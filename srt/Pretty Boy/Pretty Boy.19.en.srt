[Pretty Boy]

00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,620
[Episode 19]

3
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,480
I...

4
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,630
This is...

5
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,800
This is the seasoning Gao Yin left in the kitchen.

6
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,640
You guys can add it to your food.

7
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,350
I...

8
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,470
I don't know how to thank you.

9
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,550
Thank you.

10
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,860
You're welcome.

11
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm leaving.

12
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,380
Chunlan, Qiu Ju,

13
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,730
come and eat too.

14
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,010
No, we don't like it.

15
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,450
We don't want to eat.

16
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,730
Is the rabbit I gave you before still alive?

17
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,870
Yes.

18
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,860
It's very fat now.

19
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,370
Have you ever thought

20
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,030
if it weren't for this accident,

21
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,010
we might have become friends?

22
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
I guess so.

23
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,240
At least we should thank you.

24
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,780
But...

25
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,630
now we have a grudge against Gan Pu.

26
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,810
To be honest,

27
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,620
Wang Yishao and I are pure enemies.

28
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,829
But we are also friends.

29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,730
How can enemies be friends?

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,070
We are enemies

31
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,120
due to some special reasons.

32
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,940
But from a human perspective,

33
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,760
some people are born to get along well.

34
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,770
In other words, they're the same type.

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,520
That makes them natural friends.

36
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,510
Natural friends?

37
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,380
Is there such a statement?

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,310
Of course.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,650
Think about it.

40
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,670
Why can't sheep and wolves become friends?

41
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,910
Because wolves eat sheep.

42
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,240
Then... do sheep eat cows?

43
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,760
How is that possible?

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,330
So sheep and cows are natural friends.

45
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,490
Kind people are natural friends

46
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,130
with each other.

47
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,170
Then... can evil people become friends with each other?

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,080
Evil people don't have friends.

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,230
Think about it.

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,630
Can wolves

51
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,280
and leopards become friends?

52
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,740
I don't think they can.

53
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,630
They're worried the other side might fight against them.

54
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,500
Then... have you ever thought about eating me?

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,950
No, we don't eat people.

56
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:26,960
So,

57
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,520
we're all kind people.

58
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,250
That makes us natural friends.

59
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,740
I treat my friends to something delicious.

60
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,159
Isn't that normal?

61
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,070
That makes sense.

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,150
Sit.

63
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,740
It'll be ready soon.

64
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,500
Here.

65
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,700
Gan Pu, it's ready.

66
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,390
Is it good?

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,900
You guys eat too.

68
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,870
If you have nothing to do,

69
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,890
take a good rest.

70
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,500
You didn't sleep well yesterday, right?

71
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,650
I don't want to sleep.

72
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,750
If... If you don't sleep,

73
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,210
your body won't be able to take it.

74
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,420
Don't worry.

75
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll always hold your hand.

76
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,100
I'll just hold your hand here.

77
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,630
Sleep.

78
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,540
I really won't let you go.

79
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,330
I'll always stay here

80
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,570
to accompany you while you sleep, okay?

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,780
I really can't bear to see this anymore.

82
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,100
Me neither.

83
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,830
They are so pitiful.

84
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,270
Why don't we let Vegetable go inside?

85
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,660
They are in the room anyway.

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,550
They can't escape.

87
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,600
Is that okay?

88
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,700
Go inside.

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,510
Qing Cai.

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,080

91
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840

119
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,130
The pheasant and hare are for Gan Pu.

120
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,930
Please help me give them to her.

121
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,530
Thank you.

122
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,460
I'm leaving.

123
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,940
Qing Cai, Hong Hui delivered wild animals again.

124
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,870
Go cook.

125
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,980
She can't go.

126
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,380
That's right. Only you can go.

127
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,670
Will a pheasant and a hare eat each other?

128
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,440
I don't think they will.

129
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,790
Never heard of that.

130
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,350
If the hare

131
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,350
accidentally break the pheasant's eggs,

132
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,820
will they be enemies?

133
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,780
Of course.

134
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,620
Even if they are enemies,

135
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,550
will the hare and the pheasant eat each other?

136
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,370
I don't think they will.

137
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,260
The hare

138
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,580
will be punished due to the accident,

139
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,470
but they're still not enemies, right?

140
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,980
You can say that.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,370
So before the hare gets punished,

142
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,440
they are still natural friends, right?

143
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,330
Gan Pu accidentally hurt Yinniang due to a misunderstanding.

144
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,210
But now the misunderstanding has been cleared.

145
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,420
Gan Pu has also realized

146
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,990
she and you are not enemies,

147
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,380
but natural allies.

148
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,600
So you won't hurt each other, right?

149
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,890
So before Gan Pu gets punished,

150
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,020
you're still natural friends, right?

151
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm not asking for too much.

152
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,550
I just hope

153
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,480
when I cook later,

154
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,620
I can be with Gan Pu the whole time.

155
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,130
I'm sure you don't want to see us separated, right?

156
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,110
As you know,

157
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,310
the time we spend together

158
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,610
is very little.

159
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,790
Every minute could be

160
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,230
the last minute we spend together

161
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,390
in this world.

162
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,470
Are you worried we'll find a chance to escape?

163
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,510
Look at Gan Pu.

164
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,040
She's been clinging to me,

165
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,830
never wanting to let go.

166
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,860
Do you think we can

167
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,570
escape successfully like this?

168
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,300
Your people are everywhere in Mingyi Manor.

169
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,260
And we have no weapons.

170
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,640
Do you think we can escape?

171
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,030
Then why are you so nervous?

172
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,850
We let her out.

173
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,390
That makes us a little worried.

174
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,360
You can imagine this courtyard

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,140
as that room.

176
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,520
You two and the disciples around

177
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,400
are like the lock of that room,

178
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,000
locking us in the courtyard.

179
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,960
So what's the difference

180
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,310
between staying in that room

181
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,830
and staying here?

182
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,690
That makes sense.

183
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,770
Come on. Sit down.

184
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,680
Let's eat together later.

185
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
I just thought about it.

186
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,260
The examples of cows and sheep you took

187
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,680
seem a bit unreasonable.

188
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,200
Sometimes, examples used to make a point

189
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,760
don't stand up to close examination.

190
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,040
As long as the point is made, that's enough.

191
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,730
Taking examples is just an approach.

192
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,280
If every point can be justified by examples,

193
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,590
the more you think about it, the more it seems wrong.

194
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,830
That makes sense.

195
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,260
No wonder

196
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,550
the more I thought about it, the stranger it felt.

197
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,350
Yeah, I don't understand either.

198
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,300
How can cows and sheep become friends?

199
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,910
They can't speak.

200
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,530
They can't go out to have fun together either.

201
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,070
It can be counted as an appointment

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,450
when they eat grass together.

203
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,670
I saw cows and sheep together.

204
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,280
They seemed very close.

205
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,570
I also saw pigs and sheep rubbing against each other.

206
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,060
I saw a goose standing on a cow.

207
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,180
Yes.

208
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,390
I even saw a chicken standing on a cow.

209
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,850
I saw something even weirder.

210
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,040
A little bird was pecking on the back of a cow.

211
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,050
But the cow was not angry.

212
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,130
Qing Cai is really something.

213
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,210
He managed to talk them

214
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,030
into letting Gan Pu out.

215
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,100
He even managed to make those who had a grudge against Gan Pu

216
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,080
let go of their hostility.

217
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,510
He's such a talented man.

218
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,180
What a pity.

219
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,430
How come your makeup looks different from others'?

220
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,770
Why?

221
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,000
It seems...

222
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,820
there's something extra.

223
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,890
Do you really think

224
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,720
Qing Cai is a woman?

225
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,710
What do you mean?

226
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,810
That's a man.

227
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,970
Does Qing Cai... like women?

228
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm a man. I only like women.

229
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,190
I only like women too.

230
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
Well, then why are you giving me flowers?

231
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,750
Qing Cai, Gan Pu,

232
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,819
I have bad news for you.

233
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,579
Yinniang... died.

234
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,170
We're going to have an all-hands meeting

235
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,640
to discuss how to deal with Gan Pu.

236
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,400
You guys...

237
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,180
You guys...

238
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,270
I'm sure

239
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,470
Yinniang is dead.

240
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,340
Yinniang was highly skilled in martial arts.

241
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,830
How could she die so easily?

242
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,880
Gan Pu's archery is very impressive.

243
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,310
And it was a sneak attack.

244
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,690
Luckily, Yinniang was highly skilled in martial arts.

245
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,880
When the arrow was released, she moved her body to one side

246
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,280
so that it didn't hit her heart.

247
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
Otherwise, she could have died on the spot.

248
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,860
But even so,

249
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,580
her heart meridians were damaged.

250
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,720
She still couldn't be saved.

251
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,190
You both have received clear orders.

252
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,860
You don't have your own ideas, do you?

253
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,650
What a pity.

254
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,900
I really consider Qing Cai as my brother.

255
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,610
But I've never had my own ideas.

256
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,910
I've always obeyed the orders.

257
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,710
My father and His Majesty

258
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,070
also gave me a clear instruction.

259
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,270
Poison the son of the late emperor.

260
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,770
Looks like something big is going to happen here.

261
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,980
Otherwise, you wouldn't have called me back.

262
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,330
You're smart.

263
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,260
In ten days,

264
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,740
we'll put on a show here.

265
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,750
By that time,

266
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,950
my father, my brother, and General will show up.

267
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,220
It's something much bigger than I expected.

268
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,050
Fine.

269
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,450
Looks like I'm about to direct a show

270
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,360
that will go down in history.

271
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,540
But...

272
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,970
many people will die.

273
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,430
Is it that serious?

274
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,360
I'm a little scared.

275
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm sorry for dragging you guys into this.

276
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,570
But now,

277
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,530
you can choose to quit.

278
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,100
Come on.

279
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,220
Although I'm

280
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,270
a bit casual,

281
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,790
I'm quite interested

282
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,870
in being part of

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,360
a major event in history.

284
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,910
So...

285
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,280
what on earth is it?

286
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,630
You'd better go as far as possible.

287
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,840
Stay out of this.

288
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,650
My two brothers are here.

289
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,360
If I miss such a big scene,

290
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,910
it would be a pity.

291
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,870
But if something really happens,

292
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,270
I'll run away first.

293
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,520
I'm a fast runner anyway.

294
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,030
No one can catch up with me.

295
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,980
Run away yourself?

296
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,570
You don't even care about me?

297
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,790
That's a strange question.

298
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,940
Why should I care about you?

299
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,350
Because you're a pushover.

300
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,550
Where can I find someone

301
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,690
as tough as you?

302
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
If you don't want to die,

303
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,770
I don't want to die either.

304
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,590
Your confession is quite interesting.

305
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,770
Can you give us some more time?

306
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,750
You'll have plenty of time in the future.

307
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,470
No need to be in a rush.

308
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,100
Looks like you've been doing great.

309
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,190
What big plan did you bring?

310
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,160
I didn't believe what they said.

311
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
I knew there is a plan when Han Aizhen came.

312
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,890
Impressive.

313
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,210
Wang Yishao brought some suggestions from Wang Quan.

314
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,560
He asked us to cooperate with him to put on a show in ten days.

315
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,720
He will attend it with General and Prime Minister.

316
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,150
He told us not to execute Gan Pu now.

317
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,370
Looks like they heard the report too.

318
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,950
They think as long as Gan Pu is here,

319
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,360
they can keep me here.

320
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,240
Wang Quan wants to use that strategy here.

321
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,270
He wants to use us

322
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,420
to get rid of you and General.

323
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,120
And make Mingyi Manor a scapegoat.

324
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,050
Then he'll destroy Mingyi Manor

325
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,590
in the name of justice.

326
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,010
Is that what you think?

327
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,290
If that's not the case,

328
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,020
Wang Quan wouldn't have the guts to make a move against General.

329
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:19,840
Qing Cai,

330
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,610
your safety is still very important.

331
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,980
I think Wang Quan

332
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,830
won't let you live that long.

333
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,040
That's for sure.

334
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,950
I'm still the biggest threat.

335
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,070
Of course they want to get rid of me first.

336
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,950
The problem is if Vegetable is killed in advance,

337
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,020
will General still come?

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,050
Of course he will.

339
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,730
Wang Quan believes General

340
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,910
must want to get rid of Mingyi Manor more

341
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,980
and then get rid of his opponent by the way.

342
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,280
How detestable!

343
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,920
I think that's what General thinks.

344
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,650
Han Aizhen,

345
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,730
the order you received is the same, right?

346
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,740
Kill Wang Quan first and then kill us.

347
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,440
They are both bad guys.

348
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,280
Are they that confident

349
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,160
that they can do whatever they want in our territory?

350
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,370
They believe Yinniang is dead.

351
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,850
So this is their best chance.

352
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,210
I suddenly have a plan.

353
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,950
The show in ten days

354
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,850
is their decisive battle, right?

355
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,880
You put forward a condition:

356
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,940
only Wang Quan, his son,

357
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,970
General, and Prime Minister can come.

358
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,800
And each of them can only bring two guards.

359
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,280
Will they agree?

360
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,630
If they agree, their lives will be in our hands.

361
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,350
That's a good idea.

362
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,280
They think Yinniang is dead,

363
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,470
so they have nothing to worry about.

364
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,450
Qing Cai,

365
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,450
if the condition you just mentioned

366
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,640
is accepted by them,

367
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,060
next,

368
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,020
Wang Quan will target Mingyi Manor

369
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,570
in advance.

370
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,050
Maybe Wang Quan has already taken action.

371
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,150
I was just anticipating their next move based on

372
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,120
their usual tactics.

373
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,500
Zhang Fang.

374
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,340
Are you sure you're not leaving?

375
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,110
If I leave,

376
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,620
who'll be the protagonist?

377
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,090
You just want to see how I'll end up, don't you?

378
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,330
But it's already a tense situation.

379
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,890
Yes.

380
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,560
It's already a life-and-death struggle.

381
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,630
Why are you looking at me?

382
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,040
Just say what you want to say.

383
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,270
Hu Jiao,

384
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,880
he is hesitating.

385
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,410
It has nothing to do with you.

386
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,740
No wonder.

387
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,360
I already made myself clear just now.

388
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,090
If you still don't understand,

389
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,990
I would think I'm the stupid one.

390
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,720
How confident are you

391
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,250
in handling this crisis?

392
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,360
Don't worry.

393
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,830
We're not that easy to deal with.

394
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,140
How do you... plan to deal with Gan Pu?

395
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,810
Will you... just let it go?

396
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,930
Before Yinniang died, she told us

397
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,070
to go easy on Gan Pu.

398
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,490
Actually...

399
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm a member of the Mo Clan.

400
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,280
The Mo Clan has been...

401
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,710
exterminated, right?

402
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,180
Your godfather must have told you

403
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,550
about the Mo Clan, right?

404
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,140
When Yinniang went back to save the Mo Clan,

405
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,750
she also saved some orphans and widows.

406
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,460
I was one of them.

407
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,200
What... What about the others?

408
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,730
They were housed in the Widow Village.

409
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,270
Do you still remember

410
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,260
your first day entering Mingyi Manor?

411
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,100
Those abandoned women.

412
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,000
Abandoned women?

413
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,950
We housed all of them in the Widow Village

414
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,460
and provided them with livelihoods.

415
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,880
At that time, I thought

416
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,160
you sold them.

417
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,530
Only real villains would do that kind of thing.

418
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,680
We've also been despised

419
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,430
by strangers since we were little.

420
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,310
Sorry.

421
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,980
I was one of them.

422
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,000
My teacher told me

423
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,490
there might be more to Mingyi Manor's matter than meets the eye.

424
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,280
But I believed the rumor.

425
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,680
In that case,

426
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,190
we are family to some extent.

427
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,720
But unfortunately,

428
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,840
I don't know who my parents are either.

429
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,550
Anyway,

430
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,450
Gan Pu has family now.

431
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,710
Then... what are your thoughts?

432
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,960
If that's the case,

433
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,200
Gan Pu is on your side.

434
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,120
You'll think

435
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,240
I will also be on your side.

436
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,370
Do you want to side with General

437
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,590
and stand against us?

438
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,930
Your plan is to let me ascend the throne

439
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,410
and then hold General back.

440
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,080
And you hope I won't kick you when you're down.

441
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,370
Is that hard?

442
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,450
Given my identity,

443
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,860
how am I supposed to hold General back?

444
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,640
But we don't have any other way now.

445
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,570
Don't you think Mingyi Manor's dream

446
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,770
is too unattainable?

447
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,860
Our dream

448
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,140
is just to protect those miserable women

449
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,370
and unite them.

450
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,980
Yeah.

451
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,010
Without us,

452
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,490
they'll live very miserable lives.

453
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,820
I don't think so.

454
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,520
You already upheld justice

455
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,580
by helping the Mo Clan, right?

456
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,660
Are you saying we're overconfident?

457
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,860
That's not true.

458
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,380
Yinniang told me

459
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,700
we were lured into the trap step by step.

460
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,960
Qing Cai is also your enemy.

461
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,420
Why can you make an exception for him?

462
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,880
Qing Cai and his mother are Mr. Shang Shan's disciples.

463
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,600
Qing Cai's mother was a very virtuous person.

464
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,480
Unfortunately, she died too early.

465
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,240
Otherwise, the late emperor wouldn't have been so crazy.

466
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,460
Later, we analyzed it.

467
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,480
The brutality of the late emperor

468
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,230
was because he was bewitched by Wang Quan.

469
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,680
Also, the pain of losing his wife

470
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,380
made him lose control.

471
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,900
That's why he exterminated the Mo Clan.

472
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,780
Is this your speculation?

473
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,800
Maybe.

474
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,910
I think it was a web of schemes.

475
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,150
All of us were used.

476
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,850
Back then, Yinniang left the Mo Clan and then returned.

477
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,300
Was it reported by Wang Quan's subordinate?

478
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,350
Yes.

479
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,500
That is a weakness of Wang Quan.

480
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,630
But at that time,

481
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,930
Yinniang was furious at the Mo Clan's extermination.

482
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,100
She didn't have time to think about it.

483
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,440
After knowing what Wang Quan did later,

484
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,810
Yinniang finally came to her senses.

485
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,510
If that's the case,

486
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,610
the order General received to exterminate the Mo Clan

487
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,140
could be a fake imperial order delivered by Wang Quan's subordinate.

488
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,980
This is your guess?

489
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,630
What you said

490
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,100
is possible.

491
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,910
Continue to say what you just wanted to say.

492
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,340
What did Wang Quan do after that?

493
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,760
When Yinniang was furious

494
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,620
at the Mo Clan's extermination,

495
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,040
Wang Quan offered us a chance

496
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
to assassinate the late emperor.

497
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,630
Assassinate the late emperor?

498
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,720
Yes.

499
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,050
Actually, Mingyi Manor

500
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,300
assassinated the late emperor in cooperation

501
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,390
with Wang Quan.

502
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,540
You assassinated Qing Cai's father?

503
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,130
How old were you at that time?

504
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,200
It was Yinniang.

505
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,220
At this point,

506
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,270
I'll be frank with you.

507
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,170
Yinniang did it herself.

508
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,310
What a confusing situation.

509
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,790
So,

510
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,650
my real enemy

511
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,850
is Wang Quan, who has been well-hidden.

512
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,710
Yes.

513
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,370
All of us were fooled by him.

514
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,660
Wang Quan killed many birds with one stone.

515
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,850
He made

516
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,800
Mingyi Manor side with him,

517
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,410
made Mingyi Manor and General enemies,

518
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,260
and kept a backup plan for the future.

519
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,740
Since Yinniang is gone,

520
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,250
Wang Quan has the chance to carry out his backup plan.

521
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,300
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,990
I'm really sorry.

523
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,390
Don't blame yourself.

524
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,200
It was not your fault.

525
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,490
I can't avoid feeling guilty.

526
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,090
No matter what,

527
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,350
I caused Yinniang's death...

528
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,500
Don't you think you're a bit too indifferent

529
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,890
when talking about Yinniang?

530
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,860
Well, we'll regret if we accidentally hurt others.

531
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,880
We'll get angry when our loved ones get hurt.

532
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,840
Your reaction seems a bit unreasonable.

533
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,800
I'm just good at hiding my emotions.

534
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,760
Really?

535
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,110
It already happened.

536
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,500
It's useless to think too much.

537
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,040
We need to think carefully about how to face the future.

538
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,570
Do you trust Mr. Shang Shan that much?

539
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,940
Yinniang was taught by Mr. Shang Shan.

540
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,670
Back then, the rumor in the Martial Arts World

541
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,940
made everyone think the Mo Clan

542
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,680
was exterminated by Mingyi Manor.

543
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,790
General was already on his way

544
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,350
with his troops to besiege Mingyi Manor.

545
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,880
Even Wang Quan couldn't stop him.

546
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,320
Mr. Shang Shan went to persuade the emperor to issue an order

547
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,870
to stop General.

548
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,800
Mr. Shang Shan helped us.

549
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,130
I see.

550
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,560
At Mingyi Manor's all-hands meeting,

551
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,190
they all agreed to execute Gan Pu.

552
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,450
All-hands meeting?

553
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,970
So noticeable.

554
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,040
Things have changed.

555
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,980
Young Master Wang,

556
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,030
are you so sure

557
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,700
that Qing Cai is definitely here?

558
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,310
We've been waiting for so many days

559
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,440
just to confirm it, right?

560
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,480
Didn't Crown Prince tell you?

561
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,870
Crown Prince told me

562
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,020
if Qing Cai didn't show up in the royal city,

563
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,020
he must have hidden in the royal city

564
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,170
or gone invisible to return to Mingyi Manor.

565
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,320
But he thinks

566
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,030
a prince won't risk his life for a woman.

567
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,620
Have some tea.

568
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,990
Continue to practice qin.

569
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,550
It was noisy at the all-hands meeting just now.

570
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,890
Even I was not scared.

571
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,600
Can you fool Wang Yishao?

572
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,010
Since we've come this far,

573
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,140
we should finish what we started.

574
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,370
Facing Wang Quan

575
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,810
is nightmarishly difficult.

576
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,430
We have you now, right?

577
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,670
That's not enough.

578
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,260
We still have a trump card.

579
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,300
What is it?

580
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,790
A just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds little support.

581
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,970
That's too profound.

582
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,450
You should say the worm turns.

583
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,550
At a time like this,

584
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,590
you're still saying such nonsense.

585
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,590
No matter what,

586
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,650
I'll be on Mingyi Manor's side.

587
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,980
Even if I'll die, I won't regret.

588
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,630
Qing Cai,

589
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,310
you've lost your sense of logic since you joined us.

590
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,560
Is this the natural friends you said?

591
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,390
You really have the potential to be a thief.

592
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,770
You always eavesdrop and peep.

593
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,300
How could you talk to Hongxiu like that?

594
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,590
Be serious.

595
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,190
He talked to me like that

596
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,610
because he doesn't treat me as an outsider.

597
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,670
It's too stuffy here.

598
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,260
Gan Pu and I want to go to the town.

599
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,370
It's too dangerous.

600
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,960
You only need to stay here for just over ten days.

601
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,270
It'll be over before you know it.

602
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,290
Don't take the risk. Be good.

603
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,270
Well, think about it.

604
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,900
Wang Yishao has paid most of his attention

605
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,239
to Mingyi Manor.

606
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,370
If I stay in Mingyi Manor,

607
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,760
it'll be easier for me to be exposed.

608
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,929
The town is also our territory.

609
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,639
It's no different from Mingyi Manor.

610
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,600
But there is something you need to know.

611
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,030
The emperor has also planted spies in the town recently.

612
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,480
Why don't I send two people to follow you?

613
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,980
I guess the emperor didn't just send spies.

614
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,449
I think Wang Yishao has reported

615
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,330
that we released Han Zhong.

616
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,989
Recently, I noticed a lot of subordinates

617
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,219
of the emperor and General.

618
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,070
Do you still think the town is your territory?

619
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,660
You know, the number of their men is limited.

620
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,930
They won't start a fight now.

621
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,300
It mostly depends on the mood

622
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,210
of the men sent there.

623
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,550
What... does that mean?

624
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,140
If they are cautious enough,

625
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,880
they won't make any big move.

626
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,110
Well... I want to go to the town too.

627
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I just want to protect you.

628
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,370
Your main task is to keep an eye on Wang Yishao.

629
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,590
Considering what Gan Pu and I are capable of,

630
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,410
ordinary people can't hurt us.

631
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,270
Sixth Brother, are we going to kill someone this time?

632
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,260
Fifth Brother, are we going to kill someone today?

633
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,260
Fourth Brother, are we going to kill someone today?

634
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,980
Third Brother, are we going to kill someone today?

635
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,700
Big Brother.

636
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,930
This is Mieqing's territory.

637
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,110
Let's just destroy it.

638
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,800
Master,

639
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,610
if we use the Heaven-Destroying Formation,

640
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,980
Mieqing's disciples can't handle it, right?

641
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,670
That's right.

642
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,790
Once Master's poison is used,

643
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,560
he'll die no matter how strong he is.

644
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,390
What else can you do except killing people?

645
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,310
Mieqing is dead. Why should we be afraid?

646
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,940
We took someone's money.

647
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,160
Taking revenge is secondary.

648
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,090
Don't forget our top priority.

649
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,010
Understand?

650
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,350
We should kill a few people first to vent our anger.

651
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,690
I've been controlling myself for more than ten years.

652
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,300
Look what it has made me become.

653
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,330
After we find Mingyi Manor's men, kill those who can be killed.

654
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,750
Don't kill those who can't be killed.

655
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,910
Of course.

656
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,100
If he hadn't helped us,

657
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,410
we would have died long ago,

658
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,470
not to mention taking revenge.

659
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,230
But how do we identify

660
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,770
Mingyi Manor's members?

661
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,760
Women with a weapon!

662
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,070
At what age does someone qualify as a woman?

663
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,900
Can't you tell what a woman is like?

664
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,570
Well, it's easy

665
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,400
to identify children.

666
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,550
But it's not easy to tell if a woman who's neither too young nor too old

667
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,680
is a child or an adult.

668
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,120
Don't worry.

669
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,190
Pick something easy.

670
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,280
Don't think about those difficult things.

671
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,430
Don't cause trouble.

672
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,850
If things get out of hand, it'll be hard to fix them.

673
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,830
Remember why we are here.

674
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,520
We're here

675
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,740
to weaken Mingyi Manor

676
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,450
and kill the man disguising himself as a woman.

677
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,560
We still need to find the man disguising himself as a woman, right?

678
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,070
Yes. If you meet him, do it.

679
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,490
Don't worry about it if you don't.

680
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,120
You can't handle other things!

681
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,180
Don't do anything stupid.

682
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,290
Otherwise, you'll be punished according to the rules.

683
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,550
You think I can't discipline you?

684
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,680
Alright, that's it.

685
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,680
Let's go down the mountain to have tea.

686
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,230
What's wrong, Big Brother?

687
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,470
Who's going to pay?

688
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,650
My treat. Have you ever paid?

689
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,830
Okay! Let's go!

690
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,490
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

691
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,160
Go down the mountain.

692
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,200
Let's go.

693
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,620
So comfortable.

694
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,210
I didn't expect

695
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,730
that I could still come out.

696
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,250
It feels so good to be free.

697
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,380
I don't want to be imprisoned anymore.

698
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
I'd rather wander around

699
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,720
than lose my freedom again!

700
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,240
I'm here.

701
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,030
What's that look?

702
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,440
It's just been a few days. It feels like a lifetime to you?

703
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,710
No.

704
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,510
The fighting is in a few days.

705
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,230
I always have a feeling that we're going to fight against you.

706
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,350
So I feel... awkward.

707
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,310
I really like your straightforward personality.

708
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,710
Now I think

709
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,150
you're the cutest.

710
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,350
Your feeling is right.

711
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,790
But I've always been cute.

712
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,150
It's just that you didn't realize it.

713
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,670
Aizhen.

714
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,030
Have you seen Qing Cai?

715
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,040
I...

716
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,310
Forget it.

717
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,950
It's so hard to deal with smart people like you.

718
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,630
You know the answer even if I don't tell you.

719
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,310
I'll be honest with you.

720
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,430
Yes.

721
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,630
He's fine.

722
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,790
What about Gan Pu?

723
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,870
Should I tell you the truth?

724
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,270
She's not okay at all.

725
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,110
Han Aizhen,

726
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,790
given your current way of speaking,

727
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,910
I don't even know what is true

728
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,790
and what is not true.

729
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,830
Of course.

730
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,350
Smart people like you are humans too.

731
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,790
If I talk nonsense,

732
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,190
what can you do with me?

733
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,630
You're right.

734
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,510
What?

735
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,750
You're not stupid anymore.

736
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,550
This is Qing Cai's idea.

737
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,230
-Turn things upside down.
-Turn things upside down.

738
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,540
You teach me.

739
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,440
Teach me.

740
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,730
You must have been

741
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,360
upset these days too.

742
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,700
These days,

743
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,100
I often thought of what you said.

744
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,520
I know a way.

745
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,590
When you feel upset,

746
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,090
think about how short life is.

747
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,440
Maybe...

748
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,760
Maybe it can relieve your nervousness.

749
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,020
It seems... I would think of the melodies from time to time.

750
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,020
Your feelings must be quite complicated right now.

751
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,240
They are all beautiful.

752
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,230
You want to arrest them all?

753
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,970
Yes.

754
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,270
Well...

755
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,240
I-I haven't seen anyone.

756
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,230
I don't see any woman with a weapon.

757
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,500
When can we find them?

758
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,000
-Bad guy!
-Bad guy!

759
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,350
Why did you stop the kids?

760
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:06,970
-Bad guy!
-Bad guy!

761
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,180
Have you forgotten what I told you?

762
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,130
My mistake, Master.

763
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,980
-Bad guy!
-Bad guy!

764
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,930
Why did you stop the kids?

765
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,390
Let's go. Don't make Master angry.

766
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,480
Go. Go.

767
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,320
That tall guy just now looks highly skilled in martial arts.

768
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,780
There might be a crossbow

769
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,730
in the pouch at the short guy's waist.

770
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,170
Judging from his physique, he could be a master of archery.

771
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,460
Are they General's men?

772
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,940
It's hard to say.

773
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,250
But don't mess with General's men

774
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,040
unless we have to.

775
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,830
We must leave no evidence if we do it.

776
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,760
Otherwise, we'll suffer.

777
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,180
Those people don't look simple.

778
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,510
Yeah. Don't mess with them.

779
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,140
They don't look like death warriors

780
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,640
or guards.

781
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,910
They look like some members of a sect in the Martial Arts World.

782
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,060
Looks like they are looking for someone.

783
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,710
If it's for vengeance,

784
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,730
it is quite normal.

785
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,890
But this is a sensitive time.

786
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,000
Is it related to us?

787
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,420
It's hard to say.

788
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,030
We should be careful.

789
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,870
These people look very powerful.

790
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,390
I wonder where they came from.

791
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,350
The manor has been in turmoil lately.

792
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,000
We just need to follow Vegetable.

793
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,640
Someone will keep an eye on them.

794
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,870
I haven't seen

795
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,990
a single woman with a weapon along the way.

796
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,900
Then a girl with a sword suddenly appeared.

797
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,090
I was caught off guard.

798
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,750
-Sorry, Master.
-What should we do?

799
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,860
On our way back just now,

800
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,990
I caught a glimpse of two women passing by.

801
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:48,880
I didn't see them clearly.

802
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,490
I think they both have a sword.

803
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,760
Looks like you didn't look carefully.

804
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,030
Let's split up.

805
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,160
Looking for them together is too time-consuming.

806
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,230
Yes.

807
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:04,860
-Yes.
-Let's go.
