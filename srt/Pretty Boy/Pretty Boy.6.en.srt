00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,610
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,470
(Episode 6)

3
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,990
Look at our life.

4
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,340
We roast wild game every day.

5
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,750
It's too comfortable, isn't it?

6
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,710
I think I've gained weight again.

7
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,990
Jiaoniang too.

8
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,510
It doesn't matter if you gain more weight.

9
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,110
It's best if we all gain a few more pounds.

10
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,590
When we walk down the street then,

11
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,910
it'll be like a group of Hu Jiao walking together. What a sight!

12
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,550
Since when did you start making witty remarks?

13
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,910
You're not being reasonable anymore?

14
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,710
You must have learned it all from Qing Cai, right?

15
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,950
You're right. He's just a troublemaker.

16
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,510
It's not right for you to say that.

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,110
You're insulting yourself by saying that.

18
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,700
And you're calling all of us trouble.

19
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,070
Then I guess I'm the troublemaker.

20
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,870
Who are you calling trouble?

21
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,950
I...

22
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,470
Han Aizhen.

23
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,350
How dare you bully my Jiaoniang!

24
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,190
I'll fight you!

25
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,860
You're not eating anymore?

26
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,950
It was a collateral damage.

27
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,430
You're done for. She's gone to get a kitchen knife.

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,990
I know it.

29
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,110
It can't be true, right?

30
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,950
Han Aizhen, just you wait.

31
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,630
Don't!

32
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,150
Come here!

33
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,510
You're really doing this?

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,960
Hu Jiao, give me that basin.

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,390
I'll help you avenge your Jiaoniang.

36
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:15,990
Hu Jiao.

37
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,710
Hu Jiao.

38
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,060
Hu Jiao.

39
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't run!

40
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,520
Why are you three eating so much today?

41
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,950
I can't eat anymore.

42
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,400
I can't go on.

43
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,230
I can't eat anymore, I'm too tired.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,230
I'm going to bed.

45
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,510
Take your time eating.

46
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,550
I'm off.

47
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,790
I'm full too.

48
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,190
I'm going for a walk.

49
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,430
Let's go for a walk too.

50
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,470
My back hurts from sitting.

51
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,000
Why do you have so many crossbow arrows here?

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,070
It looks like it's becoming an arsenal.

53
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,510
They're just for backup.

54
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,240
Who knows what might happen in the future?

55
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,590
You've just arrived here,

56
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,830
and you've already made this kind of cellar?

57
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,430
No, this

58
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,670
is formed by utilizing the natural terrain.

59
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,510
And,

60
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,670
it's just being used as a backup trap for now.

61
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,940
I admire your abilities.

62
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,790
I have many more abilities.

63
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,910
You'll discover them gradually.

64
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,230
Meeting you is like finding a treasure.

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,910
Who said you found anything?

66
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,220
Dream on.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,790
Cover it up.

68
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,310
Let's go.

69
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,270
Speaking of which,

70
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,230
what do you think of today's competition?

71
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,909
I don't know martial arts,

72
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,550
so I can't tell.

73
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,909
But I think

74
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,670
your duel with Gan Pu was quite spectacular.

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,550
I'm just

76
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,540
feeling a bit uncomfortable, that's all.

77
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,790
Young Master Wang,

78
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,220
that Qing Cai has lost all face for you.

79
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,350
So pathetic.

80
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,110
And Hua Gu has been very depressed lately.

81
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,990
Young Master Wang,

82
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,630
you have

83
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,910
left a trail of broken hearts wherever you go, don't you?

84
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,270
Tea drinking is a refined activity.

85
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,590
Indeed, one must find the right company for it.

86
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,590
Look at him. He's trying to get rid of us.

87
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,830
Fine.

88
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,750
I know when I'm not wanted.

89
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,910
I'm leaving.

90
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,470
Who are you?

91
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,270
And who are you?

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,190
You don't need to know who we are.

93
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,909
But since we're already here,

94
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,710
our purposes might be the same.

95
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,510
Many people come here,

96
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,070
each with their own purpose.

97
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,430
Then I should kill you.

98
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,310
Wait.

99
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,110
Since I've already fallen into your hands,

100
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,390
I'll tell you

101
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,310
to avoid allies from killing each other.

102
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,790
If you're enemies,

103
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,270
I'll accept my fate.

104
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,990
Tell us the truth.

105
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,630
I'm here to rescue someone.

106
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,310
Aren't you here to kill?

107
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,590
No, to rescue.

108
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,710
Rescuing is my mission.

109
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,750
Our purposes are the same.

110
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,350
Which organization are you from?

111
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,560
We're just lone wolves,

112
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,670
not part of any organization.

113
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,060
We came here

114
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,470
just to help a friend.

115
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,990
You're friends with that person?

116
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,940
I don't know who you're referring to,

117
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,460
and I can't say.

118
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,110
But I won't ask which organization you're from.

119
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,620
I just need to know

120
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,070
if we have the same purpose.

121
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,150
If we can be allies,

122
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,670
then we'll have more strength.

123
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,070
Why should I trust you?

124
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,070
I didn't kill you just now. Isn't that enough?

125
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,590
You might not be able to kill me now.

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,470
You can try.

127
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,990
Fighting here would hurt us both, wouldn't it?

128
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,870
I can trust you for now.

129
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,150
Do you have any way

130
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,990
to break the barrier inside?

131
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,150
We passed through the outer formation of Mingyi Manor.

132
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,510
Our people have tried many methods.

133
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,510
If we don't make a big move,

134
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,550
there's no way to break the barrier inside.

135
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,670
What help can you offer?

136
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,380
What do you need?

137
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,790
Money.

138
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,750
What do you need?

139
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,030
Money.

140
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,320
We don't have that much money.

141
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,510
Breaking that barrier requires special tools.

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,630
We can do it,

143
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,230
but we don't have money to buy the materials.

144
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,510
How much do you need?

145
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,590
Ten taels of silver.

146
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,870
Just ten taels of silver?

147
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,190
People with connections are indeed different.

148
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,510
Do you have them?

149
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,550
No.

150
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,270
We have a contact in our town.

151
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,190
I can have him go to the royal city to get the money.

152
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,150
Why go to the royal city for just ten taels of silver?

153
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,510
We're not some local rich folks.

154
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,190
Who carries that much money around?

155
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,540
Wouldn't it be heavy?

156
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,950
How much money do you usually carry?

157
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,670
A few coins.

158
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,030
How long does it take to go to and from the royal city?

159
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,990
It takes about three days.

160
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,030
But we've already wasted several days.

161
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,990
I'll be uneasy if we waste another day.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,150
How about we try to find a way from us disciples?

163
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,430
What do you mean?

164
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,310
Among the fellow disciples being trained this time,

165
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,990
there's one who eats a lot.

166
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,230
I saw her open her bundle one day,

167
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,740
and there was a lot of silver inside.

168
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,630
I can try.

169
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,830
I'll also arrange for someone from the town to get the money.

170
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,910
Alright.

171
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,390
Then for the next few days,

172
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,430
come here at this time every day to wait for us.

173
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,710
Okay.

174
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,670
Don't wait for us more than an hour each time.

175
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,030
I'm not sure if those two people

176
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,870
can gather enough money for us to buy the materials.

177
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,190
Let's go.

178
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,390
I think Han Aizhen might be

179
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,150
following us now.

180
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,550
She's definitely following us.

181
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,630
Which means

182
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,990
she doesn't fully trust us.

183
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,790
Even if she trusts us,

184
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,070
her superiors might not believe us.

185
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,110
Should we still include her in our future actions?

186
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,470
There are many hidden sentries there.

187
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,270
You can't handle them alone.

188
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,020
She's skilled in combat.

189
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,630
Understood.

190
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,740
Then we'll start with Hu Jiao tomorrow.

191
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,910
Let's go to town to make arrangements.

192
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,430
Alright.

193
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,390
It's perfect to let Han Aizhen lose our trail.

194
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,600
Why don't we

195
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,070
perform another "get lost" trick for her here?

196
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,190
It seems they can indeed pass through the grand formation.

197
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,350
I've woken them all up.

198
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,710
Boss, what did you call us for?

199
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,550
I heard you all had your first sales today.

200
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,350
Yeah, and I didn't throw up today.

201
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,150
My mom didn't roll around on the ground either.

202
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,350
What's going on?

203
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,910
We didn't sell anything today

204
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,910
when we were closing up.

205
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,430
Did your families give you trouble?

206
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,020
Our families didn't bother us.

207
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,310
They didn't give us any trouble.

208
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,870
Really?

209
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,870
Really.

210
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,350
My mom ended up eating everything.

211
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,790
She threw up several times, didn't she?

212
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,870
Are you okay?

213
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,670
Are you alright, Mom?

214
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,670
It's fine.

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,230
This woman has eaten too much.

216
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,430
Alright.

217
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,230
I've called you here today because I have a task for you.

218
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,070
Boss, we'll do

219
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,350
as you say.

220
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,470
Right.

221
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,430
Tomorrow, I'll bring a wealthy client here.

222
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,670
I want to

223
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,310
get all the money from her.

224
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,230
Tell us, what's the plan?

225
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,510
Have this poison ready for tomorrow.

226
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,320
Poison?

227
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,800
Boss, are you planning to poison someone in public?

228
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,950
That's so thrilling.

229
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,660
Come on, let's divide it up.

230
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,950
Tomorrow, add a small spoon of poison to each portion of food.

231
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,310
When they're about to die from the spiciness,

232
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,150
they'll devour your tangyuan.

233
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,070
Tomorrow, reduce the amount of tangyuan in each serving.

234
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,990
Just one tangyuan per bowl, with extra soup.

235
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,510
Why's that?

236
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,950
We're selling it as soup.

237
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,510
Boss,

238
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,910
are you sure one spoonful won't kill someone?

239
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,710
I've tried this dosage myself.

240
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,070
In my experience,

241
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,790
this amount is about right.

242
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,870
It'll be very spicy, but bearable.

243
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,310
What if I add two more spoonfuls?

244
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,470
They'd die.

245
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,120
Tomorrow, tell the people who come

246
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,590
if they want the regular one, it's the original price.

247
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,070
If they want the one with this poison,

248
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,790
the price is ten times higher.

249
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,480
Ten times?

250
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,070
Who would buy that?

251
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,270
Exactly!

252
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,510
This is specially prepared for the person

253
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,670
coming tomorrow.

254
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,550
You remember it?

255
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,710
Okay.

256
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,710
So if someone else comes and wants to eat this,

257
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,950
do we sell it to them?

258
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,740
Of course we sell it!

259
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,190
We don't sell it, right?

260
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,780
How are you even smarter than a pig?

261
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,430
Of course, I'm smarter than a pig!

262
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,350
Tell me.

263
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,310
Would Hu Jiao like the poison you mentioned?

264
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,550
Most likely.

265
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,990
What are the chances

266
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,470
those unreliable people of yours can pull this off?

267
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,230
They're all talented individuals.

268
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,230
Talented at relying on luck, I suppose.

269
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,750
No.

270
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,470
My luck

271
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,190
is always unpredictable.

272
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,250
I really admire your confidence.

273
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,670
Blindly optimistic.

274
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,030
Let's go.

275
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,190
Let's go.

276
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,350
You're back.

277
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,910
We're back.

278
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,990
It's quite warm.

279
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,430
Who lit the fire?

280
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,110
I did.

281
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,270
Did you two sneak off to take a bath?

282
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,230
Didn't you guys go take a bath too?

283
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,390
We did.

284
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,510
Don't even mention it.

285
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,230
We were interrupted halfway through.

286
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,150
What a buzzkill.

287
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,750
No way. I have to make up for it tomorrow.

288
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,390
Hey, why do you keep staring at me?

289
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,670
Is there a toad on my face?

290
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,670
You two went to take a bath together?

291
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,110
That's right.

292
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,350
And you took so long?

293
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,590
We just enjoy bathing.

294
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,390
It seems we're really not compatible.

295
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,750
We're already even.

296
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,110
Yet you're still so interested in me.

297
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,750
Han Aizhen,

298
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,900
you don't happen to like women, do you?

299
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,390
They say you only hurt the ones you love.

300
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,830
I...

301
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,470
I have absolutely no interest in women.

302
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,070
So you only like men, huh?

303
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,230
Did you two enjoy bathing together?

304
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,310
Doctor Gao,

305
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,310
I thought you always took the aloof approach.

306
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,589
Didn't expect you to make jokes like this.

307
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,109
I'm in a bad mood.

308
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,710
Do we have different senses of humor?

309
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,990
I don't think this even qualifies as a bad joke.

310
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,750
According to your way of thinking,

311
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,670
being in a bad mood is also an experience.

312
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
It should be interesting.

313
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,829
But it's also quite boring, isn't it?

314
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,830
It's a pity we don't have any alcohol.

315
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,030
Otherwise, I'd definitely have a good drink with you.

316
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,730
Gao Yin's way of thinking

317
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,030
is even more topsy-turvy than Qing Cai's.

318
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,110
It's indeed hard for ordinary people to understand you.

319
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,590
What's so topsy-turvy about having a drink?

320
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,430
So you're just an ordinary person.

321
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,670
That's why I like it.

322
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,390
I'm going to find some alcohol to drink tomorrow.

323
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,990
Qing Cai.

324
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,230
It's pretty normal for Hu Jiao to drink alcohol.

325
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,590
You're so delicate.

326
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,670
Who's delicate?

327
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,510
You are.

328
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,710
Don't judge a book by its cover.

329
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,670
I almost forgot.

330
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,030
Forgot what?

331
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,680
People always judge by appearances.

332
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,590
Who says they don't?

333
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,820
♫What kind of encounter♫

334
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,860
♫Sparks both tenderness and excitement?♫

335
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,300

347

You don't need to go to class today.

348
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,750
Liu Yiyi is not in a good mental state.

349
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,710
Should we go check on him?

350
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,110
He probably doesn't want to see you.

351
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,110
He must really dislike us now.

352
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,790
Then why doesn't he quit?

353
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,590
He's thinking about what to do.

354
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,510
He's a very persistent person.

355
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,270
Otherwise, he would have quit long ago.

356
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,430
Persist in what? Persist in thinking?

357
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,150
Wouldn't that mean he's been thinking over and over again,

358
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,460
and then thinking some more,

359
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,470
and just keeps thinking endlessly?

360
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,030
Mental illness

361
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,880
can only be overcome by himself.

362
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,470
Forget it. Let's not talk about this anymore.

363
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,790
What are you guys going to do later?

364
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,070
I'm going to the town.

365
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,350
I won't stay with you guys today.

366
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,390
I want to go to the town too.

367
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,910
The food at Mingyi Manor is too monotonous.

368
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,510
I'll go too.

369
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,590
Gao Yin, let's go together.

370
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,790
I'd like to go for a walk too.

371
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,270
Why don't we all go together?

372
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,590
Let's go.

373
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,750
Let's go.

374
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,150
Let's go.

375
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,390
Stop!

376
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,030
Why are you following us?

377
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,750
I'm going the same way.

378
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,590
The weather is quite nice today.

379
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,710
It's with gentle breeze and warm sunshine.

380
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,470
There's a clothing store over there.

381
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,470
Let's go take a look.

382
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,470
Sure.

383
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,550
Would you like to take a look at our fabrics, honored guests?

384
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,510
What color of clothes do you like?

385
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,070
Let's get you a new outfit.

386
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,670
Young Master Wang, what color do you think suits me?

387
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,720
I think you could try some

388
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,310
fresh and elegant colors.

389
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,030
Fresh and elegant?

390
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,390
What colors would be considered fresh and elegant?

391
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,630
There are two more boxes over there. Help me bring them here.

392
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,550
Alright!

393
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,470
For example, this moonlight white,

394
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,150
or light cyan.

395
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,510
You could try both.

396
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,710
Is he buying fabric for Gan Pu?

397
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,030
How can that be? I haven't given her anything yet.

398
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,350
They do look quite nice.

399
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,400
But usually I...

400
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,230
Isn't that all Gao Yin's style?

401
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,190
Do you want to transform Gan Pu into Gao Yin?

402
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,030
I didn't know that in Young Master Wang's heart,

403
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,950
you held such a high position.

404
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,350
Every time he sees a woman,

405
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,710
he uses you as the standard.

406
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,350
You're getting bolder and bolder.

407
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,630
Do you think I'm too mild-mannered

408
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,630
and have started taking advantage of me?

409
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,990
Aren't we close already?

410
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,350
I don't see you as an outsider.

411
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,910
I don't need your help.

412
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,350
Moreover,

413
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,470
aren't you afraid of making things worse?

414
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,710
Have you found anything you like?

415
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,830
Let's look around a bit more.

416
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,790
You don't understand women.

417
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,950
Women in love can sometimes be quite

418
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,070
fragile.

419
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,310
It's only been a few days,

420
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,670
yet you two seem quite close.

421
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,190
Young Master Wang,

422
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,190
you asked me what color I like.

423
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,790
Are you planning to buy fabric to make clothes for me?

424
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,950
Of course.

425
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,750
What are you talking about?

426
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,950
Young Master Wang,

427
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,590
are you buying fabric to make clothes for all of us?

428
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,830
That's so thoughtful of you!

429
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,790
I like red.

430
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,230
How can red be appropriate?

431
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,240
That's for wedding dresses.

432
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,670
Who wears that on a daily basis?

433
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,780
Why can't I wear it?

434
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,050
It's not like I'll ever get married anyway.

435
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,530
I can wear it every day.

436
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,830
Who said you can't get married?

437
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,790
Who was it? I'll settle the score with them.

438
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,750
Who? Who? Who?

439
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,500
I said it myself.

440
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,790
Who curses themselves like that?

441
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,430
There are so many men in this world.

442
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,630
Where are all these men in the world?

443
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,750
You mean Young Master Wang?

444
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,070
Isn't he the one you like?

445
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,940
How could I compete with you for him?

446
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,550
What's over there?

447
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,720
In this world,

448
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
Wang Yishao isn't the only man out there.

449
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,910
Who else?

450
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,190
Hong Hui?

451
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,790
Doesn't he like you?

452
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,270
How could I compete with you?

453
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,790
Why do you always try to steal men from Qing Cai?

454
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,960
There are only two men here,

455
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,430
and they're both connected to Qing Cai.

456
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,630
Who's connected to him?

457
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,510
Look, look.

458
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,270
I told you two were in sync.

459
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,270
If you ask me,

460
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,550
the two of them are a match made in heaven.

461
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,710
-Who’s matched with her?
-Who...

462
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,910
Miss, take a look.

463
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,670
How did we end up out here?

464
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,590
Weren't we supposed to look at fabrics?

465
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,310
I don't need that many new clothes either.

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,150
It's quite cumbersome to carry them around.

467
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,190
Why don't you buy some for Hu Jiao and the others?

468
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,910
Never mind, we're already out.

469
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,230
I'll fleece you next time.

470
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,270
Finding something to eat is more important right now.

471
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,070
Let's go. Let's go find some food.

472
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,710
Miss, look.

473
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,190
Look, over there.

474
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,150
Those people are laughing so awkwardly.

475
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,030
Let's go take a look.

476
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,030
Bro, what's this?

477
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,150
This is called Malatang.

478
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,630
Malatang? How much is this?

479
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,270
Vegetable dishes cost one wen, while meat dishes cost two wen.

480
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,510
What would you like?

481
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,870
I'll try one of each, vegetarian and meat.

482
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,790
Alright.

483
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,150
Finally, we're open for business.

484
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,710
Here, take it carefully.

485
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,560
Be careful, it's hot.

486
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,910
How is it?

487
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,710
The taste is quite good.

488
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,470
Is that so?

489
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,910
The key is, it's not spicy at all.

490
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,420
It's not spicy? That's okay.

491
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,710
I have spicier ones here.

492
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,110
Quickly, add some for me. I want to try it.

493
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,790
Well, um...

494
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,950
It seems...

495
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,110
If you want it spicier, you'll have to pay extra.

496
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:35,960
Right?

497
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,350
How much? Tell me.

498
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,340
How much was it again?

499
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,150
Ten wen for vegetarian, twenty wen for meat.

500
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,590
That's way too expensive!

501
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,950
Have you been blinded by greed?

502
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,920
I remember now.

503
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,630
I'm not selling anymore. Give it back to me.

504
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,150
Why won't you sell? Explain it to me clearly.

505
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,310
Who said we're not selling?

506
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,910
My Boss said we're not selling anymore.

507
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,990
Boss.

508
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,710
B... Boss.

509
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,820
Boss.

510
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,750
We only sell to beautiful women.

511
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,070
Are you saying I'm not beautiful?

512
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,270
No, no, no.

513
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,750
It's like this.

514
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,270
Everyone's aesthetic is different.

515
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,110
In my eyes,

516
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,430
you're the most beautiful in the world.

517
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,230
You have good taste.

518
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,110
In that case...

519
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,870
Give me one with meat.

520
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,950
Sure thing!

521
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,670
Okay.

522
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,070
Here you go, take it carefully.

523
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,870
Be careful, it's hot.

524
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,630
Finally, we have our first order.

525
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,830
How is it?

526
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,070
It's amazing!

527
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,640
I've never had such amazing skewers before.

528
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,070
Really?

529
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,110
Then give me one too.

530
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,790
I won't sell to you.

531
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,950
Why not?

532
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,310
They...

533
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,710
Only sell to beautiful women.

534
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,430
No, no, no.

535
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,670
Those who come with beautiful women are also welcome.

536
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,460
Gentlemen, come this way.

537
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,950
I have grilled skewers over here.

538
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,470
Same recipe, same taste.

539
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,030
You can come and try them.

540
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,750
Boss said we have to sell.

541
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,790
What? I don't remember.

542
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,390
You're asking for a beating.

543
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,510
No, please!

544
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,430
I'll sell to you!

545
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,110
I'll sell! I will!

546
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,870
I know it already.

547
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,000
Why are you so excited?

548
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,790
You're shouting so loudly. Are you trying to sell yourself?

549
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,630
Idiot.

550
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,060
What an idiot.

551
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,350
This is way too spicy!

552
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,190
What is this? What's it called?

553
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,350
That's called "Poison."

554
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,630
-Yes.
-Poison! Poison!

555
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,070
"Poison" is good.

556
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,310
Poison is like tears that have been shed.

557
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,390
Endless longing, a heart-wrenching poison,

558
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,950
spills a lover's tears.

559
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,270
It seems the name "Poison" is still too fierce.

560
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,550
Lover's Tears.

561
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,030
Just now, this Young Master Wang

562
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,910
gave your "Poison" a new name.

563
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,990
It's called "Lover's Tears."

564
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,590
This name does sound better than "Poison."

565
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,330
Good, good, good.

566
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,110
So from now on, let's call it "Lover's Tears."

567
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,980
Good. Lover's Tears.

568
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,130
Alright. Come on.

569
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,070
Everyone, come buy my Lover's Tears!

Is there a discount?

576
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,670
A discount?

Give me ten portions.

581
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,390
You're looking to experience heartbreak, aren't you?

582
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,910
You really understand me.

583
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,990
We only live once. We can't waste our lives.

584
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,750
When it's time to feel something,

585
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,030
we should feel it to the fullest.

586
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,270
If it's not good, you don't have to pay!

587
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,670
Lover's Tears!

588
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,630
Big sale! Big sale!

589
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,870
Ten wen for vegetarian, twenty wen for meat.

590
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,070
If you want to eat skewers,

591
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,110
you'll have to share with me later.

592
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,990
I'm going to eat you all into poverty.

593
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,350
We'll definitely eat them into poverty.

594
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,870
But it's too spicy.

595
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,670
Does anyone have water? I need to drink water.

596
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,750
Are you also selling Lover's Tears?

597
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,670
I have tangyuan here.

598
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,080
Tangyuan can help with the spiciness.

599
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,110
I'll have a skewer too.

600
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,260
Six wen.

601
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,400
Six wen.

602
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,440
Here.

603
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,830
Thank you.

604
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,680
Six wen.

605
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,270
This is too spicy. Let me eat it.

606
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,830
I... I'll eat it.

607
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,790
Give me one.

608
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,470
I'll have another bite.

609
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,600
Gan Pu, I've finished eating.

610
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,750
Line up and move forward.

611
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,870
We have enough for everyone.

612
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,750
Gan Pu.

613
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,430
It's quite tasty.

614
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,390
Another bowl, please.

615
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,110
Come, try our skewers.

616
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,710
Come, get your grilled skewers!

617
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,630
Try this.

618
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,630
Skewers here!

619
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,270
Hurry up! Hurry up!

620
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,230
What's wrong with you?

621
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,910
Delicious food here!

622
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,270
If it's not tasty, it's free!

623
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,630
Take a look!

624
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,380
It's really delicious!

625
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,630
What is this? Why are they eating like that?

626
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,390
Young Master Wang gave it a new name.

627
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,630
Lover's Tears.

628
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,860
I was just teasing Hong Hui.

629
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,860
I didn't expect them to use it.

630
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,430
Then why are they crying?

631
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,150
You're so silly.

632
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,270
Listen to this name,

633
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,150
Lover's Tears.

634
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,390
Do you understand now?

635
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,270
Is it that exaggerated?

636
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,510
Give me one.

637
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,430
Alright!

638
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,830
This is practically poison!

639
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,070
You always see through to the truth of things.

640
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm impressed.

641
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,670
It's actually quite tasty.

642
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,580
Is it that spicy? Look at you crying like that.

643
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,310
It's really spicy.

644
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,910
If you can't handle it, don't eat it.

645
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,310
I...

646
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,240
I'm eating it, I...

647
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,550
Are you kidding? Is it really that spicy?

648
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,710
You guys just won't stop, will you?

649
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,830
Quick, give me a bowl of tangyuan.

650
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,230
Here, here.

651
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,470
You pay for me.

652
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,680
Miss,

653
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,590
you're so beautiful

654
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,800
that you outshine all others.

655
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,790
Won't you have a skewer?

656
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,710
It's on me.

657
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,070
I'll give it for free too. Free!

658
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,340
For free!

659
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,790
For free!

660
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,190
Yes, this young lady,

661
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,150
a celestial beauty, unparalleled in the world.

662
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,270
I'll give it for free too.

663
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,870
Free, free, free!

664
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,270
Or is there any girl here,

665
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,390
who thinks she's prettier than her?

666
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,830
I'll give it all for free for her.

667
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,750
-Fair to all, regardless of age.
-I’m prettier than her.

668
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,230
I'm prettier than her.

669
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,630
Can I have it for free?

670
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,710
Your word alone doesn't count.

671
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,270
We need everyone to vote.

672
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,750
Right, right, right.

673
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

674
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,590
those with money, show your support with it,

675
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,150
those without, show your support in person.

676
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,870
If you think I'm prettier,

677
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,710
give me some applause!

678
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,830
It's up to you to keep me fed.

679
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,230
Alright.

680
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,429
If you think she's prettier, clap now.

681
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,170
Okay, okay, okay.

682
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,989
Can I eat for free now?

683
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,389
Alright.

684
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,389
Here, little one.

685
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,700
Where did this little girl come from?

686
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,510
She's made a monkey out of me.

687
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,950
Sir, I want one skewer too.

688
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,150
How many do you want?

689
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,550
Don't push. Come one by one.

690
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,760
How many do you want?

691
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,510
Take it easy.

692
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,280
There's enough for everyone.

693
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,780
Here are the tangyuan.

694
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,190
The capable shoulder more work. You eat.

695
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,170
It's delicious.

696
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,140
I know.

697
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,470
Here.

698
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,710
Eat first, Han Aizhen, eat.

699
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,270
Take your time.

700
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,910
Take it.

701
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,430
We're still eating?

702
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,470
Come on, take it.

703
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,550
Everyone, don't push.

704
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,750
Hold it carefully.

705
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,940
Take your time.

706
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,190
On your way back,

707
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,670
you were scratching your head and ears,

708
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,830
looking just like a monkey.

709
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,370
those with money, show your support with it,

710
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,070
those without, show your support in person.

711
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,620
If you think I'm prettier,

712
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,450
give me a round of applause.

713
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,790
-You…
-What…

714
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,240
-You're even imitating now.
-What do you think?

715
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,760
Are you prettier or is she?

716
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,520
What do you think?

717
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,350
I think I'm prettier.

718
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,700
Don't run!

719
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,790
You... you...

720
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,830
Instead of hitting that kid, you hit me?

721
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,800
Boss.

722
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,190
Boss.

723
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,590
Who told you to organize this beauty pageant?

724
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,030
It really wasn't me.

725
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,510
Jing started it. I had nothing to do with it.

726
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,320
You dare to hide?

727
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,910
No, Jing said

728
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,700
I wouldn't get beaten if I came here.

729
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,960
So you're not here for me to vent my anger on?

730
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,790
Why are you here then?

731
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,460
What am I here for?

732
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,390
Oh, right.

733
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,390
Here.

734
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,190
This is what we've managed to gather so far.

735
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,990
Jing told me to hurry over and give it to you first.

736
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,230
Ten taels of silver, so quickly?

737
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,030
Jing said as soon as I enter,

738
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,030
I should give you the silver,

739
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,920
and then I wouldn't get beaten.

740
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,590
Alright.

741
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,110
This is what they call making amends.

742
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,940
Next time, when you're all gathered,

743
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,550
I'll beat you all together.

744
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,230
If there's nothing else, go back and continue your business.

745
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,110
Okay, okay, okay.

746
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,470
Go on.

747
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,430
Quick, let me take a look.

748
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,750
There really are ten taels of silver.

749
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,750
Let's go. Let's go process it.

750
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,550
Let's go.

751
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,360
Come on, let's go.

752
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,310
Emergency! Get out of the way quickly!

753
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,710
Stop fooling around.

754
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,470
Young man,

755
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,230
why are you dressed up like a fairy today?

756
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,670
Dark Egg, you're joining in on this nonsense too?

757
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,190
Hurry and help me get the materials. I need to save my father.

758
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,750
That's quite a lot of materials.

759
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,540
Alright, I'll get on it right away.

760
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,590
Awesome!

761
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,070
No way.

762
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,630
What's wrong?

763
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,710
My stomach hurts.

764
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,070
Is that so?

765
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,990
Do you still want to eat the Lover's Tears?

766
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,800
I can't take it anymore.

767
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,910
It's okay, it's okay.

768
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,870
I'll help you.

769
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,710
Let's go quickly.

770
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,910
Don't eat it anymore in the future.

771
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,510
This is really a disaster.

772
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,480
It's not bad. It's delicious.

773
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,270
Go over there.

774
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,310
It's really delicious.

775
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,030
Go over there.

776
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,790
This is for the two beautiful ladies.

777
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,710
It's good, isn't it?

778
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,230
Give it to them.

779
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,950
Are you okay?

780
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,230
I can't even speak anymore. Let's go.

781
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,580
Take it easy.

782
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,480
♫A gentle breeze brushes past the bright moon♫

783
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,630
♫Your radiance spreads softly in the wind♫

784
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,480
♫Your quiet arrival♫

785
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,510
♫Tugs at my heartstrings♫

786
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,290
♫My heartbeat pauses at this very moment♫

787
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,280
♫Drizzling spring rain nourishes the soul♫

788
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,320
♫The sea of flowers in my heart blooms full of longing♫

789
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,200
♫No need for sweet words♫

790
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,160
♫Sharing simple moments♫

791
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,830
♫Our meeting no longer feels distant♫

792
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,010
♫A shooting star streaks across the sky♫

793
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,660
♫Wishes find their answer♫

794
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,270
♫I wish to pluck♫

795
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,320
♫The moon in the sky♫

796
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,150
♫Willing to change, all for you♫

797
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,260
♫Softly, softly whispering♫

798
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,400
♫You're by my side♫

799
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,020
♫Heart to heart, in unison♫

800
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,170
♫Forever intertwined♫

801
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:43,140
♫Memories swing gently like a hammock in my mind♫

802
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:48,080
♫Echoing between you and me, you and me♫

803
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,970
♫The sun rises, and the sun sets again♫

804
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,520
♫The moon wanes and then waxes again♫

805
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,510
It looks like we've saved a lot of materials.

806
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,910
I didn't expect the success rate to be so high this time.

807
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,990
We're really lucky.

808
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,030
Then we can store the extra materials here.

809
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,390
We might need them in the future.

810
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,310
Sounds good.

811
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,590
What's wrong?

812
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,150
I'm used to it.

813
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,190
I always did this when I was injured before.

814
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,240
My uncle told me when I was young,

815
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,860
if I don't suck out the poisoned blood,

816
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,880
it could be fatal in severe cases.

817
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,150
Thank you.

818
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,110
You're welcome.

819
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,310
It's getting dark.

820
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,150
Let's come back another day.

821
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,310
Next time we come,

822
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,190
we can try making sleeve arrows.

823
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,950
Are those the crossbow arrows hidden in sleeves?

824
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,890
Yes.

825
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,590
That's a secret technique of our Mo Clan.

826
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,470
It's our exclusive technology.

827
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,110
These sleeve arrows

828
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,310
are much more powerful than ordinary sleeve arrows.

829
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,190
Since they're hidden in the sleeves,

830
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,710
they're highly concealed.

831
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,070
Unlike crossbows.

832
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,830
You know,

833
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,220
when we face opponents much stronger than us

834
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,090
in a fight,

835
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,190
sometimes we need to ambush them.

836
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,990
With these sleeve arrows,

837
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,800
even face to face with them,

838
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,790
they can hardly escape.

839
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,710
Okay.

840
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,510
Let's come back next time then.

841
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,030
Gan Pu.

842
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,640
♫What kind of encounter♫

843
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,330

You know what?

858
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,320
Gao Yin's medicine is quite effective, isn't it?

859
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,590
Of course, it is.

860
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,390
Just look at who Gao Yin is.

861
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,150
Do you think

862
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,510
Qing Cai came back first?

863
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,470
Did she go somewhere to sulk?

864
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,110
Those people were really too much.

865
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,760
They harassed her on the street. She must feel very upset.

866
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,550
Why harass her and not us?

867
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,030
It's because she's flirting around.

868
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,790
It's... It's starting to hurt again.

869
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,790
Don't you think Qing Cai is quite charming?

870
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,990
Her? Please.

871
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,710
You're not a bit jealous of her, are you?

872
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,550
I just can't stand her.

873
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,030
A woman is blamed

874
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,710
even when she is harassed by men.

875
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,960
It's really unfair.

876
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,110
Well...

877
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,430
Agreed.

878
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,110
I just don't like her

879
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,550
timid and submissive attitude.

880
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,950
If I were harassed today,

881
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,230
I'd slap them right away.

882
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,220
That's right.

883
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,510
If it were me, I'd give them two slaps.

884
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,360
Right?

885
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,070
Exactly.

886
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,550
She's not like you two.

887
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:06,920
You...

888
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,710
We could take on twenty like you.

889
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,390
Stop walking.

890
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,950
It's too tiring.

891
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,840
Tell me.

892
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,310
Do you think Hu Jiao and the others might still be in town?

893
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:27,790
It's hard to say.

894
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,030
So you'll have to keep wearing this, won't you?

895
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,790
Actually, we could both just wear men's clothing.

896
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,510
We've only been out for half a day and you want to change clothes.

897
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,310
It's so easy to arouse suspicion.

898
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,230
Wang Yishao is not an ordinary person.

899
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,310
It seems you have a high opinion of him.

900
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,230
Indeed.

901
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,030
You see,

902
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,470
he is quite handsome and dashing.

903
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,830
And he's very considerate.

904
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,910
Most women

905
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,230
would find it hard to resist his charm.

906
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,710
That's true.

907
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,230
I've noticed Gao Yin has been quite close to you lately.

908
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,660
Do you think she might like you?

909
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,300
Who's close to her?

910
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,150
You are.

911
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,960
-Who's close to her?
-You are.

912
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,570
Who, who, who?

913
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,950
You, you, you.

914
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,270
In your opinion, Wang Yishao is so great.

915
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,550
Why did you choose me?

916
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,430
You don't understand.

917
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:38,750
Think about it.

918
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,510
Who is Wang Yishao?

919
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,510
He's a prince.

920
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,150
His status is noble,

921
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,350
right?

922
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,710
He's handsome too.

923
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,430
So many women like him.

924
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,030
I'm just a commoner.

925
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,550
How could I be worthy of him?

926
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,990
So, I definitely need to find someone

927
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,070
who's a bit dumber, a bit poorer,

928
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,390
and treats me better.

929
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,350
I'll just keep him as a pet for fun.
