1
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,750
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,600
(Episode 3)

3
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,710
Now are you

4
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,270
very eager to kill me?

5
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,510
What do you think?

6
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,470
You have the guts to do that,

7
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,630
but you don't have the ill intention.

8
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,590
What if I take the risk?

9
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,830
So you've stopped getting lost?

10
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,190
Why did it take so long?

11
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,830
How come your hair is wet?

12
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,590
When I came out just now, I didn't see you guys here,

13
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,030
so I went to take a bath.

14
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,470
You took a bath at this late hour?

15
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,230
Why don't we also take a bath in the pond

16
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,270
at this hour tomorrow?

17
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,590
It might be more interesting.

18
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,790
Qing Cai obviously went to do something.

19
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,870
Gan Pu seems to know about it.

20
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,230
But they are not quite close to each other.

21
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,030
There are still some feelings of estrangement.

22
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,350
Han Aizhen has a fiery temper

23
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,710
and isn't quite shrewd.

24
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,710
Her dislike for Qing Cai and Gan Pu

25
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,230
is about to reach the highest level.

26
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,030
Which factions do these people belong to?

27
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,400
It's really confusing.

28
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,430
Young Master Wang happens to be here today.

29
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,829
Didn't you have a private meeting with him before?

30
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,670
Why don't you two dance together?

31
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,870
What private meeting?

32
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,510
Qing Cai, I also think that

33
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,390
you should dance with

34
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,550
your private teacher.

35
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,390
Gao Yin doesn't hide her affection for Wang Yishao at all.

36
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,470
And Wang Yishao asked Hu Jiao to keep an eye on me.

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,510
So what's the relationship between Gao Yin and Wang Yishao?

38
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,230
Why haven't they exposed me?

39
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,510
Or do they have another conspiracy?

40
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,590
Are Wang Yishao and Qing Cai putting on an act?

41
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,590
Let me see how they'll perform, and I'll look for flaws.

42
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,470
That's right.

43
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,310
You had private lessons, didn't you?

44
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,909
Why don't you perform a dance?

45
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,710
Just perform today's dance

46
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,110
so that we can learn it, too.

47
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,630
Wang Yishao has asked Hu Jiao to keep an eye on Qing Cai

48
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,150
and showed his attitude directly.

49
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,550
It seems that he deliberately alerted his enemy.

50
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,860
Has he set up a suspicious trap deliberately

51
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,190
or are they from different factions?

52
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,510
What's Qing Cai's true identity?

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,710
It's always good to let them show more of themselves.

54
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,110
That's right. You two should dance together.

55
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,310
It's also a good chance for us to learn it.

56
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,100
I... I'll just grill the meat.

57
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,390
Why are you two just sitting there?

58
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,870
Haven't you noticed everyone agrees that you two should dance?

59
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,150
You can't refuse now, can you?

60
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,110
No, no, no. I'll grill the meat. I'll grill the meat.

61
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,830
I...

62
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,110
Just dance.

63
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,830
Just go.

64
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,240
-Stand up. Just dance.
-You can help him grill the meat.

65
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,550
Just dance!

66
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,560
Dance!

67
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,310
Just do it!

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,310
Let's do the same as we did that day.

69
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,150
That's not right.

70
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,580
Logically speaking,

71
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,750
Wang Yishao is a man,

72
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,990
so it's natural for him to dance like that.

73
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,630
But logically speaking, you're a woman.

74
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,390
Shouldn't you dance more seductively?

75
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,070
I used to like this dance of yours.

76
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,390
But why does it look so weird

77
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,630
when you dance with a man?

78
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,830
It's necessary to be seductive when you dance with a man.

79
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,230
Watch me do it.

80
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,630
Stand up. Don't sit.

81
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,110
Stand up.

82
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,830
Learn from me.

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,340
Have you learned it?

84
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,110
Just applaud!

85
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,750
Why hasn't Young Master Wang arrived yet?

86
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,950
Is he coming soon?

87
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,670
Qing Cai.

88
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,270
You're everyone's love rival now.

89
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,550
Will you be overwhelmed by their gossip,

90
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,870
resentful gaze

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,510
and complaints?

92
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,310
Han Aizhen,

93
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,870
why are you starting to be so unreasonable

94
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,470
and make witty remarks now?

95
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,550
She has been infected by you, hasn't she?

96
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,790
So we're both bad people, huh?

97
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,710
Then will you be implicated

98
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,110
and be deeply misunderstood by others too?

99
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,230
Vegetable,

100
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,590
what you said will put an end to the conversation.

101
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,140
It's alright. Just keep dashing forward.

102
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,360
If the sky falls, I'll hold it up for you.

103
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,430
Still dashing forward? If I keep doing it, I'll be dead for sure.

104
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,190
And they won't even be able to find any of my remains, will they?

105
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,710
He's coming!

106
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,270
Now I'm going to announce some rules.

107
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,669
From now on, during lessons,

108
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
no extreme behavior will be allowed anymore.

109
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,030
Otherwise, we will punish you severely

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,910
or even expel you.

111
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,710
Hua Gu wants to use her official power to gain personal benefits.

112
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,510
She did lose her composure a bit.

113
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,870
Will this affect our plan?

114
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,190
Let her make a fuss with these people.

115
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,830
It's not easy for her, either.

116
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,830
Being the manager of Mingyi Manor

117
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,390
is too stressful for her.

118
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,300
Now let's review the dance which we learned last time.

119
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,150
I thought the situation would be better after Wang became the substitute.

120
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,170
But it turns out that it's still the same.

121
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,390
Rumor has it that this Yinniang is a great demon.

122
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,510
She's indeed quite intimidating.

123
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,380
She's like a persistent plaster.

124
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,070
Her personality is just like that.

125
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,630
If you don't let her vent her anger,

126
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
she'll probably suffocate from holding it in.

127
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,230
I... I've been trying every way to raise money.

128
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,910
But it might still take some time.

129
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,590
Well, according to what you said,

130
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,270
there's no rush, huh?

131
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,550
How can there be no rush?

132
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,950
I feel that now I'm just like...

133
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,990
I'm just like a rabbit being roasted over the fire.

134
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,110
Then there's no rush indeed.

135
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,830
Think about it.

136
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,030
If you're already being roasted over the fire, you're about to die.

137
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,510
Once you die, you won't feel any pain.

138
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,870
The problem is that I'm still alive.

139
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,510
You're here to rescue someone, aren't you?

140
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,510
You still don't trust me.

141
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Alright. It's fine.

142
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,470
Anyway,

143
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,710
I don't want to eat roasted live rabbits, either.

144
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,870
Alright.

145
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,550
I'll tell you.

146
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,550
My father was caught by the people from Mingyi Manor.

147
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,960
Are you sure?

148
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,550
I think so.

149
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,520
I followed the people who abducted my father

150
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,670
and arrived at Mingyi Manor.

151
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,260
It was the day when I met you.

152
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,390
It's troublesome then.

153
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,110
It is said that Yinniang's martial arts skills are unrivaled in the world.

154
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,740
If you really encounter her,

155
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,190
I'm afraid...

156
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,990
It seems you have other motives for coming to Mingyi Manor.

157
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm here to kill Yinniang.

158
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,390
Why did you have the guts to tell me such an important thing?

159
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,710
I've been taking adventures in the Martial Arts World for over a decade.

160
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,910
I can still distinguish

161
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,270
between truths and lies.

162
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,750
Over a decade?

163
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,950
Are you an old demon or do you have some secret skills to stay young?

164
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,230
I quite admire you.

165
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,070
You can make jokes in any situation.

166
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,190
My... My teacher taught me this.

167
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,390
Staying calm in all situations.

168
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,150
So jumping around and being so eccentric

169
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,190
are your ways of staying calm?

170
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,230
That's very calm indeed.

171
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,950
Isn't this how I always am?

172
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,950
You don't need to hide it from me.

173
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,670
I'm not interested in your affairs at all.

174
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:48,990
Alright.

175
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,630
Then do you have any ways

176
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,670
to raise the money as soon as possible?

177
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,740
I don't know how they usually

178
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,990
mistreat my father.

179
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,150
How did your father offend the people of Mingyi Manor?

180
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,070
Mingyi Manor isn't an ordinary faction.

181
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,580
I can't figure it out, either.

182
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,950
We're just ordinary people.

183
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,590
And even if he did offend them,

184
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,510
there was no need to catch him.

185
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,510
Let's go.

186
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,790
Let's go investigate it again tonight.

187
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,390
Maybe we can really get some money

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,510
from Mingyi Manor.

189
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,070
You don't need much money anyway.

190
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,790
That isn't much money?

191
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,110
How would I know you're so poor?

192
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,180
Aren't you just as poor as I am?

193
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,070
You're such an incompetent money-grubber.

194
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,390
Let's go take a look.

195
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,230
Three annoying pests.

196
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,510
When I set the table with my tea ware for the first time, I ran into you guys.

197
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,150
You came just in time for the good tea.

198
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,270
Are you selling tea? How much is it?

199
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,030
I don't have any money right now.

200
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,310
How delightful it is to have friends coming from afar.

201
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,470
Well, can we get paid for drinking tea with you?

202
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,950
It looks like your charm isn't quite enough.

203
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,110
No one is willing to pay for it.

204
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,430
How's the tea?

205
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,590
I think it tastes kind of fresh.

206
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,590
While we're having Zen tea,

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,070
human nature is reflected in the tea.

208
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,240
It is said that Mingyi Manor is backed by the royal family.

209
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,750
Since you're able to be here,

210
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,510
you must be a young master from the royal family too, right?

211
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,550
He's Second Prince.

212
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,750
It looks like they're not that close yet.

213
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,510
Qing Cai hasn't even told Gan Pu about my identity.

214
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,870
Since you're someone of such noble status,

215
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,750
why are you here to talk about having Zen tea?

216
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,750
It sounds a bit hollow indeed.

217
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,460
This is interesting.

218
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,870
Gan Pu hates me, so she hates my friend, too.

219
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,590
At least, monks live in austerity.

220
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,590
This kind of detachment of yours, which is built on money,

221
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,390
cannot bring any inner peace at all.

222
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,310
You have resentment towards the royal family.

223
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,790
But we can't change our own background.

224
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,270
That's not what I meant.

225
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,430
I just think that

226
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,630
the more stuff people have gained,

227
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,510
the more likely they are to feel anxious.

228
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,750
But some people have nothing

229
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,030
and still feel anxious.

230
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,910
I've seen many people in the marketplace.

231
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,030
Most of them tend to quarrel over trivial matters in life.

232
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
They just squabble with each other.

233
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,780
It doesn't reach the level of real suffering.

234
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,860
Indeed.

235
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,780
It looks like we do have some common topics.

236
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,390
Come on. Cheers!

237
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,750
Using tea as wine.

238
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,240
That's a novel approach.

239
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,470
Cheers!

240
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,110
Cheers!

241
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,910
Cheers!

242
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,190
Your name is "Pu", which means "cattail"?

243
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,020
It's just wild grass which can be

244
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,830
seen everywhere and grow all over the ground.

245
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,270
Though it's wild grass, its meaning is profound.

246
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,430
A cattail whip hangs on the eaves, which just shows symbolic shame.

247
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,990
The cattail whip shows shame.

248
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,620
This name is indeed well-deserved.

249
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,590
Then in your opinion,

250
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,510
how do you judge a person's moral character?

251
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,110
I can't reach your level,

252
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,080
so what I'm going to say may not be correct.

253
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,110
But according to my understanding,

254
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,990
most suffering comes from self-centeredness.

255
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,630
For example, not getting love,

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,990
not getting money,

257
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,430
not getting status and so on.

258
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,590
And those who are truly happy

259
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,350
are the people who always think about others.

260
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,230
Interesting.

261
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,830
What does she do?

262
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,030
Well, you're so strange.

263
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,790
She's right here.

264
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,830
Can't you ask her yourself?

265
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,480
It feels impolite to ask her directly.

266
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,840
You're such a polite man.

267
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,550
I'm just a wanderer in the Martial Arts World.

268
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,630
I've been wandering for over a decade.

269
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,110
I guess I could call myself a sophisticated wanderer.

270
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,390
How old is she?

271
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,950
You're really unsophisticated.

272
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,830
She... She...

273
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,390
You can think of her as an old demon,

274
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,550
so it's difficult to guess her age.

275
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,109
How many hardships have you been through?

276
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,880
As a poor wanderer,

277
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,069
isn't it quite normal that

278
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,230
I've been through many hardships?

279
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,390
Don't your parents care about you?

280
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,069
It's also my first time

281
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,069
being able to drink tea like this.

282
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,750
I've said too much today

283
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,150
and disturbed everyone's pleasant mood.

284
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,190
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,390
I'll leave now.

286
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,670
There's no need to leave.

287
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,230
Well, when we're in a better mood next time,

288
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,750
let's all have tea together again.

289
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,150
Thanks.

290
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,710
After she has experienced so much,

291
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,350
her eyes can still be so bright,

292
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,390
and she can still preserve that innocence.

293
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,110
That's truly rare.

294
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,720
She's a woman who really deserves to be cherished,

295
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,230
just like the rare beauty in this world.

296
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,030
What you said is so touching for me.

297
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,510
Let's have another drink.

298
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,670
Wait.

299
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,350
I think something is wrong with you.

300
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,660
I feel like...

301
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,790
I'm in love.

302
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,120
Hey, it... it was just a short while.

303
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,350
That's... That's better than falling in love at first sight, isn't it?

304
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,630
Well, what's the difference?

305
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,350
You're being so irresponsible.

306
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,350
Why are you saying that?

307
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,790
How do you know I'm irresponsible?

308
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,510
That's strange.

309
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,660
You're not a man.

310
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,230
How come you look like...

311
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,110
you're jealous?

312
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,790
Why... Why would I be jealous?

313
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,090
Indeed, when the conversation gets disagreeable, it's better to say less.

314
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,030
I'll leave first.

315
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,470
Oh no.

316
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,430
I forgot that Qing Cai is a woman.

317
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,790
Wang Yishao, oh, Wang Yishao.

318
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,030
Destiny, oh, destiny.

319
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,910
Cattails.

320
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,440
This afternoon, after we had tea,

321
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,630
you seemed to be in a bad mood.

322
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,830
It was nothing.

323
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,870
I rarely experience this kind of romantic lifestyle.

324
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,070
When I compared it with my previous struggles to make a living,

325
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,630
I couldn't help feeling a bit upset.

326
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,110
I'm fine now.

327
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,070
So what's your impression of Wang Yishao?

328
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,640
Actually, I really hate this kind of young master.

329
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,870
But Wang Yishao seems to be a very genuine person.

330
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,870
He doesn't act like a prince.

331
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,430
It is said that he stays away from the circles of power.

332
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,030
How do you even know the information about that stratum?

333
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,060
Although my teacher lives in seclusion in the mountains,

334
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,430
somehow he knows

335
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,070
all about current affairs.

336
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,350
What's more, he'll even comment on them.

337
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,590
When he talked about this Second Prince,

338
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,590
he said he was an outstanding elite,

339
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,110
who only yearned for mountains and seas.

340
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,830
In that case,

341
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,590
your teacher must be quite extraordinary.

342
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,750
Everyone says so,

343
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,710
but I don't know what's so special

344
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,720
about that old guy.

345
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,910
You call him "old guy"?

346
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,720
That's what I always call him.

347
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,110
So you've learned how to be

348
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,230
so smooth-tongued from him?

349
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,550
This could be called "returning to one's true nature".

350
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,910
Your teacher might be returning to his true nature,

351
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,150
but you're just an inexperienced kid at most.

352
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,550
Well...

353
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,590
What about Wang Yishao?

354
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,150
He has a bit of an otherworldly temperament.

355
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,190
What do you think?

356
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,350
You think so highly of him.

357
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,950
I'm starting to get jealous.

358
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,790
What are you jealous of?

359
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,150
You're not even on the same level as him.

360
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,110
How can you compare yourself with him?

361
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,370
I'm heartbroken.

362
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,390
Do you really

363
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,420
think of yourself as a man,

364
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,590
just like what that woman said?

365
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,750
You don't...

366
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,420
You don't... have to be like this, do you?

367
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,960
I need to keep

368
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,950
a certain...

369
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,670
a certain safe distance from eccentric people like you.

370
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,150
Gan Pu!

371
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,030
Gan Pu!

372
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,990
Why are there so many people here?

373
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,430
Yinniang,

374
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,130
this is what we've found in our investigation.

375
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,870
We've also sent our people out.

376
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,720
You're really going to risk your life, aren't you?

377
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,580
I've finally managed to get close to Yinniang.

378
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,990
I can't give up this opportunity.

379
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,870
Just leave at once.

380
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,990
Don't let me implicate you.

381
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,910
Do you want to die?

382
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,900
I've lived until now just for this day.

383
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,950
I can't give up.

384
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,110
Stop talking and leave at once.

385
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,590
How can you expect me to leave?

386
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,190
Watching you die in front of me?

387
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,470
What else can you do?

388
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,950
Do you want to stay and die with me?

389
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,630
Well,

390
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,870
if you want to take revenge, you should have a plan at least, right?

391
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,910
Why do you have to sacrifice yourself?

392
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,470
I'm not a very resourceful person.

393
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,630
I've been waiting for today's chance

394
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,750
for over a decade.

395
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,090
I can't wait any longer.

396
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,190
This might be my last chance.

397
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,150
Do you understand?

398
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,350
Then you should get closer at least

399
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,710
and find a better opportunity, right?

400
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,990
If you keep talking,

401
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,350
you really won't be able to leave.

402
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,870
Our friendship hasn't reached that level yet, has it?

403
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,390
We've found some new information in our investigation.

404
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,930
That person disguised himself as a woman

405
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,510
and infiltrated into our Mingyi Manor.

406
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,770
What do you mean? Did he infiltrate here to assassinate someone?

407
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,490
No.

408
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,790
At that time, our Mingyi Manor was recruiting disciples.

409
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,270
He disguised himself as a woman

410
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,150
and infiltrated into our group of trial disciples.

411
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,270
Then did we actually recruit this person?

412
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,190
I have no idea.

413
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,470
This is all the information we've found so far.

414
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,150
However, we can find the makeup artist

415
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,190
and ask her to identify him.

416
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,950
Let's not alert him now.

417
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,070
Let's start screening these trial disciples from tomorrow.

418
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,510
Let's go!

419
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,030
Chase them!

420
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,590
Yes!

421
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,870
You two, go that way!

422
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,990
The rest of you, follow me!

423
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,710
That's strange. Why have they slowed down?

424
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,630
Hurry!

425
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,190
So you were setting up a formation just now?

426
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,150
I couldn't guarantee that we would be able to escape.

427
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,750
Otherwise, I wouldn't have urged you to run away.

428
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,460
Take a look over there!

429
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,510
If you weren't prepared,

430
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,790
you wouldn't have let me follow you.

431
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,400
Let's go.

432
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,190
That's strange.

433
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,750
We came here in a roundabout way.

434
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,160
But why does it sound like

435
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,590
they're coming straight towards us?

436
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,150
Our clothes have been marked with Soul-tracking Incense.

437
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,470
If we don't wash it off in time,

438
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,620
we'll be caught sooner or later.

439
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,910
But if we go back without clothes,

440
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,170
we'll be exposed when we run into others.

441
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,590
We can take a bath in the pond over there.

442
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,390
We can't soak all our clothes

443
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,350
while bathing, can we?

444
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,030
But it's still better than getting caught, isn't it?

445
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,870
Even if we're seen,

446
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,070
we haven't done anything wrong.

447
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,750
At most, they'll just be suspicious of us.

448
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,880
Hu Jiao's clothes are bigger. Put them on.

449
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,830
Wait.

450
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,630
What?

451
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,590
Turn around.

452
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,710
Turn around.

453
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,750
You really had the foresight.

454
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,990
Before they come back,

455
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,350
let's go investigate Mingyi Manor.

456
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,430
Let's change our clothes before we go.

457
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,390
Let's change into the ones we haven't worn before.

458
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,160
Good idea.

459
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,950
Last time, Han Aizhen

460
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,910
must have identified our identities

461
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,070
from our clothes.

462
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,420
Let's go.

463
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,070
I didn't expect that though I'm so much taller than Hu Jiao,

464
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,030
her clothes would still be a bit big for me.

465
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,950
Gao Yin's clothes are a bit

466
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,070
big for me, too.

467
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,870
Did you deliberately make some noise just now

468
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,880
to alert Yinniang and the others?

469
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,150
Was that necessary?

470
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,830
If I had really done that,

471
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,550
I could have caught you directly long ago.

472
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,110
You're really a man!

473
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,950
You're the one they're looking for, aren't you?

474
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,630
It seems so.

475
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,950
However,

476
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,720
I didn't expect that after they had caught my father,

477
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,670
they would still try to catch me.

478
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,270
Why did you disguise yourself as a woman?

479
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,260
I had no choice but to do this.

480
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,020
What's going on? Why is there a commotion?

481
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,110
How would we know what's happening?

482
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,400
While we were just bathing down there,

483
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,310
she asked us to come up.

484
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,670
We haven't finished bathing yet.

485
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,790
Why are you all here?

486
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,470
Ask them.

487
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,150
Them?

488
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,510
They even told me to take a bath just now.

489
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,790
It's been just a while,

490
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,850
but how did my outfit shrink?

491
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,430
The color doesn't seem right, either.

492
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,310
The color of your outfit doesn't look right either, does it?

493
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,630
So you're going after someone?

494
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,270
What happened at Mingyi Manor?

495
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,110
I'm here to take them away to investigate this matter.

496
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,150
Let's go.

497
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,030
I should have figured it out.

498
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,830
No wonder you always spoke and behaved eccentrically.

499
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,190
I knew there was something wrong with you.

500
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,150
If you could figure it out, I guess others could do so, too.

501
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,070
Why are you still here? You should run away at once.

502
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,670
How can I run away?

503
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,230
My father is here now.

504
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,270
I have no idea what to do at all.

505
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,670
I also don't know where to start.

506
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,070
I can only take risks.

507
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,790
Alright, alright.

508
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,790
Considering you risked your life to accompany me today,

509
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,910
I'll go through thick and thin with you.

510
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,910
Have we already reached

511
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,230
the point of entrusting our lives to each other?

512
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,630
No matter what,

513
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,230
we've just been through life and death together.

514
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,750
I suppose it could be considered as entrusting our lives to each other.

515
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,540
Why are you so happy?

516
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,910
I...

517
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,190
Since you've found a new companion,

518
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,470
aren't you happy?

519
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,310
I don't know.

520
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,460
I've never had a companion before.

521
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,710
I don't know how to react.

522
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,750
I guess I'm quite happy.

523
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,710
Why are you looking at me like that?

524
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,350
It makes me frightened.

525
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,830
Well, didn't we promise Hu Jiao to go hunting?

526
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,950
Let's go hunting first.

527
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,780
That's right.

528
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,590
Come with me.

529
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,270
You're really a man.

530
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,870
You're well-prepared, aren't you?

531
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,830
I came here to set traps right after having tea in the afternoon.

532
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,070
It's eating quite happily.

533
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,910
Young Master Wang, I've come to see you today

534
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,670
to report the latest news.

535
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,710
The person your father was looking for

536
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,990
has already disguised himself as a woman and infiltrated into Mingyi Manor.

537
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,030
Are you sure?

538
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,670
I'm not sure yet.

539
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,470
But I've already made some arrangements

540
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,500
to ask someone to bring her here tomorrow for a face-to-face identification.

541
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,150
I'll first screen the trial disciples.

542
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,270
What does this person look like?

543
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,110
All I know is that he has a thick beard.

544
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,470
But once the identifier arrives,

545
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,270
we'll know.

546
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,630
As long as it's not the person I suspect, it'll be fine.

547
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,030
Who do you suspect?

548
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,630
It's nothing.

549
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,670
I'm just making groundless speculations.

550
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,630
Why did you tell him?

551
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,190
What do you think?

552
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,150
He's also someone we're testing?

553
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,070
Our skills of roasting lamb are getting better and better.

554
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,350
Roasted lamb?

555
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,910
How did you catch it? You're so amazing!

556
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,230
Does it smell good?

557
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,510
It smells so good!

558
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,630
What did you do just now?

559
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,110
Did you cause all that commotion?

560
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,590
We went hunting.

561
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,530
It's such a big lamb.

562
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,870
It was not that easy to catch it.

563
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,030
Don't forget about Jiaoniang if we're going to eat meat.

564
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,830
Why does Jiaoniang look so listless?

565
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,310
It must have lost weight from hunger.

566
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,430
Jiaoniang.

567
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,710
I'll go take a look.

568
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,270
What's wrong with Jiaoniang?

569
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,950
Why does it look so listless?

570
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,110
Jiaoniang seems to be sick.

571
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,850
It's sick? How did it get sick?

572
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,590
Jiaoniang, how come you're sick?

573
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,910
Has it eaten anything improper lately?

574
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,350
No, it hasn't.

575
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,190
You can't just think about eating meat every day.

576
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,270
Well, I'm a vegetarian, too.

577
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,870
Why can't you be a vegetarian?

578
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,310
Is that too much?

579
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,630
That's more like it.

580
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,550
What are you doing?

581
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,830
Are you putting poison in the food?

582
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,710
To kill you with poison?

583
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,670
Why... Why are you holding the cat?

584
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,310
It was scratching at the door just now.

585
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,710
I think it must be hungry,

586
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,960
so I'm here to feed some jerky to it.

587
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,909
Give it to me.

588
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,830
I'll feed it.

589
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,110
Did you poison Jiaoniang?

590
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,350
I...

591
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,990
If I were to poison anyone, I'd poison you first.

592
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,480
You're so vicious.

593
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,690
It looks like you really know how to poison someone.

594
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,350
What? I didn't.

595
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,300
The day, I saw you taking

596
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,190
Jiaoniang away sneakily.

597
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,750
Did you feed some kind of slow poison to it?

598
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,990
I... I fed some wild vegetables to it.

599
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,270
The wild vegetables were poisonous.

600
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,670
How would the wild vegetables be poisonous?

601
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,210
Did you add anything else?

602
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,950
Otherwise, how would Jiaoniang become like this?

603
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,230
I ground the jerky into powder and mixed it with the wild vegetables.

604
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,710
Otherwise, it wouldn't eat it.

605
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,270
The meat powder was poisonous, too.

606
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,160
Why do you keep talking about poison?

607
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,440
I think you're the poisonous one.

608
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,590
Actually, Jiaoniang wasn't poisoned.

609
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,110
It just ate too many wild vegetables.

610
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,910
Let me tell you.

611
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,190
All foods have their own properties.

612
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,590
Even arsenic can be used as medicine.

613
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,590
Ordinary food can also be poisonous.

614
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,870
So,

615
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,870
for all the things,

616
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,750
it depends on how you use the properties of the food.

617
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,190
Anything can become poison.

618
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,070
What you said makes sense, too.

619
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,590
In a way,

620
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,020
those wild vegetables of yours were poisonous.

621
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,360
You're talking nonsense! That's far-fetched!

622
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,110
Those wild vegetables were not poisonous.

623
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,150
The jerky was fresh, too.

624
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,630
If I can eat it, why can't the cat eat it?

625
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,950
It was just not poisonous.

626
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,990
That's true in theory.

627
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,790
But you probably didn't do it intentionally, right?

628
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,110
You surely wouldn't poison it on purpose.

629
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,310
This is the difference between manslaughter and murder.

630
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,990
You keep staring at others relentlessly all day.

631
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,030
What? Aren't you tired?

632
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,990
You've been beating around the bush,

633
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,430
and this is actually what you wanted to say.

634
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,430
Let me tell you. These are two different things.

635
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,510
I just want to vent my anger for what you did.

636
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,510
Venting your anger, huh?

637
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,510
Jiaoniang!

638
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,880
Jiaoniang, go scratch her a couple of times.

639
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,910
Let her vent her anger.

640
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,750
Jiaoniang.

641
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,710
Jiaoniang won't stoop to your level.

642
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,070
Jiaoniang doesn't want to respond to you at all.

643
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,430
Qing Cai.

644
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,510
Women need to be buttered up.

645
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,150
Share this jerky with Jiaoniang

646
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,550
and Jiaoniang's daughter.

647
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,390
Come on. Let me add some seasoning for you guys.

648
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,790
This isn't the same stuff as before, is it?

649
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,750
I was just kidding last time.

650
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,210
Don't worry and just eat it. I won't poison anyone.

651
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,630
It was really so strange today.

652
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,870
While we were taking a bath,

653
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,430
our clothes were stolen.

654
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,990
Did the color of the clothes change?

655
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,030
How is that possible?

656
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,750
They must have been swapped by someone secretly.

657
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,070
The key... The key is why the thief did that.

658
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,700
Was someone peeping?

659
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,550
Peeping?

660
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,270
It must be Hong Hui.

661
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,420
He has always wandered around us.

662
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,770
He's the most suspicious.

663
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,630
Why don't we go investigate the case?

664
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,910
I agree.

665
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,480
I think you did it.

666
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,910
You're so clever.

667
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,630
Stop arguing, you two. Let's go now.

668
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,670
Let's go.

669
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,150
Let's go.

670
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,030
Gao Yin, stop roasting meat.

671
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,030
Let's go together.

672
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,830
Let's go.

673
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,190
Let's go together.

674
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,510
Hong Hui, are you there?

675
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,030
He's not inside. Can we go in?

676
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,310
If we go inside, we'll become thieves.

677
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,110
We'll become...

678
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,920
What if someone comes to search the place?

679
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,510
We don't have an official warrant.

680
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,470
Who gave us the permission to search his room?

681
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,000
But why are there women's clothes inside?

682
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,070
Where are they?

683
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,010
They're really my and Gao Yin's clothes.

684
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,990
Why would Hong Hui steal your and Gao Yin's clothes?

685
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,190
This doesn't count as framing him, right?

686
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,710
The clothes are lost, and that's it.

687
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,790
No one will investigate.

688
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,950
If a man keeps staring at you all day

689
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,110
and gazes at you lovingly.

690
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,670
don't you feel uncomfortable?

691
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,110
I don't feel anything.

692
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,350
This doesn't count as framing Hong Hui.

693
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,630
If he has an alibi,

694
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,470
it'll prove that someone has framed him, won't it?

695
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,590
As long as we can make this guy

696
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,850
stop appearing in front of me all this time,

697
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,560
it'll be fine.

698
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,310
And if we all do it together, it will take less effort.

699
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,270
Come to think of it,

700
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,270
as a man,

701
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,350
you always sleep among us women.

702
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,390
What's that all about?

703
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,150
What can I do?

704
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,750
You can sleep on the edge.

705
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,990
Han Aizhen isn't willing to swap with me.

706
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,240
You can swap with Gao Yin.

707
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,910
Then I'll swap with you.

708
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,150
In that case, I can keep an eye on you.

709
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,070
Why are you laughing? Hurry up.

710
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,880
Were you his target?

711
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,070
You're not allowed to fall for someone else.

712
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,590
What are you talking about?

713
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,430
You like Wang Yishao, don't you?

714
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,750
Well, what do I have to do with Hong Hui?

715
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,830
You...

716
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,320
Look. What's this?

717
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,260
Isn't this you?

718
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,770
As I said, you were his target.

719
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,910
Even the portrait matches the clue.

720
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,950
In that case, I'm not angry anymore.

721
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,630
When I see Hong Hui tomorrow,

722
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,910
I'll slap his face.

723
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,350
Then we'll be even.

724
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,630
Alright. If we speak so loudly,

725
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,070
it might attract others to come in later.

726
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,480
Let's leave now.

727
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm holding your clothes.

728
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,270
Let's go.

729
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,550
When I see Hong Hui,

730
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,990
I'll teach him a lesson properly.

731
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,510
How dare he steal clothes?

732
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,230
It seems that the people from Mingyi Manor are keeping an eye on us.

733
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,430
It looks like this matter is a bit serious.

734
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,000
It looks like the situation is quite tense now.

735
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,550
There might be a crisis tomorrow.

736
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,590
Tomorrow,

737
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,470
it's basically like catching a turtle in a jar.

738
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,550
Are you sure you don't want to escape now?

739
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,600
If I escape now, it's like walking into the trap myself.

740
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,310
We might still have a chance to adjust to the changing situation tomorrow.

741
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,230
You're right.

742
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,310
Then let's pretend nothing happened tonight.

743
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,590
Don't forget to swap bunks.

744
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,630
Gao Yin,

745
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,390
can I swap bunks with you?

746
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,470
The grudge between her and me is getting deeper.

747
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm afraid that while she's dreaming at night,

748
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,190
she might strangle me to death.

749
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,750
I don't need to be dreaming to strangle you.

750
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,670
Let's go.

751
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,830
I'll swap with you.

752
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,150
Move over!

753
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,120
Why are you leaning on me?

754
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,830
Stay away from me!

755
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,830
It hurts.

756
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,540
It really hurts.

757
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,230
This is so annoying.

758
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,150
I feel cold.

759
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,910
Why do you feel cold?

760
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,320
If you feel cold, cover yourself with a blanket.

761
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,830
I still feel cold even with a blanket.

762
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,590
Don't move.
