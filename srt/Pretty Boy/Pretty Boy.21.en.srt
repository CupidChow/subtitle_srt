[Pretty Boy]

00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,699
[Episode 21]

3
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,840
As long as we take care of the Ding brothers,

4
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,100
he will be safe.

5
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,140
I'll go with you.

6
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,870
What's going on?

7
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,440
Nothing. We're fine.

8
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,630
Something really happened.

9
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,760
Did that boy dump you?

10
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,970
No.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
He wouldn't dare!

12
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
If I meet him, I'll make sure

13
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,370
to give him a piece of my mind for you.

14
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,610
We're fine, really.

15
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,760
Aizhen.

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I watched you grow up.

17
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,710
No one

18
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,670
in this world

19
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,579
knows you better than I do.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,230
Master.

21
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,030
I don't want to force him.

22
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,260
If you know me that well,

23
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,440
you should also know my personality.

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,810
I won't let him off easily.

25
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,210
How dare he bully you?

26
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,250
Master.

27
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,970
Our men have spotted the Ding brothers.

28
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,580
Let's go.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,660
Aizhen, you stay here.

30
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,760
Leave it all to me.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,910
I...

32
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,270
Waiter, come here.

33
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,110
Let's have a chat.

34
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,070
Coming.

35
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,940
Crazy Taoist.

36
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,350
This isn't the time to kill.

37
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,630
Don't do anything reckless.

38
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,870
I think you should keep hiding.

39
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,790
Hiding?

40
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,950
You think we're scared of you?

41
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,510
We just don't want to make a bigger scene than necessary.

42
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,250
You showing up

43
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,840
already made things worse.

44
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,080
What do you want?

45
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,740
Leave this place.

46
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,210
Let's keep our paths from crossing.

47
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,860
You're pushing your luck!

48
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,830
Sir,

49
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,850
may I have your name?

50
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,300
No need for formalities. Just call me Hu Jiao.

51
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,560
Hu Jiaow?

52
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,060
The same pronunciation as pepper?

53
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,760
No wonder you can handle so much heat!

54
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,210
Great name, great name.

55
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,330
Hu Jiaow.

56
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,780
We have things to handle.

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,750
Let's continue

58
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,020
this conversation later.

59
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,510
You...

60
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,590
♫A gentle breeze brushes past the bright moon♫

61
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,730
♫Your radiance spreads softly in the wind♫

62
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,540
♫Your quiet arrival♫

63
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,460
♫Tugs at my heartstrings♫

64
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,470
♫My heartbeat pauses at this very moment♫

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,480
♫Drizzling spring rain nourishes the soul♫

66
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,570
♫The sea of flowers in my heart blooms full of longing♫

67
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,350
♫No need for sweet words♫

68
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,450
♫Sharing simple moments♫

69
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,040
♫Our meeting no longer feels distant♫

70
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,370
♫A shooting star streaks across the sky♫

71
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,110
Speak up. What do you want?

72
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,360
Are you sure you want this to be a fight to the death?

73
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,880
It's not about what I want.

74
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,970
I have no choice.

75
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,530
You've become a serious threat

76
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,390
to our survival.

77
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,350
If you're that eager to die, I'll gladly oblige.

78
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,440
Are you sure you're not going to run?

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,470
Do you understand

80
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,830
the consequences of crossing us?

81
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,430
The General's army will annihilate you.

82
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,140
But who said anyone would survive to report back?

83
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,030
You think you can take us out?

84
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,210
We don't even have to fight.

85
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,710
Our disciples can kill you

86
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,360
easily.

87
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,740
Since you're so eager for your disciples to meet their end,

88
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,210
I'll grant your wish.

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,560
You told me to hold back,

90
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,710
but I can't anymore.

91
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,010
I want to kill them now.

92
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,020
Kill them!

93
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,270
You'll see the power of our disciples'

94
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,350
Heaven-Destroying Formation.

95
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,060
He's looking for a weakness.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,970
Just wait.

97
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,350
Trying to sneak attack?

98
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,500
Foolish!

99
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,909
Let's see how he dies.

100
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,670
He thinks the scholar is the weakest.

101
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,670
He'll die even faster.

102
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,030
He has no backup plan at all

103
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,450
and fell into our trap easily.

104
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,320
In front of the Heaven-Destroying Formation,

105
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,590
he's as good as dead

106
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,590
unless he's leading an army.

107
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,980
Seven, come here.

108
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,150
That person was poisoned by my Heart Devouring Poison.

109
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,850
He won't last long.

110
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,950
Go.

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,470
Six.

112
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,080
Master.

113
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,600
Yes.

114
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,760
Why don't you just kill me?

115
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,570
You were poisoned by my uncle master.

116
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,480
The poison has already sealed your fate.

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,800
I'm already dead, huh?

118
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,850
I'm dead?

119
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm dead?

120
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,160
Then why are you still following me?

121
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,870
[Swallow]

122
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,000
My uncle master told me to stick with you,

123
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,730
just in case there are any accomplices left.

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,310
We think

125
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,090
it doesn't matter if I let you know or not.

126
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,150
Come on.

127
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,690
Following me so openly

128
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,320
will scare off anyone who might be hiding.

129
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,280
You need to follow me secretly.

130
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,100
Then others will come out.

131
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,360
Only fools will come with you here so openly.

132
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,750
What are you thinking?

133
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,020
Whether what you said makes sense.

134
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,390
Get lost!

135
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,810
[Swallow]

136
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,350
Actually, I've thought about it,

137
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,310
and I don't think you're right.

138
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,970
Others don't know our relationship.

139
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,200
If someone sees you wounded,

140
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,420
they might come out to help.

141
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,040
And I'd be close enough

142
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,550
to gauge their intentions.

143
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,910
Are you being funny?

144
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,780
Listening to you two argue

145
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,590
is exhausting.

146
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,080
And you.

147
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,750
Get up.

148
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,590
Stop looking, idiot.

149
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,290
Get lost!

150
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,850
Gauging intentions for what?

151
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,420
Who are you?

152
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,150
What? Wanna fight?

153
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm fine.

154
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,660
Why are you so impulsive?

155
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,370
What does it have to do with you?

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,730
Seven, are you alright?

157
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,740
Where did you even come from?

158
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,710
I was just passing by.

159
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,030
Passing by?

160
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,880
Go! Beat him!

161
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,040
How stupid.

162
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,230
Can you get up?

163
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,630
You two, get lost.

164
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,080
I won't go easy on you.

165
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,380
If you don't leave,

166
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,500
I'll gladly send you to meet your maker.

167
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,190
Do you dare to say your name?

168
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,340
Do you know our master is Ding...

169
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,260
Hold it!

170
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,490
One at a time.

171
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,250
Speak Mandarin.

172
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,170
Do you dare state your name?

173
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,550
You two aren't worthy of knowing my name.

174
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,550
You...

175
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,830
Do you know our master is Ding...

176
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,390
Stop! That's even more ridiculous.

177
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,770
Your master?

178
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,400
Why should I care who your master is?

179
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,020
Go back and tell him:

180
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,790
Wild Crane Zhang Fang.

181
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,100
Ask if he dares provoke me.

182
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,050
Zhang Fang?

183
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,140
I'm not here to stir up trouble.

184
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,890
But if someone wants to test me,

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,100
they can try it.

186
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,930
Let's go.

187
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,510
Wait.

188
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,630
What are you waiting for?

189
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,050
I'm just wondering if my task is complete.

190
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,940
At a time like this, who cares?

191
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,270
Move!

192
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,360
My task isn't done! Why are you dragging me?

193
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,890
It's done, it's done. Let's go!

194
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,670
Really done?

195
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,450
Done, done. I swear!

196
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,010
Are you sure? Done.

197
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,070
Yes.

198
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,100
Is it really done?

199
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,680
-You can't fool me.
-Just go.

200
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,630
So, you're this strong.

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,220
You should

202
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,770
stay out of this mess.

203
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,320
My master was killed by them.

204
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,390
Are you here to help me?

205
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,050
I'm here to save you.

206
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,810
I saved you because of our affection

207
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,370
but it doesn't mean I owe you.

208
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,970
Take care

209
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,970
of yourself.

210
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,660
So cold-hearted…

211
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,290
I'm begging you.

212
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,980
Help me this once.

213
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,750
Help with what?

214
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,190
Kill them for you?

215
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,620
Martial Arts World's feuds never end.

216
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,510
If I help kill once, it'll lead to a hundred more.

217
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,280
Too much trouble.

218
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,810
You're poisoned and injured.

219
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,520
You can barely stand.

220
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,510
Let me take you to Gao Yin.

221
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,540
Get on my back.

222
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,650
Really stubborn. I'll support you.

223
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,400
I keep wondering if my task is done,

224
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,830
but you rushed me too much!

225
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,660
Brother, stop grinding.

226
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,690
They are back.

227
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,210
Master. Uncle Master.

228
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,160
We're back.

229
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,130
Master.

230
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,630
How did the task go?

231
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,520
Any issues?

232
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,730
We found an accomplice of them.

233
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,450
It's…

234
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,940
Wild Crane Zhang Fang.

235
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,450
You...

236
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,170
Get lost!

237
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,170
Why did they run into him?

238
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,910
Why are you following me?

239
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,740
Didn't Master tell us to get lost together?

240
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,280
Glutinous rice balls! Glutinous rice balls!

241
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,570
[Alcohol]

242
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,310
Tears of Lovers. Take a look.

243
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,220
[Fermented Glutinous Rice Balls]

244
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,450
You still remember to come back?

245
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,270
Scared me half to death!

246
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,180
Stop bluffing.

247
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,700
[Alcohol]

248
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,350
No, no!

249
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,530
I just witnessed something earth-shattering!

250
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,460
Really?

251
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,410
Do you know

252
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,110
the famous Crazy Taoist?

253
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,590
Crazy...

254
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,930
Of course.

255
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,060
Some no-name juniors

256
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,860
used a Heaven-Destroying Formation

257
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,410
and killed him.

258
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,110
What's this sissy doing here?

259
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,740
Got some peculiar obsession with you?

260
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,060
Want me to get rid of him for you?

261
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,210
He's my follower. Don't scare him,

262
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,350
or he'll wet himself.

263
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,030
What's wrong?

264
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,420
Let me see.

265
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,540
Did you get into a fight?

266
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,970
Had no choice.

267
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,839
Trouble always finds us.

268
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,680
Who dared mess with you?

269
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,260
A big shot,

270
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,200
meddling in our matters with Mingyi Manor.

271
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,440
Clearly tired of living.

272
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,490
Such a severe poison...

273
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,860
How did you get so injured?

274
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,860
My master was killed.

275
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,240
Old Weirdo Ding did it.

276
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,290
Old Weirdo Ding?

277
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,150
That heartless monster!

278
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,050
Take this medicine first.

279
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,190
Ten years ago, during the city massacre,

280
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,270
wasn't he supposedly killed by Yinniang

281
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,240
and the Mingyi Manor crew?

282
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,770
He's alive,

283
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,380
along with his seven disciples.

284
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,260
Aizhen.

285
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,860
Your master...

286
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,870
My master is Crazy Taoist.

287
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,950
Crazy Taoist?

288
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,550
Impossible.

289
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,250
How could someone like him

290
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,160
be killed so easily?

291
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,820
Old Weirdo Ding didn't even lift a finger.

292
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,030
His disciples did all the killing.

293
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,800
Even our top fighters

294
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,980
were wiped out.

295
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,710
Heaven-Destroying Formation is so powerful?

296
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,800
So, this is my father's trump card.

297
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,380
Trump card? I don't think so.

298
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,810
So, you've returned to the secular world?

299
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,710
It's just bluffing

300
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,260
to scare people off.

301
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,820
If it really came to a fight,

302
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,440
how could I beat that...

303
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,410
that formation or whatever it's called?

304
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,590
You're being modest.

305
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,600
Just now,

306
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,040
you clearly outmatched

307
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,420
those two.

308
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,490
He's still got some inner strength left.

309
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,240
As long as that remains,

310
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,000
even against Yinniang, he'd hold his ground.

311
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,140
Otherwise, he'll have no chance.

312
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,010
It's all just for the show.

313
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,460
Scaring people off

314
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,380
is enough.

315
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,490
But now it's blown up so much

316
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,910
that everyone thinks

317
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,790
I'm some peerless master.

318
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,290
Still, thanks for saving me just now.

319
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,880
But you...

320
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,920
Forget it.

321
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,210
Next time there's a fight,

322
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,430
remember to call me!

323
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,580
You know martial arts?

324
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,660
I don't,

325
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,210
but I'm strong.

326
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,030
See that rock over there?

327
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,010
I can toss it straight to the second floor.

328
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,240
Really?

329
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:30,960
You don't believe me?

330
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,650
Watch this.

331
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,280
Brother.

332
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,560
Look, that woman's pretty strong.

333
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,710
And we're just

334
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,100
short of a disciple, aren't we?

335
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,430
Young Master Wang.

336
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,990
Have you decided how to deal with the Ding brothers?

337
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,830
Young Master Wang.

338
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,150
Are you ready to make your move?

339
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,490
I made my decision

340
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,210
when I came here.

341
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,850
No, I have to find Qing Cai.

342
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,170
I have to tell him.

343
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,380
You're injured.

344
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,620
Moving around recklessly

345
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,450
will get you caught.

346
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,570
I am Wang Yishao.

347
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,510
Please, have a seat.

348
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,630
You carry such an air of nobility—

349
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,860
I didn't expect you to be the Second Prince.

350
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,750
That young man with you, the injured one—

351
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,690
he's yours?

352
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,470
My little brother

353
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,370
is very curious.

354
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,920
So, it's a misunderstanding

355
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,430
between us.

356
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,630
That brother must be Wild Crane Zhang Fang.

357
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,240
I see the poison on him has already been cured.

358
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,190
You truly have capable people by your side.

359
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,160
That's the last disciple of the Fairy Doctor.

360
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,450
Ah, I see. What an honor.

361
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
So this is the renowned disciple

362
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,060
of the Fairy Doctor.

363
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,700
I'm a mere commoner

364
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,410
but have long heard of your reputation.

365
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,640
And yours, Second Prince—renowned for both

366
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,820
intellect and martial skill, unmatched in our times.

367
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,730
It's a shame you abstain from court affairs—

368
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,420
such a waste.

369
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,050
You flatter me too much, Mr. Ding.

370
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,560
Careful with such praise;

371
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,300
it might ruin a person.

372
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,920
Years ago,

373
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,610
the seven of us trained together,

374
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,710
but our youngest fell ill and died.

375
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,670
So we patched things up

376
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,810
with a poor scholar.

377
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,420
That guy's so annoying!

378
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,790
Someone like you

379
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,250
is more our vibe.

380
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,850
Don't mention him.

381
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,330
Just thinking about him makes me mad!

382
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,530
A scholar who can learn martial arts?

383
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,120
That's rare.

384
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,360
Rare indeed.

385
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,820
We wanted to make him our strategist,

386
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,490
but who knew he'd be so talented?

387
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,050
Since he joined us,

388
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,960
our Heaven-Destroying Formation

389
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,590
developed a whole new technique.

390
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,750
Isn't that bizarre?

391
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,470
Really?

392
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,700
That's quite remarkable.

393
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,530
Remarkable?

394
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,650
My foot!

395
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,130
He thinks he's so clever

396
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,740
but doesn't even know how to woo women.

397
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,190
Woo...

398
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,110
Woo women?

399
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,170
We are all from the Martial Arts World.

400
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,660
Who hasn't visited a brothel or gambled a little?

401
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,550
Right!

402
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,370
But this guy? Doesn't do any of it.

403
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,060
Says he's "not into that."

404
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,140
What a sissy!

405
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,900
If we didn't hang around him all the time,

406
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,890
I'd think he was a woman!

407
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,760
Brother.

408
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,540
We really hit it off.

409
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,680
How about this? I'll talk to my master,

410
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,680
kick that guy out,

411
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,430
and take you in as a disciple.

412
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,560
What do you think, bro?

413
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,340
Show some respect.

414
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,560
What does he mean?

415
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,420
Take your filthy hands off!

416
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,330
You mangy dog, barking at me.

417
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,410
Haven't tasted my fist, huh?

418
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,190
Want me to teach your dog a lesson?

419
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,300
Are you okay?

420
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,220
Be my guest—if you can catch him.

421
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,060
-No problem.
-Come on.

422
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,110
Come on.

423
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,430
A long time ago,

424
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,590
there was a story

425
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,870
about

426
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,450
a stuttering magistrate.

427
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,350
At that time,

428
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,830
-What nonsense?
-Let's go.

429
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,860
this stuttering magistrate

430
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,810
went from the Shang Estate

431
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,490
to Sichuan

432
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,710
and then to Tianfu to take office.

433
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,830
Everyone...

434
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,710
Wild Crane Zhang Fang is not someone to mess with.

435
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,010
Don't blame Master;

436
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,890
even I just got scolded.

437
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,270
It was all me he was yelling at.

438
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,480
If Master hadn't told you to keep an eye on me,

439
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,240
you wouldn't have to put up this fake act, right?

440
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,280
What are you talking about?

441
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,830
Master cares about you!

442
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,650
Besides,

443
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,670
he's strict for your own good.

444
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,400
I know you all hate me.

445
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,990
We're not

446
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,540
the same kind of people,

447
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,210
so stop pretending.

448
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,550
I hate you too—

449
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,830
a bunch of hateful,

450
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,630
boring people.

451
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,700
Pretty boy, don't push your luck.

452
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,990
Watch me smash that smug face of yours.

453
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,840
Sure, if you could've done it, you would've already.

454
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,240
Let's wait until next time.

455
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,860
Now let me tell you another story—

456
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,580
about sparrows and swans.

457
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,120
Such a tiny arrow—what's it good for?

458
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,670
Precisely because it's small,

459
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,260
it's highly concealed.

460
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,790
Within two steps, if it hits,

461
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,340
no matter how skilled someone is,

462
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,400
they'll be easily subdued.

463
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,830
Two steps?

464
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,100
Sounds like rat poison—

465
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,510
stick it in their mouth,

466
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,870
and they're done for.

467
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,800
What do you know?

468
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,280
It's always better to be prepared.

469
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,460
Life-saving tools like this?

470
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,660
The more, the better.

471
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,650
But something this small—

472
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,650
is it at most a tickle?

473
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,030
Of course not.

474
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,600
These needles

475
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,180
are for hitting specific acupoints.

476
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,480
When you hit the right spot,

477
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,030
you can subdue your opponent.

478
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,000
Besides, we aim to control

479
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,400
the enemy, not kill them.

480
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,760
So precise—

481
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,350
doesn't that require incredible accuracy?

482
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,550
It's like hitting the mark from a hundred steps.

483
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,530
This tool

484
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,140
is probably only for you.

485
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,630
Not necessarily.

486
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
If you sincerely apprentice yourself to me,

487
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,910
I might just teach you.

488
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,600
Master.

489
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,110
Originally, I wanted you to experience

490
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,230
the missing motherly love.

491
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,990
Now, I haven't even learned how to be a mom,

492
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,160
and we're already heading to the battlefield.

493
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,880
Truly beyond my control.

494
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,750
We're fighting

495
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,280
for a comfortable future.

496
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,600
Leave this to me.

497
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,020
You two head back to Mingyi Manor first.

498
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,870
Okay.

499
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,450
Stop!

500
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,920
You little puppy.

501
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,880
If you've got the guts, stop running!

502
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,670
You limp dog, if you've got the guts, catch me!

503
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,580
All bark, no bite!

504
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,500
You're driving me crazy!

505
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,770
You bastard!

506
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,350
If I catch you,

507
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,300
I'll...

508
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,960
What?

509
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,480
I'll beat you up!

510
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,250
If you can catch me!

511
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,680
If you can catch me!

512
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,560
Your leg's already giving out, isn't it?

513
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,560
Come on!

514
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,310
About what my junior mentioned earlier,

515
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,210
think about it.

516
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm not interested in learning martial arts.

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,980
I am!

518
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,130
I want to learn martial arts.

519
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,880
You sneaky little rat,

520
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,540
one look at you and I can tell you're no good.

521
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,950
You're not much better yourself.

522
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,900
Like a mule laughing at a donkey's ears.

523
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,060
You slippery one.

524
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,210
Let me ask you something:

525
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,000
You've seen plenty of people at the market.

526
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,000
Ever seen a man prettier than a woman?

527
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,010
Now that you mention it,

528
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,890
Mingyi Manor asked us about that too.

529
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,360
Really? So you have seen him?

530
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,010
If you don't believe me, ask them!

531
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,170
[Lover's Tears Grilled Chicken]

532
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,530
Yes, Yes, Yes.

533
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes, Yes, Yes.

534
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,920
Yes, Yes, Yes.

535
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,030
So this man you're talking about—does he often come here?

536
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,650
Yeah, he's always wandering around here.

537
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,560
Get up.

538
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,590
What were you just saying?

539
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,420
We said...

540
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,340
They said

541
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,390
this man, prettier than a woman,

542
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,430
often shows up here.

543
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,350
Brother.

544
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,820
Who'd have thought the hardest thing would turn out to be so easy?

545
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,940
So can I become an apprentice now?

546
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,190
Grill me a few more skewers and bring them over.

547
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,360
I'll think about it.

548
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,900
Alright.

549
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,170
He wants to apprentice himself, huh?

550
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,620
He's quite the sly one—

551
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,850
hard to figure out.

552
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,950
Right now, he's no replacement for Seven.

553
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,540
You, a grown man,

554
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,960
can't even catch him?

555
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,310
That little pup's quick on his feet.

556
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,590
Could be good material.

557
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,970
No need to feel down.

558
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,420
My lackey here has extraordinary talent.

559
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,160
Hardly anyone can catch him.

560
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,670
Hu Jiaow, when you put it this way,

561
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,230
I don't feel so bad about losing.

562
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,090
Come on, drink! Drink!

563
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,980
Welcome.

564
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,310
What can I do for you?

565

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,460
You? Revive the family?

754
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,200
Don't even think about it.

755
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,710
It can be realized here.

756
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm naturally gifted.

757
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,380
I'm just temporarily off track.

758
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,880
I'll pass the imperial exams.

759
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,310
Keep dreaming.

760
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,910
Once you've entered my tutelage,

761
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,280
don't even think about leaving.

762
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,790
I'm waiting here

763
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,000
simply to say goodbye.

764
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,840
After all, we've had a teacher-student bond.

765
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,090
Please, Master, let me go.

766
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,290
You're too naive.

767
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,320
Don't move.

768
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,610
Move recklessly, and you might die.

769
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,160
Now you can leave.

770
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,550
No one's holding you back.

771
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,110
Let go of my master!

772
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,430
Are you stupid?

773
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,240
If we let him go, how will you escape?

774
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,540
"Once a master, always a father."

775
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,910
Can I walk away now?

776
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,960
If a ruler is unjust, a minister serves another country.

777
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,040
If a father lacks compassion,

778
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,680
a son seeks another home.

779
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,500
Today, I wanted to tell everyone a story

780
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,690
about The Three Bonds and Five Relationships.

781
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,660
Today's

782
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,850
not a good day for storytelling.

783
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,170
You can leave.

784
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,250
I owe all my martial skills to my master.

785
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,930
In this situation,

786
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,900
I can't abandon him.

787
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,540
I don't have a disciple like you.

788
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,550
If you're not going to kill me,

789
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,780
I'll call for reinforcements.

790
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,500
Let's go.

791
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,750
[Fermented Glutinous Rice Balls]

792
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:47,930
How about it?

793
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,830
Can you lay a hand on this nerd?

794
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,400
If not, then kill him.

795
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,980
How dare you!

796
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,560
You're being ungrateful.

797
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,490
You attacked us while I was

798
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,020
at odds with my master.

799
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,670
Why should I be grateful?

800
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,320
Just now, I could've killed you

801
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,230
but didn't.

802
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,360
Sparing your life counts as a favor, doesn't it?

803
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,680
A favor for not killing me?

804
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,530
I'm not afraid of death!

805
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,720
Go ahead, kill me!

806
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,070
Fool.

807
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,780
Release my master now,

808
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,800
and I'll leave.

809
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,470
After all, he's agreed to let me go.

810
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,380
What's that supposed to mean?

811
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,430
I've agreed with Seven:

812
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,870
Our teacher-student relationship is over.

813
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,120
We shouldn't

814
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,390
make things worse here.

815
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,130
This isn't a fun spectacle.

816
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,760
Go back to your stall.

817
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,120
Someone's going to die here!

818
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,530
It's not that serious.

819
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,280
It is!

820
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,850
Whose side are you on?

821
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,020
He's my lackey.

822
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,030
Let him go!

823
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,350
If you dare harm my big brother,

824
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,260
not only will I kill you all,

825
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,720
I'll slaughter the entire town!

826
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,410
Massacre the town! Massacre the town!

827
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,960
Run! Quick, quick, quick!
