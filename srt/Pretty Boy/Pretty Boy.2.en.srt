1
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,080
You're here to save someone, aren't you?

2
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,150
I thought that place was a treasure vault.

3
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,400
Standing here won't help.

4
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,390
Let's leave for now.

5
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,710
We'll try another spot tomorrow.

6
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,280
Let's go.

7
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,080
The barrier ahead has been triggered!

8
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,030
Everyone, hurry!

9
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,030
Yes!

10
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,000
Quick, find the one who triggered the barrier!

11
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,000
They must be nearby.

12
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes!

13
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
You guys, search carefully!

14
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes!

15
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,560
Over here!

16
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,310
Over there!

17
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,310
Check over there!

18
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,150
Got it!

19
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Search thoroughly!

20
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,360
They should be close by.

21
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,630
Over here!

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Go over there!

23
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,120
There's movement over there!

24
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,630
Head over there!

25
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,630
-Got it.
-Got it!

26
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,280
Over here!

27
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
Looks like they went that way.

28
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,470
As if I needed you to tell me.

29
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,630
Let's go.

30
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,560
I think someone was following us earlier.

31
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,630
Who do you think it could be?

32
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,430
Not sure.

33
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,630
Qing Cai, is it?

34
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,830
Gan Pu?

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,270
You're pretty good, huh?

36
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,190
Restoring the barrier so I'd trigger it?

37
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,240
To get me chased down

38
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,310
and bitten by a snake?

39
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,680
This grudge...

40
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,950
You just wait!

41
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,560
I… I can't die yet.

42
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,510
Not yet.

43
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,270
I still have a mission.

44
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,360
Be careful.

45
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,920
It's okay.

46
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,000
What's… what's wrong with her?

47
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,560
I found her in the forest.

48
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
She was bitten by a venomous snake

49
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,000
and almost died.

50
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,680
Where exactly did you find her?

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Not far from the barrier.

52
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,040
It seems she triggered it

53
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,160
and got bitten.

54
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,560
Take this to Han Aizhen.

55
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,560
This piece is big.

56
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,920
Was that person just now Han Aizhen?

57
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,430
We've truly made an enemy this time.

58
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,750
Even sending food to make peace won't help now.

59
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,070
She was seriously hurt this time.

60
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,950
This grudge is a serious one.

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Eat something.

62
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,159
I'm not eating.

63
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
You're hurt today.

64
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,750
You need to eat something to recover.

65
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,600
Let me rest for a bit.

66
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,390
I'll be fine after a while.

67
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
She won't eat.

68
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Thanks.

69
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,310
Wait a moment.

70
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,870
This will make it taste better.

71
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,190
Want some?

72
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,040
It smells great.

73
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,310
You didn't poison this, did you?

74
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
This poison is deadly.

75
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,070
49 days later...

76
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,600
If a woman eats this, nothing will happen.

77
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,270
What do you mean?

78
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,040
The ingredients here aren't poisonous.

79
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,630
But if a man eats it, it'll harm his body.

80
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,480
If a man eats it, he'll be sterile.

81
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
You know it again.

82
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
What's with you? Why are you so scared?

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,480
Uh…

84
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,630
I was bitten by a rabbit when I was a kid.

85
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,360
So now I'm terrified of rabbits.

86
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,150
You were bitten by a rabbit?

87
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,030
Even rabbits bite you?

88
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,240
How much do you have to annoy others?

89
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,440
Who knows?

90
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,750
Maybe I was born unlucky.

91
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,550
Just eat it. It won't kill you.

92
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,790
I don't know what Han Aizhen's background is.

93
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,120
Her temper is too volatile.

94
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,390
She's not suitable to be here.

95
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,320
We still need to be careful.

96
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,000
Though she's impatient,

97
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,750
She's highly destructive. She'll cause trouble.

98
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,630
Your mind's not broken, huh?

99
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,150
So, are you going to deal with me now?

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,270
We're all smart people here.

101
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,080
We're all well aware of the situation.

102
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,040
Whether we're enemies or allies, it's still hard to say, isn't it?

103
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,270
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

104
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,320
At the very least, we're all opposed to Mingyi Manor,

105
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,080
right?

106
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,510
Hard to say.

107
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,550
This is Sun Li,

108
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,840
whom you've all met already.

109
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,150
Next, I'd like to introduce someone else,

110
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,750
the overall supervisor of our trial disciples,

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
Young Master Wang.

112
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,910
I am Wang Yishao.

113
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,790
I was away dealing with important matters earlier,

114
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,360
and by the time I returned, I'd already missed the event.

115
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,480
I'd like to apologize for that.

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,120
Today, I'll be teaching you all to dance.

117
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,750
Come, let's learn together.

118
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,870
One, two, three, four.

119
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,510
Five, six, seven, eight.

120
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,550
Two, two, three, four.

121
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,480
That's right.

122
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,960
Like this.

123
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

124
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
Like this.

125
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,390
What are you doing?

126
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,440
Correct.

127
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,550
Yes, move your hips, your chest, and your head.

128
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,080
Five, six, seven, eight.

129
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,480
This hand, this hand.

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,240
That's right.

131
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,550
Last time,

132
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,750
you were just making things up, weren't you?

133
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,670
But...

134
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,510
Strange.

135
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
Why do you

136
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,030
always smell like a man?

137
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,630
You're not secretly hiding a man, are you?

138
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,120
You're funny.

139
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,120
You don't want to do feminine movements.

140
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,150
Do you imagine yourself

141
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
as a man every day?

142
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,720
And your legs…

143
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,910
Why are you touching my legs?

144
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,840
What's the big deal about a woman touching you?

145
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,480
This Qing Cai seems a little odd.

146
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,270
Keep an eye on her.

147
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Got it.

148
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,750
Do you actually think you're a man?

149
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,790
Her name is Vegetable.

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,150
Right?

151
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,910
Right.

152
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,720
Her name is quite unique.

153
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,270
This newcomer seems very clever.

154
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,150
I need to stir the waters a bit.

155
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,550
Madam, since

156
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
we have a man here,

157
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
why don't we let him dance?

158
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,480
Let us see

159
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,390
what a real man's dancing looks like.

160
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,440
I agree.

161
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,480
Sure.

162
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,150
Dance!

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,630
The women here

164
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,150
don't do feminine dances.

165
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,910
Can you show us?

166
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
From the beginning?

167
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,390
Start from the beginning,

168
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,030
so we can observe.

169
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,720
Please, go ahead.

170
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
So beautiful!

171
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,240
He's like a cat,

172
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
not on the same team as you.

173
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
I heard you keep a cat.

174
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,150
You didn't bring it, did you?

175
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,320
Of course, I did.

176
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,200
Wang Yishao is afraid of cats?

177
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,510
I can use that.

178
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,670
Alright, alright, enough fooling around.

179
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,720
Let's keep practicing.

180
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,440
I admire you so much! You have to teach me.

181
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,550
Jiaoniang!

182
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,120
-You dare tease Young Master Wang?
-Don't run!

183
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,360
Despicable! Shameless!

184
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,550
You...

185
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,600
She went that way!

186
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,080
Let's hurry! Go, go, go! Quick!

187
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Young Master Wang!

188
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,030
Young Master Wang!

189
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,200
Wait for me!

190
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,390
Young Master Wang!

191
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,270
Don't run, Young Master Wang!

192
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,000
Make way! Make way!

193
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Young Master Wang!

194
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,550
Young Master Wang!

195
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,840
Young Master Wang!

196
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,870
Young Master Wang!

197
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,120
Young Master Wang!

198
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,720
Young Master Wang!

199
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,470
What's going on?

200
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,840
Where did those two run off to?

201
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,120
Over there.

202
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
Let's chase them! We can't let her succeed.

203
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,270
Despicable! Shameless!

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,790
Go! Go!

205
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,200
What's going on? Why is the alarm ringing?

206
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,790
They stumbled upon it by accident.

207
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,550
Who triggered it?

208
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,270
I couldn't see.

209
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,550
We couldn't figure out what happened either.

210
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,360
The alarm just went off.

211
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,030
Do you think they did it on purpose or by accident?

212
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,440
By the time we arrived, they'd already triggered it.

213
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,510
It's hard to say.

214
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,600
It's hard to say?

215
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,870
You suspect it was deliberate?

216
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,670
I can't be sure either.

217
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,840
It's hard to say about that Qing Cai.

218
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,630
She always seems a bit odd.

219
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,320
As for Young Master Wang,

220
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,440
his identity shouldn't allow such behavior.

221
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,320
If it were up to me,

222
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,240
that person shouldn't have been left alive.

223
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,910
But Yinniang doesn't permit that.

224
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,600
True.

225
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,480
You two, check the barrier.

226
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,320
Yes.

227
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,640
Add a few more people to guard it.

228
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,829
Yes.

229
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
We shouldn't have been so impulsive.

230
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,240
That person was bait.

231
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,200
Yes.

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,440
The barrier wasn't damaged,

233
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,400
just triggered.

234
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,160
Be more vigilant in the coming days.

235
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,920
Young Master Wang, stop running!

236
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,680
Young Master Wang!

237
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,000
Young Master Wang!

238
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,400
Why are you running? Stop running!

239
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
Don't come near me!

240
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,310
Well, why are you running?

241
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,550
What are you trying to do?

242
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,480
I want you to teach me how to dance!

243
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,880
Oh, come off it.

244
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,710
Who dances while carrying a cat?

245
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,240
I'm not carrying a cat!

246
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,480
Are you sure you want me to teach you to dance?

247
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,960
Yes!

248
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,310
Let me go change my clothes first.

249
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,590
Wait, wait, wait!

250
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,440
The...

251
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
The weather is so nice,

252
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,750
and the sun is shining.

253
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
Just let it dry out!

254
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,350
Are you sure you don't mind?

255
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,110
You're really nonchalant about this.

256
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,830
What's the big deal?

257
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,440
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

258
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,750
You already have a husband?

259
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
Actually,

260
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm a widow.

261
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,750
My late husband has already passed away.

262
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Vegetable.

264
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,350
That name is still a bit strange.

265
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,350
My real name is Qing Cai.

266
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,480
“Vegetable” is just a nickname Hu Jiao and the others gave me.

267
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,400
They were just messing around.

268
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,590
Qing Cai?

269
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,880
Then I should call you Widow Qing.

270
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,440
Widow Qing…

271
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,000
Well...

272
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,240
It sounds a bit awkward.

273
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Just keep calling me Vegetable.

274
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,440
Vegetable.

275
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,510
It does sound rather appetizing.

276
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,720
No wonder Hu Jiao gave you

277
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,030
such a nickname.

278
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,720
I didn't expect you to be so straightforward.

279
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,440
You're not shy about speaking your mind,

280
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,790
and you don't care about propriety between men and women.

281
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm unfamiliar with social norms. If I've offended you,

282
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,350
please forgive me.

283
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,750
It's fine.

284
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
It's actually refreshing.

285
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,880
Men and women should maintain proper distance.

286
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,680
Okay.

287
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,680
Let's just be friends.

288
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,880
I feel more comfortable that way.

289
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,070
Alright.

290
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,480
Do you really want to learn how to dance?

291
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,920
Of course! Let's do it.

292
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,550
Watch closely.

293
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,160
This person sees himself as a celestial being, detached from the mundane.

294
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
I love knocking such “celestials” down a peg.

295
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,960
How can you dance while holding a cat?

296
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,720
This isn't a cat. This is my mother.

297
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,590
The cat's name is Jiaoniang.

298
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,550
She's a cat, but also her mother.

299
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,880
Even if she's your mother,

300
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,590
how can you dance while holding her?

301
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,550
Put her down already!

302
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,110
My mother was resting in the room.

303
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
Since she came out,

304
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I have to carry her.

305
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,120
I can't just ignore my mother.

306
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,550
Qing Cai is really clever, figuring that out so quickly.

307
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,030
Why don't we take a break?

308
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,960
Sure.

309
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,720
Sure.

310
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,510
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,720
For someone so carefree,

312
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,000
how can you be afraid of something so mundane?

313
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
You mean the cat?

314
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm not actually afraid of cats.

315
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,790
I just can't get close to them.

316
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,030
I'll get rashes.

317
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
Once it got really bad.

318
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,110
I almost lost my life.

319
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,830
That serious?

320
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,400
Sorry, I had no idea.

321
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,240
It's fine.

322
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
You intentionally triggered the barrier earlier, didn't you?

323
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,680
What do you think?

324
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,240
The people who came to Mingyi Manor this time

325
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,750
are all working for their own interests.

326
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,270
I don't like confrontation.

327
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,310
What you're saying is you feel you have no choice, right?

328
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,720
But what's the reason behind all of this?

329
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,030
There are always people who want more,

330
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,350
power, for example.

331
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,640
I really hope we don't end up as enemies.

332
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,000
But I think

333
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,950
everyone being in a certain camp

334
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,030
is all a matter of chance.

335
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,920
And perhaps

336
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,750
there's a chance to choose again.

337
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,750
Is that how you see things?

338
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,070
Parents are given by the heavens,

339
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,110
but how you choose to act

340
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,160
is up to you.

341
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,480
What you're saying

342
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,200
seems to be aimed at what I've said.

343
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,110
It's what my teacher taught me.

344
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,790
Haven't you noticed?

345
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,070
I'm only saying what you want to say.

346
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,550
Your teacher must be extraordinary.

347
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,920
It seems you already know my identity.

348
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,440
That wasn't hard to guess.

349
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,920
For you to be accepted by an all-women villa like Mingyi Manor

350
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,030
and even become its so-called Supervisor,

351
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,680
you can't be a nobody.

352
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,000
I might as well tell you.

353
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,110
I'm the second prince.

354
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,680
A transaction?

355
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,270
Not just one.

356
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,680
A very complicated series of transactions.

357
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,000
Next, he'll ask about my identity.

358
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,440
I can't let him keep probing.

359
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,830
I admire you.

360
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,830
Friendships between gentlemen are as light as water.

361
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,590
Since we can connect on a deeper level,

362
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,750
we should maintain a respectful distance.

363
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,400
Don't misunderstand me.

364
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,440
I have no feelings for you whatsoever.

365
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,550
-Really.
-Hurry, hurry, hurry!

366
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,400
We must find her.

367
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,310
Truly despicable!

368
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,070
-Let's go.
-We have to find her.

369
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,920
Alright.

370
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,720
-Let's go.
-Search over there.

371
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,830
Check over there too.

372
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,510
Okay.

373
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,680
That barrier is very complex.

374
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,200
We'll need some specially crafted components

375
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,640
to stabilize the triggered mechanisms.

376
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,550
That lock is also quite intricate.

377
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,880
It'll require a complete set of lock-picking tools.

378
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,350
I don't have those things.

379
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,480
I only know how to make them.

380
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,480
That place

381
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,400
looks like a place designed to hold prisoners.

382
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,310
From the way you're acting,

383
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,240
it seems like you're about to jack up the price.

384
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,640
Tell me, what exactly do you need to make,

385
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,440
and how many parts do you need.

386
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,680
So you don't trust me, huh?

387
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,640
It's fine if you don't.

388
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,750
I can take or leave this deal.

389
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,830
It's up to you.

390
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,310
What are you doing?

391
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,750
Look, I'm skilled in martial arts. I can help you.

392
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
If you help me this time, I'll return the favor once.

393
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,510
A fair deal.

394
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,400
We'll need at least ten small stabilizing parts

395
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,030
and twenty

396
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,310
larger components.

397
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,030
Altogether, it'll cost ten taels of silver.

398
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,110
Ten taels of silver?

399
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,680
I don't even spend that much in a year!

400
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
Why don't you just ask for a hundred taels while you're at it?

401
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,480
You swindler!

402
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,440
How can you say that?

403
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,030
Rare goods are worth hoarding. And only I can make them.

404
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,640
I didn't ask you for a thousand taels of silver.

405
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,550
That's already being very generous to you.

406
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
A thousand taels of silver?

407
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,110
You greedy scoundrel, taking advantage of the situation.

408
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,430
I need to buy on credit.

409
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
It's quite depressing.

410
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,510
Impossible. I can't give you credit.

411
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,830
With the way you're running your shady business, you still don't have money?

412
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,510
You must have made a fortune by now, right?

413
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,070
This business hasn't even started yet.

414
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,070
You're taking me for your first sucker.

415
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Fine.

416
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,240
Enough talk.

417
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,240
One word.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,680
Deal or not?

419
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,110
I have no money.

420
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,720
Then you can handle it yourself.

421
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
Can't even get credit for selling goods?

422
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,790
Alright, I'll find the money.

423
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,750
What does Qing Cai usually do?

424
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,750
Helping me find food.

425
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,270
Anything else?

426
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,590
She's quite funny.

427
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Always so jumpy.

428
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,350
You're the one who's jumpy.

429
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,750
Not really.

430
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,590
So, who's she been hanging out with recently?

431
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,680
Gan Pu, I suppose.

432
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,790
They often go out together,

433
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,350
but

434
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,640
it's mostly to find food for me.

435
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,790
Good.

436
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,640
Carefree.

437
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,480
I actually envy you.

438
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,550
The way you say it, it sounds like you're insulting me.

439
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,110
You can tell, huh?

440
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,000
Do you think I'm a fool?

441
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,000
But if you think that way,

442
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,070
you're suspicious of Vegetable?

443
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,200
At least she's not on our side.

444
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,190
Watch her

445
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
and see what she's been up to.

446
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,070
Got it.

447
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,270
I should follow her secretly and don't get caught.

448
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,960
Can you do it?

449
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,240
I can't.

450
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,680
But I can stick to her.

451
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,320
She won't be able to do anything. Problem solved.

452
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,070
Alright.

453
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,000
Let's do that then.

454
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,310
Right.

455
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,110
I think I've noticed

456
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,400
she's interested in you.

457
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,350
If you ask me,

458
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,920
you might as well use the "honeypot" strategy.

459
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,160
This way, Vegetable...

460
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,440
But this is one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems. It's so much easier.

461
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,680
Just remember your task.

462
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,400
Why are you following me?

463
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,750
From now on, I'm going to follow you.

464
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,310
Wherever you go, I'll go.

465
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,680
Are you trying to be my personal bodyguard?

466
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,000
Personal bodyguard?

467
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,160
Yes, that's right.

468
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,640
I'm going hunting.

469
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,590
I'll go too.

470
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,440
I need to raise money.

471
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,920
I must shake her off.

472
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,550
Fine, let's go together.

473
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,960
But with your agility,

474
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,230
I can easily lose you in no time.

475
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,550
Jiaoniang's attribute is more agile.

476
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,790
I'll borrow Jiaoniang's attribute for a bit.

477
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,680
I'll go too.

478
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Then I'll go along as well.

479
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,750
Let's go.

480
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,400
Wait for me, you guys!

481
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,000
Wait.

482
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,310
Someone's calling you.

483
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,750
What are you up to, anyway?

484
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,640
You money-grubber.

485
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,590
I'm just satisfying your appetite, aren't I?

486
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,200
I must say, you're really quite unlucky.

487
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,830
Being broke is one thing,

488
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,790
but dragging around a big T-Rex?

489
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,270
You don't even have a chance to beg for food.

490
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,640
Give me a hand.

491
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,640
I'll help you out, seeing how pitiful you are.

492
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,310
So, how do you want to deal with it?

493
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,550
Should we capture them directly,

494
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,400
or set up a few traps?

495
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,350
Isn't there that "get lost" thing?

496
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,480
Then I can relax.

497
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,920
There's such a thing?

498
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,310
So powerful.

499
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,280
You're pretty clever. That one's quite tricky.

500
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,960
Come with me.

501
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,350
This way.

502
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,030
You guys.

503
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,070
Wait for me.

504
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,960
Do we have to go this far to hunt?

505
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,680
I can't go on anymore.

506
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm... I'm exhausted.

507
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,720
Can't go on.

508
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,030
If you can't go on, just rest here.

509
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,830
We'll keep going.

510
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,830
-Let's go then.
-Alright, let's go.

511
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,790
No way.

512
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,480
We all came out together.

513
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,680
If we go, we go together.

514
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,790
I don't want to be bitten to death by a venomous snake again.

515
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,030
Then I can't go on.

516
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,030
I'm... I'm dead tired.

517
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,200
I need to sit for a while, right here.

518
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,510
Maybe we'll even see a rabbit run into a tree.

519
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,720
That makes sense.

520
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,030
I'm tired too. Let's sit for a while.

521
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,830
We've already reached the edge of Mingyi Manor.

522
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,240
How is Gan Pu going to teach me to get out?

523
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,480
Oh, right.

524
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,790
A while ago,

525
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,680
I just learned a really interesting dance.

526
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,830
Want to learn it?

527
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,880
Yes, let's learn it.

528
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,920
Okay, let's learn it.

529
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,400
I won't learn it.

530
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,510
Come on, take a look.

531
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,720
It's quite interesting.

532
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
A very skilled teacher taught me this.

533
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,070
They said,

534
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,720
wave your hands like this,

535
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,590
shake your head twice,

536
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,240
then stomp your foot,

537
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,830
and spin around.

538
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,720
The key is in the footwork.

539
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,640
You need to take seven steps to the right,

540
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,400
then ten steps to the left.

541
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,440
Hu Jiao, can't you be more like a girl?

542
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,240
Be a bit more charming, will you?

543
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,030
Spin around again.

544
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,350
Don't forget the hand movements.

545
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,550
Have you learned it?

546
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,480
Don't forget the key points.

547
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,510
You should rest for a while.

548
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,720
Alright.

549
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,240
I've got it.

550
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,480
Let's go a bit further in.

551
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,550
How about we hunt first and then talk?

552
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,830
Let's go.

553
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,960
Don't sleep anymore.

554
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,830
Carry your mother and let's go.

555
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,000
Jiaoniang.

556
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,550
Let's go.

557
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,680
The path is slippery here. Watch your step.

558
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,590
Hu Jiao.

559
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,110
Look, is that catnip?

560
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,720
Where?

561
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,390
Where?

562
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,400
Look, isn't that it?

563
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,310
You need to walk seven steps to the right,

564
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,510
then ten steps to the left.

565
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,240
What's wrong?

566
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,960
Well done. That's another strike against you.

567
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,270
Where did Qing Cai go?

568
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,880
To hell with him.

569
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,030
To hell? There really is a "get lost" thing?

570
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,160
Is it real?

571
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,750
Still saying "hmm"?

572
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,400
"Get lost"? You're really something.

573
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,160
You'll regret this.

574
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,920
Will I?

575
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,750
This is quite fun.

576
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,720
Jiaoniang, let's go this way.

577
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,400
You don't believe me?

578
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,920
Then I'll wait for you here.

579
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,790
Idiot.

580
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,030
Finally out of that maze.

581
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,400
Where are they?

582
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,240
Did they all go up the mountain?

583
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,480
You must be quite reluctant

584
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,510
to come here.

585
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,920
Some debts of gratitude

586
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,750
must be repaid.

587
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,750
I know.

588
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,880
When you were young,

589
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,440
he always took care of you.

590
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
It's just that

591
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,480
this is too unfair to you.

592
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,510
Although this time he seems to be taking advantage of past kindness,

593
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,240
at least I've repaid him a favor.

594
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,000
Let's just consider it self-consolation.

595
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,000
What do you think of Qing Cai?

596
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,590
A very strange person.

597
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,360
But definitely not on our side.

598
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,440
Hu Jiao might not be able to keep an eye on him.

599
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,670
Of course.

600
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,480
So we can only do our best and leave the rest to fate.

601
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,989
Yishao, I...

602
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,070
I want to talk to you about something.

603
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,000
I'll go find Hu Jiao and the others first.

604
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,590
Let's talk another day.

605
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,440
Is that all?

606
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,320
Just this little?

607
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,800
What I need is ten taels of silver.

608
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Ten taels of silver?

609
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,670
I've never even seen that much.

610
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,360
Never seen that much before.

611
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,550
Why don't we start a business?

612
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,960
Actually, I don't want to keep living like this either.

613
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,400
I want to find a nice girl

614
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,400
and do something proper.

615
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,800
What can you do?

616
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,920
Open a snack shop.

617
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,550
My mom's cooking is the best in town.

618
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,280
I'll have her teach me.

619
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,550
I think opening a snack shop

620
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,550
shouldn't be a problem.

621
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,510
Mom, I'm home!

622
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,630
Jing, you're back.

623
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,800
You're back so early today.

624
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,280
This is our boss.

625
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,400
New, new boss?

626
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,840
It's the same one as before.

627
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Why didn't you say so earlier?

628
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,190
Boss, you've come to have a meal at our home.

629
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,880
Why did it take so long for you to visit?

630
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,150
Were we being too polite?

631
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Please don't call me boss.

632
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,590
You can just call me by my name.

633
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,000
How can that be?

634
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
This boss of yours,

635
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,840
after shaving, he's quite a handsome young man.

636
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,280
Why are they here too?

637
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,960
Are you trying to eat us out of house and home?

638
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,510
Mom,

639
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,630
they're here to learn your cooking skills.

640
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,510
Eating them out of house and home?

641
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,030
You used to have a beard.

642
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,920
What a waste of such a handsome face.

643
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,920
What did you just say?

644
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,670
What skills? What do you want to learn?

645
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,630
Cooking.

646
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,870
Them?

647
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,000
Do you want to make pig food?

648
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,960
Yes.

649
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,280
Why do they seem even dumber today?

650
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,150
They're all scared dumb.

651
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,280
What do you mean?

652
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,360
Have you seen a ghost?

653
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,960
What are you going to do after learning this?

654
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,880
I just want to open a snack stand.

655
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,510
A snack stand won't work either.

656
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,670
Think about it, a snack stand

657
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,840
needs pots, bowls, and utensils.

658
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,480
Where would our family get that much money?

659
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,230
Mom, don't you want your son to get married?

660
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,000
Mom has already started saving

661
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,360
the money for your marriage.

662
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,150
The problem is

663
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,550
decent girls

664
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,070
don't like troublemakers, you know.

665
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,230
Are you serious? You really want to set up a stall and do business?

666
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,920
Yes, indeed.

667
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,150
Alright then, let's have a good talk about it.

668
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,320
Go bring a few chairs over here.

669
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,070
Come on, let's get some chairs.

670
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,030
-Get the chairs.
-Let's go.

671
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,550
Boss, please take the seat of honor.

672
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,920
Please, you first.

673
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,190
Please, you go ahead.

674
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,800
No, please, you first.

675
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,000
How about we sit together then?

676
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,360
This kid is really good-looking.

677
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,880
Mine, mine, it's mine.

678
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,400
I'll sit first.

679
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,710
Let's talk.

680
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,320
What are you going to sell at your stall?

681
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,070
Braised chicken wings.

682
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,840
Good.

683
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,150
What about the others?

684
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,190
I'm planning to sell Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce.

685
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,190
How about Glutinous Rice Balls?

686
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Wait, why does it sound like

687
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,320
you're trying to put together a whole restaurant?

688
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,590
Okay.

689
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,110
I just listened outside for a bit.

690
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,880
You guys.

691
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,150
To sum it up in one sentence,

692
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,880
you lack experience.

693
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,360
Lack of experience.

694
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,590
You're back, sir.

695
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,280
I didn't recognize you at first.

696
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,190
You shaved off your beard, boy,

697
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
looking sharp!

698
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,000
So different.

699
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,000
Move aside.

700
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,190
These ideas of yours

701
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,710
will definitely cause you lose money.

702
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,360
You won't even gain any fame.

703
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,870
You old coot.

704
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,360
Your son is finally trying to do something legitimate.

705
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,190
Can't you stop with the sarcastic remarks?

706
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,400
Alright, alright, alright.

707
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:13,110
Why do people go out to eat on the streets?

708
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,510
You don't know, do you?

709
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,000
It's because

710
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,440
it's delicious, but not filling.

711
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,320
If it's not filling, why eat it?

712
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,760
Isn't that just being silly?

713
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,110
Exactly, that's right.

714
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,510
The filling ones are called main dishes.

715
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,590
The not-so-filling ones are called snacks.

716
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,070
Why are you the only one left?

717
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,840
Where are the others?

718
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,440
Who are you looking for?

719
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,400
I saw you all going up the mountain earlier.

720
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,590
I just came to check things out since I had nothing else to do.

721
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,710
You're here to find Qing Cai, aren't you?

722
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,510
What do you mean?

723
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,800
I saw you two running off together that day.

724
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,510
That was a misunderstanding.

725
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,110
She just wanted me to teach her how to dance.

726
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,430
She ignored perfectly good teachers,

727
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,510
and asked a grown man like you to dance with her.

728
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,360
Anyone would find that strange, wouldn't they?

729
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,960
Everyone interprets things differently.

730
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,510
Is there any more normal interpretation?

731
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,400
Everyone has their own motives.

732
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,960
What you saw

733
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,510
may not be the truth.

734
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,630
Maybe you two are putting on an act.

735
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,360
Who knows?

736
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,510
It seems

737
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,760
you've figured out my identity.

738
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,710
Maybe I deduced it.

739
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,800
We all know without saying.

740
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,000
Since you know who I am,

741
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,400
you should understand

742
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,110
I don't like conflict.

743
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,880
Before a dog barks,

744
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,000
who knows if it will bite?

745
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,800
That fiery temper of yours

746
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,230
easily reveals your true nature.

747
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,590
You're already losing your cool.

748
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,230
Want to kill me to shut me up?

749
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,030
We haven't reached the point of a life-or-death struggle, have we?

750
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,840
You're right.

751
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,190
Let's continue playing the game then.

752
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,190
That's a good attitude.

753
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,400
To make these things delicious,

754
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,760
you need good ingredients.

755
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,400
Good ingredients

756
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,440
must be mixed by yourselves.

757
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,550
Look.

758
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,510
I have some insights about ingredients.

759
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,190
I can help you research together.

760
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,670
Who is this?

761
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,800
I don't know.

762
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,590
Do you know?

763
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,480
I don't know either.

764
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,280
This is a mixture

765
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,360
of several spicy flavors combined into a seasoning.

766
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,480
Boss, boss, boss!

767
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,230
Boss, here, water!

768
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,630
Here, here.

769
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,040
No way.

770
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,590
Are you feeling better?

771
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,840
It's poison.

772
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,440
You ate too much.

773
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,360
You should only eat a little of this stuff.

774
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,880
I...

775
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,070
I just smelled it.

776
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,510
I didn't even eat any.

777
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,830
What do you mean?

778
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,070
Now,

779
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,630
do you want to kill me to shut me up?
