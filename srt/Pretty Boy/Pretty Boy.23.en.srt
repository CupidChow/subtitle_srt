00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,660
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,460
[Episode 23]

3
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,800
Why did you come back empty-handed?

4
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,770
We caught animals.

5
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,270
We caught them.

6
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,410
There's nothing.

7
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,620
There's nothing here.

8
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,370
Where are the animals?

9
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
-Here.
-Here.

10
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,700
Are these

11
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,920
animals?

12
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,850
We can kill them in front you.

13
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,300
Yes.

14
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,750
Yes.

15
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,490
Right in front of you.

16
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,870
It's delicious and nutritious.

17
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,010
Yes.

18
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm so...

19
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,090
I'm so...

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm so...

21
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,630
I'm so...

22
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,260
I'm so...

23
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,260
Big Brother!

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,440
Calm down.

25
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,750
I'm so mad!

26
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,060
Qing Cai.

27
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,700
How dare you let a vendor

28
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,870
do such a dangerous thing?

29
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,590
I don't know if his head was burned

30
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,190
by the furnace or what.

31
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,800
He said he had a dream of being a hero.

32
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,690
I wasn't able to convince him.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,040
What hero dream?

34
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,450
I think he's in love.

35
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,610
He probably

36
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,610
likes Chunlan.

37
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,680
How did you know?

38
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,780
You fool. What can you see?

39
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,260
Chunlan?

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,760
The disciple of Mingyi Manor.

41
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,120
She followed us to Jing's house before.

42
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,030
I see.

43
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,940
That's a bit like moths flying into a flame, isn't it?

44
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,810
Yeah, it is.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,790
That guy? He's as slippery

46
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,150
as a catfish.

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,570
By the way,

48
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,430
how is your previous informant doing?

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,640
It's all sorted.

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
Those two old weirdos

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
are as good as blind now.

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,650
With so many new plans,

53
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,910
I think I need to head back to the royal city and report in person.

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,630
What do you think?

55
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,250
Ah, there I go rambling again.

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,830
We should get going.

57
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,790
Leaving without even saying goodbye, huh?

58
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,409
Let's go.

59
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,070
Let's go.

60
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,580
Waiter, the check!

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,000
The last time I pushed you on the swing,

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,140
it was just a few days ago,

63
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,300
but now it feels like ages have passed.

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Yeah, it does.

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,120
Who knows, in a few decades,

66
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,470
when we think back to today,

67
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,750
you pushing me on the swing

68
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,840
will feel like it happened just yesterday.

69
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,910
Why are you sounding so old and wistful?

70
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,530
Am I?

71
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,650
I just feel like

72
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,020
these days

73
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,280
have dragged on for what feels like decades.

74
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,530
Good times will come after hardships.

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,400
You've been through so much.

76
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,370
What comes next should be your time to enjoy life.

77
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,080
Let's hope so.

78
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,430
Where is everyone?

79
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,710
They've gone off to learn martial arts.

80
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,070
They all want to be your juniors.

81
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,610
What do you mean?

82
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,060
Aren't you planning to take a master?

83
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,440
They went ahead of you.

84
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,310
By now, they might have already become your seniors.

85
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,180
They wouldn't dare.

86
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,760
Where are they?

87
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,870
I was ordered to wait here for you.

88
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,870
Ordered?

89
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,240
By whom?

90
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,970
Some old weirdos

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
want to take me as a disciple too.

92
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,890
Well then,

93
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,070
looks like you can't escape now.

94
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Raise your butt, you'll get smacked.

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,400
Lift your head, you'll get smacked.

96
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,720
Climb too slow, you'll get smacked.

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,230
Brother,

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,180
this method isn't bad.

99
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,890
It's time to toughen up these cowards.

100
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,720
Who would've thought, after a lifetime of brilliance,

101
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,570
my Heaven-Destroying Formation would only

102
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,670
be good for swatting flies and mosquitoes?

103
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,650
-I'm so tired.
-I'm dead tired.

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,159
I've been dead for ages.

105
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,310
I'm practically a thousand-year-old zombie now.

106
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,580
If Mom finds out about this,

107
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,080
she'll roll around on the floor in despair again.

108
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,550
I've been rolling all day already.

109
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,390
Well then, let's roll together now.

110
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,650
You guys roll. I can't roll anymore.

111
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm out of strength.

112
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,810
Too exhausted to roll.

113
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,560
Yeah.

114
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,200
At least we can still gather half a band.

115
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,750
As long as we can play, it's fine.

116
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,810
Let's practice seriously.

117
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,920
Alright.

118
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,480
It's a good thing you have someone by your side

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,650
who doesn't look down on you.

120
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,660
And you

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
shouldn't laugh at others when you're only marginally better yourself.

122
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,570
Still, you're kind of interesting.

123
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,360
You held a sword

124
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,060
and kept swinging it at us,

125
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,090
but in the end, you turned it on yourself.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,410
Yeah.

127
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,410
Isn't that what everyone expected?

128
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,809
To be able to swing a sword wildly at yourself,

129
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,080
I have to admit, that's impressive.

130
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,070
I'll help you ascend to the throne.

131
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,630
As a turtle king?

132
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,390
I think I lack the aura of a turtle king.

133
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,630
You seem to have it, though.

134
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,820
Don't drag me into this.

135
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,210
Once this is all over,

136
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,760
I'll be leaving.

137
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,610
You know the kind of life I really want.

138
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,770
And what about the person

139
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,530
who doesn't look down on you?

140
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,890
After this battle,

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,010
I've reexamined my biases against her.

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,170
Gao Yin has no ulterior motives.

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,210
She's a pure and devoted healer.

144
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,710
What a peculiar pair of deities.

145
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,890
But I can't help feeling

146
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,660
she'd make a good empress.

147
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,680
Stop right there.

148
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,410
I'll retreat to the mountains,

149
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
and she'll probably continue practicing medicine and helping others.

150
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,800
You're not playing mysterious anymore?

151
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,470
I was never mysterious to begin with.

152
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,930
I just disagreed with Young Master Wang

153
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,040
and kept my opinions to myself.

154
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,990
Do you want Young Master Wang to become king?

155
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,980
If there's someone more suitable for the throne,

156
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,120
I'd rather see him happy.

157
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,380
It seems I was wrong before.

158
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,690
You're the one who truly understands love.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,690
If Qing Cai becomes emperor,

160
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,330
what will you do?

161
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
What choice do I have?

162
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,470
I'll just take it one day at a time.

163
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,110
You won't be happy.

164
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,760
Some things

165
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,250
always require someone to compromise.

166
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,550
Besides,

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,660
if he becomes emperor,

168
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,940
he won't be happy either.

169
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,890
They were talking about us just now too.

170
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,300
You're just in time.

171
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,510
We have a new plan

172
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,800
and can discuss it thoroughly now.

173
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,670
With your help,

174
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,310
we'll be even more confident.

175
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,590
Let's go.

176
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,660
If we'd had this Hu Jiao back then,

177
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,600
the Heaven-Destroying Formation wouldn't have had a flaw.

178
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,890
Maybe it wouldn't have been broken.

179
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,760
Yeah,

180
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,870
those disciples died for nothing.

181
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,820
It's also my fault for being greedy

182
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,770
and unwilling to let go of the seventh trap.

183
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,090
I reaped what I sowed.

184
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,570
But now, with Hu Jiao and Hong Hui

185
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,940
at the core,

186
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,880
given time, the Heaven-Destroying Formation

187
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,230
will definitely be stronger than before.

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,410
Jing.

189
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,610
Come here.

190
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,590
Master.

191
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,020
How's the investigation I asked you to do last time?

192
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,150
That thing from last time?

193
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,250
There are all sorts of rumors.

194
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,930
What are they saying?

195
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,740
Wait a second.

196
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,570
You guys, come here!

197
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,090
We're coming!

198
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,330
Stop right there!

199
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,190
What did you find out

200
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,390
about the fight last time?

201
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,550
What I heard was

202
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,990
that a bunch of people were fighting,

203
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,070
and there were guts spilled all over the ground.

204
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,050
Not that!

205
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm asking who started the fight!

206
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,620
No, no, I heard

207
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,300
there were seven of them.

208
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,620
They're bandits.

209
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,620
Bandits?

210
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,550
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

211
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,150
I mean, that's what I heard.

212
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,810
They were killed by a passing hero.

213
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,040
Killed?

214
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,500
How were they killed?

215
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,960
I heard the seven of them were too much for a few people to handle.

216
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,010
Suddenly, a god descended from the heavens

217
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,110
and killed them all.

218
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,470
It wasn't a god. It was a beggar.

219
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,100
Nonsense.

220
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,610
It was clearly a Buddha!

221
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,310
With one palm strike,

222
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,990
he crushed them all.

223
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,850
Alright, enough of this nonsense.

224
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,480
You...

225
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,100
Can't you get any useful information out of this?

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,750
Well, everyone says something different.

227
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,300
I don't know what's true.

228
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,630
That's right.

229
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,300
Yeah, yeah, same here.

230
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,020
What about that storyteller?

231
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,140
That guy?

232
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
We're all familiar with him.

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,300
Yeah, very familiar, very familiar.

234
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,060
Familiar, indeed.

235
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,830
He's just

236
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,840
an old fool

237
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,840
who loves to brag.

238
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,050
That guy's a joke.

239
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,500
We've never taken him seriously.

240
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,450
He talks nonsense all day.

241
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,710
Let me tell you.

242
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,230
I've never, not once,

243
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,430
ever listened to his stories.

244
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,690
Is he a local?

245
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,140
Of course,

246
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,040
he's lived in this town for decades.

247
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,620
As expected, it's someone else's territory.

248
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,660
Nothing ever goes our way here.

249
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,220
Yes.

250
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,000
That's right.

251
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,650
You guys, keep practicing.

252
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,200
-Stop, Hong Hui!
-Alright, alright.

253
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,790
Let's practice.

254
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,590
So your plan

255
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,150
is to have Old Weirdo Ding and Old Devil Ding

256
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,360
serve as Wang Quan's guards

257
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,070
at the Mingyi Manor event?

258
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,290
Why not just

259
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
take them out directly?

260
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,920
Killing a few cornered wild dogs would only

261
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,090
prompt Wang Quan to send new ones in their place.

262
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,240
What do you mean?

263
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,150
Both Old Weirdo Ding and Old Devil Ding

264
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,260
have been poisoned with the help

265
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,220
of Gan Pu and me.

266
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,610
You know about the Mo Clan's Sealing Magic Power, right?

267
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,730
Yes, of course.

268
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,630
It requires ox-hair needles to remain in the body, doesn't it?

269
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,310
If they remove the needles,

270
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,750
wouldn't the technique fail?

271
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,210
That's usually the case.

272
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,260
But Gao Yin gave me a type of poison,

273
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,800
which I applied to my sleeve darts.

274
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,090
When I attacked Old Devil Ding,

275
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,350
he was poisoned.

276
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,490
Even if the needle is removed,

277
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,750
the poison remains in his system.

278
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,640
What about Old Weirdo Ding?

279
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,670
When I was treating Old Weirdo Ding,

280
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,660
I also secretly applied poison

281
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,770
to his acupoints.

282
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,990
Isn't that poison meant to kill people?

283
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,510
More like a pointless, over-the-top poison.

284
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,030
How vulgar.

285
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,870
It's a pretty useless poison, honestly.

286
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,620
I was just researching its effects

287
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,470
and happened to have it with me.

288
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,690
That day,

289
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,450
after seeing the wonders of the Sealing Magic Power,

290
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,970
I had a sudden idea

291
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,540
to poison Old Weirdo Ding

292
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,760
without much thought.

293
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,490
Later, when they told us about this action,

294
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,230
it turned out to be part of our larger plan.

295
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,840
What exactly do you intend this poison to do?

296
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,780
If they use martial arts, it will damage their acupoints.

297
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,940
The extent of the damage

298
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,320
depends on the intensity of their martial arts usage.

299
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,210
Usually, the effect kicks in within 15 minutes.

300
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,500
The acupoints sealed by the Sealing Magic Power are meant to suppress martial arts.

301
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,090
If the acupoints are ruined,

302
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,410
their martial abilities are permanently crippled.

303
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,170
Exactly.

304
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,920
So this poison,

305
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,560
when combined with the Sealing Magic Power,

306
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,310
is perfect for controlling people.

307
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,760
This world is fascinating.

308
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,370
Something seemingly useless, if handled properly,

309
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,640
can become a delicacy.

310
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,060
You've really mastered the art of cooking, haven't you, “Mom”?

311
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,710
Right, Mom?

312
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,920
Mom?

313
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,000
W... What does that mean?

314
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,340
The Buddha says some things are better left unsaid.

315
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,040
You're such a smooth talker.

316
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,970
What about the Heaven-Destroying Formation?

317
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,730
My five delinquent friends

318
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,330
have gone to be disciples of Old Weirdo Ding.

319
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,940
But there're still short by two, aren't there?

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,510
That would surely be Hu Jiao and Hong Hui, right?

321
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,630
You sent them?

322
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,360
No.

323
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,250
Hu Jiao was never one of my people.

324
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,950
Then what's your brother trying to do,

325
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,380
avoiding even you?

326
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
What else could it be?

327
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,580
Why don't you stop him?

328
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,260
How am I supposed to stop someone

329
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,730
on the verge of madness?

330
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,280
It's dog-eat-dog.

331
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,470
And what about Hong Hui?

332
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,640
Is he one of yours?

333
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,950
He went on his own.

334
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,260
Why?

335
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,510
I don't know.

336
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,730
Maybe it's for Hu Jiao.

337
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,240
Or maybe…

338
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,430
Maybe he has another identity.

339
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,930
Another identity?

340
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,290
I've always wondered

341
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,300
why he helps me so willingly and without complaint.

342
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,869
By all logic,

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,510
he should be like Zhang Fang,

344
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,970
distant and indifferent.

345
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,220
That's why, when making this plan,

346
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,010
I deliberately kept it from him.

347
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,080
So, he acted on his own?

348
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,900
Yes.

349
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,710
So whose man is he, then?

350
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,330
I can't figure it out.

351
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,860
If he's just here to spy on me,

352
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,600
it makes no sense.

353
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,010
Especially during my most peaceful and harmonious days,

354
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,380
it's even more illogical

355
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,890
to have someone planted near me.

356
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,530
So now,

357
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,010
your plan

358
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,510
is to control your father and brother,

359
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,980
forcing them to step down?

360
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,860
Yes.

361
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,600
Once they arrive,

362
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,900
we'll place them under house arrest.

363
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,850
When Qing Cai ascends the throne

364
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,390
and the situation stabilizes,

365
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,280
we'll decide what to do next.

366
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,100
Are there any potential complications?

367
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,260
The only variable

368
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,810
is if those two old guys fight back desperately.

369
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,990
Hongxiu,

370
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,730
now's the time

371
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,880
to tell them.

372
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,000
Gao Yin,

373
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,680
what else are you hiding from us?

374
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,410
This is the last thing.

375
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,110
After this, I won't hide anything from you again.

376
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,810
Alright, everyone, today's lesson, using weapons!

377
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,140
Come here!

378
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,740
This way.

379
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,460
Yes, over here. Switch hands!

380
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,490
Switch hands.

381
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,690
Yes, that's right.

382
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,600
Yes.

383
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,840
Honestly, you're so clumsy.

384
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,750
Yes.

385
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,640
Alright.

386
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,960
Practice!

387
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,430
Practice the Eight-Directions Hidden Blade technique for night battles!

388
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,730
Swing it, yes, like that.

389
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,280
Wait, Master.

390
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,470
How are we supposed to practice this?

391
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,260
You're so hopeless.

392
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,790
A few days

393
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,230
won't be enough to learn anything properly.

394
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,850
If they can at least look convincing, that's already good enough.

395
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,410
Everything's been settled.

396
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,630
The General will fully cooperate with us.

397
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,790
That's good.

398
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,020
Now, let's play some music.

399
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,160
Father is recovering quickly.

400
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,450
He asked me to send his regards.

401
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,880
That's good to hear.

402
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,880
So many people are gone now.

403
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,620
As time passed by, they gradually drifted away.

404
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,960
Like the sound of the zither,

405
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,660
people are fleeting too.

406
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,070
Should we go comfort her?

407
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,750
How would we even do that?

408
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,240
Let's take a walk.

409
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,390
Alright.

410
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,380
You've never been on a swing, have you?

411
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,990
How did you know?

412
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,060
It doesn't seem to fit your personality.

413
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,140
That's true.

414
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,290
I don't like the feeling of drifting.

415
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,010
Indeed.

416
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,730
For someone like you,

417
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,080
that must be a challenge.

418
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,890
I'd have to conquer the awkwardness.

419
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,300
Want to give it a try?

420
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,590
Careful.

421
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,080
How does it feel?

422
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,480
Mental strength is often one-sided.

423
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,520
Where ordinary people seem fragile,

424
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,570
they can be strong.

425
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,710
But they might also

426
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,480
treat things

427
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,390
that others find simple as insurmountable.

428
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,770
I know.

429
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,010
On the surface,

430
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,930
we seem very alike.

431
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,340
But

432
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,020
in many ways,

433
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,380
we're polar opposites.

434
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,060
Perhaps.

435
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,140
Indeed,

436
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,930
we both possess an extraordinary calmness.

437
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,850
It's what makes us

438
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,680
seem less approachable.

439
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Relationships between people

440
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,580
are about seeking common ground while respecting differences.

441
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,860
We both need to let go of our obsessions.

442
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,770
Brother,

443
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,500
they're finally getting the hang of it.

444
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,460
Master, do we have to use knives?

445
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,430
Yeah,

446
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,550
can't we not use knives?

447
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,990
If not knives, then what?

448
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,250
Throw stones?

449
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Stones won't work.

450
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,320
How many stones would you even carry?

451
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,300
I say we use hot water.

452
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,670
Hot water?

453
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,290
Hot water.

454
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,110
Are you going to carry your dumpling soup around?

455
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,470
Careful it doesn't get cold,

456
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,820
your customer might ask for a refund.

457
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,330
Good point.

458
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,040
Wait,

459
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,590
we have poison, don't we?

460
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,730
-Oh yeah!
-What poison?

461
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,800
It's a kind of chili.

462
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,590
You mean “Tears of Lovers”?

463
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,880
What nonsense is that?

464
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,800
Nonsense!

465
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,880
Enough with the absurd chatter!

466
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,960
Use knives. Knives! Just use knives.

467
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,540
I'm starving these days.

468
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,920
Starving?

469
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,040
You eat so much.

470
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,410
You're more likely to overeat and die!

471
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,860
Don't make me smack you!

472
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,120
Quick, quick!

473
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,120
I'll hit Hong Hui.

474
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,350
I'll hit Hong Hui.

475
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,510
Form the formation!

476
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,720
Everyone, put your hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you.

477
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,810
You there!

478
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,780
Rotate!

479
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,350
Yes, like that.

480
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,710
Up. Down.

481
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,730
Good.

482
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,590
Up. Down.

483
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,340
You're all hopeless.

484
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,810
Gan Pu,

485
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,550
did you hear that?

486
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,860
The sound of the zither?

487
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,230
Did you hear it?

488
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,420
The zither?

489
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,740
Life.

490
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,360
Did you hear life?

491
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,570
Are you running a fever?

492
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,930
No.

493
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,860
Play your erhu for a moment.

494
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,000
Now did you hear it?

495
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,920
I heard it. The erhu.

496
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,120
What erhu?

497
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,600
That's bowing.

498
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,590
Try mine.

499
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,360
I don't know how to play this one.

500
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,430
Just strum something.

501
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,830
Did you hear it?

502
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:19,850
The sound of the pipa.

503
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,910
No talent.

504
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,510
You're hopeless.

505
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,500
Qing Cai,

506
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,290
mine is a flute.

507
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,820
You can't tell much from it. It's not meant to be plucked.

508
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,320
The one Gao Yin has is for plucking.

509
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,350
Go find her.

510
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,240
You're right.

511
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,870
Did you hear it?

512
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,950
Play it for a moment.

513
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,730
Did you hear anything?

514
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,970
Hear what?

515
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Did you hear anything?

516
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,430
I heard my own inner voice.

517
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,800
Did you?

518
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,840
The Guzheng's heart is my heart.

519
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,590
The Guzheng and I are one.

520
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,670
The sound of the Guzheng is the sound of the heart.

521
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,990
Then listen to my heart's voice.

522
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,310
What did you hear?

523
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,880
Confusion.

524
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,140
Hope.

525
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,740
Longing.

526
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,130
Why didn't I hear any of that?

527
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,610
You'll have to feel it slowly on your own.

528
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,080
Confusion?

529
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,410
Longing?

530
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,700
Look at her.

531
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,790
Do you think

532
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,850
we're going too far with this?

533
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,090
There's no other way.

534
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,440
The way she's been,

535
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,130
it's hard not to worry.

536
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,740
I'm starting to feel scared myself.

537
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,380
It's really pitiful.

538
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,410
Maybe we should go check on her.

539
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,360
I really can't feel at ease seeing her like this.

540
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,990
Aizhen.

541
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,530
Gan Pu.

542
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,370
I've heard my heart's voice.

543
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,530
The Pipa's sound is finally speaking to me.

544
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,350
What did it say to you?

545
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,790
Waiting.

546
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,390
Endless waiting.

547
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,120
We've received word.

548
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,100
Hu Jiao and Hong Hui

549
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,320
have joined the Heaven-Destroying Formation.

550
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,350
All sides have agreed to your proposal as well.

551
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,700
Only two guards will accompany them.

552
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,070
Everything is ready now.

553
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,550
Chunlan, Qiu Ju,

554
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,830
what do you think of Jing?

555
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,610
That kid's pretty cute.

556
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,480
And you?

557
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,610
That Jing is glib-tongued.

558
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,880
I don't like him.

559
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,690
Zhang Fang wasn't wrong when he said it.

560
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,350
People

561
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,580
always tend to like those who aren't suited for them

562
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,670
and whom they can't handle.

563
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,390
When we were kids,

564
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,870
we waited to grow up,

565
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,780
hoping time

566
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,940
would pass quickly.

567
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,790
I counted the days every day.

568
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,160
Yes,

569
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,130
waiting to grow up,

570
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,330
and also to wake up from nightmares.

571
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,410
When we grew up,

572
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,630
we felt the stirrings of love,

573
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,400
and began to yearn for

574
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,040
that dreamlike person

575
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,040
to appear in our lives,

576
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,600
then we would love each other deeply.

577
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,510
Then

578
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,720
we fell in love with someone.

579
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
Even a moment apart

580
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,720
would make us miss them.

581
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,540
Later,

582
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,860
we woke up from the dream

583
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,770
and realized

584
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,640
that the person in the dream

585
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,670
can only live in the dream.

586
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,150
Only live in the dream.

587
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,780
Even dreams become a memory.

588
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,500
“All conditioned phenomena

589
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,900
are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, or a shadow.”

590
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,730
It turns out the best reunion

591
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,890
is to never meet again.

592
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,130
When he becomes emperor,

593
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,810
can we still get along like this?

594
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,780
Can we live as freely

595
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,460
as we do now?

596
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,690
Or

597
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,860
will we have no time to spend together?

598
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,040
Or perhaps…

599
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,870
Perhaps we'll drift further and further apart?

600
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,780
If only life were as it was at first sight.

601
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,860
But perhaps it's better never to have met.

602
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,830
What are you thinking?

603
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,960
Why are you suddenly so clear-headed?

604
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,040
I've always been clear-headed.

605
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,130
I'm just feeling the sound of the Pipa.

606
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,120
Why are you so muddled?

607
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,780
You're not getting a fever, are you?

608
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,200
Me?

609
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,720
Am I running a fever?

610
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,430
No.

611
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,870
Definitely not.

612
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,580
Right?

613
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,590
I'm so tired.

614
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,580
Today's been really exhausting.

615
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,620
It hurts so much.

616
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,760
Hello, Jing's Dad.

617
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,680
Goodbye.

618
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,280
Goodbye.

619
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,100
Dad, what are you doing here?

620
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,270
Just came to see how many of you kids

621
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,850
will make it back alive.

622
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,910
How could anything happen to me?

623
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,830
Your mother hasn't been able to sleep these past few nights.

624
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,840
Sorry, Dad.

625
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,870
You little brat.

626
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,980
You still dare to hide?

627
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:14,930
If I didn't hide,

628
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,580
what if you hit me to death?

629
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,670
I'm your dad.

630
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,430
How could I possibly kill you?

631
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,000
What if you accidentally kill me?

632
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,180
That would be so unfair.

633
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,000
Jing,

634
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,950
stay sharp.

635
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,680
Don't die.

636
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,350
Don't make your mom worry.

637
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,560
The band members are back?

638
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,260
It's the last day.

639
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,380
Go practice the drums.

640
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,810
Who exactly are you?

641
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,760
Who are you?

642
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,640
I'm Hong Hui.

643
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,730
I'm here to catch the ghost of Mingyi Manor.

644
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,510
Ridiculous.

645
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,130
Mingyi Manor is full of people.

646
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,420
Where would there be ghosts?

647
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,070
Whether it's a person or a ghost,

648
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,680
you should know.

649
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,630
I know.

650
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,280
I, Hu Jiao, am incredibly strong

651
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,400
and smart.

652
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,920
I can tell you're strong.

653
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,210
As for being smart,

654
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,720
I haven't seen that yet.

655
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,290
What are you blowing?

656
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,510
I'm blowing...

657
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,410
None of your business.

658
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,530
I see you're just boasting.

659
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,350
I'm boasting?

660
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,520
I'll kill you and leave not a single piece of you intact.

661
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,380
See, starting to boast now.

662
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,070
You? You couldn't even scrub my back properly.

663
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,460
That depends on whether you can handle

664
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,040
my bear claws.

665
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,030
What a fool.

666
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,100
You're a fool.

667
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,300
You're a fool.

668
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,350
You're a fool.

669
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,670
You're a fool.

670
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,610
You're such a big fool.

671
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,160
You're the fool.

672
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,770
You're the fool.

673
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,470
You're the fool.

674
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,300
You're the fool.

675
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:24,810
You're the fool.

676
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,180
No, you're the fool.

677
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,590
You are.

678
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,280
You are.

679
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,190
Stop messing around.

680
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,600
It's tomorrow.

681
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,620
I hope that the days to come

682
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,770
can always be like today.

683
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,760
I wish you can keep pushing me on the swing.

684
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,560
Sit down.

685
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,580
Look at him.

686
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,160
[Royal]

687
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,550
Brother,

688
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,160
what do you think?

689
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,290
Say whatever he wants. I don't care.

690
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,140
I'm telling you,

691
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,150
the Crown Prince has agreed.

692
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,510
Alright.

693
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,330
Don't get too happy too soon.

694
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,580
The Crown Prince still has conditions.

695
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,610
It's fine, any conditions will do.

696
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,310
You help him kill his father,

697
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,070
then seize the throne.

698
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,930
What... What did he say?

699
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,210
He said to kill his father.

700
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,000
Did you hear that clearly? That's the plan.

701
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,940
Do you know the kindness His Majesty has shown us?

702
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,940
No way.

703
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,190
If it weren't for His Majesty back then,

704
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,480
we would have been hunted down and killed by Yinniang.

705
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,330
Yes, yes.

706
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,260
So, what has His Majesty done for you?

707
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,430
Completing this mission is to repay His Majesty's kindness.

708
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,070
This mission is to repay His Majesty.

709
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,100
Yes, yes.

710
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,750
Your mission is to kill the General,

711
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,480
frame Mingyi Manor for it,

712
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,460
and then kill the people of Mingyi Manor, right?

713
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,710
Well, that's not impossible.

714
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,350
This... This can't be done.

715
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,080
No, no.

716
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,710
No, no.

717
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,200
Is the Heaven-Destroying Formation short of people?

718
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,950
You're the only one missing.

719
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,840
-Don't talk nonsense.
-You're the only one missing.

720
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,200
I'm the Crown Prince's person.

721
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,330
But the Crown Prince promised you.

722
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,260
If you do things for him,

723
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,330
then the territory of Mingyi Manor

724
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,530
will be yours.

725
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,160
At that time,

726
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,940
you can establish your own sect.

727
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,690
And,

728
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,210
at that time, I can completely detach from the Crown Prince

729
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,890
and join you instead.

730
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,240
-Good, good.
-Then...

731
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,640
We can establish the greatest sect of the founding country.

732
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,500
Good.

733
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,980
See, it sounds so good.

734
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,930
Come, come.

735
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,980
-Come, come.
-Sit down.

736
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,530
It sounds wonderful.

737
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,590
Great.

738
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,520
[Royal]

739
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,920
Which one is he?

740
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,790
General,

741
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,720
it's the one wearing the mask,

742
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,930
the tall one.

743
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,320
Now let me introduce

744
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,680
the distinguished guests here today.

745
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,930
First, we have His Majesty.

746
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,010
[Music] [Rites]

747
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,370
Please, no need for formalities.

748
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,920
I'm here today with several old friends

749
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,440
to attend this small gathering.

750
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,330
[Music] [Rites]

751
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,870
It's to let everyone relax a bit

752
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,820
and exchange some feelings.

753
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,290
Nonsense.

754
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,170
What kind of exchange of feelings

755
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,610
could cost someone their life?

756
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,890
He's the one who caused all this.

757
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:57,270
He is the true enemy of our Mo Clan.

758
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,610
Don't let him go.

759
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,710
But Wang Yishao...

760
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,150
Next, I'll introduce

761
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,610
Wang Gong, the Crown Prince,

762
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,660
and the future emperor of the Empire.

763
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:22,460
When the Empire prospers, people live in joy and harmony,

764
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,720
so,

765
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,790
let's all enjoy ourselves today.

766
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,530
[Rites]

767
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,260
This person doesn't seem

768
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,050
very well-liked.

769
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,850
He can't compare to Wang Yishao.

770
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,820
Next, I'll introduce this distinguished guest,

771
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,480
the Prime Minister, who manage government affairs of the Empire.

772
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,340
Lastly,

773
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,040
I'll introduce this distinguished guest,

774
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,030
the Empire's highest military commander,

775
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,320
General Han.

776
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,160
The title of general isn't given casually.

777
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,860
I'm just a soldier,

778
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,540
dutiful and responsible,

779
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,540
protecting the Empire's safety,

780
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,080
never sparing any enemies.

781
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,370
Young Master Wang is highly skilled

782
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,450
in the six arts of a gentleman.

783
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,290
Today,

784
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,310
Young Master Wang and his friends

785
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,570
are using this manor

786
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,680
to present a performance for us fellow citizens.

787
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,000
I won't say anything more.

788
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,290
Please welcome Young Master Wang.
