[Music] [Rites]

4
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,790
Let's begin.

5
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,490
That's amazing!

6
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,660
Is that brat who looks like a thief your disciple?

7
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,070
The guy who's trying to attitudinize among them

8
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,680
is your fellow disciple, isn't he?

9
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,160
Yes.

10
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,650
Is that brat who has filled the post without real qualifications

11
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,750
your fellow disciple?

12
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,290
Isn't that brat who is faking it among them

13
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,910
too conspicuous?

14
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,290
He still needs to be serious even though he's faking it.

15
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,800
General, it doesn't matter if it's true or not.

16
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,770
What's important is that they think it's true.

17
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,980
Then it's just true.

18
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,550
These twists and turns

19
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
are really annoying.

20
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,740
That brat is playing the instrument well.

21
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,470
He isn't even hitting the hammer successfully.

22
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,770
How can he play the instrument?

23
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,190
Of course.

24
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,330
Those people with high levels

25
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,720
can still play music without instruments.

26
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,180
You're just a rough guy.

27
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,200
You don't know music at all.

28
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,050
Stop embarrassing yourself.

29
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,950
He's so handsome!

30
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,220
Second Prince, Doctor Gao.

31
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,480
How come you're here?

32
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm here to tell you two things.

33
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,510
Firstly,

34
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
The Sealing Magic Power which has hurt you two

35
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,230
hasn't been completely removed yet.

36
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,520
That's right.

37
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,910
When I checked your acupoints,

38
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,920
I just thought that it was very strange,

39
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,730
but I couldn't figure it out at that time.

40
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,250
Later, I met those two people with Young Master Wang.

41
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,910
Only then did I find that this was a poison without toxins.

42
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,580
A poison without toxins?

43
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,909
This poison is actually a kind of medicine.

44
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,270
It's used to stimulate the potential of one's body.

45
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,710
But if it's used on a wounded acupoint,

46
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,720
once the acupoint is used,

47
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,470
it may damage the acupoint.

48
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,130
So our acupoints are poisoned too?

49
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,030
And our martial arts skills no longer exist now?

50
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,640
You are also good at using poison.

51
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,090
If it was really poison,

52
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,510
it might have been removed long ago.

53
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,690
As for the poison without toxins,

54
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,510
maybe we can only use medical treatment to remove it.

55
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,510
As long as you can help us remove this poison,

56
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,830
we'll be there whenever you need anything.

57
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,780
That's the second thing I want to tell you.

58
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,210
When we go to Mingyi Manor,

59
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,770
I don't want my father and elder brother

60
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,700
to get hurt.

61
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,310
Well...

62
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,500
I won't dare to do that.

63
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,720
I know that my elder brother

64
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,220
has offered you better conditions.

65
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,600
But he's going crazy now.

66
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,690
Even if he becomes the Emperor,

67
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,330
how long can he remain on the throne?

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Then can the promise which he has made to you

69
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,810
really be realized?

70
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,270
So, Second Prince, is it a deal that

71
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,540
you'll help us remove the poison?

72
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,510
I didn't take a penny.

73
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,150
That's right.

74
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,760
If you can't do it,

75
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,970
you might be killed.

76
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,710
Do you know how many people you have offended?

77
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,050
At least, Mingyi Manor and the General

78
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,180
won't let you off, right?

79
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,700
Your enemies all thought that you were dead.

80
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
Plus, someone has been protecting you.

81
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,070
That's why you've survived until today.

82
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,550
If the person who protects you is also gone now,

83
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,170
I don't need to

84
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,930
tell you the consequences, right?

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,830
So you mean

86
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,830
my brother and I can't even go back to the Mingyi Mountain?

87
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,930
If you don't use your martial arts skills for a long time,

88
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,810
you'll be fine.

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,340
Yinniang is dead.

90
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,450
Even if something unexpected happens,

91
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,760
as long as you two collaborate,

92
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
who can make you stay?

93
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,260
What other choices can we have?

94
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,210
You have no other choices.

and then kill the General.

100

In the end,

101
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,679
I'll have to kill all the people from Mingyi Manor.

102
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,200
How do you know that?

103
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,210
I work for the Crown Prince.

104
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,950
I brought his order here.

105
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,130
You're bragging.

106
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,110
You're bragging so exaggeratedly that I was like flying in the sky.

107
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,550
Aren't you just a pig?

108
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,760
Bragging so exaggeratedly that the pig was like flying in the sky.

109
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,110
A flying pig?

110
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,270
All your family members are pigs.

111
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,870
I'll kill you!

112
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,360
Stop!

113
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,440
Do you know who His Majesty wants to kill?

114
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,650
-Who is it?
-I've never heard of it.

115
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,280
Vegetables.

116
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,630
Let me tell you.

117
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,290
Vegetable is the son of the late Emperor.

118
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,620
He's the legitimate heir to the throne.

119
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,450
Now he is the Emperor's and the Prince's biggest enemy.

120
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,270
So,

121
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,710
they must kill Vegetable.

122
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,680
He wants to kill our boss?

123
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,540
That's not okay!

124
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,770
I'll fight against him till the end!

125
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,590

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,190
Yes, yes, yes.

How about we

Do you guys

138
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,310
really want your boss to die?

139
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,830
No, we don't.

140
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,390
-No. No.
-No, we don't.

141
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,830
Of course not.

But I just can't make him two catties of sweet dumplings

143

so that he'll be stuffed to death.

144
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,470
That's right.

145
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,760
I just can't ask my mother to come here

146

to frame them to death.

147
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,030
I just can't ask my father to come here to kill them

148
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,150
by telling stories.

149
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:57,910
That's right.

150
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,790
I just can't kill them by sitting on them with you.

151
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,590
That's right.

152
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,550
I just can't go home to take the Iron Egg to kill them with it.

153

If I still let you stay alive,

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,040
maybe you will depose me at any time.

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,830
You think you can do that?

187
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,760
General.

188
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,030
You think you can kill everyone here?

189
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,820
Dream on!

190
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,130
For a fool like you,

191
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,530
Wang Quan was so blind as to let you be the Crown Prince.

192
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,990
So such an important figure died just like that?

193
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,530
What's wrong with him?

194
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,640
I guess he's Wang Quan's man.

195
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,920
Oh no!

196
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,200
The Crown Prince has gone crazy.

197
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,490
He has thought that our Heaven-Destroying Formation

198
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,800
is still as good as before.

199
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,760
Now the Second Prince won't help us, either.

200
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,320
Well... Let's escape now.

201
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,470
How can we escape? If we escape now,

202
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,940
we'll offend everyone.

203
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,840
Do you know that?

204
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,610
Now we have to join a faction to survive.

205
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,430
Second Prince, I didn't kill your father.

206
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,140
Don't... Don't blame us.

207
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,130
Old Weirdo Ding.

208
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,260
How dare you collude with my brother?

209
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,440
No, no.

210
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,140
Do you think my brother will let you off?

211
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,280
No, Your Highness.

212
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,980
It... It was him who came to see me.

213
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,280
I... I... I...

214
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,100
Don't misunderstand.

215
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,190
Yishao.

216
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,710
Were you trying to stop me?

217
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,620
You're not able to do that now.

218
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,810
You didn't expect me to do it myself, did you?

219
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,990
Do you know why I did it?

220
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,840
Because you guys don't understand me.

221
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,620
No one in this world understands me!

222
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,010
Do you know who I am?

223
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,760
I was Emperor Taizong in my previous life.

224
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
And before that, I was the First Emperor.

225
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,510
Actually, I'm the reincarnation of the Jade Emperor!

226
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,280
I came to the mortal world to do great things!

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,080
But our father didn't

228
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,060
understand it at all.

229
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,350
He stopped me from achieving the great cause,

230
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,160
so he must die!

231
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,110
You must be the son of the late Emperor.

232
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,480
I think we are cousins.

233
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,510
But you can't stay alive, either.

234
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,620
Because you've also stopped

235
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,660
a great man from making achievements.

236
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,050
Old Weirdo Ding.

237
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,400
Help me kill my cousin first!

238
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,120
Father.

239
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,540
Father.

240
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,780
Don't worry about this matter.

241
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,790
We can handle it.

242
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,280
What should we do? Is it too late to escape now?

243
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,080
Stop thinking about it.

244
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,380
If we can abduct the son of the late Emperor,

245
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,000
then we can use him as a bargaining chip.

246
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,000
At least, we can escape out of here.

247
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,250
Let's go!

248
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,340
Come on. I'll get even with you thoroughly today.

249
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,380
Attack them!

250
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,680
Now you know I didn't lie to you, right?

251
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,240
What are you going to do now?

252
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,690
Let's fight together for our boss!

253
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,940
-Let's fight together!
-Let's fight together!

254
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,850
-Let's fight together!
-Let's fight together!

255
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,770
-Let's fight together!
-Let's fight together!

256
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,530
Let's fight together!

257
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,350
Start the formation!

258
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,750
What are you doing? It's been so long, but all you can do is shouting.

259
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,920
Up, up, down, down.

260
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,070
Up, up, down, down.

261
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,460
Ask them to attack!

262
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,980
-I'll ask them to attack.
-Attack!

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,930
Attack!

264
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,950
Up, up, down, down.

265
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,040
You're walking in the opposite direction.

266
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,560
The direction is wrong.

267
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,100
But now I can't control the direction at all.

268
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,860
I think you want to rebel, right?

269
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,330
What are you guys doing? Why are you so cowardly?

270
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,210
Are you a man or not? Go attack them now!

271
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,940
-Yes, I am.
-Yes.

272
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,480
Do you want to be a loser forever?

273
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,180
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

274
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,260
So,

275
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,040
think about whom you hate the most.

276
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,710
Think!

277
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,960
The person I hate the most.

278
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,530
Hu Jiao is so silly.

279
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,100
All the hooligans are our men.

280
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,490
How can she control the direction?

281
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,750
She's doing it on purpose.

282
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,060
She wants to attack the Crown Prince.

283
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,140
I know whom I hate the most!

284
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,370
I hate Tiedan the most.

285
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,810
I've hated him for a long time.

286
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,280
I'll slash him to death!

287
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,660
I can't believe that Si wants to slash me.

288
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,570
If he slashes me, I'll slash Si to death, too.

289
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,870
I'll slash Si to death, too.

290
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,570
He took three coins from me last time.

291
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,430
I... I'll just regard him

292
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,850
as those who eat without paying.

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
I... I...

294
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,030
Alright. Show me your momentum.

295
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,870
Did you hear that?

296
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,800
-Okay!
-Okay!

297
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,770
So this is the famous Heaven-Destroying Formation?

298
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,250
This thing could kill Crazy Taoist?

299
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,340
This is just a shit formation!

300
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,010
You're the shit one!

301
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,960
That's right. You're that shit guy!

302
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,360
Yes, you're just a shit egg!

303
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,660
You're just a shit sweet dumpling!

304
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,180
You're just a shit meat ball!

305
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,340
How dare your disciples insult me?

306
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,620
How dare they insult me?

307
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,790
What's wrong with you guys?

308
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,310
He... He insulted us first.

309
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,330
You taught us that, Master.

310
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
If someone insults us first, we should insult him, too.

311
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,860
Yes, yes.

312
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,240
When did I teach you to insult others?

313
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,510
Didn't you teach us that every day?

314
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,170
I'll stab you to death!

315
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
It's to insult his mother!

316
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,830
That's right. You insulted us like this every day.

317
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll stab you to death! I'll stab you to death!

318
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,490
Do you guys really want to rebel?

319
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
When did I teach you that?

320
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,890
You also said that the Prince was a bad guy.

321
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,730
You said you would kill him if there was a chance.

322
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,930
-Yes. You would kill him.
-You would kill him.

323
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,920
Since you guys want me to die, I'll beat you to death!

324
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,450
I...

325
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,720
So this is why you've colluded with each other?

326
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,130
You want to help him ascend the throne!

327
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,030
What benefits did he promise to give you?

328
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,720
No!

329
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,600
He... He lied to you.

330
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,480
How do you prove that?

331
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
No!

332
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,520
-He... He framed me!
-Wang Gong.

333
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,590
Shut up!

334
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,020
You're asking me to shut up?

335
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,320
Alright.

336
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,870
My dear brother.

337
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,250
You're finally venting your anger on me.

338
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,430
Do you think that

339
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,050
you gave the position

340
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,900
of Crown Prince to me?

341
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,050
You're crazy.

342
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,860
You're completely crazy.

343
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,410
Do you know whom you've killed?

344
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,550
He is our father.

345
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,780
I wanted to let you stay alive.

346
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,760
But all of you lost your minds for power.

347
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,270
I...

348
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm heartbroken.

349
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,260
Letting me stay alive?

350
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,610
So you want to kill me now?

351
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,300
If I can't ascend the throne,

352
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,560
I won't be able to control my own life.

353
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,400
With my current position,

354
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,450
I'll die if I have no power!

355
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,270
My dear brother.

356
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,490
You're too naive.

357
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,150
Old Weirdo Ding! What are you waiting for?

358
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,710
Ask them to attack!

359
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,350
Kill them!

360
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,470
How dare you!

361
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,880
Kill them!

362
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,830
Wang Yishao.

363
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,520
Step aside!

364
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,860
You... You bastards!

365
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,850
I don't think you walked in the opposite direction.

366
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,660

My mission was not to keep an eye on him,

426

431

he asked me to report your situation regularly.

huge emotional trauma.

Wang Gong's situation

460
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,060
resulted from the fact that

461
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,920
his desire was much bigger than his own ability.

462
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,100
That was why he hypnotized himself like that

463
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,750
to quell his own desire

464
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,140
so that he would think he could do anything.

465
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,110
That was why he did all these things

466

to hurt himself and the people around him.

what would happen?

476
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,070
He would become a tyrant.

477
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,930
But he would be surrounded by

478

a group of villains who eulogize his virtues and achievements.

479
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,080
He would only listen to them and do things that go against the proper trend.

480

That would be a disaster.

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,280
Which side are you on?

552
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,450
Why did you try to deal with Wang Gong?

553
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,100
She's one of us.

554
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,520
We dispatched her to be a spy around Wang Gong.

555
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,180
Do you think you could live long

556
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,210
without my cover?

557
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,520
You also found out about my secret?

558
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,760
I carried you all the way.

559
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,870
I touched every part of your body.

560
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,000
It was not easy for you to stay here for so long.

561
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,890
I... I...

562
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,390
So after you knew that I was a man,

563
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,140
you also figured out my real identity?

564
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,500
I didn't know.

565
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,540
However,

566
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,860
only by covering a person whose identity is unknown

567
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,410
can I gain benefits during disturbances.

568
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,850
In fact, she's just an idle chesspiece of ours.

569
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,830
I didn't expect her to be sent to Mingyi Manor.

570
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,310
Usually, she didn't need to

571
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,830
keep us updated on the situations.

572
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,200
She could play it by ear anytime.

573
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,910
You're awesome.

574
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
You fooled all of us.

575
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,530
Actually, you figured out my identity a long time ago, didn't you?

576
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,450
I just thought it was very strange.

577
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,570
Every time I had a problem, why did you always

578
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,590
do something foolish to help me out?

579
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,540
It's good that you know it.

580
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,720
Second Prince.

581
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,540
Both your father and brother are dead.

582
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,330
Now you have to take up the responsibility to lead us.

583
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:57,930
Father.

584
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,990
Wang Yishao doesn't like these things.

585
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,960
Don't force him to do it.

586
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,970
Just kill Gao Xian!

587
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,060
What do you mean?

588
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,910
All the people who deserve to die are dead, aren't they?

589
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,180
Why do you still want to kill him?

590
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,070
Gao Xian was Wang Quan's follower and helped him do evil things.

591
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,020
Today, I'm going to kill this bad guy for the people.

592
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,800
He helped him do evil things.

593
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,190
In that case,

594
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,640
shouldn't we kill you too?

595
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,720
Nonsense!

596
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,700
I'm a member of the Mo Clan.

597
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,050
So she's Gan Pu whom you've mentioned?

598
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,640
Are you playing dumb on purpose?

599
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,700
Isn't she always standing by Qing Cai's side?

600
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,800
Who else could she be if she weren't Gan Pu?

601
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,570
Qing Cai is his alias.

602
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,410
That isn't his name anymore.

603
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,130
His surname is Wang.

604
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,180
His surname can be whatever he wants.

605
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,630
I'm used to calling him that name anyway.

606
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,260
I'll just call him that name from now on.

607
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,250
How dare you talk to me like that?

608
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,480
[Rites]

609
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,670
If you continue to kill people,

610
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,620
then I'll have to change my stance.

611
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,810
What's the attitude of your Mingyi Manor?

612
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,510
We only provide the stage here.

613
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,909
You guys are the ones to perform.

614
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,830
As death warriors,

615
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,790
you know what to do, right?

616
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,469
Father.

617
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,530
Gan Pu, how dare you hurt my father?

618
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,590
He slaughtered the members of our clan.

619
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,570
I want him to pay the price with his blood today.

620
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,040
So you're going to kill me too?

621
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,000
If you continue to kill people, I'll kill you.

622
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,600
Alright.

623
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,850
You are really my good nephew.

624
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,130
Gan Pu.

625
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,370
You're so cruel.

626
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,280
Silly girl.

627
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,120
She saved me.

628
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,350
What do you mean?

629
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,850
Why do you think of hurting you as saving you?

630
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,680
If Gan Pu hadn't tried to kill Han Zhong,

631
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,380
would Han Zhong really kill Gao Xian?

632
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,590
I don't think so.

633
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,160
So,

634
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,050
if a death warrior doesn't carry out the order,

635
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,960
what will be the consequence?

636
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,540
He... He'll have to commit suicide?

637
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,620
Father.

638
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,400
I'm sorry.

639
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,680
I wrongly blamed you again.

640
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,660
Not really.

641
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,860
Father.

642
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,170
Aren't you very smart?

643
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,440
You deceived us all.

644
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,060
I'm actually not smart.

645
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,440
I've even been playing dumb.

646
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,750
Of course, I'm getting more and more stupid.

647
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,630
Only truly smart people would say that they are stupid.

648
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,070
You always pretended to be smart previously,

649
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,010
so you deceived us all.

650
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,750
You made all of us think that you were truly stupid.

651
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,230
Alright. I give up.

652
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,510
My good nephew.

653
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,480
You can ascend the throne.

654
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,630
Wait. Wait.

655
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
Well, Han Yi,

656
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,930
you're quite ridiculous.

657
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,680
A man claims to be the Prince.

658
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,610
And you even want him to inherit the throne

659
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,210
and be your puppet.

660
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,270
Do you think only by doing this

661
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,770
can you control the imperial court?

662
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,330
You saw that, didn't you?

663
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,700
With Gao Xian's ability to confuse right and wrong,

664
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,650
he's really something.

665
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,000
You want to negotiate, right?

666
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,870
Good for you.

667
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,230
It looks like you won't be easily controlled by Han Yi.

668
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,450
We can negotiate with each other properly.

669
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,400
Let's be straightforward. What's the condition?

670
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,290
Okay.

671
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,160
My condition is that

672
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,950
Han Yi should resign,

673
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,000
and then we'll choose a new General.

674
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,630
Secondly,

675
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,710
the Emperor is just the owner of the Empire.

676
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,420
But the decision-making rights of all important and trivial matters

677
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,930
should be given to the Prime Minister.

678
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,920
You're trying to turn me into your puppet, aren't you?

679
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,870
Gao Xian.

680
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,240
What you said is sheer nonsense.

681
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,500
So what?

682
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,580
If you don't agree to my terms,

683
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,490
I won't acknowledge him as the new Emperor.

684
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,390
Even though I have this Ancestral Imperial Seal,

685
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,400
will you still refuse to acknowledge it?

686
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,360
Wang Quan didn't have this.

687
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,250
So he was just the acting Emperor.

688
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,380
I've been keeping this seal for him.

689
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,480
I gave it to him just now.

690
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,660
The Imperial Seal is real.

691
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,560
But this person's

692
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,700
identity might not be real.

693
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,330
In our Empire, both the seal and the real identity are essential.

694
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,160
Well...

695
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,840
You two are all alone now.

696
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,260
Gao Xian.

697
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,430
How dare you talk nonsense!

698
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,880
I'm going to beat you up today!

699
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,630
Help!

700
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,320
Stop right there!

701
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,910
Please spare my life!

702
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,670
-Please spare my life!
-Stop!

703
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,710
Stop!

704
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,360
Why do you not care about me now?

705
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,300
I'll beat you up!

706
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,040
Well, Han Yi, stop right there!

707
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,090
-Don't go too far!
-I'll beat you up!

708
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,170
Why is he chasing him like that?

709
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,210
Han Yi, stop right there!

710
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,190
If you dare to hit me,

711
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,140
my daughter and son-in-law won't let you off!

712
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,550
So what if I hit you?

713
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,690
Stop right there!

714
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,500
Don't come over!

715
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,780
Greetings, Mr. Shang Shan.

716
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,150
Greetings, Mr. Shang Shan.

717
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,850
This old man

718
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,880
is really not a good guy.

719
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,960
He has tricked so many people.

720
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,560
As high-ranking and powerful officials,

721
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,470
you two are jumping up and down.

722
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,830
Don't you feel ashamed?

723
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,200
If a man is resourceful without good morality

724
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,390
and works for a ruler who is not wise,

725
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,020
he'll probably make great achievements.

726
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,790
But in the end,

727
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,410
he'll still become a clown.

728
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,940
Gao Xian.

729
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,400
Now that you've become like this,

730
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,880
it has something to do with Wang Quan.

731
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,000
Can't you understand it now?

732
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,090
Han Yi.

733
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,660
You're a man with blind allegiance and blind filial piety.

734
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,820
You don't think about the big picture.

735
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,560
Eventually, you will

736
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,160
be used by others.

737
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,070
Hearing Mr. Shang Shan's words,

738
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,690
I'm enlightened,

739
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,420
just like waking up from a dream.

740
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,650
Thinking about what I did before,

741
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,860
I realize I've made mistakes and I feel so ashamed.

742
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,560
Let's go.

743
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,550
I'd like to

744
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,110
sincerely apologize to the Prince.

745
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,260
Alright.

746
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,140
You old man!

747
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,430
I finally caught you.

748
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,730
Tell me.

749
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,130
Why are you so capable?

750
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,890
How come you managed to calm everyone down so easily?

751
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,420
Stop... Stop it. Stop it.

752
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,480
Give me some dignity.

753
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,100
My face is very valuable.

754
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,570
How dare you blame me?

755
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,940
You pretended to be missing,

756
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,350
and I haven't got even with you yet.

757
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,690
Well... Well...

758
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,210
I think at this moment, we should

759
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,570
talk about inheriting the throne, right?

760
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:15,930
Right?

761
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,810
I'm willing to support this...

762
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,380
Wang Lvdou.

763
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,130
I gave him that name.

764
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,990
He's also my student.

765
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,210
Wang Lvdou?

766
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,200
It turns out that his mother was also your student.

767
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,510
This late Empress was gentle and virtuous.

768
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,430
She was highly respected by the people.

769
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,450
If she were still alive,

770
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,680
our Empire

771
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,740
wouldn't have encountered so many problems.

772
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,350
She's my sister.

773
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,530
Of course.

774
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,100
You're not as good as her.

775
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,760
Alright.

776
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,200
Since you all have no objections,

777
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,740
I think we can decide on the date

778
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,910
to ascend the throne.

779
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,620
Why don't we just do it today?

780
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,170
I think we can finish the ceremony

781
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,510
at this moment in this place.

782
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,580
Isn't it too hasty?

783
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,220
That's right.

784
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,350
This is an important event for our Empire.

785
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,080
Sir.

786
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,900
You have to support me.

787
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,720
Have you made up your mind?

788
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,360
Yes.

789
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,370
Your temperament is quite like your teacher's.

790
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,940
Stop boasting about yourself.

791
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,740
Today,

792
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,120
this moment is the auspicious time.

793
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,790
That's good.

794
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,350
Our Mingyi Manor can also

795
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,130
borrow the good luck of the new Emperor ascending the throne.

796
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,880
Uncle,

797
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,280
now you can resign from your position as General, can't you?

798
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,750
I've made up my mind.

799
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,490
With my moral character,

800
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,080
I'm not suitable to be the General indeed.

801
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,560
I'll abdicate.

802
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,170
Alright.

803
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,590
The ceremony is over.

804
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,260
I've inherited the throne.

805
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,050
Greetings, Your Majesty.

806
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,230
How come they look as if they were playing make-believe?

807
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,430
Why does it feel so weird?

808
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,850
That's right.

809
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,540
They're just playing make-believe.

810
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,660
So what if that's a throne?

811
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,620
It's just a title.

812
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,780
If they had held a grand ceremony...

813
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,260
His Majesty...

814
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,000
It would only make the people think that

815
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,730
he was trying to show his prestige as the new Emperor.

816
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,040
Young Master Wang!

817
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,090
Where are you going?

818
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,190
You're not quite respectful to me,

819
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,030
who is the new Emperor, are you?

820
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,140
I...

821
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,290
I... I need to pee.

822
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,620
Okay.

823
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,890
Now I'd like to announce that

824
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,350
I'm going to give my throne to Wang Yishao.

825
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,770
He will be the new Emperor.

826
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,550
How can you be so childish?

827
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:43,600
That's right.

828
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,510
Wang Yishao is a man of integrity and talent.

829
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,740
He will be a good Emperor.

830
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,350
He's giving it to him just like that.

831
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,360
Heaven-Destroying Formation!

832
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,350
Stop him!

833
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,050
Stop!

834
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:54,780
Where are you going?

835
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,840
If he dares to run away,

836
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,110
blind him with Lover's Tears.

837
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,940
There are no bandits like you in the world.

838
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,450
How can you force me to be the Emperor?

839
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,590
To deal with a young master like you,

840
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,550
we just need to use this kind of banditry.

841
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,750
Change the formation!

842
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,940
Think about it. If I become the Emperor,

843
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,390
will Gan Pu be happy?

844
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,080
No, I won't.

845
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,360
As a great hooligan in the Martial Arts World, I won't be happy, either.

846
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,790
Neither of us will be happy.

847
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,370
Don't you think you're a little selfish?

848
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,590
You're the selfish one.

849
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,280
I know you won't be happy as the Emperor.

850
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,460
But as you know,

851
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,120
I also won't be happy if I become the Emperor.

852
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,750
But you'll be the only one who is unhappy.

853
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,660
Gao Yin will be very happy.

854
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,760
Think about it.

855
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,930
Sacrificing a person

856
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,440
can make another person happy.

857
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,700
As for me, if I sacrifice myself,

858
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,980
the other person won't be happy, either.

859
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,310
Neither of us will be happy.

860
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,510
So don't you think

861
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,590
you should be considerate towards others?

862
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,470
But this is your throne actually.

863
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,950
This is your responsibility.

864
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:00,990
Who said that?

865
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,750
Your father was also an Emperor.

866
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,960
You are my cousin.

867
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,020
You also have the responsibility.

868
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,110
Isn't it justifiable that

869
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,670
I'll pass the position on to you?

870
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,940
Nonsense!

871
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,320
I'm not your son.

872
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,750
How could I have such a responsibility?

873
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,240
Why do you think it's justifiable?

874
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,310
You can be my son if you want.

875
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,730
Kowtow to me now.

876
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,630
You are so irresponsible.

877
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,710
It's such an important object.

878
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,030
How could you throw it to the ground so casually?

879
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:49,790

00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,940
♫Our sweetness♫

919
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,870
♫Drizzling spring rain nourishes the soul♫

920
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,900
♫My Flower Sea is full of longing for you♫

921
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,470
You...

922
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,610
♫No need for sweet words♫

923
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,710
♫Let's sing the song of slow time♫

924
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,770
You're quite handsome today.

925
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,420
♫If we stay with each other, it won't be that hard to fall asleep again♫

926
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,590
♫A shooting star streaks across the sky♫

927
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,220
♫I've got answers for my praying♫

928
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,240
Why isn't he here?

929
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,700
♫I wish to pluck♫

930
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,880
♫The moon in the sky♫

931
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,400
What are you looking for?

932
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,710
♫I'm willing to change for you♫

933
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,100
Nothing.

934
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,810
♫Softly, softly whispering♫

935
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,750
♫You're by my side♫

936
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,380
♫Heart to heart, in unison♫

937
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,790
♫Forever intertwined♫

938
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,680
♫Memories swing gently like a hammock in my mind♫

939
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,530
♫Echoing between you and me, you and me♫

940
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,420
♫The sun rises, and the sun sets again♫

941
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,520
♫The moon wanes and then waxes again♫

942
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,180
People always like to hear beautiful lies.

943
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,900
♫The time passed again♫

944
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,380
♫Only you haven't changed♫

945
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,940
They don't want to accept the cruel reality.

946
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,320
♫Let's compose a poem that will never get old-fashioned♫

947
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,490
Who would want to live in nightmares forever?

948
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,210
♫Protecting the things that only belong to us♫

949
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,240
♫Our sweetness♫

950
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,920
Dear audience,

951
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,400
do you think that Qing Cai and Gan Pu

952
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,610
would live a happy life...

953
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,250
and stop working hard?

954
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,780
However,

955
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,180
things were not that simple.

956
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,290
Brat, don't even think about that.

957
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,690
Focus on

958
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,470
ruling the Empire well.

959
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,000
I know what you want to do.

960
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:06,820
Stop dreaming.

961
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,060
Take good care of yourself.

962
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,420
Do what you should do properly.

963
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,670
I trust you.

964
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,280
I won't participate in your enthronement ceremony.

965
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,230
Let's not see each other again!

966
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,530
You...

967
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,910
Hong Hui!

968
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,480
Wait for me!

969
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,590
What an annoying guy.

970
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,110
Qing Cai.

971
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,390
We have to go, too.

972
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,990
I...

973
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,290
Father, your leg...

974
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,030
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

975
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,330
Who said that?

976
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,560
I've removed Han Zhong's identity as a death warrior.

977
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,680
Now they can leave, too.

978
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,700
Good luck.

979
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,280
Where are you going?

980
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,000
Aizhen is such a silly girl.

981
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,720
She has only known to practice martial arts skills since childhood.

982
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:16,870
She has never been to any other places.

983
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,460
I'm going to take her out for a trip.

984
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,790
I've also made a decision.

985
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,360
You've just ascended the throne.

986
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,390
You must be busy and have no time for me.

987
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,210
I've decided to travel around the Martial Arts World

988
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,300
with your sister and father.

989
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,540
We'll have a trip outside to relieve boredom.

990
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,200
Gan Pu.

991
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,090
You don't have to dissuade me.

992
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,170
I've made up my mind to leave.

993
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,230
Alright. I respect your choice.

994
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,020
Let's go.

995
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,910
I'll take good care of her.

996
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,150
Let's go, Father.

997
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:57,820
Okay.

998
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,360
Where are we going next?

999
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,070
Big Brother.

1000
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,200
-Boss.
-Where's Jing?

1001
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,310
Boss! Boss!

1002
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,240
He... He didn't dare to see you,

1003
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,550
so... so he left first.

1004
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:23,350
That's right.

1005
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,870
We...

1006
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,420
-We have to go now.
-We have to go.

1007
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,540
-We have to go.
-Bye.

1008
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:32,870
Let's go.

1009
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,180
-Let's go!
-Hurry up!

1010
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,050
You guys...

1011
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,320
You...
