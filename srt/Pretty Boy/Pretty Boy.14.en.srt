00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,690
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,570
[Episode 14]

3
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,460
Being too smart makes you look less cute.

4
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,310
I was wrong.

5
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,260
You have a special relationship with him, right?

6
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,470
I can't hide it from you.

7
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,170
To be honest with you,

8
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,329
he is my father.

9
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,210
From how intimate you were,

10
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,810
I already had a rough idea.

11
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,079
I came here to save him.

12
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
Then your relationship with the son of the late Emperor...

13
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,150
We're kind of...

14
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,380
Friends, I guess,

15
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,900
Close friends.

16
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,320
And your father's organization...

17
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,630
I'm not a death warrior.

18
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,580
Normally, father and daughter won't both be death warriors.

19
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,170
I'm the nominal person in charge of this operation.

20
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,610
But, you know...

21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,290
It's already not easy for you to come.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,860
I guess you're kind of like a hostage prince.

23
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,900
You feel that way too?

24
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,560
Your father is on such an important mission.

25
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,920
How can the higher-ups rest assured without a hostage?

26
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,050
It's an extra guarantee, I guess.

27
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,360
I threatened them with my life this time,

28
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,470
or they wouldn't have let me come.

29
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,490
How did you learn about your father's arrest?

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,490
From my master.

31
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,570
I've been isolated in a place since I was little.

32
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,600
Only my master taught me martial arts.

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,329
He treats me like his own daughter.

34
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,810
What about your mother?

35
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,940
I don't know.

36
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,920
My father said

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,990
my mother died due to obstructed labor when giving birth to me.

38
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,310
If that's the case,

39
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,630
you shouldn't know the son of the late Emperor.

40
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,329
I've known him since childhood.

41
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
It's just he didn't know me.

42
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,820
So, do you think the son of the late Emperor will show up?

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,500
I really don't know what he thinks.

44
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,220
And I don't know

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,090
if this place of yours is a trap.

46
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,600
We're showing our sincerity.

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,870
The Martial Arts World is changeable and treacherous.

48
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,320
Who can believe what anyone says?

49
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,570
I don't buy it, that you are showing sincerity.

50
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,040
On the way here,

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,030
you've found out all about me.

52
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,990
Who said she wanted to make friends?

53
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,130
No, I dare not.

54
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,290
That's right.

55
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,140
Our nightwear

56
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,790
was also made here.

57
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,720
He seems afraid of you.

58
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,450
I don't eat people,

59
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,920
nor am I a robber.

60
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,500
Why are you so afraid of me?

61
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,820
Alright, alright.

62
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Look at him.

63
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,010
Don't scare him anymore.

64
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,710
It's not easy for him either.

65
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,220
Tell us yourself,

66
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,670
did I scare you?

67
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,560
When you argued with me over a few pennies last time,

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,540
I ended up giving you more money, didn't I?

69
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,940
Y-Yes.

70
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,690
You're very generous, Miss.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
Young Master Wang, are you checking out new fabrics again?

72
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,450
You want to buy fabrics and make new clothes for me again?

73
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,050
The way you said it

74
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,180
made it sound like I had an ulterior motive.

75
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,620
Let's go check out other stalls.

76
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,670
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,390
Don't be so scared next time.

78
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,710
Is it okay for us to peep like this?

79
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,880
It's okay.

80
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,360
As long as we don't disturb her.

81
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,710
She indeed has profound skills.

82
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,830
As expected from

83
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,380
the famous Madam Mieqing in the Martial Arts World.

84
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,970
What?

85
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,180
Right, we respect her.

86
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,050
But there have been rumors about her in the Martial Arts World,

87
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,860
calling her Madam Mieqing.

88
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,850
People love to spread falsehoods.

89
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,540
So what's the truth about the rumors in the Martial Arts World?

90
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,340
We did a lot of chivalrous things.

91
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,940
But of course, we also killed a lot of people.

92
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,180
So we offended many people.

93
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,380
Yinniang

94
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,070
struggled to support the whole Mingyi Manor alone

95
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,350
to protect us kids.

96
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,370
She struggled to stay alive among various forces in the Martial Arts World.

97
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,950
Besides her mastery of martial arts,

98
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,320
she's actually

99
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,620
just an ordinary woman.

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,480
Maybe you'd think I'm saying this to gain your sympathy,

101
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
but I think everyone

102
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,730
has something to be sympathized with.

103
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,840
You beat my father, didn't you?

104
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,880
I don't sympathize with you.

105
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,530
My father is still imprisoned by you,

106
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,130
so we're still enemies.

107
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,530
Everyone's position is different,

108
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,610
so they naturally have different views.

109
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,770
That's why they kill each other.

110
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,490
Kill each other?

111
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,750
Isn't the fight among people

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,530
just killing each other?

113
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,250
Thank you.

114
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,970
You're so generous today.

115
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
What do you know?

116
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,090
It smells pretty good.

117
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,550
Boss.

118
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,240
I see there're new designs for the sachets.

119
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,809
These sachets seem a bit different.

120
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,179
The original ones had been sold out,

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,500
so I bought new fabrics.

122
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,299
That's why they look different.

123
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,760
I didn't expect your sachets to sell so fast.

124
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,130
It seems people like me who don't know how to do needlework

125
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,420
are not a minority.

126
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,770
Actually,

127
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,130
most girls make sachets themselves.

128
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,480
Few girls would buy these.

129
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,130
They're basically bought by men

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,650
as gifts to women.

131
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,940
Normally, sachets

132
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,430
are tokens of love

133
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,190
girls give to boys.

134
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,780
Why don't you buy me one?

135
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,870
Is that so?

136
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,700
Why are you smiling?

137
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,350
I'm a wanderer.

138
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,390
Isn't it normal that I don't know how to do needlework?

139
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,330
This one looks pretty too.

140
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
What's wrong?

141
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,400
Nothing.

142
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,770
I just feel a bit sad all of a sudden.

143
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,090
You feel a bit sad all of a sudden?

144
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,840
Young Master Wang.

145
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,380
Can't you change your habit of being overly sympathetic?

146
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,230
This is annoying.

147
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,030
Also, don't always

148
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,440
be in a daze, okay?

149
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,580
Where did the dashing and smart you go?

150
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,380
You know what?

151
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,820
Actually,

152
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,420
most people don't like to be pitied.

153
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,880
Even if they're in a plight,

154
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,340
they don't necessarily think it's scary.

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,390
Otherwise, people may collapse at any time.

156
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,060
Do you understand what I mean now that I put it this way?

157
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,180
Maybe I've really become stupid.

158
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,240
I even forgot the simple truth that

159
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,270
showing kindness may cause resentment.

160
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,130
It's okay.

161
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,850
I'm not a very sensitive person.

162
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,660
You don't have to be nervous.

163
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,350
It's not like that.

164
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,640
Sympathy and kindness

165
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,430
should not be shown in the first place.

166
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,670
Otherwise, it would be a show of superiority.

167
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,290
It would cause resentment.

168
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,420
Of course,

169
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,980
I don't mean that towards you.

170
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,350
Me too.

171
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,230
I've never resented you.

172
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,630
Maybe I've been living too comfortably.

173
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,830
When I think of those sufferings,

174
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,390
I feel like I can't bear them.

175
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,880
How should I put it?

176
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,190
As the saying goes, once you've seen the ocean, you can never settle for a pond.

177
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,200
It's always harder

178
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,560
to go from extravagance to frugality.

179
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,020
Actually,

180
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,910
I've never seen anyone who is truly happy.

181
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,980
No matter how high their status is or how rich they are,

182
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,300
they're all actually the same.

183
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,160
People at the bottom of society

184
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,330
suffer more physically,

185
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,180
like enduring hunger,

186
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,700
while rich people

187
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,170
suffer more psychologically.

188
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,120
They also suffer.

189
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,240
People are always like this.

190
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,850
They always seek troubles even when they have no troubles.

191
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,540
I haven't had much contact with very wealthy people.

192
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,310
But after hearing what you said,

193
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,000
I think all beings must be suffering equally.

194
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,300
Wait for me.

195
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,810
[Lover's Tears]

196
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,340
Glutinous rice balls. They are very sweet.

197
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,610
-Delicious skewers.
-Come on.

198
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,600
One penny for a skewer.

199
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,750
It's quite lively here today.

200
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,030
Delicious skewers. Check it out.

201
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,610
Sir, please check this out.

202
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Have a taste.

203

Try my spicy hotpot.

204
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,550
One penny for a skewer.

205
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,360
When I saw this stall a few days ago,

206
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,090
there weren't many people here.

207
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,860
Yes.

208
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,870
I didn't expect

209
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,390
these people to change so much.

210
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,520
Come on, try this. Check it out.

211
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,770
Let's look around.

212
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,030
Didn't those beautiful girls come with you?

213
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,640
They didn't come today.

214
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,530
Gan Pu.

215
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,410
It's almost noon.

216
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,590
Why don't we eat something here?

217
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,260
If you two eat here,

218
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,910
I'll let you have everything you want for free.

219
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,010
All free.

220
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,400
Nonsense. Nonsense.

221
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,920
For free?

222
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,720
It's a must.

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,480
They made great contributions

224
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,630
and brought us a lot of business.

225
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,980
It's all thanks to them.

226
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,880
Really?

227
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,120
So they were the ones dressed weirdly that day?

228
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,350
But they aren't wear those clothes today.

229
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,380
Are we still letting them eat for free?

230
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,700
Why are you as petty as your mom?

231
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,460
But...

232
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,610
Don't we have the same mother?

233
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm as generous as my father.

234
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,590
Beat him.

235
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,850
Alright. Alright.

236
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,830
We'll have the regular version.

237
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,190
Lover's Tears is too spicy.

238
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,420
No problem.

239
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,890
But you have to eat Lover's Tears.

240
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,160
Why?

241
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,700
Because you're a man.

242
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,880
Men have to eat Lover's Tears?

243
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,120
Why is that?

244
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,270
No reason.

245
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,610
What do you mean no reason?

246
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,600
So what do you mean no reason?

247
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,310
"No reason" means it's unreasonable.

248
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,830
Isn't that what the ghosts said yesterday?

249
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,510
They are the ghosts!

250
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,280
Don't you understand?

251
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,260
Gan Pu.

252
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,040
I just don't understand.

253
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,050
Where did this unreasonable disaster come from?

254
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,680
Who knows? They're so weird.

255
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,210
Gan Pu, how many skewers do you want?

256
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,520
I'll have three to five.

257
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,750
I can't eat a lot.

258
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,190
Okay.

259
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,290
Please give us ten skewers then.

260
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,420
Are you sure?

261
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,610
What do you mean?

262
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,560
When we give food away for free, there's a rule.

263
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,850
You'll have to finish all ten skewers.

264
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,350
If you can't finish them,

265
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,310
you'll have to shout in the street

266
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,060
that you're not a man.

267
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,990
And you have to do it ten times.

268
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,860
Have I ever offended you?

269
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,610
No, no.

270
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
You are our benefactor.

271
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,980
How could you have offended us?

272
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,050
Benefactor.

273
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,380
You win.

274
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,800
So I fell into your trap.

275
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,480
I'd like to see

276
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,590
what you have up your sleeves.

277
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,330
Come and take a look.

278
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,140
This gentleman here said he'd eat ten skewers

279
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,480
of our Lover's Tears.

280
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,260
If he can't finish them, he'll claim he's not a man.

281
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,910
Please be our witness, fellow villagers.

282
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,610
We'll be witnesses.

283
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,400
We'll be the witnesses.

284
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,450
That's enough. What are you doing?

285
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,800
Don't kill me with your eyes.

286
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,550
Take the challenge if you dare.

287
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,090
Bring it on.

288
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,740
Okay.

289
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,620
There are too many people here.

290
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,230
Let's go over there.

291
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,690
We'll sit over there.

292
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,150
Okay.

Thank you.

What's going on?

You're so smart. Don't you understand?

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,100
I see.

Then add a bit more.

306
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,860
Okay. Okay.

307
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,490
I'll tell them.

308
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,260
Did you hear that?

309
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:16,890
Yes.

310
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,450
Well, which one of them is Boss's woman?

311
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,670
-That one.
-That one.

312
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,070
Isn't that a man?

313
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,430
-It's a woman.
-It's a woman.

314

Lower your voice.

315
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,110
Have you ever seen two men

316
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,780
holding hands on the street?

317
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,780
So Boss is a woman.

318
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,800
-No wonder.
-Boss is a man.

319
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,730

That's a woman.

323
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,010
Why can't I tell she's a woman?

324
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,440
Are you blind?

325
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,060
So is Boss a man or a woman?

326
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,130
A man.

327
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,260
He's just an idiot.

328
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,520
Add more Lover's Tears later.

329
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,160
Okay.

330
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,920
How much more?

331
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,680
Forget it.

332
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,470
Don't worry about it. I'll do it.

333
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,880
Idiot.

How many skewers do you want?

335
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,700
I want five regular ones.

336
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,760
Okay, the two of us will have ten regular skewers.

337
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,700
That's not right.

338
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,990
You can't order regular ones.

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,170
She can order regular ones,

340
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,890
but you must have Lover's Tears.

341
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,619
Lover's Tears? What does that mean?

342
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,380
No, no.

343
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,300
You shouldn't ask me what that means.

344
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,130
You should ask me why.

345
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,640
What why? What do you mean?

346
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,520
That's right. There's no reason.

347
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,290
What's wrong with you?

348
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,650
We're letting those two eat for free,

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,890

Only for regular customers.

354
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,540
Are you selling it or not? If not, we're leaving.

355

Only regular customers can have it for free.

360
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,720
That's right.

361
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,070

Okay.

370
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,570
We've been in this town forever.

371
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,130
Why haven't we seen them before?

372
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,300
Did you see a bunch of monsters yesterday?

373
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,310
I was here yesterday.

374
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
So he was...

375
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,950
That tall guy

376
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,020
with grey hair.

377
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,740
Was that him? He doesn't look like it.

378
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,260
[Wine]

379
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,150
Third Brother! Third Brother! Tiedan!

380
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,470
Come on. Let's enjoy the show.

381
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,720
Hurry up. Come here.

382
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,550
[Wine]

383
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,190
Is it too spicy?

384
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,360
How dare you steal men from our boss?

385
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,340
This is what happens to you.

386
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,720
It's stealing women.

387
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,610
[Wine]

388
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,590
I can't stand them.

389
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,930
He doesn't look like the gray-haired guy from yesterday.

390
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,630
His eyes and nose are wrinkled.

391
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,470
He looked quite like that guy just now.

392
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,170
So when making funny faces,

393
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,500
handsome guys and beautiful women look just like ugly monsters.

394
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,010
So you're here to see beautiful women.

395
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
You bastard.

396
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,710
Let's go. Stop peeking here.

397
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,760
No, no.

398
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,640
Looks like he's wasted.

399
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,340
If you keep being like this,

400
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,300
I'm no longer interested either.

401
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,630
This little girl.

402
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,390
You are not qualified to be a man.

403
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,510
Be a woman.

404
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,510
That's right.

405
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,180
If you can't do it, just quit.

406
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,430
[Wine]

407
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,260
What a loser.

408
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,870
How long are you going to laugh?

409
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,130
I don't mean it.

410
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,590
I just can't stop.

411
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,910
Take your time washing your mouth. No hurry.

412
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,850
I feel much better.

413
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,230
Today,

414
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,900
I feel like I've fallen into the bandits' den.

415
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,870
I didn't expect to be fooled by some thugs.

416
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,540
Stop laughing.

417
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,320
When there's a problem,

418
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,880
I like to express it directly.

419
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,220
I think this is the best way

420
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,610
to solve a problem.

421
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,780
Covering up your hard feelings

422
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,160
would only make things worse.

423
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,670
Did you say all those things

424
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,780
to make me accept Wang Yishao?

425
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm not a saint.

426
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,540
I just said this is a way.

427
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,120
Besides, you can

428
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,070
find out if what you're feeling

429
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,980
is real,

430
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,970
or you fell sick.

431
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,420
In that case,

432
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,060
what Hua Gu said when she was drunk is true.

433
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,280
But

434
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,010
your stronghold has been taken down.

435
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,750
How are you going to contact the higher-ups?

436
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,690
I'll have to go back in person.

437
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,710
But I don't know

438
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,740
what will happen after I go back.

439
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,100
Your original stronghold has been taken down.

440
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,160
And your people won't be able to come here.

441
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,140
If they built a new stronghold,

442
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,120
you wouldn't know, either.

443
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,990
But

444
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,140
what will you do if I leave?

445
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,620
What could happen to me?

446
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,780
I'm just worried about you.

447
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,300
I'm worried that when I'm gone,

448
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,060
there'll be no one to protect you.

449
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,650
We're amazing.

450
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,890
We finished our work so quickly.

451
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,340
What else should we do?

452
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,570
We can move after class.

453
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,230
Move?

454
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,280
Let's go.

455
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,200
-Why isn't he here yet?
-When will he come?

456
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,260
I don't know.

457
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,120
Seriously. Young Master Wang danced so well.

458
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,120
I really like him.

459
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,590
Me too.

460
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,390
Is that him?

461
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,530
-He's coming.
-Right? Yes.

462
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,300
He's coming.

463
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,620
He's coming.

464
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,790
So handsome.

465
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,970
Today, we're going to do daily makeup

466
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,490
to challenge your abilities.

467
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,380
We've already proved our abilities.

468
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,770
We even dressed up as ghosts.

469
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,980
What's there to challenge?

470
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,300
Last time, it was just simple makeup.

471
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,810
This time, you'll dress up from the soul.

472
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,550
Isn't that still dressing up as ghosts?

473
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,850
Then I'll take ghosts as an example.

474
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,290
Last time, you dressed up as ghosts.

475
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,990
But this time, you'll become ghosts.

476
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,940
You want to kill us?

477
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Then I'll kill you first

478
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,450
and turn you into a ghost.

479
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,750
Who said I wanted to kill you?

480
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,080
I haven't finished yet.

481
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,390
That was just an example.

482
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,110
Just seeing how sanctimonious you are

483
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,830
makes me angry.

484
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,780
This is what you get for being a poser.

485
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,260
Pepper. Pepper.

486
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,780
We're still in class.

487
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Save him some face.

488
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,880
Save him some face?

489
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,530
Even I can't stand him like this.

490
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,840
Save him some face.

491
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,260
Okay.

492
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,600
All right, no more examples.

493
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,770
Our lesson today is

494
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,550
to dress up as men.

495
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,110
Why didn't you say that earlier?

496
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,900
It's so fun to dress up like a man.

497
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,760
Dressing up is just a part of it.

498
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,470
We need to dress up from the perspective of charm and posture.

499
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,300
But of course, clothing is important too.

500
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,180
But it's only external.

501
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,710
What charm?

502
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm a man at heart.

503
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,610
There's no need to dress up.

504
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,550
It's very simple for you,

505
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,890
because you're a special case.

506
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,770
But for some people, it's extremely hard.

507
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,380
Hong Hui.

508
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,000
Why do I feel that your soul

509
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,230
is like a woman?

510
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,980
What do you mean?

511
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,760
Look at your outfit.

512
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,200
You don't even have to wear women's clothes.

513
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,510
With your elegant figure,

514
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,140
you look like a woman in every way,

515
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,010
and an ugly woman at that.

516
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,900
You've hit the point here.

517
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,680
Of course.

518
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,710
The purpose of dressing up

519
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,970
is to hide ourselves.

520
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,510
If we're too pretty,

521
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,490
we'll become the focus.

522
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,070
It'll be inconvenient for us to hide.

523
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,420
But with my fat figure,

524
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,530
how can I not be the focus?

525
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,850
That's a good question.

526
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,210
If you get mixed up with a bunch of fatties,

527
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,430
you won't be so obvious.

528
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,810
Everyone knows that.

529
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,170
But where can I find a bunch of fatties?

530
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,060
We can also think the other way around.

531
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,050
If you can't find fatties,

532
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
you can find an extremely skinny person

533
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,910
and stand next to her.

534
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,090
This way, she'll also stand out.

535
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,960
She can take at least half of the attention off you.

536
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,050
Where can I find an extremely skinny person?

537
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,350
This depends on current conditions.

538
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,770
If you can't find a skinny person either,

539
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,960
you can pretend to be a fool.

540
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,010
Because people are naturally tolerant of fools.

541
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,190
It'll be easy to hide.

542
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,900
No.

543
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,720
How depressing it is to pretend to be a fool.

544
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,060
I'd rather look for fatties or skinny people.

545
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,960
Hong Hui.

546
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,090
Why can't you be thinner?

547
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,160
What do you mean?

548
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,000
If you were thinner,

549
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,680
I'd carry you wherever I go.

550
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,890
It'd be convenient to take you with me.

551
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,930
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

552
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,550
Let's be serious and get our class started.

553
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,900
I've prepared some men's clothes.

554
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,120
You can choose by yourselves.

555
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,520
I have my own men's clothes.

556
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,760
Can I wear my own clothes?

557
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,930
Of course.

558
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,140
Me too.

559
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,940
Me too.

560
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,550
Me... Me too.

561
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,000
I made them before, but I've never worn them.

562
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,880
Me too.

563
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,620
When I was out traveling,

564
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,950
I'd wear men's clothes when it was inconvenient.

565
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,980
You...

566
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,330
You've all dressed up as men before?

567
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,160
No.

568
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,880
I have.

569
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,530
Why are you back?

570
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,700
Well,

571
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,200
I accept your suggestion.

572
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,750
I've come around.

573
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,230
What suggestion?

574
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,180
You said it to me this morning.

575
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,970
Did you already forget?

576
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,920
No way.

577
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,090
Why not?

578
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,740
I was already

579
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,280
ready to leave the town,

580
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,270
but Young Master Wang went to see me

581
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,850
and persuaded me to come back.

582
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,810
You came back just because he persuaded you?

583
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,680
Didn't you say you didn't care?

584
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,480
Are you going back on your word?

585
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,780
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

586
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,020
I'll stay here for my goal.

587
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,100
Besides,

588
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,700
I think your suggestion actually works.

589
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,940
Covering an old relationship with a new one.

590
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,510
It's clever.

591
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,640
Thank you.

592
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,800
How can you do that so fast?

593
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,110
This way, I won't be in pain.

594
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,100
Don't you want me to be happy?

595
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,080
Let's continue with the class.

596
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,980
Alright.

597
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,370
Now, let's practice walking.

598
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,420
Try to find the charm of men's walking.

599
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,360
What charm do men have when they walk?

600
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,350
Don't men all stagger when they walk?

601
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,540
Come on. Start walking.

602
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
They all seem to be familiar with men's clothes.

603
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Besides Hu Jiao and Qing Cai,

604
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,610
Gao Yin and Gan Pu wear men's clothes quite a lot.

605
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,680
As for Han Aizhen...

606
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,830
Like this.

607
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,950
Maybe it's because of her personality.

608
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,980
Go that way. That way.

609
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,180
Hu Jiao looks carefree.

610
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,880
Why is she walking like this?

611
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,090
She does look a bit strange.

612
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,190
Look.

613
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,780
Why is she walking like this?

614
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,400
Why is Qing Cai walking so strangely?

615
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,060
If all men walk like this,

616
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,160
I won't like men anymore.

617
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,300
Good.

618
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,180
Then stop liking men.

619
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,470
Leave Wang Yishao to me to like.

620
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,730
What's the use of me leaving him to you?

621
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,700
So many people

622
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,130
like Young Master Wang.

623
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,400
Qing Cai.

624
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,230
You used to

625
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,600
refuse to recognize yourself as a woman.

626
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,220
Why are you

627
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,050
so averse to men now?

628
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,200
You cold-faced girl.

629
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,940
When did you change your character

630
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,410
and start to tease others?

631
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,300
I'm just trying to get closer to you.

632
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,820
I don't want to cause any bloody incident

633
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,330
just because we don't know each other well.

634
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,000
Indeed.

635
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,120
We should find a chance to talk.

636
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,850
Okay.

637
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,640
After this is done,

638
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,600
let's have a deep chat.

639
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,560
Alright.

640
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,680
In the future,

641
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,790
our courses will no longer be conducted in the form of classes.

642
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,890
Instead, it'll be integrated into your lives.

643
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,100
You mean

644
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,990
we have to keep wearing men's clothes?

645
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,340
Not really.

646
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,510
After you really understand

647
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,980
the charm of men,

648
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,230
you can experience other people's lives.

649
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,510
For example, just as I mentioned before,

650
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,150
you can experience what it's like to be a fool,

651
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,970
a beggar,

652
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,080
or a lunatic, and so on.

653
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,150
How boring that is!

654
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,240
It's better to be a man.

655
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,630
At least it's not that annoying.

656
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,600
I'll stay at Mingyi Manor

657
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,940
and instruct you...

658
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,840
You guys anytime.

659
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,570
I think you just want to find a way

660
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,120
to not leave Mingyi Manor.

661
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,040
That's not true.

662
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,310
You dare to do it, but not admit it?

663
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,550
I look down on you.

664
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,640
That's all for today's lesson.

665
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,280
There will be new classes tomorrow.

666
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,660
You're dismissed.

667
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,840
Gan Pu.

668
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,090
Do you have time?

669
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,310
Come to my place to have some tea.

670
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:56,970
Sure.

671
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,600
You... You've recovered?

672
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,790
I feel alright now.

673
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,130
I just feel a bit miserable today.

674
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,900
I feel like I fell into the bandits' den.

675
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,620
But I'm happy.

676
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,730
They are not real bandits.

677
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,050
When they see their boss,

678
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,230
they'll be as obedient as little lambs.

679
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,200
Would you like to have tea at Wang Yishao's?

680
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,990
I have plans with Qing Cai.

681
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,280
I'll pass.

682
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,770
When did you two

683
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,870
hook up?

684
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,920
It's weird.

685
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,560
Don't talk nonsense.

686
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,970
We have things to talk about.

687
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,720
Han Aizhen.

688
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,660
I don't want to have tea.

689
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,340
The tea tastes terrible.

690
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,170
Let's go hunting.

691
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,360
Jiaoniang has run out of food.

692
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,110
Sure.

693
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,490
Anyway,

694
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,930
I don't want to drink tea either.

695
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,760
Let's go.

696
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,360
Let's go.

697
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,060
Let's go and have tea.

698
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,650
Let's go.

699
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,330
Han Aizhen, be careful not to get bitten by a snake again in the mountain.

700
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,410
It'll bite you.

701
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,970
Han Aizhen, stop right there!

702
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,690
Let's go. Don't get in their way.

703
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,510
Let's go have a drink.

704
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,840
They're going to have a drink.

705
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,650
Please.

706
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,720
Han Aizhen has told me.

707
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,450
I understand what you mean.

708
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,990
But your mask is too heavy.

709
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,650
It always makes me feel

710
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,580
there's a knife hanging there.

711
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,150
As your enemy,

712
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,170
I know your most important secret.

713
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,210
Now,

714
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,740
I've also found out your identity.

715
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,110
You're indeed

716
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,090
facing a life-and-death crisis now.

717
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,429
From my point of view,

718
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,389
you are a very dangerous monster.

719
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,489
I'll either kill you

720
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,620
or run away.

721
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,840
You take such a big risk staying here.

722
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,449
Is it just to save

723
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,949
your foster father who's imprisoned here?

724
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,560
Yes.

725
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,010
Now,

726
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,090
I'll unveil the thickest mask in your mind.

727
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,080
You're not showing your real intention of killing me now, are you?

728
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,560
Here?

729
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,929
Did you choose the wrong place?

730
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,510
I just want to sort out

731
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,470
our core conflict with you.

732
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,660
Core conflict?

733
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,140
We're in different camps.

734
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,900
I'm the one who will subvert you.

735
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,950
That's your identity,

736
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,200
not who you are.

737
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,850
I came here only to save my father.

738
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,130
As for other matters,

739
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,500
I'm not interested at all.

740
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,830
So what core conflict do we have?

741
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,690
No matter how far an ant goes,

742
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,670
it has to go home.

743
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,460
Maybe one ant went too far

744
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,100
and forgot the way home.

745
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,470
You really saw through me.

746
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,220
But the people on your side

747
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,270
won't think so.

748
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,790
Their first priority will still be to kill me.

749
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,590
That's why I kept silent.

750
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,620
Can I trust you?

751
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,830
Just like how a mouse believes that a cat won't eat it?

752
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,180
So what do you think?

753
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,320
Why haven't I exposed you?

754
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,940
Do you think

755
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,990
I'm playing a cat-and-mouse game?

756
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,940
Give me a reason.

757
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,420
We are all pawns.

758
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,910
Those who are fighting against each other

759
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,420
are not us.

760
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,060
People fight

761
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,740
just to get more things.

762
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,970
It's like playing chess.

763
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,240
But we are not players.

764
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,000
To win or to lose is their business.

765
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,280
With your ability,

766
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,360
you don't look like a pawn.

767
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,230
I think

768
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,280
you are more like

769
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,260
a pawn that wants to destroy the entire chessboard.

770
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,490
You mentioned those people's boss.

771
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,680
Do you know him?

772
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,890
Of course.

773
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,900
I have a special relationship with him.

774
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,820
One of them said

775
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,750
I stole a man from their boss.

776
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,040
What does that mean?

777
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,050
Is their boss a woman?

778
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,120
Why are you laughing?

779
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,820
I'm laughing.

780
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm laughing because

781
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,800
you finally look a bit human now.

782
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,390
What was I like before?

783
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,730
Before...

784
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,280
You used to be fairy-like.

785
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,950
You'd make people feel they couldn't get close to you.

786
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,090
Didn't we work together?

787
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,530
Why did you still think I was inhumane?

788
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
That was just superficial.

789
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,070
It felt like you were pretending.

790
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,910
Would you only feel real when I'm being tortured?

791
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,670
You're not really thinking about

792
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,080
how you want to be tortured, are you?

793
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,850
No.

794
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,290
You may be well-educated,

795
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,260
but your mentality is still like that of a child.

796
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,540
Is this a compliment or a scolding?

797
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,480
Look at you.

798
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,110
I called you a fool, and you really became a fool?

799
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,850
Forget it.

800
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,130
In order for you to return to your former smart and unrestrained self,

801
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,470
I have to stay away from you.

802
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,250
Don't.

803
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,960
We can still be friends.

804
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,480
Based on my past experience,

805
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,250
many people who say we should start off as friends

806
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,120
have other intentions later.

807
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,840
This...

808
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,600
Alright, alright.

809
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,570
I was just kidding.

810
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,110
You

811
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,340
are really a good person.

812
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,180
How about I take you as my older brother?

813
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,180
In case you

814
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,340
have improper thoughts about me in the future.

815
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,520
But... But I...

816
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,540
Stop stammering.

817
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,440
It's a deal.

818
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,910
How should I address you in the future?

819
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
No, no.

820
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,830
I haven't come around yet.

821
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,510
Stop stammering.

822
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,760
It's a deal.

823
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,750
Let me think about how I should address you first.

824
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,710
How about Young Master Wang?

825
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,400
No.

826
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,040
That's too distant.

827
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,470
Second Prince?

828
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,840
Second Prince is even more distant.

829
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,840
How about I call you Brother?

830
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,200
It's so cheesy. I can't say it out.

831
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,370
Brother Wang. Brother Wang...

832
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,720
It's so markety.

833
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,100
How about Big Wang?

834
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,390
Wait, wait.

835
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,030
Give me a bit more time.

836
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,870
Or...

837
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,850
Maybe you can call me

838
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,540
Handsome Wang?

839
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,410
Handsome Wang.

840
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,670
Handsome Wang.

841
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,600
But don't let others know about this for now.

842
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,680
Okay, it's just between the two of us.

843
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,890
Handsome Wang...

844
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,790
Lower your voice.

845
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,650
It's low enough.

846
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,130
Don't.

847
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,310
Over there. Hurry up.

848
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,970
Over there.

849
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,780
Where?

850
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,440
Stop cutting! Stop it!

851
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,390
You're almost chopping it into pieces.

852
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,450
Are you sure it was a rabbit?

853
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,360
It left a shadow and ran away.

854
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,920
I think so.

855
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,040
What if it was a rat?

856
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,320
It was just a shadow.

857
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,090
How would I know?

858
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,890
I didn't see it.

859
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,860
Don't. Don't.

860
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,870
You saw it again?

861
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,510
No.

862
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,130
I was just kidding you.

863
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,970
You think you can catch rabbits this way?

864
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,140
Why do they always succeed in hunting?

865
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,800
Gan Pu knows how to set a trap.

866
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,240
Of course she can catch prey.

867
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,330
That makes sense.

868
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,000
Let's ask Gan Pu for help next time.

869
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
Don't use your sword anymore. We won't succeed.

870
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,920
Are we quitting?

871
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,840
Yes, let's quit.

872
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
It hurts so much.

873
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,080
Don't chop it with your sword next time.

874
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,470
The rabbit can't be eaten that way.

875
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,740
You drink like this every day.

876
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,580
Why haven't you become wasted?

877
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,380
I'm a wine jar.

878
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,660
I can hold my liquor. I never get drunk.

879
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,800
How could a wine jar be damaged by wine?

880
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,720
In this weather,

881
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,560
we are both men, yet we're sitting on this mountain together.

882
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,910
It's foggy and misty.

883
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,520
It's quite romantic.

884
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,880
Isn't it a bit awkward?

885
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,780
It's better to go down the mountain and enjoy the sunshine.

886
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,850
Hey.

887
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,260
Did you go peek at the girls taking a shower?

888
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
I didn't.

889
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,580
Would I have been beaten if I peeked?

890
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,170
You even got beaten up by girls.

891
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,060
How did you end up like this?

892
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,330
After that incident,

893
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,600
I didn't follow them much.

894
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,760
Whenever I see someone going in the direction of the shower room,

895
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,970
I'll give up right away.

896
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,350
Since when

897
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,610
did you side with Wang Yishao?

898
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,140
Is it because of that woman?

899
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,330
I just couldn't bear to see him degenerate.

900
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,090
As his friend,

901
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,450
I just gave him a little help.

902
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,810
Let me ask you something.

903
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,690
Do you really think Qing Cai,

904
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,560
I mean, Vegetable,

905
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,440
is a woman?

906
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,250
What do you mean?

907
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,460
You really don't understand?

908
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,760
That's a man.

909
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,450
H-How is that possible?

910
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,870
What do you mean how is that possible?

911
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,900
You're just too naive.

912
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,530
Unlike me.

913
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,510
You go through various girls, yet never get involved with them?

914
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,010
Let me tell you.

915
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,600
To judge if someone is a woman,

916
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,390
use your smell. If it's a woman, you can smell it

917
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,170
when she walks by.

918
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,420
You can also identity women's personalities

919
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,050
through how they smell.

920
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,190
This is the

921
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,500
valuable experience I've summarized over the years.

922
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,960
Are you serious?

923
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,790
They...

924
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,940
They take baths together,

925
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,270
and they sleep together.

926
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,790
How could she be a man?

927
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,730
All you know is they take baths together,

928
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,710
and you ruined it.

929
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,980
What else do you know?

930
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,980
No wonder Sun Li kept sniffing around him.

931
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,970
Why do you smell like a man?

932
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,060
Isn't that Gao Yin a doctor?

933
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:05,650
Yes.

934
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,940
So

935
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,740
he also knows he's a man?

936
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,590
Of course Gao Yin knows.

937
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,400
She and Qing Cai seem to have formed

938
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,940
a special tacit understanding.

939
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,690
Today,

940
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,650
they made an appointment to negotiate, right?

941
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,780
She... She...

942
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,390
Doesn't she like Young Master Wang?

943
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,440
Why didn't she tell Young Master Wang?

944
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,800
Don't you know what kind of person Gao Yin is?

945
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,370
She's a woman with a strong mind.

946
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,550
She's no ordinary person.

947
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,500
So why didn't you tell Young Master Wang?

948
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,180
Should I tell him?

949
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,640
H-How could this be?

950
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,460
How come he's a man?

951
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,250
He's not a man.

952
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,850
He's definitely not a man.

953
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,900
Take your time to calm down.

954
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,530
No way.

955
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,780
There's no way.

956
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,930
How could he possibly be a man?

957
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,930
He's not a man!

958
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,690
He's not a man!
