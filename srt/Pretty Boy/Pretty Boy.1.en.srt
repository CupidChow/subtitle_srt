00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,590
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,630
(Episode 1)

3
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,050
Dear listeners.

4
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,530
As the saying goes,

5
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,870
a tale

6
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,510
isn't meant for boasting

7
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,390
or exaggeration—

8
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,390
it's meant for telling.

9
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,000
Today, let me tell you

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,950
a story about Qing Cai.

11
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,390
Is it Qing Cai (green vegetable)?

12
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,850
It's neither Qing Cai (green vegetable) nor Qin Cai (celery).

13
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,270
It's Qing Cai.

14
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,150
This Qing Cai, as a burly man with a bushy beard,

15
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,150
often punished the ruffians in town.

16
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,400
Where are you going?

17
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,440
Hand over the money.

18
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,630
Give me the money.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,430
Those ruffians

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,990
both respected and feared him.

21
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,310
My chest!

22
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,060
You've knocked me silly.

23
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,910
It hurts so much.

24
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,720
I've been telling you all along

25
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,950
that even if you want to be hooligans,

26
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,350
be ones with morals,

27
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,670
aspirations,

28
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,150
and ambition.

29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,410
But what about you lot?

30
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,020
If I catch you causing trouble again,

31
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,870
I'll strip you naked,

32
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,829
tie ropes to your feet,

33
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,750
and hang you upside down from the beam,

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,910
drying you out like cured meat.

35
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,360
That's it. The very sight of you annoys me.

36
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,350
It's the Villain.

37
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,079
The Villain.

38
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,990
Quick, let's go.

39
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,070
Isn't that the Villain himself?

40
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,250
What have I done to you all?

41
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,210
Why are you hiding from me?

42
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,000
Looks like Father was right after all.

43
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,550
You, with your little beard, wander aimlessly

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,750
around town every day,

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,880
making everyone think you're no good.

46
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,350
Why can't you make things easier

47
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,550
for Mr. Shang Shan and me?

48
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,130
Looks like this mustache needs to go.

49
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,779
Father?

50
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,940
Could something have happened to Father?

51
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,670
There must be an ambush nearby.

52
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,670
I don't see Father anywhere,

53
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,670
which means he's still alive.

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,409
Wake up, all of you.

55
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,590
It seems I can only follow these women now

56
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,120
to find out where Father is.

57
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,820
(Mingyi Manor)

58
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,310
(Mingyi Manor)

59
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,570
They're actually from the Mingyi Manor.
(Mingyi Manor)

60
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,330
(Mingyi Manor)

61
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,960
Looks like I'll have to sneak in from somewhere else.

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,350
I actually ended up back here again.

63
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,830
How did I circle back here again?

64
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,110
Could this place be protected by traps or formations?

65
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,360
Who's there?

66
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,710
Quick, after him!

67
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

68
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,670
Come quickly!

69
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,810
There's an intruder at Mingyi Manor!

70
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,110
Well, we're all thieves here;

71
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,750
no need to be at each other's throats, right?

72
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,790
Well, I saw you go in just now.

73
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,790
It looked pretty interesting inside.

74
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,860
How about you take me along with you?

75
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,320
We could form an alliance.

76
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,390
Then, let me tell you

77
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,790
a story about this place.

78
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,510
They say this is a thousand-year-old tomb,

79
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,000
and inside is a millennium-old demon.

80
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,190
Every night, it comes out.

81
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,790
What do you want?

82
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,190
If you kill me,

83
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,940
I'm telling you,

84
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,190
I'll come back as a ghost to haunt you.

85
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,110
Why did you scare me?

86
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,190
You... look quite nice... when you smile.

87
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,350
Cut the nonsense.

88
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,290
Give me back my face mask.

89
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,350
Put it here and don't come any closer.

90
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,390
Actually...

91
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,570
your voice is quite pleasant too.

92
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,510
Haven't we found that person yet?

93
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,590
You all, search over there!

94
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,190
Yes.

95
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,470
We can discuss

96
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,000
our next cooperation plan.

97
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,750
This is where we part ways.

98
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,870
Don't say that.

99
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,350
We can exchange our contact information.

100
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,150
Next time, take me inside, okay?

101
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,870
The general has gone too far this time.

102
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,080
He has forced us to recruit disciples from outside.

103
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,120
How about we just kill that bastard general

104
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,580
and end it once and for all?

105
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,840
We've been used by Wang Quan again.

106
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,990
But your move was truly brilliant.

107
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,110
You had Wang Quan send someone to oversee the disciple trials,

108
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,240
letting them fight among themselves.

109
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,470
Dongmei, how could you have failed?

110
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,590
I'm sorry. I was ambushed.

111
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,310
Yinniang, Dongmei has been

112
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,910
so upset over this that she can't eat or sleep.

113
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,950
I think it's because that person was just too cunning.

114
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,550
Indeed.

115
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,790
In terms of martial arts,

116
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,230
Dongmei is on par with me,

117
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,950
which means that the person's martial arts skills

118
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,750
are already at a top-tier level.

119
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,110
Plus, he was familiar with the terrain.

120
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,310
So Dongmei's failure

121
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,020
is understandable.

122
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,150
Boss, Boss, Boss.

123
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,500
I've got some news.

124
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,270
M-M-Mingyi Manor is openly

125
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,800
recruiting disciples now.

126
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,310
This is unexpected.

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,670
Yeah,

128
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,750
I heard that Mingyi Manor is all women.

129
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,470
So they're only recruiting female disciples this time,

130
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,130
and the requirements are particularly strict.

131
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,270
Mingyi Manor only recruits female disciples.

132
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,570
If I want to find my father,

133
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,370
I'll have to disguise myself as a woman to sneak in.

134
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,960
Find me someone for makeup.

135
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,950
Why are you staring at me?

136
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,790
Hurry up and do the makeup for me.

137
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,070
Sir, how can I apply women's makeup to you

138
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,910
if you don't shave your beard?

139
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,770
Can't we do it without shaving?

140
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,630
Are you sure?

141
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,390
Look, the Boss shaved his beard.

142
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,190
He looks less intimidating now.

143
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,750
Why did Boss shave his beard?

144
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,390
Are you stupid? If Boss kept his beard,

145
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,150
who wouldn't see he's a man?

146
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,330
So, if the beard's shaved, no one will see he is a man?

147
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,200
Here, take a look.

148
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,540
Wait,

149
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,550
what kind of look is this?

150
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,010
It's not finished yet.

151
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,470
We still need to draw your eyebrows.

152
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,570
Drawing the eyebrows will make it even better.

153
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,590
Look, this is the Mandarin Duck Eyebrows.

154
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,580
This one looks like little earthworms.

155
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
It's all the rage.

156
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,430
And this style, the Flying Eyebrows.

157
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,310
No, no, no. None of these are good.

158
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,790
No,

159
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,510
all of this is bad.

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Sir,

161
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,430
what kind of makeup do you want then?

162
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,750
How would I know?

163
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,350
What other styles can you do?

164
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,750
Well, women, to please men,

165
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,310
sometimes need to wear special makeup.

166
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,020
Men are always fickle, aren't they?

167
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,230
I want to please men?

168
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,370
Who told you to give me a makeup look to please men?

169
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,470
Please men.

170
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,750
Sir,

171
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,930
do you want me to do your makeup or not?

172
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,670
Yes.

173
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,350
Take another look.

174
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,910
What on earth

175
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,570
did you smear all over my face?

176
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,250
All the girls in our house

177
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,630
like this style.

178
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,830
What house are you from?

179
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,310
The Yihong House.

180
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,590
Yihong House! Yihong House!

181
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,190
Don't you know some normal makeup?

182
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,910
I do.

183
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,270
This woman looks familiar.

184
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,250
There is even a woman who looks so much like a man.

185
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,910
Looks like I won't be exposed.

186
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,790
Today is the first time in the history of our Mingyi Manor

187
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,070
that we are recruiting disciples from outside.

188
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,450
However, our Mingyi Manor

189
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,310
only accepts capable disciples.

190
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,510
Now, each of you

191
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,280
will demonstrate your skills.

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,210
Does everyone have to demonstrate?

193
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:31,910
Yes.

194
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,300
But I came to Mingyi Manor just to learn martial arts.

195
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,410
Learn martial arts?

196
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,030
That can be very tough.

197
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,250
Tougher than cooking or frying dishes?

198
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,420
It's much tougher than that.

199
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,550
Then forget it.

200
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,200
Next.

201
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,310
My name is Hu Jiao,

202
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,570
a maid in the Wang family.

203
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,570
I've learned martial arts to protect my lady.

204
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,030
Go ahead and demonstrate.

205
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,650
My name is Han Aizhen.

206
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,540
I've been learning martial arts from my master since childhood.

207
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,340
I aspire to become a female knight-errant in the martial arts world.

208
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,340
Next.

209
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,210
My name is Gan Pu.

210
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,830
Next.

211
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,670
My name is Gao Yin.

212
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,150
I've been learning from the Divine Doctor since childhood,

213
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,210
skilled in both medicine and poison.

214
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,200
Next.

215
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,370
My name is Qing Cai.

216
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,800
I grew up in a coastal fishing village.

217
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,330
To defend against invasions by Japanese pirates,

218
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,130
everyone in the village has learned martial arts.

219
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,420
You five

220
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,810
are fortunate to become trial disciples of Mingyi Manor.

221
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,230
After training,

222
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,490
you may have the chance to become official disciples.

223
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,550
Next, let me introduce

224
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,150
your training instructors.

225
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,750
First, please, let's welcome Sun Li.

226
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,580
She will be teaching you to dance.

227
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,310
Why do you smell like a man?

228
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,320
Are you born in the Year of the Dog?

229
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,430
How did you know?

230
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,410
Do you know how to read faces?

231
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,390
Read my palm for me.

232
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,670
When will I find my true love?

233
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,470
You've been through many men.

234
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,510
That's right.

235
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,390
Take a closer look for me.

236
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,990
When will I

237
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,250
meet the man of my dreams?

238
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,349
Alright.

239
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,550
I've already revealed too many of heaven's secrets.

240
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,790
I can't say more.

241
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,710
You should think about it yourself from now on.

242
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,990
When will it be my turn?

243
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,640
Did you forget about me?

244
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,630
Oh no, I really did forget about you.

245
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,190
Alright.

246
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,070
Next, let's warmly welcome Liu Yiyi.

247
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,090
My name is Hong Hui.

248
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,330
Hong Hui.

249
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,830
He will teach you how to apply makeup.

250
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,430
Then let me take a look at your makeup.

251
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,310
The mole is nice; well done.

252
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,100
What's wrong with your eyes?

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,310
Your ears are nice; well done.

254
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,040
These are my natural ears.

255
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,230
This little girl.

256
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,870
Your nose is nice.

257
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,590
Well done.

258
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,150
Yeah, thank you.

259
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,870
Your eyes are quite big.

260
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,460
Well done.

261
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,150
Strange,

262
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,120
why does your makeup look different from the others?

263
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,230
What's the reason?

264
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,360
It seems like...

265
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,640
there's something extra.

266
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,750
What... could it be?

267
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,290
You also want to have her read your face.

268
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:44,890
Read face?

269
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,640
You are a heartless man.

270
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,820
B-B-But your heartlessness

271
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,630
comes from caring too much.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,270
Yes, yes, that's right.

273
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,430
I indeed care too much.

274
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,810
You've already found the love of your life.

275
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,350
But you found her in your dreams.

276
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,950
I'm always searching for the love of my life, even in my dreams.

277
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,300
People who care too much are especially vulnerable to getting hurt.

278
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,390
How pitiful.

279
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,030
How lamentable.

280
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,660
It's the first time someone has truly seen into my inner world.

281
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,630
You're amazing.

282
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,720
I've found it.

283
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,490
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

284
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,590
I got caught in the moment.

285
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,730
How can you be so rude?

286
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,300
How dare you grab a woman's hand!

287
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,630
You're so annoying.

288
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,990
Another teacher has been driven away.

289
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,910
A-A-Are there...

290
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,310
are there more teachers?

291
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,350
Oh no.

292
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,720
I forgot another one.

293
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,030
Next, let me warmly introduce our musical prodigy, Zhang Fang.

294
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,680
Let me warmly introduce our musical prodigy, Zhang Fang.

295
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,550
Stop calling.

296
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,790
This teacher must have run away too.

297
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,780
If he's gone, so be it.

298
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,870
You!

299
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,580
Read my palm too.

300
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,510
Next, let me show you around

301
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,440
the various facilities of Mingyi Manor.

302
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
This is the woodshed.

303
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,840
There aren't any monsters in this woodshed, are there?

304
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,240
There will be if you go in.

305
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,180
This is the kitchen.

306
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,730
Let me ask you something.

307
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,430
It's full of leaks.

308
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,470
When we cook, are we eating water or mud?

309
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,770
Don't you wash the pots before cooking?

310
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,240
I don't wanna.

311
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,390
This is the storage room.

312
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,070
Don't go in unless necessary.

313
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,070
It's way too dirty in here.

314
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,130
You can clean it up when you have some free time.

315
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,310
Next, I'm pleased to introduce

316
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,470
the study hall, where you'll

317
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,130
be spending most of your time.

318
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,420
You can look around.

319
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,250
Don't touch anything.

320
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,570
All of our valuable items are here.

321
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,310
All of Mingyi Manor's most valuable assets

322
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,630
are here.

323
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,230
Petty.

324
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,550
These are the facilities

325
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,270
you'll be using during your training.

326
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,130
It's quite fun.

327
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,790
Please handle them with care.

328
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,590
Are we going to learn how to play this drum too?

329
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,110
Yes.

330
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,700
I know; don't touch it.

331
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,390
Everyone, please be careful.

332
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,990
Luckily, I'm agile enough.

333
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,790
Alright.

334
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,470
Here we are.

335
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,560
You'll be living in there.

336
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,510
Well, we're all sleeping together?

337
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,760
Of course.

338
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,430
Our Mingyi Manor is very poor.

339
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,870
We don't have that many rooms for you.

340
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,150
Didn't we just pass many empty rooms?

341
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,470
Why do we have to squeeze into one room?

342
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,200
How many times do I have to say it? Those rooms are dangerous.

343
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,230
Can't we repair them?

344
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,830
We don't have enough people.

345
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,990
How can we women sleep in the same room?

346
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,790
I'm just kidding.

347
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,430
You can go in now.

348
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,720
I'll go in first.

349
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,070
Choose your beds.

350
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,640
You can bring your luggage in later.

351
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Aren't you going?

352
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,650
Can I sleep outside? It's cooler.

353
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,560
Do as you like. Whatever makes you happy.

354
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,510
We've found out.

355
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,590
It was those town hooligans spreading rumors,

356
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,270
causing such a stir in the town.

357
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,870
Someone must be behind this.

358
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,570
That person has started seeking an opening.

359
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll keep an eye on those trial disciples.

360
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,500
People from various factions

361
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,110
should be among them.

362
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,190
Otherwise,

363
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,590
those factions wouldn't remain this silent.

364
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,430
Next step,

365
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,160
we need to closely monitor these trial disciples

366
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,820
and wait for their next moves.

367
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,390
Finally, my Jiaoniang

368
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,390
can come out for some fresh air.

369
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,440
Why is there a cat here too?

370
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,750
This is Jiaoniang.

371
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,820
Jiaoniang?

372
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,070
Where does her name come from?

373
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,110
The "jiao" in my name, Hu Jiao, and the "niang" means mother.

374
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,570
You're not saying it's your mother, are you?

375
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,830
Why couldn't it be?

376
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,590
She's even more important to me than my mother.

377
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,970
I heard you're a doctor.

378
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,670
Look, all of these are for my cat.

379
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,260
This one's for coat improvement.

380
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,190
And this one.

381
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,670
Want to go for a walk?

382
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,950
Sure, let's go.

383
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,810
You two, come with me.

384
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,710
-Yes.
-Yes.

385
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,090
Sorry, this is a restricted area.

386
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,060
You trial disciples are not allowed in yet.

387
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,950
So is the entire Mingyi Manor a restricted area?

388
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,910
No.

389
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,260
The place where you're staying is also part of Mingyi Manor.

390
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,140
Are you here for a walk too?

391
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,870
This area is off-limits.

392
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,430
I'm going to wander around the mountain.

393
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,560
Are you interested?

394
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,080
That fortune-telling thing you did earlier—

395
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,510
what was that about?

396
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,330
I don't know how to tell fortunes.

397
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,930
Besides, you should have noticed it.

398
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,660
That was just standard speech.

399
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,350
What you said about that makeup artist later was quite obvious.

400
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,900
What about the dancing one before?

401
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,230
Pure coincidence.

402
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,230
I saw her sniffing around like a dog,

403
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,110
so I was just teasing her.

404
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,080
Who knew she was really born in the Year of the Dog?

405
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,210
She actually bought it?

406
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,080
You were just guessing and making things up as you went along, right?

407
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,140
You're an old hand.

408
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,750
This was just a lucky guess.

409
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,770
I made all that up.

410
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,800
In these remote mountains,

411
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,830
how can we find the caterpillar fungi that's good for Jiaoniang?

412
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,690
There are only more insects in the deep mountains.

413
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,350
Let's go ahead and take a look.

414
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Let me take a look.

415
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,950
Is it here?

416
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,010
There's nothing here.

417
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,030
You insisted there were caterpillar fungi on the mountain

418
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,610
that would be good for my cat, so we came.

419
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,810
How can we possibly find anything in such a vast mountain?

420
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,150
There's simply nothing here.

421
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,670
What kind of place is this?

422
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,510
Jiaoniang!

423
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,790
Alarm.

424
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,150
Be careful.

425
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,870
What kind of place is this?

426
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,380
Jiaoniang!

427
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,070
Jiaoniang.

428
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,530
-Jiaoniang.
-Jiaoniang!

429
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,710
Jiaoniang.

430
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,480
Jiaoniang!

431
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,950
-I didn't expect the restriction to be so tight.
-Jiaoniang!

432
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,590
Jiaoniang!

433
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,310
Jiaoniang!

434
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,230
What's wrong?

435
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,630
Jiaoniang is missing.

436
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,510
Jiaoniang, where are you?

437
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,150
Oh my goodness.

438
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,110
Jiaoniang, come out quickly.

439
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,310
It seems all these people have their own agendas.

440
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,830
-Breaking this restriction definitely won't be easy.
-Jiaoniang.

441
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,910
Jiaoniang!

442
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,640
Hu Jiao.

443
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,350
Jiaoniang, where are you?

444
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,680
Why is it you again?

445
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,970
Why are you here again?

446
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,820
The three of us were just taking a walk.

447
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,150
We only came after we heard the warning bells.

448
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,030
Jiaoniang! Don't go.

449
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,770
Jiaoniang!

450
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,920
Don't go.

451
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,030
What's going on?

452
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,690
Jiaoniang.

453
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,500
What happened?

454
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,250
Stop yelling.

455
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,160
There are so many of you. Quickly help me find Jiaoniang!

456
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,480
If I can't find her, I'll eat you all!

457
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,510
Stop yelling.

458
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,760
Help her find it.

459
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,870
Jiaoniang, don't be afraid.

460
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,000
Come out quickly.

461
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,630
Jiaoniang.

462
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,830
Where are you?

463
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,910
Jiaoniang!

464
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,110
Jiaoniang.

465
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,700
It seems like they are still on guard.

466
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,500
Jiaoniang.

467
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,120
What are you doing?

468
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,730
Hu Jiao's cat is missing.

469
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,060
These signs mark restricted areas.

470
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,260
You can't go in there.

471
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,340
If you get killed by mistake, don't blame me.

472
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,160
Finally, I found Jiaoniang.

473
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,000
Is there a place to bathe the cat around here?

474
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,430
There's a pond behind the mountain.

475
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,450
The water there is very clear.

476
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,380
You can go there.

477
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,550
That's great.

478
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,670
I'll go now.

479
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,850
I'm going to bathe my cat

480
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,820
to calm it down.

481
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,430
Why did you come back so slowly?

482
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,670
I have an idea.

483
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,740
I think we need to

484
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,070
strengthen the bond between us.

485
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
How to strengthen it?

486
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,190
Let's bare it all.

487
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,830
What do you mean?

488
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,750
Bathe together.

489
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,190
Are you interested?

490
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,430
Bathing sounds fine.

491
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,670
How can women bathe together?

492
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,390
Why do you always act so weird?

493
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,430
You're not a man, are you?

494
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,060
How is that possible?

495
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,630
I'm just...

496
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,590
I think I'm fresh enough today.

497
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,050
I don't need to take a bath.

498
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,750
I'm going to take a bath anyway.

499
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,860
Anyone want to join me?

500
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,790
I want to take a bath too.

501
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,170
Let's go.

502
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,390
Come on, let's go take a bath.

503
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:04,950
Let's go.

504
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,970
Why aren't you going?

505
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,390
Let's go take a shower together.

506
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,170
I don't need to.

507
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,390
We need to bare it all.

508
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,250
I don't need to.

509
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,670
Put me down now.

510
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,740
Let me go.

511
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,670
Let me go!

512
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,990
Put me down!

513
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,560
What are you doing?

514
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,090
We're here for a bath. Take off your clothes.

515
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,110
Come on.

516
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,310
Vegetable.

517
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,610
Everyone's in the water.

518
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,270
Why don't you get in the water?

519
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,820
I'm afraid of water.

520
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,350
I nearly drowned when I was young.

521
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,350
Now I'm scared whenever I see water.

522
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,070
Don't be afraid.

523
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,730
The first time is always the hardest. It gets easier.

524
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,190
Once you get in, you won't be afraid anymore.

525
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,230
Come on.

526
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,110
Not scared anymore, right?

527
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,020
It's you.

528
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,950
I'm not here to peep.

529
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,090
I didn't see anything.

530
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,970
You're not here to peep?

531
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,830
Then why were you standing there?

532
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,140
I followed her here.

533
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,230
I didn't know you were bathing.

534
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,630
Why were you following me?

535
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,750
I was a bit worried about you.

536
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,530
I feel uneasy when I can't see you for a while.

537
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,790
-So I followed you.
-No, you…

538
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,970
What do you mean by that?

539
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,300
What else could he mean?

540
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,950
He's into you, obviously.

541
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,810
Does liking someone give you the right to peep?

542
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,750
You pervert.

543
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,710
I really wasn't peeping.

544
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,590
I saw you taking off your clothes,

545
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,200
and immediately I closed my eyes.

546
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,750
See? You did see us.

547
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,490
You think you can fool someone as smart as me?

548
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,430
I didn't!

549
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,850
If my eyes had been open,

550
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,190
how could I have been hit on the head?

551
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,400
I would have dodged for sure.

552
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,990
You dare to dodge?

553
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,520
He fell unconscious on his own.

554
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,270
Don't worry. He's fine.

555
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,230
There you go.

556
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,710
Stop playing dead.

557
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,440
I've found out your secret.

558
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,390
Yours are small, so you're afraid people will see, right?

559
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,540
Let me tell you,

560
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,210
mine used to be small too and only grew bigger later.

561
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,740
There's still hope for you.

562
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,660
You should learn from me in the future.

563
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,910
Use your brain more for everything.

564
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,050
Then you won't have so many troubles.

565
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,310
Forget it. Let's go.

566
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,350
(No Entry)

567
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,760
(No Entry)

568
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,190
Wait, wait, wait...

569
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,860
You've been following me.

570
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,270
We can work together.

571
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,840
Why should I trust you?

572
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,510
At least I'm not a member of Mingyi Manor.

573
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,490
I won't turn you in.

574
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,620
How can you prove it?

575
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,690
This is a thousand-year-old tomb.

576
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,650
It's said that inside is a millennium-old demon.

577
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,610
It comes out at night.

578
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,210
You're that bearded fellow.

579
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,230
That's me.

580
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,190
I...

581
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,710
Now I can confirm.

582
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,950
You're that smooth-talking guy from the other day.

583
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
Here's a little punishment for you.

584
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,690
Who's smooth-talking?

585
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,670
You're a man.

586
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,190
I...

587
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,470
You're a man.

588
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,630
So that day you were cross-dressing as a man too.

589
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,660
No wonder I couldn't recognize you.

590
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,800
How did you recognize me?

591
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,830
I always thought that you looked familiar.

592
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,010
And just now, you were so familiar with those traps

593
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,420
and the way you used the crossbow.

594
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,020
That's how I recognized you.

595
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,240
What are you doing?

596
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,050
Your beard that day was fake, wasn't it?

597
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,510
It was pretty convincing, though.

598
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,550
When you tugged at your beard,

599
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,840
you were grimacing and yelling.

600
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,370
It was all an act, wasn't it?

601
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,070
You really are a crafty one.

602
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,110
Let me ask you.

603
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,750
What are you trying to do by sneaking into Mingyi Manor?

604
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,730
Steal things, of course.

605
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,660
Didn't we agree to steal together?

606
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,110
Steal things?

607
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,830
What things?

608
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,330
Pots and pans?

609
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,350
Yeah.

610
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,350
Liar.

611
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,270
You...

612
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,720
Don't, don't, don't...

613
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,490
Alright, alright, you're the boss, okay?

614
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,550
You're the boss.

615
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,110
I submit to you, okay?

616
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,280
What boss?

617
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
How vulgar.

618
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,710
Then, "Sister," is that better?

619
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,550
Sister.

620
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,990
If you really want to steal something,

621
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,320
just follow me closely.

622
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,320
There are lots of traps and restrictions in here.

623
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,070
Let's go.

624
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,150
Are you some famous thief

625
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,610
in the martial arts world?

626
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,840
Well, well...

627
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,230
What's your alias then?

628
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,830
Can you tell me

629
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,840
so I can admire you?

630
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,390
I've told you to shut up.

631
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,000
You're so noisy.

632
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,860
That room has more restrictions.

633
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,190
It looks like an important place.

634
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,930
It doesn't look like living quarters.

635
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,230
It's more like a place to keep people locked up.

636
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,110
Could this be where people are kept in confinement at Mingyi Manor?

637
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,020
Doesn't seem like it though.

638
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,890
Confinement is supposed to be voluntary.

639
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,070
There's no need to have so many restrictions

640
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,500
as if guarding against thieves.

641
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,710
And that door is so thick.

642
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,240
It looks like it might trigger traps if touched.

643
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,810
Could it be a treasure vault?

644
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,930
Can we get closer and take a look?

645
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,590
No.

646
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,130
We were just in that area this afternoon.

647
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,600
That area must be guarded.

648
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,670
We'd definitely be spotted the moment we got close.

649
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,990
The restrictions within the courtyard are even harder to deal with.

650
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,120
It's tough to break with ordinary methods.

651
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,050
We need specialized tools to do it.

652
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,460
Do you have the tools?

653
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,390
Special restrictions require specialized tools.

654
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,390
But I don't know

655
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,890
what they will be like

656
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,660
after triggered.

657
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,590
So I can't do anything about it.

658
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,750
So you're saying

659
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,750
we need to trigger them first to know how to break them?

660
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,350
You're so smart.

661
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,110
Isn't that a dead end?

662
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,030
If we trigger them,

663
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,350
the people at Mingyi Manor will know.

664
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,350
If we don't trigger them, there's no way to break them.

665
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,630
You're here to rescue someone, aren't you?
