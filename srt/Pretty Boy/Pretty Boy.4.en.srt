1
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,650
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,580
(Episode 4)

3
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,940
Why are you holding me?

4
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,790
No, it's...

5
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,150
You snuggled into my arms yourself!

6
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,950
And

7
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,790
my arm...

8
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,510
It's numb now.

9
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,030
Gan Pu probably wanted to strangle you

10
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,890
but didn't have the strength,

11
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,890
so she ended up hugging you instead.

12
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,670
What's the big deal about a hug?

13
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,430
You must have squeezed against me.

14
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,290
Move over a bit.

15
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,740
Don't touch me.

16
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,990
You move over too!

17
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,750
Why aren't they here yet?

18
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,630
The makeup artist was injured.

19
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you sure it wasn't intentional?

20
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,400
It doesn't seem like it—just bad luck.

21
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,990
But jealousy is definitely in play.

22
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,550
Why she disappeared is still a mystery.

23
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,680
Who do you suspect?

24
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,190
Qing Cai.

25
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,950
You think she's highly suspicious?

26
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,830
So handsome!

27
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,060
I'll handle this my way.

28
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,550
What is she doing?

29
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,550
What is she doing?

30
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,030
How shameless can she be!

31
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,210
She kissed Young Master Wang!

32
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,870
She kissed Young Master Wang!

33
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,670
You stop!

34
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,270
Move!

35
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,680
Go away!

36
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,350
You're disgusting! Despicable!

37
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,590
You're expelled!

38
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,830
Get out!

39
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,100
You filthy, vile thing!

40
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,460
You've lived together this whole time—

41
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,390
and didn't notice if she's male or female?

42
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,700
How could she be a man?

43
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,110
We've bathed together.

44
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,570
All of you?

45
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,909
Of course.

46
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,390
We all bathed together.

47
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,230
We've seen each other all over.

48
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,270
She's not a man,

49
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,110
but definitely a weirdo.

50
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,670
Hua Gu.

51
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,710
You kissed him!

52
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,350
Hua Gu!

53
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,430
You...

54
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,990
Go back.

55
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,120
You just wait!

56
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,440
No training today—dismissed.

57
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,150
Kissed him!

58
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,610
Hua Gu, who gave you the authority to expel people?

59
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,470
Come with me.

60
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,990
Unbelievable!

61
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,360
Despicable!

62
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,190
She's so over the line!

63
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,250
-Never seen someone so shameless.
-That's too much!

64
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,030
Despicable!

65
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,990
Clothes thief!

66
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,070
What was that for?

67
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,750
You've been dying to do this, haven't you?

68
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,510
Yeah.

69
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,030
Today, we've resolved a major issue.

70
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,960
Wanna head out for some fresh air?

71
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,430
Sure.

72
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,950
It's time you saw my true self.

73
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,350
Worse than what I've already seen?

74
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,150
Qing Cai.

75
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,390
What you did was impressive.

76
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,390
I like it.

77
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,070
No training today.

78
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,460
What are you going to do?

79
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,070
I want to go to town to buy a few things.

80
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,330
Who's coming with me?

81
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,260
I need to grab some stuff too.

82
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,710
I'll pass—

83
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,710
it's too far.

84
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,360
Then we'll leave.

85
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,950
Bye.

86
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,670
Bye.

87
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,990
Gao Yin, let's catch bugs in the mountains!

88
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,030
Let's go.

89
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,520
Take a look! Fresh cabbages here—just picked!

90
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,850
Check out these leaves.

91
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,570
You used to wear men's clothes often?

92
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,270
Yes.

93
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,700
Take a look.

94
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,350
Thank you.

95
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,670
I've worn men's clothes

96
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,510
my whole life.

97
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,170
It wasn't until I joined Mingyi Manor

98
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,430
that I started wearing women's clothes.

99
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,970
Must've been tough for you.

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,990
Why?

101
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,750
Nothing.

102
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,270
You know what?

103
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,950
You've been wearing dresses,

104
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,040
so seeing you like this

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,110
feels... Off.

106
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,190
Oh, right!

107
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,419
You were quite fierce earlier.

108
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,750
Wang Yishao

109
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,110
is going to have nightmares.

110
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,070
He's like a crane,

111
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,390
and I'm a butcher.

112
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,830
Plucking feathers and tossing him in the pot!

113
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,630
If he's not having nightmares, that'd be strange.

114
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,150
How was it?

115
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,790
Disgusting all the way through.

116
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,560
Don't act smug after getting a good deal.

117
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,250
With someone like Wang Yishao,

118
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,960
look at those women at Mingyi Manor—

119
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,020
which of them doesn't drool over him?

120
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,410
Count yourself lucky.

121
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,680
What about you?

122
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,370
What about me?

123
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,910
Are you really jealous?

124
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,830
Fresh cabbages!

125
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,030
Come take a look!

126
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,990
You, in that outfit, look just like a man.

127
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,190
Who'd get jealous?

128
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,750
Exactly—I'm just a man.

129
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,030
Who cares if you're jealous?

130
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,510
Come on, Miss!

131
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,170
Come have a taste, young lady.

132
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,190
Don't go.

133
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,980
Try one bite.

134
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,710
Young lady, don't go.

135
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,480
Take a look, take a look.

136
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:41,990
Just take a look.

137
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,870
What are you doing?

138
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,630
Boss.

139
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,880
What are you doing? What are you doing?

140
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,680
-What are you doing?
-Boss!

141
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,710
-Why are you harassing girls?
-No, no, no.

142
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,550
Stop hitting.

143
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,390
I can't take it anymore!

144
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,790
Then lick it clean!

145
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,590
Stop! Stop!

146
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,130
My guts are about to spill!

147
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,870
Boss, I was wrong.

148
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,130
Great, then we'll make sausage out of it!

149
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,590
That's what you get for harassing girls.

150
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,710
And you—

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,330
can't you control them?

152
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,830
Can't you... And you're still laughing?

153
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,510
You.

154
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,590
Dodging?

155
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,420
Why don't you take care of this?

156
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,910
Boss, I have something important to tell you.

157
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,620
Let's talk somewhere else.

158
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,070
How about it?

159
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,830
Fine. Meet me at the ruined temple later.

160
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,430
Okay.

161
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,230
And keep them in line.

162
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,620
No more harassing women!

163
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,550
Let's go.

164
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,270
I didn't harass anyone!

165
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,310
This is your usual hangout?

166
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,750
It's where I teach.

167
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,830
Teach?

168
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,310
Teach those pigs.

169
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,110
You really do seem like a pro pig farmer.

170
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,310
Here come your piglets.

171
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,990
Why are you acting like a thief?

172
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,870
I'm afraid of being followed.

173
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,560
With the way you act, of course someone will follow you.

174
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,390
Hey, this guy looks kinda familiar.

175
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,380
Don't talk nonsense. How could you know him?

176
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,950
But they do

177
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,110
look familiar.

178
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,230
You used to hang around town too, didn't you?

179
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,590
You probably didn't spend much time

180
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,590
with them though.

181
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,590
When I went to town, it was either for business or to beat them up.

182
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,710
Which gang were you with?

183
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,260
How come we don't know you?

184
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,230
Come on,

185
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,440
he's out of your league.

186
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,310
He's a professional assassin!

187
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,510
Boss, boss, boss!

188
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,270
You really sway with the wind.

189
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,600
Anyone stronger than you becomes "Boss."

190
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,430
Alright, let's get serious.

191
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,870
Boss, you might've been exposed.

192
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,750
You know?

193
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,830
Spill the details.

194
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,870
Tuan's cousin

195
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,630
used to hang out with us.

196
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,240
Then he took a job running errands at that brothel.

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,910
He's the one who brought in the makeup artist.

198
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,710
That makeup woman

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
That makeup lady got into a jealousy spat yesterday.

200
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,110
Somehow, the fact

201
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,210
that she did your makeup slipped out.

202
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,910
Maybe one of us accidentally blabbed.

203
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,590
She found out about Mingyi Manor

204
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,850
and started bragging.

205
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,190
She said her male client fooled

206
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,030
even Mingyi Manor's people.

207
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,110
While boasting, she got into a fight—

208
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,350
badly beaten.

209
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,140
She was badly hurt and even called for help.

210
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,950
How badly?

211
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,590
Missing an arm or a leg?

212
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,550
No, she was knocked to the ground,

213
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,790
and couldn't get up. Probably internal injuries.

214
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,910
A Tuan's cousin

215
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,510
Tuan's cousin told us,

216
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,860
and we thought it was serious.

217
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,310
So, we sneaked her out.

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,970
Sneaked her out?

219
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,310
You kidnapped her?

220
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,790
Just to scare her.

221
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,510
We told her this was a grave matter

222
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,380
and leaking information

223
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,580
would get her killed.

224
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,110
She panicked

225
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,660
and begged us to hide her.

226
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,600
We're treating her injuries now.

227
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,950
Thanks for the help.

228
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,150
This is a big favor. I owe you one.

229
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,230
It's nothing.

230
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Later, people from Mingyi Manor really came looking.

231
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,160
How do you know they're from Mingyi Manor?

232
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,030
Those women with weapons

233
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,530
are definitely from Mingyi Manor.

234
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,170
They went to the brothel too?

235
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,710
Yes.

236
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,230
They must have a spy there.

237
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,630
They didn't find that makeup artist,

238
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,190
so they questioned us instead.

239
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,870
Mingyi Manor didn't know

240
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,050
we were connected to you.

241
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,500
But I bet

242
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,350
that woman let it slip as well.

243
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,730
We weren't prepared,

244
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,080
but we stuck to our code—

245
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,360
didn't spill a word.

246
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,590
Good to know my help wasn't wasted.

247
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,610
Since I've helped you once,

248
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,270
I'll see it through to the end.

249
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,350
You guys really have a talent for this.

250
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,920
From running a stall

251
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,160
to blocking roads—

252
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,510
it's quite a leap.

253
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,630
We're not robbing anyone!

254
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,630
They don't even have anything worth stealing.

255
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,070
We're just left with scraps—we've eaten so much we're sick of it!

256
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,980
Maybe stop looking so fierce then.

257
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,290
Who does business like that?

258
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,260
Can't you smile?

259
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,990
Smile?

260
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,670
How?

261
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,170
We need to smile to do business?

262
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,510
You don't even know how to smile?

263
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,640
Of course I know how.

264
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,750
But I don't know how to fake a smile.

265
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,500
Who said anything about fake smiles?

266
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,630
Well, I can't manage a real one either.

267
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,630
One more thing—

268
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,510
you can't let anyone know

269
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,630
that I know you.

270
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,390
If you see me on the road,

271
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,590
act like we're strangers.

272
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,470
It's for your own safety. Got it?

273
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,230
But didn't you just

274
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,470
beat me up in front of everyone?

275
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,100
Does the person throwing punches need to know their target?

276
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,910
Of course.

277
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,270
I only beat people I know.

278
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,070
Exactly.

279
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,870
You'd never hit a stranger—

280
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,910
you don't know how dangerous they might be.

281
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,970
Exactly, exactly.

282
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,320
Alright, fine. That was my bad.

283
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,750
It won't happen again.

284
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,270
Also,

285
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,510
I need you to spread something for me—

286
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,410
that Mingyi Manor abuses their new disciples.

287
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,910
No furniture, no beds,

288
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,650
and everyone's crammed into one room.

289
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,630
This...

290
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,990
-This...
-This is our specialty.

291
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,310
Piece of cake.

292
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,030
Leave it to us.

293
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,290
Sharing a room with a bunch of girls, huh?

294
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,390
Living the dream!

295
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:49,860
Not even close.

296
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,270
Not even close.

297
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,020
It's a room full of ugly freaks.

298
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,910
Happy now?

299
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,670
Ah, so a room full of freaks.

300
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,930
Don't worry, we'll rescue you in no time!

301
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:05,990
Alright,

302
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,870
start practicing your fake smiles.

303
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,930
We're leaving now.

304
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,270
Did you just call me a freak?

305
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,110
It was just to shut them up.

306
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,960
You're sure enjoying yourself.

307
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,130
Our room

308
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,480
may not be filled with absolute stunners,

309
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,020
but they're definitely better than average.

310
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,670
Better than average? Please.

311
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,130
You're really shameless.

312
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,440
What's there to be ashamed of?

313
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,390
Let's sit here for a while.

314
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,150
What can I get for you two?

315
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,670
Tea, please.

316
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,480
Coming right up.

317
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,190
Thank you.

318
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,390
Please enjoy.

319
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,700
Men and women should keep their distance.

320
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,470
Why do you keep pinching me?

321
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,070
Do you have feelings for me?

322
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,490
Stop flattering yourself.

323
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,510
Drink your tea.

324
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,980
I said something wrong again.

325
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm such an idiot.

326
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,960
You were never smart.

327
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,790
You said you spent time

328
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,819
in this town,

329
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,950
but when we were walking around,

330
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,069
you looked so unfamiliar with it.

331
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,970
Back then, I only focused on making tools to take my revenge—

332
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,270
no time to sightsee.

333
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,069
How old were you?

334
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,550
Around thirteen, I think.

335
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,670
That young?

336
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,190
My uncle and I fled the country together.

337
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,030
When I was ten,

338
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,510
he died in a foreign land.

339
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,470
Later, I heard

340
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,880
Mingyi Manor wasn't far from the capital,

341
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,550
so I begged my way

342
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,310
to the capital first

343
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,070
and then made my way to this town.

344
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,360
Those three years on the road,

345
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,990
I nearly died several times.

346
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,780
Why did you have to flee your country?

347
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,090
Mingyi Manor wiped out my entire family.

348
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,230
Only my uncle escaped with me.

349
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,670
We wandered for ten years.

350
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,290
Ever since I can remember,

351
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,350
my life's been full of hardship.

352
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,070
No wonder you hate Mingyi Manor so much.

353
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,390
My uncle told me

354
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,880
it was Yinniang who led the attack.

355
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,590
So, are you planning to kill

356
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,150
everyone at Mingyi Manor?

357
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,790
I only hate the one who led the charge.

358
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,230
The others

359
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,350
were just following orders.

360
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,470
I heard before

361
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,070
I heard that Mingyi Manor wiped out the Mo Clan.

362
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
You're not from the Mo Clan, are you?

363
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,040
That explains your skills with traps and mechanisms.

364
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,910
I only know the basics.

365
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,470
A lot of it

366
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
is just theoretical knowledge.

367
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,430
So that's why you

368
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,950
burn through so many materials—

369
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,860
you've never actually built much before.

370
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,870
Exactly. I'm broke.

371
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,970
How am I supposed to

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,810
afford materials without money?

373
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,070
And I called you greedy before...

374
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,190
Sorry, I had no idea.

375
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,510
It's fine.

376
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,450
After so many years out there,

377
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,870
I've heard worse.

378
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,900
You're practically kind.

379
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,830
I thought I was pretty mean.

380
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,190
You? Mean?

381
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,260
With all that chirping

382
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,370
and carefree attitude?

383
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,310
Let me tell you,

384
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,770
when I used to have a big beard,

385
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,110
I was terrifying—

386
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,730
people ran at the sight of me!

387
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,570
Now that you mention it,

388
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,710
last time

389
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,870
you yanked your beard off,

390
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,960
you were wincing like crazy.

391
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,270
So it was real?

392
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,450
♫A gentle breeze brushes past the bright moon♫

393
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,250

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,620

let's visit the blacksmith's shop.

Okay.

Old Monkey!
(Blacksmith's Shop)

475
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,910
I've told you a million times...

476
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,160
Master Zhang.

477
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,290
You two never learn.

478
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,190
You Cheeky Monkey, why are you here?

479
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,350
Just swinging by the monkey's den

480
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,940
to see if you, Old Monkey, can still bounce around.

481
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,950
Old Monkey?

482
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,210
Today I'll deal with you, Cheeky Monkey!

483
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,780
I've never seen Master Zhang this lively before.

484
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,910
Who is this?

485
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,310
Dark Egg!

486
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,770
You... how did you become so fair-skinned?

487
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,590
Dark Egg?

488
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,070
Yeah, back then

489
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,870
I'd smear my face and body black.

490
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,070
Dark Egg.

491
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,390
No, now I should call you Light Egg.

492
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,820
Got some time?

493
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,870
Think you can help me design something else?

494
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,710
That bellows you upgraded for me

495
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,130
work exceptionally well.

496
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,630
Really?

497
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,510
Absolutely.

498
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,810
Other blacksmiths come by

499
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,150
just to place orders.

500
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,310
Sure, no problem.

501
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,390
Great!

502
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,810
By the way, Master Zhang,

503
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,590
do we have any big households here

504
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,640
that would need some kind of burglar alarm system?

505
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,950
You mean anti-theft devices?

506
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,720
Those are more common in the capital.

507
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,540
We've only got a few wealthy families around here.

508
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,670
Don't worry,

509
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,410
it should fetch a good price.

510
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,990
Rich folks are always

511
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,640
willing to spend to protect their money.

512
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,590
But that kind of system is complicated.

513
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,910
Must be tricky to make.

514
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,990
Complicated?

515
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,110
Hmm, might be tough.

516
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,230
There is only one forge

517
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,270
in my shop.

518
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,540
If it's occupied for too long,

519
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
I won't have time for anything else.

520
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,550
Little Monkey handles robes and bowls

521
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,030
while Old Monkey begs for food.

522
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,090
Think it's doable?

523
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,070
Well, Little Monkey, grab some fabric

524
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,830
and let me try on a robe.

525
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,790
Sure, I'll get some later.

526
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,830
Just don't let it end up like a monkey trying to grab the moon—

527
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,760
all for nothing.

528
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,150
No problem.

529
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,270
I'll test the waters first.

530
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,710
Worst case, I just get a bath out of it.

531
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,110
Why do you two talk like riddling monks?

532
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,510
I don't get it.

533
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,770
Let's ignore him.

534
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,750
Now tell me,

535
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,510
got anything else good,

536
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,860
like that bellows?

537
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,360
Something practical.

538
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,590
I do have some new ideas,

539
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,990
but I need to think them over.

540
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,110
Next time, I'll let you know.

541
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,640
Have to wait until next time?

542
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,590
It's a promise then.

543
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,720
You'd better bring me something good when you come back.

544
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,340
Old Monkey, I'm leaving.

545
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,230
Alright.

546
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,510
You go ahead.

547
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,910
Bye.

548
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,630
Bye.

549
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,750
This kid.

550
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,830
Why were you talking in riddles with Master Zhang?

551
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,550
Master Zhang used to be a Taoist cultivator.

552
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,840
He thought his worldly experience was lacking,

553
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,570
so he opened a blacksmith shop.

554
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,750
He's been running it for over twenty years.

555
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,610
But he still feels he hasn't reached perfection.

556
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,550
He also knows my teacher.

557
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,820
The first time I met him

558
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,280
was at my teacher's place.

559
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,500
They both talked like that,

560
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,830
so I picked it up.

561
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,750
Anyway, when talking to them,

562
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,830
as long as it doesn't sound human, it's right.

563
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,830
Wanna learn?

564
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,950
No.

565
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm perfectly comfortable being human.

566
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,870
Being an immortal seems exhausting.

567
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,110
It suits a weirdo like me perfectly.

568
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,870
I used to think

569
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,000
that you talk in a jumbled way

570
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,680
because of some deeper reason,

571
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,950
but now I see—

572
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,860
you've just been refined by a group of weirdos.

573
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,720
Looks like you're starting to get interesting too.

574
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,020
I've always been interesting!

575
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,070
Come check it out, folks!

576
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,690
Sounds good.

577
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,820
I haven't had much street food before.

578
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,280
Take a look!

579
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,590
Grilled skewers here! Take a look!

580
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,110
We'll have a few of everything.

581
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,670
Great! Come inside.

582
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,510
Have a seat!

583
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,270
Come, come.

584
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:10,790
Sit inside.

585
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,550
Okay.

586
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,500
So lively and full of life.

587
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,910
Here come the skewers!

588
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,310
How much is it?

589
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,910
I'll pay.

590
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,350
This gentleman's paying.

591
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,750
Alright.

592
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,480
Go ahead and eat.

593
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,160
Okay.

594
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,920
This is the first time someone's treated me to food.

595
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,070
Today's full of firsts for you, huh?

596
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,030
First time trying street food,

597
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,740
first time being treated,

598
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,900
first time wandering the streets,

599
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,230
first time having someone to wander with.

600
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,280
And now, my first time feeling a bit melancholy.

601
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,510
You...

602
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,030
You've never felt sad before?

603
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,900
How should I put it...

604
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,950
My mind was always full of

605
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,720
numbness, fear, and revenge.

606
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,960
There wasn't room for sadness.

607
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,110
But...

608
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,590
But today shouldn't be sad.

609
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,320
It's supposed to be a happy day.

610
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,330
You don't get it.

611
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,710
It's because today should've been joyful—

612
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,380
eating delicious food,

613
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,230
seeing all this lively, bustling life—

614
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,350
that I realize

615
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,300
I've never truly lived.

616
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,870
I've never experienced even

617
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,950
the simplest joys of this world.

618
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,250
And that thought is just a little sad.

619
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,430
Then… Eat more.

620
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,270
This really is delicious.

621
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,110
Come take a look.

622
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,440
Take a look, beautiful.

623
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,750
Skewers here!

624
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,350
Skewers!

625
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,320
Why did you decide to help them?

626
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,590
Didn't you think of it before?

627
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,670
I was planning to borrow money from them recently,

628
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,640
but it turns out they're all broke.

629
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,360
Then they suggested starting a business,

630
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,620
and I knew I had to help.

631
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,020
Before, I just saw them

632
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,030
as ordinary hooligans,

633
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,670
but now,

634
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,970
they seem kind of endearing.

635
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,630
They're just small fry,

636
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,030
floating aimlessly,

637
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,390
unable to stir up trouble.

638
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,830
But if they mess up,

639
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,680
they'll end up cooked in the pot.

640
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,670
Teach a man to fish, huh?

641
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,740
You're genuinely helping them.

642
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,610
This is really delicious.

643
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,070
Glutinous rice balls!

644
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,670
Glutinous rice balls!

645
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,070
Boss told us to smile.

646
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,810
We should smile.

647
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,630
Yes, yes, yes, smile.

648
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,300
Glutinous rice balls!

649
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,840
Glutinous rice balls!

650
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,790
You know,

651
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
this is the happiest

652
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,030
I've ever been while eating.

653
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,990
Me too.

654
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,770
What if

655
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,470
we eat like this every day?

656
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,310
Do you think we'll turn into Hu Jiao?

657
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,430
What's wrong with being like Hu Jiao?

658
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,910
She looks so happy

659
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,920
and healthy every day.

660
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,630
If I do end up

661
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,610
gaining a lot of weight,

662
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,990
will you dislike me?

663
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,350
Yes.

664
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,750
You're all over the place.

665
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,190
Nonsense! Lies!

666
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,030
Once we're full,

667
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,940
we can go over there and look around.

668
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
I want to check out the other stalls.

669
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,290
They seem to have a lot of interesting things.

670
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,690
There's more over there.

671
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,760

Sir,

726
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,750
can I take a look at that black fabric?

727
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,390
Does your shop

728
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,990
have tailoring tools?

729
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,850
Yes, in the back.

730
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,470
And we can process things here too.

731
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,600
No need, I just need to borrow the tools for a bit.

732
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,250
If you buy fabric, you can borrow them.

733
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,990
But thread costs extra.

734
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,830
What's this, pay for the outhouse

735
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,030
but no toilet paper?

736
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,920
Every little bit counts. Even flies are meat.

737
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,710
Look at you,

738
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
all claws and fangs—

739
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,170
thinking you're a spider now.

740
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,350
Want me to catch you a fly to eat?

741
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,470
Fine,

742
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,400
if you don't use too much thread, I'll let you have it.

743
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,290
Not much, not much.

744
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,030
Definitely not much.

745
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,710
I barely use any.

746
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,750
Alright then. Come on in.

747
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,870
Let's go.

748
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,780
♫What kind of encounter♫

749
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,190
♫Sparks both tenderness and excitement?♫

750
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,470
♫I can see in your eyes♫

751
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,320
♫A vast and boundless sky♫

752
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,280
♫Brushing past in a sea of people♫

753
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,360
♫Waiting for time to glance back♫

754
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,650
♫If love shines like a shooting star♫

755
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,240
♫Who can truly hold it close?♫

756
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,950
♫The wandering I long endured♫

757
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,940
♫Once had someone by my side♫

758
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,080
♫The heartfelt moments in my memory♫

759
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,760
♫How to describe them with words?♫

760
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,240
♫I dare not reach out♫

761
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,530
♫Afraid to shatter the dream♫

762
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,510
♫Guarding the roots and sprouts♫

763
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,870
♫Of my unwavering resolve♫

764
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,050
♫Gazing into those eyes♫

765
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,600
♫Doubts should no longer remain♫

766
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,400
♫Don't let a sincere heart go to waste♫

767
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,600
♫How could this love bear♫

768
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,770
♫To be lost♫

769
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,410
♫What kind of encounter♫

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,920

♫Who can truly hold it close?♫

777
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,690
We're not some notorious bandits.

778
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,090
We wouldn't resort to robbing and looting.

779
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,180
Don't worry.

780
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,290
Based on your pricing,

781
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,350
it should be just over ten coins.

782
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,810
Are you charging eleven?

783
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,190
No need, ten is enough.

784
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,630
Weren't you acting like a spider earlier?

785
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,389
And now you're buzzing—

786
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,270
have you turned into a mosquito?

787
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,010
I wouldn't dare.

788
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,750
I... I'm just a mosquito.

789
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,830
Including the thread, here's eleven coins.

790
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,310
Let's go.

791
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,630
You,

792
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,190
just look at you.

793
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,600
Why do you like teasing people so much?

794
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,790
Everyone's got free time anyway,

795
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,120
so why not have some fun?

796
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,210
I think that shop assistant

797
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,560
was scared out of his wits just now.

798
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,239
Doesn't a little scare make it more exciting?

799
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,810
When we leave,

800
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,270
he'll immediately feel relieved and happy.

801
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,750
Will he?

802
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,090
You're actually being more frightening this way.

803
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,950
He won't be able to sleep tonight.

804
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,260
Have you always been like this, teasing people?

805
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,540
You're even spot-on about their every move.

806
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,150
My teacher used to call me "monkey" when I was little.

807
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,320
Being called that so much, I've turned into a real monkey.

808
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,250
Can't sit still.

809
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,990
Let's go.

810
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,700
This is hilarious.

811
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,390
What are you doing?

812
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,470
Nothing,

813
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,150
just felt like looking at you.

814
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,230
Help me up.

815
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,710
Suddenly,

816
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,200
♫A gentle breeze brushes past the bright moon♫

817
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
seeing you dressed like a woman—
♫A gentle breeze brushes past the bright moon♫

818
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,310

00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,040
it's so strange.

♫Your radiance spreads softly in the wind♫

822
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,220
Does it feel like "a monkey in a crown"?

824
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,170
I don't know about the crown,

825
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,860
♫Your quiet arrival♫

839
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,350
Look,

840
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,910
the area above this section is full of barriers.

841
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,590
But this little path has none.

842
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,290
Then we'll have to come at night.

843
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,150
We can't show up here too often.

844
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,550
Otherwise, if all those barriers disappear,

845
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,430
it'll be obvious it was us.

846
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,460
Let's go first.

847
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,140
Since you're already here,

848
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,870
why not come in for some tea?

849
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,350
Gao Yin already knew I was a man earlier.

850
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,680
Yishao,

851
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,310
you're being rude.

852
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,720
Let's go inside first.

853
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,590
I'm sorry.

854
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,990
I was out of line before.

855
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,030
I hope you don't mind.

856
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,700
Let's just have tea together.

857
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,050
Is there something odd about me?

858
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,990
No, nothing odd.

859
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,270
I'm just a bit curious.

860
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,070
I am a doctor.

861
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,180
As long as I'm not offended,

862
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,320
I treat everyone equally—

863
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,590
no matter their identity,

864
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,070
gender,

865
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,030
or status.

866
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,990
I understand that.

867
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,390
But you know my curiosity isn't just about that.

868
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,350
I know.

869
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,630
Everyone has their own reasons for what they do.

870
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,150
I assume you've figured out some things too.

871
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,430
More or less.

872
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:45,990
Thank you.

873
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,940
You're welcome.

874
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,390
Gao Yin is way too sharp.

875
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,190
Just one glance, and she figured it all out.

876
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,710
As a doctor,

877
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,950
you've seen so much—

878
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,330
life and death, sickness and aging,

879
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,630
and the fragility of life itself.

880
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,540
Does that make you see us

881
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,750
as nothing more than little jumping mice?

882
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,480
Not that exaggerated.

883
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,030
I still see people differently.

884
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,950
Not much better than mice, though.

885
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,070
You know,

886
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,630
I think it's safer for me

887
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,110
if we are friends.

888
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,990
At least I won't drown in people's spit,

889
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,810
get killed by glares, or suffocated by resentment.

890
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,370
Isn't that what Han Aizhen said?

891
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,270
Yes. I think it's pretty accurate, actually.

892
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,870
Sounds like you weren't too deeply invested in him.

893
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,430
A little setback, and you're ready to give up?

894
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,790
I enjoyed talking to her.

895
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,190
Yes.

896
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,390
I remember the last time we were here,

897
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,300
we toasted with tea instead of wine.

898
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,190
Yes,

899
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,390
that was such a peculiar tea-drinking session.

900
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,190
Yes,

901
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,610
we were all acting a little strange that day.

902
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,510
Why was that?

903
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,890
After I went back that day,

904
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,070
I really reflected on my feelings.

905
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,230
I had never felt that way before.

906
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,710
It was like...

907
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,280
Falling in love.

908
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,990
So...

909
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,400
I wanted to face my feelings head-on.

910
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,760
But you're a "celestial crane".

911
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,310
In the end, aren't you supposed to ride the crane to the afterlife?

912
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,940
How can you entertain such worldly feelings?

913
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,260
You're the one riding a crane to the afterlife.

914
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,480
Are you glaring at me?

915
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,680
Don't tell me you're really thinking about giving up immortality for love.

916
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,870
What a fool.

917
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,470
I really am a fool.

918
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,150
Why did I have to bring up such a sensitive topic?

919
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,110
Thank you.

920
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,310
Well, you were the one who made the first move,

921
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,530
so don't blame me for not treating you like just a friend.

922
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,150
This...

923
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,420
This is the first time in my life anyone's given me flowers.

924
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,510
I'm very happy.

925
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,790
Not bad.

926
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,470
Cheers.

927
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,520
We're out of tea.

928
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,190
Aren't you skilled at using poisons?

929
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,320
How do you also know how to heal people?

930
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,470
My master was a doctor and my mistress was a poisoner.

931
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,440
You're trained in both medicine and poison.

932
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,710
Then who could possibly be worthy of you?

933
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,760
I'll just find an immortal.

934
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,510
An immortal? That's too hard to find, isn't it?

935
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,600
Gao Yin, looks like you've got a tough road ahead.

936
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,960
Don't you think?

937
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,820
I have great respect for her.

938
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,430
From the way you look,

939
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,190
it seems like you're afraid of her.

940
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,270
Are you worried she'll poison you in the future?

941
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,840
Looks like you're admitting it.

942
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
From what you're saying,

943
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,530
you two must've known each other for a long time.

944
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,960
I treated him before.

945
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,610
I'm very grateful to her.

946
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,640
Back then, I broke out in rashes.

947
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,780
Luckily, you were there.

948
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,070
I remember—you told me about it.

949
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,830
That time with the cat, right?

950
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,630
Yeah, and you almost…

951
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,670
Almost didn't make it.

952
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,510
So, Gao Yin's your lifesaver.

953
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,070
I never properly thanked you.

954
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,510
Thank you.

955
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,600
No need to thank me.

956
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,560
You've got such a strong constitution.

957
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,750
I haven't seen you since then.

958
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,730
Listen to what you just said.

959
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,070
Shouldn't you be saying,

960
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,590
"Hopefully, I'll never have to see you again"?

961
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,870
If you meet again,

962
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,890
it's probably because his life's in danger, right?

963
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,190
Gao Yin,

964
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,700
have you ever used poison to harm anyone?

965
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,470
Never.

966
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,110
Then why are you here at Mingyi Manor?

967
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,310
Is there someone you need to treat?

968
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,430
I'm...

969
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,180
here to protect Mingyi Manor

970
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,400
from being poisoned.

971
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,690
What about you?

972
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,930
Are you here to protect Mingyi Manor too?

973
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,710
Yes.

974
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,980
Why isn't Hu Jiao following us today?

975
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,350
It is a bit strange.

976
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,280
Maybe Wang Yishao gave up.

977
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,270
Or… maybe it's "love me, love my dog."

978
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,590
"Love me, love my dog"?

979
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,770
What does that mean?

980
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,220
♫A gentle breeze brushes past the bright moon♫

00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,460

That's all.

1012

They're mostly in the core area of Mingyi Manor

1013
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,880
and the range we've been moving in.

1014
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,500
There are a total of 48 alarm bells.

1015
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,430
Looks like we've got work tonight.

1016
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,040
Let's head back for now.

1017
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,240
Let's go.

1018
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,400
Only two disabled barriers left.

1019
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,840
Quick, erase any traces—otherwise, we'll be in big trouble.

1020
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,060
Someone's trying to frame us.

1021
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,870
Han Aizhen.

1022
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,400
It's all because you had to throw a tantrum with her.

1023
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,230
Now she's paying us back for it.

1024
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,710
She's also childish.

1025
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,820
Both of you are being childish, bickering like that.

1026
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,910
We're surrounded.

1027
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,060
Do you have a way out?

1028
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,110
Follow me.

1029
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,710
This time, I've caught you all red-handed.
