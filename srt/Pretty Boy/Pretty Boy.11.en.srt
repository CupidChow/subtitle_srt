1
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,590
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,590
(Episode 11)

3
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,670
Don't go.

4
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,150
Don't go.

5
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,640
Don't go.

6
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,340
Don't go.

7
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,590
Here you are.

8
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,220
Jiaoniang, eat.

9
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,630
Eat.

10
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,210
Hu Jiao, eat up.

11
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,190
It'll get cold.

12
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,450
Okay.

13
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,700
What are you eating?

14
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,400
Nothing.

15
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,050
Gan Pu.

16
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,340
I just met Qing Cai these days,

17
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,700
so I've been keeping her to myself.

18
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,579
Now it's fine.

19
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,140
I'll give her back to you.

20
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,510
Tonight,

21
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,579
let's switch beds back.

22
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,690
I've figured it out.

23
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,130
It's because you've been keeping her to yourself these past few days

24
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,950
that she hasn't been able to go hunting.

25
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,140
Yes.

26
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,660
I haven't hunted in two days.

27
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,870
I noticed Mingyi Manor has been

28
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,630
fixing up this broken house these past couple of days.

29
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,210
It seems like they want to make it more spacious for us to live in.

30
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,350
But I see they only have two or three workers,

31
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,470
and the progress is a bit slow.

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,350
How about this?

33
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,310
Let's volunteer to help out together

34
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,910
and get this house fixed quickly.

35
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,550
That's the best idea

36
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,670
I've heard so far.

37
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,450
Alright then.

38
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
The strongest one must be Qing Cai, right?

39
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,240
Why do you think that one is Qing Cai?

40
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,290
Why?

41
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,150
It suits you.

42
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,270
Someone like you, with your delicate personality,

43
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,070
needs someone strong to keep you in check,

44
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,770
don't you think?

45
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,790
What about Gan Pu then?

46
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,710
Gan Pu?

47
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,000
The one in white,

48
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,920
with that ethereal temperament,

49
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,850
must be Gan Pu, right?

50
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,670
Why?

51
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,180
She's extraordinary,

52
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,590
a perfect match made by heaven for our Young Master Wang.

53
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,050
Stop talking nonsense!

54
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,760
There are only so many people,

55
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,630
and you managed to guess them all

56
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,040
wrong.

57
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,070
Is that so?

58
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,550
By the way,

59
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,800
I just remembered

60
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,620
I was guessing suitability,

61
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,150
not how easy they are to deal with.

62
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,730
Okay then.

63
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,310
Let...

64
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,560
Let me guess again.

65
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,010
This person,

66
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,740
sharp, capable, good-looking,

67
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,700
neither too masculine nor too feminine.

68
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,030
She must be Qing Cai.

69
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,550
How did you figure that out?

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,970
Because people

71
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,050
often like the ones they can't handle

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,050
and who aren't right for them.

73
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,700
So, it has to be her.

74
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,240
Think carefully.

75
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,240
What about Gan Pu?

76
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,060
Gan Pu...

77
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,710
Honestly, this one's tough,

78
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,590
because you're rather picky.

79
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,420
Well.

80
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,860
Are you here to work or to cause trouble?

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,460
You might as well not work.

82
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,100
You said it. Then I won't work.

83
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,440
It'll save me some effort.

84
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,930
How dare you slack off?

85
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,630
Then we'll just build a cat house.

86
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,980
And you live there with Jiaoniang, alright?

87
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
We...

88
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,940
Alright.

89
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,680
Stop arguing. It's not a big deal.

90
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,110
Let's all work hard together.

91
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,990
More hands make light work, okay?

92
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,140
You're right. I'll be careful.

93
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:53,810
Alright.

94
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,350
Alright, I've figured it out.

95
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,520
That must be Gan Pu.

96
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,250
But she seems to like that

97
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,670
neither-too-masculine-nor-too-feminine woman.

98
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,140
Young Master Wang.

99
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,490
You must be sad.

100
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,330
But there's still a chance.

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,950
It seems those two

102
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,420
have been having some issues lately.

103
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,810
You've got a sharp eye.

104
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,310
How did you figure it out?

105
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,900
Me?

106
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,880
Drifting effortlessly through a garden of flowers,

107
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,510
without letting a single petal cling to me.

108
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,170
They're so busy,

109
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,990
and here we are just standing and watching?

110
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,000
What else can we do?

111
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,530
Are we supposed to go and help them?

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
Let me help you.

113
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,820
You're so delicate.

114
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,180
Can you handle this kind of rough work?

115
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,170
I can manage.

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,470
Are you here to help too?

117
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,060
Come on.

118
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,610
I told you not to go, didn't I?

119
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,790
You're just asking for trouble.

120
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,000
What are you doing here?

121
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,580
There's so much work to do, and you're not helping.

122
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Come help me move this stuff!

123
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,500
Let's go, down there.

124
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,940
Down there.

125
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,919
Tighten it.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,720
Down you go.

127
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,990
I'll kick you if you don't move!

128
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,170
Get in there!

129
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,330
Help out!

130
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,200
They're really a perfect pair, huh?

131
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,280
Get inside!

132
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,140
Weren't you here to help? Then help!

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,750
Why would I help here?

134
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,350
Then where do you want to help?

135
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,460
Oh, are you looking down on me?

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,520
You've got some nerve!

137
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
Hurry up and get to work!

138
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,370
Go help.

139
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,530
Hurry up.

140
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,460
Are you okay?

141
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,380
It's okay.

142
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,560
Throw it up.

143
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,810
I told you not to get involved.

144
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,410
You're not cut out for this kind of work.

145
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,310
You alright?

146
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,040
Yeah, I'm fine.

147
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,910
Let me see.

148
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,470
I'm fine.

149
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,360
Just put some medicine on it.

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
We're

151
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,440
more suited for the finer things in life.

152
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,320
Doing this feels like burning a zither to cook a crane.

153
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,840
Thank you.

154
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,290
You'd better not meddle in this kind of rough work.

155
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,370
Let's keep going.

156
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm not that fragile.

157
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,330
Alright, come on.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,850
Not bad!

159
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,610
You're actually pulling your weight.

160
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,180
People live to learn endlessly.

161
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
To stop learning is to stagnate.

162
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,570
The scariest thing is laziness,

163
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,060
just like that guy.

164
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,010
Alright, head over there.

165
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,570
Okay.

166
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,190
Over there.

167
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,600
Be careful.

168
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,120
(Wine)

169
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,250
Delicious stinky tofu.
(Wine)

170
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:10,760
Delicious stinky tofu.

171
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,490
(Wine)
Delicious stinky tofu.

172
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:11,510
(Wine)

173
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,110
Take a look, come see!
(Wine)

174
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,360
(Wine)

175
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,730
Spicy hot pot?
(Wine)

176
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,260
Spicy hot pot?

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,870
There's no charcoal left. I'll grab some.

178
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,550
Come on, take a look! Come and see!

179
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,940
Follow me.

180
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,660
Come with me and keep it quiet.

181
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,730
-This...
-Have a taste.

182
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,690
I heard you often have nightmares at night.

183
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,050
I'm not prying into your private life.

184
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,760
I just think your stress is too much.

185
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,980
It will affect your health.

186
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,910
When I was young,

187
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,650
I often had nightmares too.

188
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,410
When I woke up scared from a nightmare,

189
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,800
I didn't dare go back to sleep,

190
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,120
nor did I dare light a candle.

191
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,150
I'd just sit there until morning.

192
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,450
Because my father didn't like weak children.

193
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,750
I didn't expect you to have gone through that kind of life.

194
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,530
Actually, everyone has nightmares sometimes.

195
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,070
Even now, as an adult,

196
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,120
I still occasionally have scary dreams.

197
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,270
When I wake up from a nightmare,

198
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,960
I'll light a candle and then go back to sleep.

199
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,340
So,

200
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,700
is it better to have someone who looks after you

201
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,350
or to have no one?

202
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,110
I can't tell anymore.

203
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,790
When I was young, I often had nightmares too.

204
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,540
But I was very poor

205
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,180
and couldn't afford candles.

206
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,200
So every time I had a nightmare,

207
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,980
I would just lie in bed and wait for the morning light.

208
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,250
Do you think

209
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,260
this counts as a kind of weakness?

210
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,860
This has nothing to do with weakness.

211
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,390
You're just a young girl living a precarious life,

212
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,830
already bearing pressures others couldn't handle.

213
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,630
Having nightmares is perfectly normal.

214
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,070
But

215
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,100
you've managed to maintain that innocence and calmness,

216
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,170
which is already a strength I can't even compare to.

217
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,070
I'm not as strong as you say.

218
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,790
How do I put it?

219
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,680
I just think

220
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,300
that if a person is always

221
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,030
in a dangerous situation,

222
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,020
they'll naturally

223
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
learn how to adapt.

224
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,460
That's not necessarily true.

225
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,240
If I were in your situation,

226
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,670
I probably wouldn't have been able to hold on.

227
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,190
Don't underestimate yourself like that.

228
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,290
People don't know their limits

229
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,430
until they face the most dangerous moments.

230
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,710
Maybe it's because

231
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,790
I grew up in a comfortable environment.

232
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,740
I can't imagine it.

233
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,830
Comfortable?

234
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,870
I always thought

235
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,530
that royal family members like you

236
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,190
grew up in the midst of storms

237
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,170
and struggles.

238
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,810
I guess I've been relatively lucky.

239
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,380
Because of my personality, maybe.

240
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,370
I don't push too hard or fight for anything,

241
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,390
so my brother took care of me in every way.

242
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,140
So I didn't get involved in those struggles.

243
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,260
That means

244
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,860
you and your brother have a great relationship.

245
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,790
Actually, as we grew up,

246
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,370
our relationship

247
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,360
became a lot more distant.

248
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,520
I even started to sense his defensiveness toward me.

249
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,990
That's inevitable in royal families.

250
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,400
What's wrong?

251
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,710
I'm bleeding.

252
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,900
You need someone to suck out the blood for you?

253
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,800
I'll do it.

254
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,800
It's fine. Just a minor injury.

255
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,970
Hey, hey, Gao Yin,

256
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,860
you, you take a look at him.

257
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,010
Didn't he say it's fine?

258
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,210
Why apply medicine then?

259
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,280
You really do play favorites, huh?

260
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,920
Wang Yishao was injured earlier too, wasn't he?

261
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,370
Wang Yishao, did you apply any medicine?

262
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,570
Let me see.

263
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,210
You're okay, right?

264
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,640
Since you're fine, get back to work.

265
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,270
A tangled mess, hard to sever and straighten out.

266
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,500
Ah, youth is wonderful.

267
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,090
You old guy.

268
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,870
The lazier you are, the faster you age.

269
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,100
What's that saying again?

270
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,450
"An old man regains the spirit of youth."

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,990
I admit

272
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm pretty old.

273
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,320
But it also proves

274
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,290
that I've experienced a lot.

275
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,640
Kid.

276
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,030
You're the kid here.

277
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,060
All you talk about is nonsense.

278
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,190
I'm telling you, I'm running out of patience.

279
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,400
If you don't start talking,

280
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,600
I'll kill you.

281
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,220
I already told you.

282
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,170
Our boss left a long time ago.

283
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,440
But each of you said something different.

284
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,760
That's obviously a lie.

285
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,420
Exactly.

286
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,090
Exactly.

287
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,280
That just proves I didn't lie.

288
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,020
What?

289
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,050
Are you treating the four of us like fools,

290
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,130
playing us for fun?

291
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,460
Think about it.

292
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,500
If we had all said the same thing,

293
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,240
it would mean we conspired to deceive you.

294
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,910
-Suddenly, I feel like what he said makes some sense.
-It does make some sense.

295
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,980
Makes sense? What sense?

296
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,200
Look,

297
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,800
their boss might've just left,

298
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,430
but they didn't say where he went.

299
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,640
So they could only guess randomly.

300
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,020
Yeah.

301
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,000
That's why each of them had a different story.

302
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,050
Right?

303
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:16,869
Right, right, right.

304
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,349
Right, right, right.

305
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,050
So?

306
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,890
We figured out the truth!

307
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,829
Aren't you surprised?

308
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,079
You're still the clever one.

309
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,220
Mingyi Manor has come to take him.

310
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,320
Get ready to fight!

311
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,160
Catch the bad guys!

312
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,150
Catch the bad guys!

313
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,170
Catch the bad guys!

314
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,510
Charge!

315
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,550
Charge!

316
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,130
Catch the bad guys!

317
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,120
Catch the bad guys!

318
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,150
Father, come quickly and save me!

319
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,870
These bad guys are causing trouble!

320
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,270
Let's charge forward and fight them!

321
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,710
Catch the bad guys! I'm going to report this to the authorities right now!

322
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,590
You should say you've already reported it.

323
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,190
I've already reported it!

324
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,480
I really have reported it!

325
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,320
Reported it?

326
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,870
I can vouch. My father has already gone to report it!

327
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,390
Retreat!

328
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,360
Let's go, let's go!

329
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
Catch the bad guys!

330
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,630
Catch them!

331
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,790
Chase them!

332
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,790
Don't run! Catch the bad guys!

333
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,630
How did they manage to escape?

334
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,950
I was almost scared out of my wits!

335
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,270
They really got away.

336
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,870
So my drinking here was for nothing?

337
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,160
A total waste.

338
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,350
We won?

339
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,390
We won, we won!

340
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,710
We won, we won!

341
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,270
Old man.

342
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,190
The older people get, the stranger they become.

343
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,700
You two stop working!

344
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,370
Come with me to catch the slackers.

345
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,190
Let's go.

346
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,260
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

347
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,680
Back to work!

348
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,750
Did you see that?

349
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,590
That guy is slacking off.

350
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,620
Get him out of here for me!

351
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,460
You two, clean over there.

352
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,190
We're going to clean up now.

353
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,240
What?

354
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,740
What? Am I in your way here?

355
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,470
Fine. I'll move over here, is that better?

356
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,460
Here, I'll stay here.

357
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,160
You two clean over there.

358
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,680
Am I in your way here too?

359
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,980
Alright.

360
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,800
I'll move over here.

361
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,350
Here, is this okay?

362
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,210
You two, clean that spot.

363
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,440
Get him out of here for me.

364
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,140
What?

365
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,450
Sweep here.

366
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,600
-What are you doing?
-Sweep there, sweep there!

367
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,430
-Hurry up.
-What are you doing?

368
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,910
Hurry up and sweep!

369
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,180
Hurry up and sweep!

370
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,220
Sweep!

371
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
Hurry!

372
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,180
The townspeople brought news.

373
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,570
Those people went after the hooligans.

374
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,190
They finally couldn't hold back anymore.

375
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,500
Which side is it?

376
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,150
It should be the General's men.

377
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,070
They tried to fight as soon as they saw our people.

378
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,760
If it were the Emperor's men, it probably wouldn't have come to this.

379
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,860
Not necessarily.

380
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,700
Who knows what the Emperor is planning?

381
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,500
Maybe he's trying to bypass us.

382
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,710
Or maybe he's worried

383
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,470
that we'd use the former Emperor's son's identity.

384
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,450
That person is well-hidden.

385
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,610
We need to find him quickly. Prolonging this will only lead to trouble.

386
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,850
Those hooligans are important.

387
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,960
The problem is there's no way to start.

388
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,830
These people are as stubborn as they come.

389
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,450
We can't use force.

390
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,400
They're all commoners.

391
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,070
We can't resort to extreme measures.

392
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,370
We could try building a good relationship with them.

393
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,630
We can appeal to emotions.

394
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,460
Can you do that?

395
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,940
When it comes to forming connections,

396
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,030
how could your sour face compete with me?

397
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,360
Alright.

398
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,540
You go ahead then.

399
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,760
Bring along that Han Aizhen.

400
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,990
We need to maintain good relations with her too lately.

401
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,810
Got it. Leave it to me.

402
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,100
Alright, you're dismissed.

403
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,520
To accommodate everyone

404
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,070
and your living conditions,

405
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,090
we've set a new schedule: work in the morning

406
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,290
and lessons in the afternoon.

407
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,360
Why does it have to be work in the morning

408
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,430
and lessons in the afternoon?

409
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,730
Can't you reverse it?

410
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,220
In such hot weather, aren't you afraid of the heat?

411
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,500
Good point.

412
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,160
Alright, lessons in the afternoon then.

413
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,450
Wait a minute.

414
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,370
Can we skip the lessons altogether?

415
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,760
Sure.

416
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,510
Alright,

417
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,200
let's start the lesson now.

418
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,030
Today, we'll learn about makeup.

419
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,440
Makeup? Is it just painting patterns on our face?

420
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,760
Then can I draw a tiger on my face?

421
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,650
I'll draw it here.

422
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,220
I... I don't know how to draw a tiger.

423
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,550
You don't know how? That's so boring.

424
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,540
Are we supposed to end up looking like you, all ambiguous and androgynous?

425
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,500
You could do a super cool look.

426
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,800
Super cool?

427
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,730
How cool can it be?

428
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,410
Let me try.

429
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,680
I finally figured it out.

430
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,440
You look like a well-fed giant panda.

431
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,080
Weird. So weird.

432
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,590
A ghost!

433
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,720
Hong Hui, what are you doing?

434
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,560
No, this is cool!

435
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,830
Not bad.

436
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,190
Is this

437
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,630
really cool?

438
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,150
Cool. Super cool.

439
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,470
Looks good.

440
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,910
Cool works.

441
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,590
Ghosts are the coolest. They scare everyone.

442
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,110
Alright, let's keep it.

443
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,910
I'm quite satisfied.

444
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,670
Of course,

445
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,380
for makeup like this,

446
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,320
pairing it with the right outfit would make it even better.

447
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,710
Come on, let's change clothes.

448
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,720
Let's change.

449
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,190
I look cool.

450
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,990
You do look cool.

451
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,390
So weird.

452
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,270
But there's a touch of cuteness in the weirdness.

453
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,550
And a bit of frightfulness in the cuteness.

454
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,070
Frightfulness is exactly the point.

455
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,640
The ability to scare people is what matters most.

456
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,160
But honestly, this outfit does look pretty good.

457
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,430
The main thing is, it's slimming.

458
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,830
I think,

459
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,390
even though it's a little weird,

460
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,270
it's weird in a unique way.

461
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,150
It gives off a different vibe.

462
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,870
You're quite talented.

463
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,670
This is the first time I've felt a bit like a woman.

464
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,230
See?

465
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,270
You two really are a pair.

466
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,950
This, I can accept.

467
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,870
Alright, give me a cool look too.

468
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,790
No way.

469
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,030
No one here can look cooler than me.

470
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,670
Then I'll give you an even cooler look,

471
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,110
earth-shattering and ghost-weeping cool!

472
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,750
Hong Hui, no favoritism!

473
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,150
Alright, let's do it.

474
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,350
Hong Hui.

475
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,870
Wow, it looks great!

476
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,710
Cool.

477
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,030
Really pretty.

478
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,350
Yes.

479
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,790
Well.

480
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,630
This...

481
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,320
How is this cool?

482
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,510
This...

483
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,630
Isn't this like that, uh, banshee or something?

484
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,950
This is what cool looks like!

485
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,230
How is this not cool?

486
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,970
In my heart,

487
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,660
you're the most perfect goddess!

488
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,670
What... What did you stick on me?

489
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,230
-What did you stick on me?
-Petals.

490
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,700
Well, you might as well

491
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,720
stick a bunch of vegetables on my face!

492
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,850
In my heart,

493
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,870
you are like a pineapple flower,

494
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,700
a flower with the most perfect meaning.

495
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,650
Exactly!

496
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,500
Your makeup leaves me in awe.

497
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,700
I'm completely convinced.

498
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,690
So, I used to be Vegetable. Now I turned into a pineapple flower?

499
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,110
What?

500
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,540
Am I destined to be stuck with plants?

501
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,130
This Qing Cai makes me feel a bit odd somehow,

502
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,600
but I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong.

503
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,800
It seems like she's unhappy with her identity as a woman.

504
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,580
This is so strange.

505
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,800
Could it be that she has some mental issues?

506
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,980
Did they really bathe together?

507
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,180
Yes, everyone confirmed it.

508
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,830
Unless someone is covering for her.

509
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,640
How could she possibly be a man?

510
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,100
We all bathed together.

511
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,390
Did everyone bathe together?

512
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,950
Of course, all of us bathed together.

513
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,530
That's impossible.

514
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,960
They're not even on the same side.

515
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,120
The world is big,

516
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,470
and it's normal for some strange people to exist.

517
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,320
This... This makeup is awful.

518
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,150
Take it off for me.

519
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,750
Alright.

520
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,720
Maybe it's just a difference in aesthetics.

521
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,260
Forget it. Don't take it off.

522
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,660
Is there anything else you're not satisfied with?

523
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,950
I can adjust it for you.

524
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,060
I trust your skills. No need to look anymore.

525
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,850
Don't overthink it.

526
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,050
I don't mean anything else.

527
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,670
I... I understand what you mean.

528
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,210
How is it?

529
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,650
You kept looking at me just now.

530
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,450
Are you interested in me again?

531
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,850
Your makeup looks good.

532
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,660
You...

533
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,810
Are you implying that

534
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,640
a crow, even if dressed as a phoenix, is still a crow?

535
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,620
You're smart.

536
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,340
Don't worry.

537
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,110
Young Master Wang values inner beauty.

538
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,550
He has no interest in me at all.

539
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,990
You'd better not do anything inappropriate

540
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,310
and disrupt the atmosphere here.

541
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,030
Actually, I think you and Young Master Wang make a good match.

542
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,270
You...

543
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,350
Look at you.

544
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,210
You have a delicate heart,

545
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,670
pure nature,

546
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,390
and all the virtues of a young maiden.

547
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,560
You're simply a charming person loved by everyone.

548
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,390
You really know how to talk.

549
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,390
I'll let bygones

550
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,540
be bygones.

551
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,610
I knew I didn't misjudge you.

552
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,230
You're the most tolerant and magnanimous person.

553
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,130
It's just a pity that I'm not a man.

554
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,710
Unlike some people,

555
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,760
who don't recognize treasure when they see it.

556
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,610
Hong Hui, did you forget something?

557
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,160
It's time to do our makeup.

558
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,650
Hey!

559
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,850
What's wrong?

560
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,460
Snap out of it.

561
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,950
We need to do our makeup.

562
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,930
Straightforward

563
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,650
and simple.

564
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,830
You're perfect for a tomboy makeup.

565
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,450
Tomboy?

566
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,040
Fine, tomboy it is.

567
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,070
Give me a warrior woman look.

568
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,400
Got it!

569
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,020
Here you go.

570
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,290
This is a warrior woman look?

571
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,770
Just putting on a straw hat?

572
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,620
If there were a real fight, wouldn't it be a burden?

573
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,470
Makeup is an art.

574
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,410
Art always has to be a bit complicated.

575
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,060
I just feel awkward.

576
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,370
Do I look awkward to you?

577
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,380
Awkward.

578
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,860
See? There you go.

579
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,400
The problem is, whether you wear makeup or not, I still feel awkward.

580
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,480
That's normal,

581
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,110
because we're not the same kind.

582
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,800
You and Wang Yishao are the same kind?

583
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,860
You hang out together every day.

584
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,840
That's because you don't understand him.

585
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,710
The person you see isn't the real him.

586
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,310
What's the real him like?

587
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,030
Look over there.

588
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,480
Just like that person.

589
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,660
Wang Yishao is also a beggar?

590
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,150
What beggar?

591
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,870
He's an immortal. Get it?

592
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,390
Wang Yishao barely qualifies as an immortal.

593
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,020
But you? You don't even come close.

594
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,680
Me? I'm a demon.

595
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,660
You're a demon, a monster, a ghost.

596
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,130
Wang Yishao and his kind are immortals who subdue demons and exorcise spirits.

597
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,180
You're their pet, right?

598
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,210
You've spent so much time talking to me.

599
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,180
You've forgotten what you're supposed to be doing.

600
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,320
Now, look at them. Are they immortals or demons?

601
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
You two are starting to sound more and more like Qing Cai.

602
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,220
Alright, give the two of us a makeover too.

603
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Let's see what we turn into.

604
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,750
Alright, alright.

605
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,260
Sure.

606
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,340
This is too much!

607
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,960
Real immortals and demons wouldn't be any more over the top than this.

608
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,449
Demons are great!

609
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,760
Doesn't that make me, a ghost, a perfect match for you?

610
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,449
Enduring countless storms,

611
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,020
growing strong,

612
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,480
like wild grass.

613
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,370
Not fragrant, but beautiful in its own way.

614
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,350
Are you talking about me?

615
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,409
What's up?

616
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,270
You two, one is a flower, and the other is grass.

617
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,800
You really are kindred spirits.

618
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,160
We're just humble weeds.

619
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,120
If you're calling yourselves weeds,

620
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,230
then unrivaled beauty would be reduced to beggars.

621
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,670
You've gotten good at sarcasm now.

622
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,340
Looking at you,

623
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,000
I now understand why you use poison.

624
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,800
See this?

625
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,660
It's my dual nature.

626
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,020
Gan Pu,

627
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:34,490
your makeup is absolutely stunning.

628
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,520
Is it?

629
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,560
Young Master Wang,

630
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,850
aren't you only supposed to care about inner beauty?

631
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,900
How could you be bewitched by such an illusion?

632
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,880
When someone is beautiful without realizing or caring about it,

633
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,510
that is true beauty.

634
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,590
Are you complimenting me? Thank you.

635
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,420
Young Master Wang, your flattery skills

636
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,690
are simply outrageous.

637
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,080
You're quite impressive too,

638
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,950
managing to insult two people with one sentence.

639
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,750
Gan Pu is my sister.

640
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,550
How could I insult her?

641
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,470
Actually, praising her is the same as praising me.

642
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,610
Your sister doesn't seem to think much of you, though.

643
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,190
Gao Yin,

644
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,630
don't take anything Qing Cai does to heart.

645
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,080
Thank you.

646
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,870
You really are considerate of her.

647
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,870
Aren't you being too noble?

648
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,940
You…

649
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,160
You even noticed that.

650
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,750
If I didn't know his identity,

651
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,620
I'd find it strange too.

652
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,200
Just like Young Master Wang.

653
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,240
What a waste!

654
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,590
This is just too beautiful.

655
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,990
This is the last jar.

656
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,790
No way. I need to buy more wine.

657
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,060
What a strange person.

658
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,080
Not bad.

659
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,410
It's very slimming.

660
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,430
Although it's a bit over the top,

661
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,700
it's quite unique.

662
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,860
How about we head back to the town

663
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,720
to test the look?

664
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,870
Sure, let's all go to the town together.

665
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,890
If we're going to town,

666
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,760
I need to remove this makeup.

667
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,160
No way.

668
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,050
-No.
-No.

669
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,580
No way.

670
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,140
Then…

671
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,010
Since we're all wearing makeup now,

672
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,350
Young Master Wang is the only one left without it.

673
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,100
Young Master Wang should get some makeup done too.

674
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,950
Yes, yes.

675
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,460
You're one of us.

676
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,550
We can't leave you out.

677
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:02,970
Young Master Wang,

678
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,270
we've just learned how to do makeup.

679
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,470
Shouldn't we at least

680
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,080
get some practice?

681
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,660
Here, let me do your makeup.

682
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,210
I know you're targeting me.

683
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,440
It's fine.

684
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,070
I'll do it.

685
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,050
What kind of invisibility technique did you teach?

686
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,950
Everyone surrounding us can see this!

687
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,140
This is so much fun!

688
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,520
I've never played like this before.

689
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,710
It's really fun.

690
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,500
Is your life really that boring?

691
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,970
You call this fun?

692
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,260
Yes.

693
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
I have endless things to deal with every day,

694
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,810
and it's truly dull.

695
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,240
Actually, life in the Wang residence is boring

696
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,160
and stifling too.

697
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,190
It's uninteresting.

698
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,010
Hong Hui, are you treating me like a monkey for your amusement?

699
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,710
Wait until I get back, I'll break your neck!

700
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,420
Hong Hui, she's going to break your neck.

701
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,240
Is it really that stifling?

702
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,420
They've all gone mad.

703
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,970
Alright,

704
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,750
it seems like I'm the only sane person

705
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,630
left in this world.

706
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,690
Yishao,

707
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,950
Your subordinate is really worrisome.

708
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,730
You know he's working for me.

709
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,470
I know.

710
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,880
Women should act a bit naive,

711
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,590
or at least

712
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,730
pretend to be naive.

713
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,950
But I don't like pretending.

714
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,850
That's not the reason.

715
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,900
Actually, I know.

716
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,280
I was just overthinking.

717
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,940
Everyone has a vulnerable side.

718
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,910
If I were to become Emperor,

719
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,470
you'd be my first choice.

720
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,670
Yes,

721
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,070
an emperor cannot act on emotions.

722
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,800
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,080
I didn't mean to offend you.

724
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,210
I understand.

725
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,110
Emotions are born

726
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,810
from the heart.

727
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,900
You don't know when they begin,

728
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,170
nor can you control them.

729
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,660
You and Aizhen…

730
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,250
She's my sister.

731
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,100
I used to think

732
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,710
you were an ordinary person like me.

733
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,890
But now, with your identity,

734
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,030
you feel so distant

735
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,320
and so unfamiliar.

736
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,320
Do you think I've changed?

737
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,620
It's hard to say about the future.

738
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,780
Do you think it's necessary for us to even think about the future?

739
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,990
You're right.

740
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,820
Someone like me, who has no future,

741
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,340
what's the point of talking about it?

742
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,170
Just surviving this long is already a blessing.

743
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,180
What I mean is,

744
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,720
I feel the same as you.

745
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,530
The future seems so uncertain.

746
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,790
What we can do now is live in the present.

747
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,450
And,

748
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,610
even in death,

749
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,670
we wouldn't walk the Yellow Springs road alone.

750
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,270
Do you know why I'm willing to accept you?

751
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,790
I know.

752
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,720
Qing Cai,

753
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,130
thank you.

754
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,850
Really, thank you.

755
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,160
There are so many people here today.

756
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,860
Thank you.

757
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,450
Thank you, everyone.

758
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,460
Thank you.

759
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,470
Today, I'll share with you the most relaxing,

760
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,390
most enjoyable story I know.

761
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:11,930
Speaking of which...

762
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,950
I don't want to play anymore.

763
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,720
Since I can't stay hidden,

764
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,330
I'll just scare you all to death.

765
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,260
Scare you to death!

766
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,700
What's going on here?

767
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,680
Can't figure it out.

768
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,140
Here, Sir,

769
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,420
your skewers are ready.

770
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,730
Here, Sir.

771
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,550
-Take care.
-Thank you.

772
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,450
-See you next time.
-Sir.

773
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,760
What is that?

774
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,030
I'll tell Jing about it.

775
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,040
Jing, look!

776
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,520
Isn't that our boss?

777
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,080
It really is!

778
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,730
Wait, cover for me.

779
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,480
I need to talk to him about something.

780
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,310
-Sure, no problem.
-Okay.

781
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,620
I'll get back to making skewers.

782
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,060
Go!

783
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,270
What are you daydreaming about?

784
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,280
My skewers are burnt!

785
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,260
Is this opera?

786
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,480
Why are they performing in the street?

787
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,470
What are you looking at?

788
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,470
Give me ten skewers, same as them.

789
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,340
That many?

790
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,650
It's over!

791
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,980
I can't be the Top Belle anymore!

792
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,520
What's this? I've never seen it before.

793
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,310
This? It's called Lover's Tears.

794
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,940
Isn't it written on the sign?

795
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,690
"An endless resemblance to heartbreak poison,

796
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,720
scattered as lover's tears."

797
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,860
Sounds interesting.

798
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,980
Young Master Wang, your poem's been plagiarized.

799
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,080
So, that's

800
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,210
the person who writes poems for us?

801
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,160
Today, whatever he eats is on the house.

802
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,860
Great!

803
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,590
Young Master Wang,

804
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,610
once you taste

805
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,190
this flavor, you'll never forget it.

806
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,290
Then give me ten skewers too.

807
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,200
I want them for free too.

808
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,670
Who are you to get ten skewers?

809
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,030
He's the one who gets them for free.

810
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,300
I'll help him eat them.

811
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,660
You'll help him eat?

812
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,740
You’re not thinking of helping him with pooping too, are you?

813
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,060
Why are you so vulgar?

814
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,690
You're selling food, yet you've ruined my appetite.

815
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,440
Alright.

816
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,930
You're all regular customers. Ten skewers each.

817
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,580
It's fine, take them and eat.

818
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,040
Take them and eat.

819
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,070
Take them and eat.

820
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,830
Take them and eat.

821
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,540
Take them and eat.
