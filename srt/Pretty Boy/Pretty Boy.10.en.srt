(Episode 10)

3
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,150
Alright.

4
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,990
I'm just more interested in men's attire.

5
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,910
Do you have a problem with that?

6
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,140
No.

7
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,190
No.

8
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,950
How strange.

9
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,430
Do none of you girls like dressing up?

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,030
Didn't you teach us the invisibility technique?

11
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,870
Of course, we're going to take on the hardest challenge.

12
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,560
But...

13
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,350
Are you sure you've taught us the invisibility technique?

14
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,350
That's right.

15
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,710
This isn't an invisibility technique at all.

16
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,150
This is an exposure technique.

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,710
Yeah.

18
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,550
Hong Hui, oh, Hong Hui,

19
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,670
I found out

20
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,130
that you're just an exhibitionist!

21
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,750
No, where does that come from?

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,910
Didn't I explain this to you? This is the basics.

23
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,380
The foundation of invisibility technique

24
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,990
is... exposure.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,120
What do you say we give it a try

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,590
and see how well we've mastered the basics?

27
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,310
No way.

28
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,630
These are all borrowed and very expensive.

29
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,630
This can be considered hands-on learning.

30
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,070
What's wrong with using teaching aids? Stingy.

31
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,310
You're just using this as an excuse to sneak into town
for snacks again, aren't you?

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,910
It's been two days since I last had any snacks.

33
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,030
I do miss it.

34
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,070
I'll grab a few things. You guys go ahead.

35
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,470
Then I'll go to the town too.

36
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,070
No problem.

37
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,510
We'll wait for you at the gate of Mingyi Manor.

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,950
I'll go with you.

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,470
At a time like this,

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,390
you're still thinking about those hooligans?

41
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,030
This is their livelihood.

42
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,030
I've finally put them on the right track.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,470
I need to see this through, right?

44
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,470
Don't you think you're showing motherly instincts?

45
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,630
I'll take that as a compliment.

46
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,630
Of course, that's a compliment.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,310
To me, you're wonderful just as you are.

48
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,550
Your identity needs to remain secret.

49
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,070
We can't let them know you have any connection to this town.

50
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,830
Let me do it.

51
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,790
Let's go.

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,510
We've successfully blended into the crowd.

53
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,950
Looks like we've mastered the basics pretty well.

54
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,430
No one has noticed us at all.

55
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,750
When does the show start?

56
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,750
Yeah, how much longer do we have to wait?

57
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,110
We're not actors.

58
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,110
Please don't crowd around us.

59
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,470
If you're not actors, why are you dressed like that?

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,630
What are you doing here anyway?

61
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,550
Yeah.

62
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,710
What are you even doing here?

63
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,710
Look at how flashily they're dressed.

64
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,430
Yeah.

65
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,490

67
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,150
It's kind of scary.

68
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,230
They're so strange.

69
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,980
What on earth are they going to do?

70
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,470
Why does he have such a long beard?

71
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,630
Weird people.

72
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,390
Where are they going?

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,510
I remember now.

74
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,190
No wonder when you were tugging at your beard last time,

75
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,300
you were grimacing.

You've been through quite a lot, surprisingly.

178
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,790
You...

179
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,350
No,

180
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,190
ten bowls of water, ten bowls of water.

181
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,550
You've plagiarized Wang Yishao's doggerel, huh?

182
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,510
Next time, I should ask him to charge you for the marketing.

183
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,630
When we're drunk and appreciating flowers, it's all about the beauty of flowers.

184
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,870
When we shed tears because of love, it's all about sorrow in our hearts.

185
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,750
Where do you get all this sorrow from all day long?

186
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,870
You might chop my head off.

187
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,030
I just find this doggerel quite interesting.

188
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,990
What's so interesting about it?

189
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,350
Hey, I'll have a bowl of that.

190
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,390
Here you go, here you go.

191
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,750
A whiff of fresh aroma from the wilderness.

192
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,230
It's really good.

193
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,270
I'll take a jar to go.

194
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,150
Okay, okay.

195
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,510
So you even drink pee, huh?

196
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,230
What pee?

197
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,710
Don't you have any sense of romance?

198
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,070
This is called "Tears of Lovers."

199
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,430
Got it?

200
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,310
So pretentious.

201
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,230
Here you go.

202
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,660
Thank you.

203
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,950
Miss, would you like a sachet?

204
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,910
Is this meant for men to give to women,

205
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,190
or for women to give to men?

206
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,190
Either is fine.

207
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,870
You can wear it yourself

208
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,120
or give it to your lover as a token of affection.

209
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,470
Do you have any other styles?

210
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,410
I made all of these myself.

211
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,390
It's a small business. I only make this one design.

212
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,510
Are there any other shops selling this in town?

213
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,030
I guarantee this is one of a kind.

214
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,190
No other place offers it.

215
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,340
I'll take one.

216
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,510
Okay, thank you.

217
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,150
Here you go.

218
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,790
Would you like a skewer?

219
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,950
Come on, customers, enjoy.

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,870
Gan Pu.

221
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,910
You can drink this.

222
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,910
Here.

223
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,990
This is delicious.

224
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,550
It tasted so good.

225
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,270
This is the first time anyone has ever bought me food.

226
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,820
Today's full of firsts for you, huh?

227
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,670
Your first time trying street food,

228
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,430
first time being treated,

229
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,740
first time walking through town,

230
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,440
first time having company while doing so.

231
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,550
And now, my first time feeling a bit melancholy.

232
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,390
Take it.

233
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,430
Okay.

234
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,060
It's delicious.

235
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,470
It's especially tasty.

236
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,510
Like this.

237
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,830
This one is definitely not spicy.

238
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,590
Alright, got it.

239
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,170
Add some spice, will you?

240
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,470
Brush on a bit more oil.

241
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,030
Okay.

242
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,230
Why did you scare me?

243
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,790
You... look quite nice... when you smile.

244
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,190
Take a look.

245
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,710
Okay.

246
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,470
This is delicious,

247
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,430
really delicious.

248
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,310
Take a look. It's delicious and not expensive.

249
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,510
You'll love it.

250
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,030
What are you looking at?

251
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,990
You're our very first customer

252
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,190
since we opened.

253
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,530
You can eat

254
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:40,750
(Lover's Tears)
You can eat

255
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:40,780
(Lover's Tears)

256
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,910
for free at any stall here. I said it!
(Lover's Tears)

257
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,580
(Lover's Tears)

258
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,420
You said it.
(Lover's Tears)

259
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,080
(Lover's Tears)

260
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,190
I'm going to eat you all into bankruptcy.
(Lover's Tears)

261
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,990
Okay.

262
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,490
Well, um, well...

263
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,590
Can I also have this for free?

264
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,870
Of course...

265
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,670
You have to pay for it.

266
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,510
After all, you're not our first customer.

267
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,110
How about another one?

268
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,590
Sure.

269
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,940
Okay.

270
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,670
Here's yours.

271
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,430
Take it carefully.

272
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,470
Alright, got it.

273
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,310
Okay.

274
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,670
He can't eat it anymore.

275
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,310
Ten coins.

276
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,390
One jar of Tears of Lovers, please.

277
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,790
Coming right up.

278
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,310
Here's your Tears of Lovers.

279
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,390
It looks quite good.

280
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,190
Sir,

281
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,110
what's this "Lover's Tears?"

282
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,190
Lover's Tears?

283
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,330
It's all written on the sign.

284
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,510
You'll understand once you see it.

285
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,030
"Endless longing, a heart-wrenching poison."

286
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,710
What does this mean?

287
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,470
Did you get dumped?

288
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,190
No.

289
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,670
Have you ever been dumped?

290
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,630
Also no.

291
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,900
I see, you've never been in a relationship.

292
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,890
You've been single since you were born.

293
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,070
Sir, how could you say that?

294
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,190
Then you probably can't taste what this really is.

295
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,150
I get it now.

296
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,430
You mean,

297
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,480
everyone who's drunk this wine has experienced heartbreak.

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,390
I've never thought about it that way.

299
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,470
Third Brother, Third Brother.

300
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,430
Come here, come here.

301
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,070
What's up?

302
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,310
He's asking if drinking this will lead to heartbreak.

303
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,310
He'll experience heartbreak whether he drinks it or not.

304
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,910
Why is that?

305
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,710
You don't understand.

306
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,510
Every boy has to experience

307
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,870
heartbreak for once growing up.

308
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,390
It's just a matter of time.

309
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,120
It's all part of growing up, you know?

310
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,950
Right.

311
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,950
Of course, it's a rite of passage.

312
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,710
So, would you like to

313
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,030
prepare yourself and try it in advance?

314
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,590
What is this? It tastes awful.

315
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,470
These unscrupulous merchants are just trying to scam people.

316
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,110
Tears of Lovers? What nonsense.

317
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,270
This isn't "Tears of Lovers."

318
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,790
If not tears, then what is it?

319
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,510
It's the bitterness of life's hardships

320
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,630
with a subtle and ethereal fragrance.

321
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,670
As if standing in the midst of a vast wilderness,

322
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,790
catching a glimpse of South Mountain.

323
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,550
Bitter in the first place while a fragrant aftertaste lingers in your mouth.

324
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,030
What could a greenhorn like you... possibly taste?

325
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,720
Is that so?

326
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,270
Let me try again.

327
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,480
I'm starting to feel it.

328
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,910
You've really tasted it?

329
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,390
Of course I did.

330
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,670
So, you're a kindred spirit.

331
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,830
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

332
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,430
How much are you buying?

333
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,670
Just one jar for now.

334
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,460
One...

335
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,630
Sir, I'll take one jar too.

336
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,750
Okay, okay.

337
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,150
That jar, that jar.

338
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,910
This jar is yours.

339
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,630
This jar, right?

340
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,620
Should we buy more?

341
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,030
After hearing what you said,

342
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,030
I'll go find those vulgar friends of mine

343
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,660
and give them a good roasting.

344
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Let's see if they still dare call me vulgar.

345
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,720
Look at him—now that's a top-tier merchant.

346
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,390
Indeed, he certainly is.

347
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,580
Well, we're not in the same league as him.

348
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,420
Do you remember what he just said?

349
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,710
I got a rough idea.

350
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,310
But then I lost track.

351
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,910
Is it really that good?

352
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,270
This is especially delicious.

353
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,710
I like it too.

354
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,630
I think

355
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,550
it's for people with stories to tell.

356
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,990
But if you say it's for monsters to drink, that works too.

357
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,590
Why pinched me?

358
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,870
You're a monster.

359
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,670
Sir, are these skewers spicy?

360
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,070
I can see their faces melting from the spiciness.

361
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,030
Well, it comes in non-spicy ones too.

362
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,390
Just add less chili, and it'll be fine.

363
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,300
I want what they're eating.

364
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,430
Then let's get one skewer.

365
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,790
How many skewers would you like?

366
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,710
One skewer, please.

367
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,990
No spicy one.

368
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,829
Spicy.

369
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,069
Alright, alright, alright.

370
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,829
Here you go.

371
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,790
Okay, thank you.

372
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,510
Come on, eat up.

373
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,270
It's so spicy.

374
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,069
How is it?

375
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,510
You're tricking me.

376
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,150
It's not the same at all.

377
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,670
I can't even fool a child now.

378
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,700
Am I really that bad?

379
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,640
Isn't this spicy enough, dear?

380
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,350
Yes, you can really handle spicy food, little one.

381
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,430
You liar!

382
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,710
Sir, how about this?

383
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,230
Please add a bit more...

384
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,350
Okay.

385
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,350
Add more, more.

386
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,150
Add a bit more Lover's Tears.

387
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,430
Okay.

388
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,230
-Here you go.
-Come on.

389
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,270
Taste it again now.

390
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,830
Easy, dear.

391
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,830
Taste good, huh?

392
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,950
Not spicy.

393
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,110
Wow, dear, you're good.

394
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,430
-You're better than me.
-You're so good.

395
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,590
Such a tough little one.

396
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,190
Why don't we give it a try too?

397
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,750
It's too spicy.

398
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,870
When you were pursuing me back then, you'd have moved mountains for me.

399
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,470
Why are you so unromantic now?

400
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,400
We've been married for so long.

401
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,990
Our child is already this big, well...

402
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,980
I don't care.

403
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,430
I'm craving it more and more.

404
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,510
And see how romantic that poem is.

405
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,390
It reminds me of when you were pursuing me.

406
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,070
Okay, okay, whatever you say.

407
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,710
We'll buy some.

408
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,750
That's more like it.

409
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,750
Sir, two skewers for each of us.

410
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,790
Got it.

411
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,910
I often have nightmares.

412
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,510
In my dreams,

413
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,580
they keep pushing me to seek revenge.

414
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,790
"They"?

415
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,670
Who are "they"?

416
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,710
My parents.

417
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,630
And many others.

418
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,790
You're really going to risk your life, aren't you?

419
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,160
I've finally managed to get close to Yinniang.

420
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,550
I can't give up this opportunity.

421
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,430
You should go. Don't let me drag you into this.

422
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,830
Do you want to die?

423
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,550
I've lived until now just for this day.

424
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,510
I can't give up.

425
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,790
How can you expect me to leave?

426
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,270
Watching you die in front of me?

427
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,830
Go quickly.

428
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,780
So spicy.

429
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,880
Yes, it's spicy.

430
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,390
Sir, your prices are way too high.

431
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,350
It's too spicy.

432
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,740
It's our special recipe. That's just how it is.

433
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,750
Sir, sir.

434
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,590
Give me ten skewers.

435
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,960
Ten... Did you say ten skewers?

436
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,750
Coming right up, ten skewers.

437
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,510
We can't eat that much.

438
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,880
Let's have a competition.

439
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,110
If you eat less than me,

440
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,110
we'll break up.

441
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,350
I can't take it. I can't.

442
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,790
Let me.

443
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,630
It's so spicy.

444
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,750
You're lying.

445
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,230
Don't, don't...

446
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,030
Okay, fine, fine.

447
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,710
You're the boss, alright? You're the boss.

448
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,550
I submit to you, okay?

449
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,990
Altogether, it'll cost ten taels of silver.

450
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,910
Ten taels of silver?

451
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,630
That's more than I spend in an entire year!

452
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,230
Why don't you just ask for a hundred taels while you're at it?

453
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,390
You swindler.

454
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,380
You're really a man.

455
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,950
However...

456
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,680
why did you accept me?

457
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,430
You are truly kind.

458
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,750
You couldn't bear to see me go to my death alone,

459
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,110
even though we were practically strangers.

460
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,150
So later I thought,

461
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,160
since neither of us cares much about life and death,

462
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,990
then why...

463
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,030
can't I open my heart?

464
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,430
Come take a look, Tears of Lovers.

465
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,350
Absolutely delicious.

466
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,950
Here.

467
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,950
Here you go. Take it.

468
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,950
Come on, take a look.

469
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,750
This is used to make Lover's Tears.

470
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,430
Take it back, grind it into powder,

471
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,470
and mix it with three other ingredients.

472
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,590
For the mixing ratio...

473
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,150
this one should be double the amount of the others.

474
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,350
Double the amount?

475
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,430
Less talking, more grilling.

476
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,190
Okay, okay.

477
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,830

540
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,450
♫A vast and boundless sky♫

541
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,490
♫Brushing past in a sea of people♫

542
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,490
♫Waiting for time to glance back♫

543
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,650
♫If love shines like a shooting star♫

544
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,500
♫Who can truly hold it close?♫

545
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,080
♫The wandering I long endured♫

546
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,100
♫Once had someone by my side♫

547
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,080
♫The heartfelt moments in my memory♫

548
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,880
♫How to describe them with words?♫

549
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,400
♫I dare not reach out♫

550
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,690
♫Afraid to shatter the dream♫

551
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,630
Let's see what they're up to.

552
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,790
Young Master Wang wants us to find out

553
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,350
about the identity of the gang leader.

554
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,910
What do you think?

555
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,550
What kind of identity could a gang leader have?

556
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,990
At most, he might know some important information?

557
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,030
Young Master Wang thinks Qing Cai is from the Mo Clan.

558
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,310
What's your take on that?

559
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,950
Qing Cai? How is that possible?

560
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,150
Young Master Wang seems quite certain.

561
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,350
He must have seen

562
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,270
or heard something.

563
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,100
How would I know?

564
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,310
Anyway,

565
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,230
with my brilliant mind,

566
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,270
I can't make such a deduction.

567
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,510
Hong Hui might be skilled in the invisibility technique...

568
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,390
and tracking.

569
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,190
You mean...

570
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,830
he's Young Master Wang's informant,

571
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,230
and he's also protecting Qing Cai?

572
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,630
Protection isn't necessarily the case.

573
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,030
People like us...

574
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,110
wouldn't let personal feelings...

575
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,080
interfere with our principles.

576
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,150
Of course.

577
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,420
We're not ordinary people either.

578
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,310
Jiaoniang.

579
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,030
Jiaoniang.

580
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,190
You two are drinking this too?

581
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,630
Qing Cai and Gan Pu

582
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,710
are going crazy over there

583
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,310
from drinking this.

584
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,950
Hu Jiao... said it's pee.

585
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,510
That Pepper.

586
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,400
It seems we really are birds of a feather.

587
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,740
Why are they crying?

588
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,750
They were eating that incredibly spicy food in town

589
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,030
and crying from the heat.

590
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,870
Then they had a bit of this drink,

591
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,000
and somehow

592
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,830
it turned into real crying.

593
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,950
Sounds like

594
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,870
another case of a broken heart.

595
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,150
But over whom?

596
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,030
Let me ask,

597
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,670
who have they been close to recently?

598
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,140
No way.

599
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,310
Don't tell me it's you two.

600
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,270
I've only been gone for a few days,

601
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,430
and you're already like this?

602
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,270
That's a bit much, isn't it?

603
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,110
The one I like

604
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,540
likes him,

605
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,870
and as for the one he likes, who knows who she likes.

606
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,230
When you put it that way,

607
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,910
it sounds quite complicated.

608
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,190
I think those two... like each other.

609
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,300
So, after all this,

610
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,270
you two are pining over that pair?

611
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,150
I think you two should really

612
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,150
go sit there

613
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,510
and have a good cry together.

614
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,310
It's just a feeling I have. I have no proof.

615
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,670
But

616
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,510
a man's intuition might just be right.

617
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,510
Wait a minute.

618
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,220
She even forcibly kissed Wang Yishao.

619
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,510
Yishao, Yishao?

620
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,390
What? Got kissed against your will?

621
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,430
But recently, those two

622
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,030
haven't been that close.

623
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,000
I guess it's the alcohol causing the trouble.

624
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,470
I have a question.

625
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,580
Why's this wine

626
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,670
called "Tears of Lovers"?

627
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,990
Tears of Lovers.

628
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,150
Marketing trick for sure.

629
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,230
Just to grab attention.

630
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,070
But the wine itself is actually pretty good.

631
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,990
It has the fresh aroma of the wilderness.

632
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,510
-A kindred spirit.
-A kindred spirit.

633
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,350
Come on.

634
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,350
Cheers.

635
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,790
What's wrong? Don't you want to drink?

636
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,180
Now that Father is safe,

637
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,590
can we go back?

638
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,630
What do you think?

639
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,750
I know.

640
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,750
I just didn't expect

641
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,240
your feelings for each other to be so deep.

642
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,990
Just thinking about how we'd become strangers after this

643
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,950
feels like a knife cutting through my heart.

644
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,550
I can't stop thinking about her.

645
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,270
I can't forget her.

646
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,710
Actually, I can tell that she feels the same way.

647
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,830
She can't let go either.

648
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,110
I just don't understand.

649
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,770
Why does the hatred between our elders

650
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,580
have to be passed down to our generation?

651
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,420
What's the point of all that?

652
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,110
Is it just for reputation and power?

653
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,390
That seems so meaningless.

654
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,110
Everyone has their own ambitions.

655
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,390
What one likes...

656
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,310
is what's best for them.

657
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,350
That's true.

658
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,820
I have no interest in any of this at all.

659
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,110
Perhaps I simply lack ambition.

660
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,790
Did Master Shang Shan teach you to think this way?

661
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,750
No, he taught me everything—

662
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,270
literature, strategy, and martial arts.

663
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,270
He sees all of these as skills.

664
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,500
He says you can never have too many skills.

665
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,470
Having skills is one thing; choosing when to use them

666
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,470
is another.

667
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,110
Qing Cai.

668
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,990
I'm setting you free.

669
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,230
Go with Gan Pu.

670
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,230
Stop staring at me.

671
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,110
A forced relationship won't bear sweet fruit.

672
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,950
I don't want myself to put up with this.

673
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,590
Actually...

674
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,270
I see how devoted you two are to each other.

675
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,030
I just can't bring myself...

676
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,670
to tear you apart.

677
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,870
Come on, squat down.

678
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,790
Good.

679
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,990
Hands.

680
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,390
Yes, just like that.

681
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,230
Don't move.

682
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,900
Don't move.

683
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,990
Right, squat lower.

684
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,950
Lower yourself a bit more.

685
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,230
Aizhen, do you find training hard?

686
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,050
It is, but it's okay.

687
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,110
Dad, tell me his story.

688
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,430
You brat,

689
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,950
slacking off again, aren't you?

690
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,170
Come on, come on.

691
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,510
I'll beat you up.

692
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,510
Come on.

693
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,390
Dad, does he know about me?

694
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,110
I've asked so many times already.

695
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,260
I can't help it.

696
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,730
I really wish he could know about me,

697
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,750
just like I know about him.

698
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,670
Hurry up.

699
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,920
I want to hear more stories about him.

700
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,520
This is the first weapon he made.

701
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,270
I've secretly taken it out

702
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,510
to give it to you.

703
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,470
Later,

704
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,430
you can find a sheath that fits

705
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,750
and encase it properly.

706
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,590
I'll make one myself.

707
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,790
Aizhen,

708
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,470
leaving you here alone,

709
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,270
you've suffered.

710
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,030
I have no choice.

711
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,230
It's okay.

712
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,590
I feel as if both of you are always here with me.

713
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,850
When I'm sad, I think of you both.

714
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,150
It makes life a little easier to bear.

715
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,110
Qing Cai.

716
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,310
Can you... hug me?

717
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,140
Just for once.

718
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,030
Hurry up.

719
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,070
Don't be so rigid.

720
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,830
Be gentler.

721
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,989
Yes.

722
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,310
Just like this.

723
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,830
For me...

724
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,480
this is enough.

725
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,949
Actually, I know.

726
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,750
You're deliberately acting recklessly.

727
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,989
Nonsense.

728
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,110
I'm not reckless at all.

729
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,750
I'm incredibly gentle.

730
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,350
Stop teasing me.

731
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,870
Then in the future...

732
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,550
will you still be my friend?

733
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,230
Of course.

734
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,190
I'll treat you like my own big sister.

735
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,390
What "big sister"?

736
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,150
If you can't find the right words, just stay silent.

737
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,910
Be quiet.

738
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,070
Thank you.

739
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,830
Why are you crying?

740
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,110
You're so dramatic.

741
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,230
Let's drink.

742
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,430
What are you staring at? You drink too.

743
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,630
Okay.

744
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,630
I didn't expect to actually taste the richness of this wine.

745
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,430
Give it to me.

746
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,990
May I be like the stars, and you the moon,

747
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,870
glimmering every night and illuminating each other.

748
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,830
Who knew we couldn't tie the knot,

749
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:52,470
turning into a thousand longings instead?

750
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:16,630
The breeze carries the yearnings to distant places;

751
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:23,790
The flute's mournful notes linger under the bright moon.

752
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,870
Worn and withered... from yearning for you;

753
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:40,550
Only to meet and drink... making the past fade away.

754
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,430
Come on, how are you this drunk

755
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,350
from just a bit of wine?

756
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,510
Zhang Fang!

757
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,350
You... you don't understand.

758
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,430
You don't understand.

759
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,870
You don't understand.

760
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,630
You don't understand.

761
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,550
Don't understand.

762
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,590
I'm really puzzled.

763
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,390
Who on earth are these mysterious girls

764
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,070
that have turned you two into

765
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,230
such a mess?

766
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,430
Alright.

767
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,630
I'd like to see for myself.

768
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,150
You haven't slept all night?

769
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,150
I've been drifting in and out of sleep for a while.

770
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,710
Do you want to go inside and catch up on some sleep?

771
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,150
About yesterday...

772
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,390
I'm sorry.

773
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,430
I couldn't control my emotions.

774
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,390
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

775
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,110
You would never.

776
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,990
You don't need to worry about me. I'm fine.

777
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,710
Besides,

778
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,470
now is not the time to talk about

779
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,670
love or emotions.

780
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,630
Well...

781
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,750
I... I didn't mean it like that.

782
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,840
I didn't mean it that way either.

783
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,030
We're still friends.

784
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,270
You, the heir to the throne...

785
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,190
No.

786
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,470
You, who's going to be the Emperor,

787
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,190
can't be friends with commoners, right?

788
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,310
It's okay.

789
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,880
I don't want to be friends with

790
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,550
someone of your status either.

791
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,310
No, I... I...

792
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,190
I didn't mean that I didn't want to be friends with you.

793
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,670
And I don't care about that status at all.

794
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,280
But for me,

795
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,310
I'm very happy, of course,

796
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,150
to have a true friend to confide in.

797
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,550
What I want to say is

798
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,000
that I don't think the two of us

799
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,350
need to be friends.

800
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,710
No, I mean...

801
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,630
I... I... I...

802
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,990
What I'm trying to say is...

803
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,540
there's something... something between us...

804
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,710
What are you talking about?

805
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,150
You're not making any sense.

806
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,510
I'm just an idiot.

807
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,500
This bright daylight

808
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,750
ruins the mood completely.

809
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,790
What... what mood are you talking about?

810
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,990
Stop talking nonsense.

811
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,060
Go back to sleep.

812
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,710
I told you to take a nap, but you wouldn't go.

813
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,790
Go quickly.

814
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,830
I don't understand what you're saying.

815
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,990
Then... I'll go to sleep.

816
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,120
O-Otherwise, it'll be too awkward.

817
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,440
You're feeling awkward?

818
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,350
I'm the one who should feel awkward.

819
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,910
I don't even know what you're saying.

820
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,790
Did I wake you up?

821
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,310
I went to bed early.

822
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,630
It was about time... to wake up anyway.

823
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,110
I made a fool of myself in front of you yesterday.

824
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,510
You're the one... he likes.

825
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,950
So what?

826
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,670
There are too many obstacles between us.

827
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,070
Indeed, there are.

828
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:40,670
But...

829
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,950
is there any obstacle we can't overcome?

830
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,710
In this world,

831
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,070
there are many things that cannot be overcome.

832
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,990
I can overcome all the difficulties.

833
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,190
Just like now,

834
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,110
I'm fighting against the unbeatable laziness!

835
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,100
If...

836
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,590
he could give up everything for you...

837
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,100
are you worried

838
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,750
that he wouldn't do it?

839
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,910
No,

840
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,400
what I'm worried about is

841
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,660
that this matter is too broad and too complicated.

842
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,230
I don't want him to make such a sacrifice.

843
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,150
But sometimes,

844
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,870
what's lost

845
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,790
is lost forever.

846
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,670
Still, I don't want him

847
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,990
to let me cloud his judgment.

848
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,870
Don't try to force matters.

849
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,070
Let nature take its course.

850
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,470
It shouldn't be like this.

851
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,390
Why aren't you encouraging me more?

852
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,150
If I succeed,

853
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,190
the biggest beneficiaries of this

854
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,270
would be you guys, wouldn't it?

855
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,270
If we face everything

856
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,390
with extreme attitudes,

857
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,190
things might become more complicated.
