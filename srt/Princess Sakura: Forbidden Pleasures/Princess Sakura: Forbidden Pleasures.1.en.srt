1
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,120
What is it, Princess Sakura?

2
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,984
This must be my brother.

3
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,270
Or maybe it's my sister.

4
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:39,418
That girl, sir, is Princess Sakura.

5
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:47,197
She's daughter to Samon
Yoshida, the nobleman.

6
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:52,564
She's cherry blossom incarnate.

7
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:57,472
Any man alive would want to

8
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,715
Be intimate with her.

9
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,328
Princess Sakura...

10
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:37,900
Princess Sakura: Forbidden Pleasures

11
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,052
Somebody, help!

12
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,986
It's no use screaming, nobody will come.

13
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:25,044
Your body's saying, "Don't
let anyone come in."

14
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:28,932
Please, stop!

15
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,061
That's not the plan.

16
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:34,991
I broke in for something
else but I wanted to see

17
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:40,011
If you're cherry blossom incarnate.

18
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,451
We had a proposal from the Nakano Family.

19
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:20,806
Their heir is apparently fond of you

20
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,485
So he wants you for his wife.

21
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,331
You don't look happy.

22
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,466
I am, Father.

23
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,820
Is there another man on your mind?

24
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,465
No.

25
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,380
This is our family treasure.

26
00:05:55,591 --> 00:06:00,438
This seagull scroll was
granted to us by the shogun.

27
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:06,584
The Yoshida family's pride
and honor must be upheld.

28
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:09,468
Understood?

29
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,440
Yes.

30
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,837
Oh, I'm sorry...

31
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,819
Is something bothering you?

32
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,777
Your playing is different today.

33
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,675
And you have a curious scent...

34
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,817
Shall we take a break?

35
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:09,166
Master Yoshida!

36
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,101
The Princess is also missing!

37
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:16,124
Where has she gone...?

38
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:23,246
Summer of same year

39
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:31,252
Kozukahara Execution Ground

40
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:38,126
Just outside the Shogun's Capital

41
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:44,290
Come one, come all!

42
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:48,356
You saw the severed heads of the condemned!

43
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,163
How about our head?

44
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,307
The flowers at Hell House brothel

45
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:57,283
will blossom to your ding-dong!

46
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:00,259
Heaven on Earth at the Hell House!

47
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,239
Hell...

48
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:07,256
Only outsiders dress like that...

49
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,363
I'm from the real Hell.

50
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,421
Very funny. Move on please.

51
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:19,933
A rumor of an unrivaled
whore brought me here.

52
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,393
Wind Chime Princess.

53
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:28,332
She's as sweet as a chime in a breeze

54
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,355
But tolls like a bell when aroused.

55
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:33,487
Is that true?

56
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:37,466
Yes, but you'll have to be patient.

57
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,525
It takes about 3 days to see her.

58
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,067
Our guest is leaving!

59
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:16,684
I'll be back.

60
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:20,664
Come again, we'll treat you like a king!

61
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,686
You needn't wait 3 days for these girls!

62
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,741
That's Onatsu, Osen, Osan, Oman,

63
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,647
And Oshichi.

64
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,826
Meet the angels in Hell.

65
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:38,890
That one...

66
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,176
Intrigues me.

67
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,694
Unbelievable!

68
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:00,966
Wind Chime.

69
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,927
What a lovely sound!

70
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:09,398
I promise you that I'll come back for you.

71
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,029
You're so sweet.

72
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,388
Can I ask a favor of you?

73
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:24,214
Name it. I'd do anything for you.

74
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,317
I'm looking for a tattoo.

75
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:31,779
A tattoo?

76
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:33,191
Yes.

77
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:37,885
There's a man with a tattoo

78
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:42,192
Of a bell just like this.

79
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,073
What do you want him for?

80
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:48,531
You love him?

81
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:53,229
No, it is vengeance I seek.

82
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,734
He took everything from me.

83
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,151
I detest him.

84
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:59,387
Oh, I'm beat! My back aches!

85
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:06,876
My poor body slaves away day and night.

86
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:10,371
When did you last have a customer?

87
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,409
You had no one yesterday!

88
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,319
Stop your crazies and start mopping!

89
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,517
Why don't they hire someone to clean?

90
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:24,430
Even our marquee attraction is cleaning!

91
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,508
It's OK. I don't mind.

92
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,503
I like doing physical work.

93
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,323
Did you hear that? She's so nice!

94
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:42,317
You've been here 2 months now

95
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:46,269
And you're still acting.

96
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:49,430
She's not a born whore like you!

97
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:53,423
Now I'm pissed!

98
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,205
Be quiet!

99
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:27,249
Oshichi.

100
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,253
I'm trying to sleep here.

101
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:36,115
I won't take that from a
lazyass who sleeps all day!

102
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,347
I'm so sorry, Oshichi.

103
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:42,228
But I'm tired of hearing about Wind Chime!

104
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:45,191
You brownnosing side-stick!

105
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:47,361
You mean, sidekick.

106
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:48,363
What's that?

107
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:51,159
You think you're a queen!

108
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,210
Then try to get more customers!

109
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,297
You're asking for it!

110
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:01,258
Stop it!

111
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,303
Keep your hands off of me!

112
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:10,270
You don't deserve to be
the marquee attraction!

113
00:16:12,191 --> 00:16:12,357
Let's go.

114
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,249
It's ding-dong time!

115
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,338
It hurts!

116
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,383
Oh, but I don't know...

117
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:37,310
Maybe I like it like this...!

118
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:42,318
I can't hold it anymore!

119
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:54,169
Don't moan! Play dead.

120
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:10,018
No wait is too long for the Wind
Chime Princess. Next please.

121
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:10,403
Hey!

122
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,372
Wind Chime Princess, where are you?

123
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,418
You're Shiragiku-maru reincarnated!

124
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:25,299
I'm down and out but I'm still a man!

125
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:32,732
I can bring you back from
your jump from the cliff!

126
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,323
Be quiet!

127
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,329
You're here, Wind Chime Princess!

128
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,254
You've gone too far, monk!

129
00:17:56,387 --> 00:18:01,299
How dare you step over Hell
House's threshold with no money!

130
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:05,192
If I see you again, I'll
feed you to a turtle!

131
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:10,366
Yuck, I touched that filthy thing!

132
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:12,327
You know him?

133
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:18,208
That monk attempted suicide with his lover.

134
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,427
A monk did such a thing? Who was the girl?

135
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,306
It was a boy.

136
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,394
A boy servant called Shiragiku-maru.

137
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,355
Of course!

138
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,277
That's who he was talking about.

139
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,283
The boy served at a shrine

140
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,411
And got tricked into hustling.

141
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:44,455
And he ended up jumping off
the cliff with the monk.

142
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:50,426
But only the boy died
while the monk survived.

143
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:56,307
Now he thinks Wind Chime
is the boy reincarnated.

144
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:04,277
You impress me with your knowledge.

145
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:09,245
Wind Chime Princess.

146
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:12,375
Maybe the boy servant...

147
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:17,382
Was as good in bed as the Princess.

148
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:22,474
How intriguing!

149
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,478
I want to know more about it.

150
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:30,360
Get out if you choose Wind Chime over me.

151
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,363
I won't go after her.

152
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,412
I intend to live a long time.

153
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,345
Okay...

154
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:22,396
When will I see him again?

155
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:36,459
Will I ever see him again?

156
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:45,472
When will I see him again?

157
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:52,358
When will I see him?

158
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,323
How miserable am I...

159
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:06,012
My only hope is to make love
to Wind Chime Princess.

160
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,383
Then she'll remember...

161
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:14,388
That she's Shiragiku-maru reincarnated.

162
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,402
I want to see her.

163
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,449
I want to do it with her...

164
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,372
Hey, monk.

165
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,547
Is Wind Chime Princess that incredible?

166
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,520
Yes. She's not of this Earth.

167
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:50,360
Is she a ghost?

168
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,493
No, she is an angel.

169
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,395
Who is out there?

170
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:14,443
Who is it?

171
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:17,367
It's you again!

172
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,538
Ouch, it's hot!

173
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,384
We have a customer!

174
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,389
Coming in.

175
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:30,484
This way.

176
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:45,478
What's the idea?

177
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,442
I want Wind Chime.

178
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,494
Uh... what was that?

179
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,418
I want to screw Wind Chime.

180
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:56,506
Oh, but sir...!

181
00:22:56,507 --> 00:23:00,558
I know everybody waits 3 days to screw her.

182
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:04,526
But she's with a client now...

183
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:07,493
I'll see what I can do.

184
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:11,628
No problem is unsurmountable!

185
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:13,549
Right, Oshichi?

186
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:17,476
Say something!

187
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,514
He's your customer.

188
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:35,689
Stay out!

189
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:41,662
This is Wind Chime Princess.

190
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:53,650
It's you!

191
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,668
You forgot me?

192
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:18,672
Why are you here?

193
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:30,755
It's beautiful!

194
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:52,044
That's quick!

195
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:53,965
Those moans...

196
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:57,056
It's her!

197
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:12,692
Those enchanting moans are irresistible!

198
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:15,978
They're not of this Earth...

199
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:24,959
So mesmerizing.

200
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:35,110
But is she with that man?

201
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,034
No!

202
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:45,031
Is that man jamming himself
into her Wind Chime now?

203
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:30,794
You became a whore at this
brothel just to find me?

204
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:38,228
That's crazy. I might never have showed up.

205
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:40,191
I knew you would.

206
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:47,552
I prayed to the fox spirit every day.

207
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:52,096
I knew we'd meet again.

208
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:59,197
But this thing doesn't look good on you.

209
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,121
Why this?

210
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:05,212
I imitated you.

211
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:11,183
I wanted a tattoo of a bell like yours.

212
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,659
But my arm's skinny so it
looks like a wind chime.

213
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:35,287
Oh, you...!

214
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:40,175
I'm so happy!

215
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:51,120
Don't sit like that!

216
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:53,250
The Hell House Special.

217
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:57,260
These pills will rejuvenate you.

218
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:58,305
Pee-chan!

219
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,235
Hi, Pee! As squishy as ever!

220
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,366
What are these new pills?

221
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:11,292
Watch out. Miwa had one of
those pills and lost her hair.

222
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:15,388
His pills give me energy.

223
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:18,313
You can have mine then.

224
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:21,404
Was Mr. Takuetsu really a physician?

225
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,274
He says he served a renowned Lord.

226
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,381
I doubt it.

227
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:40,326
What was that, Osan?

228
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,372
Nothing.

229
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:12,446
I won't let you touch
my Wind Chime Princess!

230
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:16,328
Relax, she's a brothel whore.

231
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:19,375
Nobody owns her, not you, not me.

232
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:24,425
She sure is an angel, as you put it.

233
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:27,390
So you screwed her!

234
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:33,316
I sure did.

235
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,487
Bastard!

236
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,400
Try harder.

237
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:04,330
Bastard!

238
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:07,501
If I was tougher...

239
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,957
I would have torn him into pieces.

240
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,309
Bastard...

241
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:20,483
What you just said now...

242
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,363
Do you mean it?

243
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,540
I heard what you just said, monk.

244
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:36,424
You said you'd tear him
apart if you were tougher.

245
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:40,518
- Would you? - Yes.

246
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,527
I swear I would.

247
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:24,387
This is something.

248
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:27,517
I'll test it on Wind Chime.

249
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,565
No, I wouldn't want her to die.

250
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,570
Maybe Oman... How about Onatsu?

251
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:37,410
A strange man is back there.

252
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,413
What?

253
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,581
It's the monk.

254
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:43,589
That crazy son of a bitch!

255
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:58,785
A blend of salamander, eel
and softshell turtle.

256
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:01,577
It'll give you strength.

257
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:03,498
I hope so.

258
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:09,550
Now beat the shit out of
that man like you promised.

259
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,389
Willingly.

260
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:16,438
May I ask why you're doing this?

261
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:22,570
Because he thinks Wind
Chime is better than me.

262
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:26,413
He'll learn the hard way

263
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,586
What happens if he doesn't treat me right.

264
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:37,516
In other words, you're a jealous woman.

265
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,646
Shut up and take the pills!

266
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:44,445
Okay, I will!

267
00:35:59,515 --> 00:36:02,477
Well? Do you feel empowered?

268
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
I feel hot.

269
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:07,486
I'm hot!

270
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,491
I'm super hot!

271
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:18,463
Monk!

272
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,639
Where are you going?

273
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,577
Hey, monk?

274
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:50,645
He's dead!

275
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,652
Rest in peace.

276
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,530
Oh, it's you.

277
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,497
Here you are, you thief!

278
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,587
Where have you been hiding for 3 months?

279
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:31,676
It wasn't me who was hiding.

280
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,514
It's you who didn't contact me.

281
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,521
After you rushed me on that job.

282
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:40,567
Where is it?

283
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,751
Sorry, but the price went up!

284
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:56,511
What did you just say?

285
00:37:56,555 --> 00:38:00,643
You'll have to pay more if you want it.

286
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,567
You!

287
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:06,613
You tricked me!

288
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:09,576
Behave!

289
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:10,579
Don't...

290
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,583
One wrong move and this goes up in smoke.

291
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:15,670
Damn it!

292
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:20,595
You slimeball...

293
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:28,609
How much are you asking for it?

294
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:33,743
Let's see... How about 500?

295
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:35,623
500 gold coins!

296
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:38,627
Don't look so shocked.

297
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:40,756
It's not your money you're spending.

298
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:45,556
It's that big shot boss of yours.

299
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,648
I'll see you when you've got my fee.

300
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,624
You asshole!

301
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,586
It's your own fault!

302
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,717
I know you stole my important pills!

303
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,597
What are you talking about?

304
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,765
Don't play innocent!

305
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,770
Somebody saw you take my pills!

306
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,734
I didn't steal it!

307
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,613
Shut up!

308
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,742
I have evidence!

309
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:23,581
You were once our marquee attraction.

310
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:27,714
But now you'll pay for violating the rules.

311
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,765
- Surrender. - I give up!

312
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,782
Sorry, Oshichi.

313
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:09,705
That's our rule.

314
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:11,791
Prick!

315
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:15,631
Prick!

316
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,640
Here we are.

317
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:49,691
This is your destination, sir.

318
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:52,697
Welcome to Hell!

319
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:56,746
How many girls?

320
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,749
7 supreme girls.

321
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:04,677
Send them all to our suite.

322
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,845
All 7 of them!

323
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,684
I have money.

324
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:11,855
I'm having myself a Hell tour!

325
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:26,757
This is the worst.

326
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:38,695
Oshichi, are you OK?

327
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:41,867
Oh...

328
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:45,707
You're so kind.

329
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:49,881
We're all in this Hell together.

330
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:10,876
Can you untie me?

331
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:14,925
I want to show you something.

332
00:42:16,846 --> 00:42:20,849
I was mean to you so I
want to make it up to you.

333
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:45,938
Are you OK?

334
00:43:06,768 --> 00:43:09,855
Where are you going? Come back!

335
00:43:13,988 --> 00:43:16,785
You moron!

336
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:23,877
Don't mistake me for an ally.

337
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:47,922
I'll show you what it's really like...

338
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:53,933
In Hell.

339
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:59,944
All aboard, for the Hell tour!

340
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:03,826
Here we go!

341
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:15,972
You bitch! I know you snitched on me!

342
00:44:25,948 --> 00:44:27,951
Don't go away.

343
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:33,878
Die, die, you bitch!

344
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,886
You're the kind of woman

345
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:41,016
I really, really hate!

346
00:45:02,054 --> 00:45:06,057
I can't die and leave him behind!

347
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,854
What have I done...?

348
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:35,069
Oh, my God!

349
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:46,965
You bitch.

350
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,055
Just wait.

351
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:55,898
I'll kill you soon.

352
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,079
I'll kill you.

353
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:33,005
Princess Sakura's sickness might be a ruse.

354
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:37,013
You mean, Mr. Yoshida's daughter?

355
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:41,058
Yes, the one who's as
beautiful as cherry blossom.

356
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:46,109
But she hasn't been seen for 3 months.

357
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:48,950
That long!

358
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:53,041
A person wouldn't be sick that long.

359
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:56,004
Yes, it sounds suspicious.

360
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:00,136
I did a little detective
work and asked around.

361
00:47:01,015 --> 00:47:05,020
It's difficult to pinpoint
what's going on but

362
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:11,624
Apparently their seagull scroll was stolen.

363
00:47:12,117 --> 00:47:14,955
A seagull scroll...?

364
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,783
Move.

365
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,105
I'll tell you what it is.

366
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:25,711
The scroll was given to the
Yoshida Family by the Shogun.

367
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:29,020
If it really was stolen

368
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:35,432
The Yoshida Family will be renounced.

369
00:47:56,988 --> 00:48:00,159
It's a hand! A hand!

370
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,008
Oh, boy. Rain means bad weather.

371
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,139
Nobody comes in the rain.

372
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:14,029
Why don't I torture Oshichi for fun?

373
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:33,254
What was that scream?

374
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,245
What happened to you?

375
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:48,089
There's a monster here.

376
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,317
It's the monk!

377
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:17,177
What's going on?

378
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:24,156
What's he want?

379
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:55,416
Go away!

380
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,485
Wind Chime.

381
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:23,417
I mean, Shiragiku-maru.

382
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:28,307
I missed you.

383
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:45,525
Oh, no...

384
00:50:48,493 --> 00:50:50,498
How ironic...

385
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:57,394
My boy is right before me now.

386
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,406
But I can't touch him.

387
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,495
I can't touch him!

388
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:18,541
I'm not Shiragiku-maru.

389
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:25,392
I'm not the person you think I am.

390
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:29,533
But...

391
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:34,545
I know very well how you feel.

392
00:51:37,558 --> 00:51:38,601
Wind Chime...

393
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:43,533
You've become hideous

394
00:51:45,414 --> 00:51:49,425
In order to consummate your love.

395
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:51,640
I know how you feel.

396
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:00,626
Wind Chime.

397
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:03,635
Wind Chime.

398
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:06,685
Wind Chime!

399
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:34,852
Looks like stupid Oshichi has run away.

400
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,618
That would be right.

401
00:52:40,747 --> 00:52:44,755
She'll be found and punished severely.

402
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,743
What a night!

403
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:58,716
It's been like a nightmare.

404
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:04,734
Wind Chime...

405
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,749
I sometimes have this strange dream.

406
00:53:10,713 --> 00:53:11,715
A dream?

407
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:15,726
In the dream, I live in a faraway land.

408
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,741
I'm in a room like I've never seen.

409
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:24,628
It's full of strange tools.

410
00:53:25,673 --> 00:53:29,681
There are many tall houses outside.

411
00:53:32,736 --> 00:53:36,705
There are iron horses and
carriages running around.

412
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:41,679
It's actually a fun place.

413
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:46,652
You can get whatever you want.

414
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:48,867
It's a nice dream.

415
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:54,801
But I'm all by myself in that dream.

416
00:53:55,805 --> 00:53:56,849
All alone?

417
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:02,783
Nobody can understand me.

418
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,877
Nobody even notices me.

419
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,730
It's a recurring dream.

420
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:17,829
Sometimes I have scary thoughts.

421
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:23,847
Maybe Hell House is just a dream

422
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:28,821
And I'm alone in the real world.

423
00:54:40,899 --> 00:54:43,824
It's not nice to be alone.

424
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:24,864
How does it feel to be 3 feet taller?

425
00:55:55,163 --> 00:55:59,174
You're noisy. Don't
interrupt my contemplation.

426
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:01,055
Or I'll kill you.

427
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:04,122
I warned you!

428
00:56:09,122 --> 00:56:12,005
Is everything in place?

429
00:56:12,173 --> 00:56:13,969
No.

430
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:17,061
There's one more.

431
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:30,223
I broke in for something
else but I wanted to see

432
00:56:33,152 --> 00:56:37,121
If you're cherry blossom incarnate.

433
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:55,260
What's on your mind?

434
00:56:58,209 --> 00:56:59,531
That night

435
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,242
Why did you make love to me?

436
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:07,086
You're asking now?

437
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,180
I don't know...

438
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:14,150
I was tempted by the cherry blossom.

439
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,287
You broke in for something else.

440
00:57:20,962 --> 00:57:22,341
That's what you said.

441
00:57:40,153 --> 00:57:41,314
Go ahead.

442
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,326
I stole your family scroll.

443
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:50,216
- Where is it? - I don't know.

444
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:54,228
You didn't come for me!

445
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:58,240
It's been a while.

446
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,208
I can't remember.

447
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:38,680
Hurry! You're late!

448
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,219
You think you're Musashi!

449
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:43,606
Who is he?

450
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,651
The money!

451
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:50,861
It isn't easy to get 500 gold coins.

452
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:55,626
- Goodbye. - Wait! I'm not finished.

453
01:00:57,976 --> 01:01:02,555
I have 200 in advance.

454
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:06,604
I'll get you the rest soon.

455
01:01:12,888 --> 01:01:13,770
OK.

456
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,665
Show me the scroll. I
want to see if it's safe.

457
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:43,708
That's lame.

458
01:01:43,752 --> 01:01:48,739
The water creatures are operating alone!

459
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:52,142
I want to seal the deal with no violence.

460
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:55,562
No violence. I like that.

461
01:01:55,648 --> 01:01:58,609
Now give me 500 more.

462
01:02:00,738 --> 01:02:03,534
You've raised it again!

463
01:02:03,744 --> 01:02:06,581
No violence sucks.

464
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:08,585
Let's go.

465
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:12,591
You bastard!

466
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:22,734
The scroll! Give me the scroll!

467
01:02:22,777 --> 01:02:24,737
I don't have it on me.

468
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:27,575
Damn you!

469
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:32,792
Sir.

470
01:02:33,477 --> 01:02:37,717
I know where the man with
the bell tattoo has gone.

471
01:02:38,412 --> 01:02:39,763
You do?

472
01:02:43,174 --> 01:02:47,689
To Hell House brothel by
the execution ground.

473
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:04,721
Screw me.

474
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,684
I have money.

475
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:13,695
Oh, it works! I can meet Wind Chime.

476
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:16,742
I can screw her now!

477
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:26,676
Whoops!

478
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,723
I'd better not get too excited.

479
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:37,694
May Buddha be with you.

480
01:03:38,088 --> 01:03:39,823
I'll take a fee for my prayer.

481
01:04:14,675 --> 01:04:17,680
Is this establishment, Hell House?

482
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:19,766
Uh, maybe.

483
01:04:20,852 --> 01:04:24,649
Is there a girl here named Wind Chime?

484
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:26,653
I suppose so.

485
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:30,785
I'm here to see that girl.

486
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:34,666
But, Sister, this is a brothel.

487
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:38,673
I've never heard of a nun buying a whore.

488
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,804
Maybe I can help you with your urges

489
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:44,684
And we'll go to Heaven together.

490
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:45,644
Infidel!

491
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:49,734
Watch out, she's a strange one!

492
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:55,826
Princess Sakura.

493
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,848
Koto Master!

494
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:16,806
The seagull scroll is missing.

495
01:05:17,684 --> 01:05:20,686
And you didn't steal it.

496
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:24,732
No, I swear it wasn't me.

497
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:31,697
Master.

498
01:05:32,824 --> 01:05:36,825
How did you learn that I was here?

499
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:45,495
People said, Wind Chime Princess
is cherry blossom incarnate.

500
01:05:46,482 --> 01:05:48,840
I thought it might be you.

501
01:05:50,288 --> 01:05:54,764
I didn't want to believe it was true...

502
01:05:59,337 --> 01:06:03,728
Your father has been bedridden
since you disappeared.

503
01:06:05,622 --> 01:06:09,819
He tried every method
available to find you.

504
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:18,872
He even asked a blind woman to find you.

505
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:23,794
I'm best qualified to trace your scent.

506
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,881
Like a dog.

507
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:37,892
Princess.

508
01:06:43,692 --> 01:06:47,692
I want you to tell me what's going on.

509
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:54,921
I suspect that you're feeling lost...

510
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:00,917
Does it concern a man?

511
01:07:03,111 --> 01:07:05,839
Am I right?

512
01:07:12,336 --> 01:07:16,893
I think I'm losing my mind.

513
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:21,814
I can't...

514
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:27,695
I can't go on without Gonsuke.

515
01:07:29,823 --> 01:07:33,827
But now the family is at risk.

516
01:07:35,872 --> 01:07:38,666
I know that I fled my home

517
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:41,919
But I can't let Father die like this.

518
01:07:45,715 --> 01:07:47,842
What am I supposed to do?

519
01:07:50,721 --> 01:07:52,806
How do I choose?

520
01:07:55,726 --> 01:07:56,893
I can't!

521
01:08:01,732 --> 01:08:02,732
Who's there!

522
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:11,784
So that's your story.

523
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:28,885
Is this the...?

524
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:31,722
It's yours.

525
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:40,770
Sir, you're a good patron but
you can't do as you please!

526
01:08:43,861 --> 01:08:44,899
100 coins.

527
01:08:45,816 --> 01:08:48,850
That should be enough to free Wind Chime.

528
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,756
- Any problem? - No! Thank you!

529
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,748
As you wish! Hurry up and count them!

530
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:00,701
Even cats are faster!

531
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:02,738
Thank you, sir!

532
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:08,768
And Sister...

533
01:09:09,726 --> 01:09:13,633
I'd appreciate it if you
could take that scroll

534
01:09:14,591 --> 01:09:16,793
And the Princess back to the castle.

535
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:18,789
Here.

536
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,700
For your trouble.

537
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,593
Wait! That's not what I want!

538
01:09:53,595 --> 01:09:55,465
Have a happy life.

539
01:10:00,456 --> 01:10:01,661
That's that!

540
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:03,533
Now be gone!

541
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:15,547
Those bastards!

542
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:19,486
Take care, Princess!

543
01:10:22,473 --> 01:10:25,376
There he is, get him!

544
01:10:35,496 --> 01:10:39,473
Princess, there are many customers waiting.

545
01:10:41,386 --> 01:10:45,283
The scroll's here! She has it!

546
01:10:49,224 --> 01:10:52,209
Hand me the scroll.

547
01:10:52,293 --> 01:10:54,200
Osen... why?

548
01:10:55,403 --> 01:10:58,223
Oshichi is history and so are you.

549
01:10:58,307 --> 01:11:01,209
So I'm the marquee girl now.

550
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:09,212
Wait a sec...

551
01:11:17,176 --> 01:11:20,079
I don't know why but...

552
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:22,070
She annoys me.

553
01:11:23,066 --> 01:11:26,175
Now hand me the scroll.

554
01:11:29,038 --> 01:11:33,143
Don't be scared. Come to me.

555
01:11:33,144 --> 01:11:37,000
There, there. Relax.

556
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,032
Come on, baby!

557
01:11:52,014 --> 01:11:53,050
Hold it.

558
01:11:53,965 --> 01:11:56,907
Hold it, hold it.

559
01:11:57,945 --> 01:12:00,017
Let Monk Seigen handle this.

560
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,907
You demon from hell!

561
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:29,836
What have I done?

562
01:12:33,778 --> 01:12:35,602
Gold!

563
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,532
What is this?

564
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:08,632
What's going on?

565
01:13:09,547 --> 01:13:11,577
Calm down, my boy!

566
01:13:12,491 --> 01:13:14,522
This is strange.

567
01:13:15,353 --> 01:13:17,550
I feel weird.

568
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:21,312
Focus, men!

569
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:23,110
Come on, fools!

570
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:31,518
Make love to me, please.

571
01:13:35,398 --> 01:13:37,044
Oh, what a fool...

572
01:13:55,623 --> 01:13:58,327
I'm a fool...

573
01:14:00,509 --> 01:14:03,570
The scroll! The seagull scroll!

574
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:10,273
Out of the way!

575
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:21,561
Playtime is over.

576
01:14:46,629 --> 01:14:47,648
Gonsuke...

577
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,341
Out-of-season cherry blossom.

578
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:01,516
Kill him!

579
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:25,910
Out of my way!

580
01:15:35,976 --> 01:15:36,937
Give it to me.

581
01:17:28,265 --> 01:17:29,384
Woman...!

582
01:18:10,873 --> 01:18:11,923
Move.

583
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:15,468
Move!

584
01:18:30,818 --> 01:18:32,822
You've worked up a sweat!

585
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:56,188
Come on!

586
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:58,236
To your right, no left!

587
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:00,299
Whoops, you missed!

588
01:19:04,264 --> 01:19:04,961
Let go!

589
01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:19,692
You're dead!

590
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,209
Princess!

591
01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:51,228
Wait a minute.

592
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:04,155
Oshichi!

593
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:08,881
I'm the number one whore!

594
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:13,075
I'll remind you just in case you forgot!

595
01:21:05,505 --> 01:21:06,779
No!

596
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:10,602
Let go, you creature!

597
01:21:11,488 --> 01:21:15,121
I'm not Wind Chime Princess!
She's over there!

598
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:16,869
Can't you see?

599
01:22:29,299 --> 01:22:30,735
Tell me something.

600
01:22:31,902 --> 01:22:33,002
Are you dying?

601
01:22:35,853 --> 01:22:37,260
Yeah, I guess so.

602
01:22:38,254 --> 01:22:39,400
OK, good.

603
01:22:40,527 --> 01:22:43,247
Give me the scroll first

604
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:45,903
Then die.

605
01:22:46,356 --> 01:22:49,670
You think it's that simple, you moron.

606
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:55,954
Give me a break!

607
01:22:59,028 --> 01:23:00,745
You're so mean!

608
01:23:01,853 --> 01:23:05,167
What would a dead man do with a scroll?

609
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:10,177
Stop crying! A samurai does not weep.

610
01:23:10,757 --> 01:23:14,284
If I don't return with the
scroll I'll be beheaded.

611
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:16,165
That's too bad.

612
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:24,756
But all I can think about is
me and the girl.

613
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:29,738
What a girl she is...!

614
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:36,450
She's supreme inside and outside.

615
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:42,477
Oh, the way she moans...

616
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,729
That's nothing to do with me!

617
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:51,678
It means everything!

618
01:23:55,493 --> 01:23:59,029
Don't you agree, mister?

619
01:24:03,828 --> 01:24:07,805
Yes. And I'm having a good time now.

620
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:21,785
Is merciful Buddha here to take you too?

621
01:24:21,786 --> 01:24:25,763
No, I still have things to do.

622
01:24:29,749 --> 01:24:31,697
I know!

623
01:24:33,564 --> 01:24:37,568
So she is my Shiragiku-maru reincarnated!

624
01:24:39,744 --> 01:24:42,541
She is the one!

625
01:24:54,734 --> 01:24:57,739
Whatever it's about, I'm happy for you.

626
01:24:59,578 --> 01:25:02,667
OK, it's time for me to go.

627
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,754
Don't die yet!

628
01:25:05,675 --> 01:25:09,723
First tell me where I can
find the girl and the scroll!

629
01:25:11,729 --> 01:25:12,730
Ouch!

630
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:18,617
Oh, gross!

631
01:25:22,752 --> 01:25:24,796
"Justice"

632
01:25:25,675 --> 01:25:26,759
You deserve it.

633
01:25:30,685 --> 01:25:32,813
I smell something nice.

634
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,701
I'll see you in Hell.

635
01:25:38,745 --> 01:25:41,666
Have a nice trip.

636
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:43,672
How hilarious.

637
01:27:41,837 --> 01:27:43,800
Gonsuke...

638
01:28:16,828 --> 01:28:18,874
Gonsuke!

639
01:28:34,825 --> 01:28:35,786
Is this a dream?

640
01:28:36,829 --> 01:28:39,876
Au revoir, Princess.

641
01:28:44,846 --> 01:28:46,974
The river streams into the sea

642
01:28:47,937 --> 01:28:51,941
And the sea leads to the realm of eternity

643
01:28:54,032 --> 01:28:58,958
That has no end...

644
01:29:12,864 --> 01:29:14,838
Gonsuke!

645
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:25,730
Gonsuke!

646
01:29:37,718 --> 01:29:41,724
The following spring

647
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:51,834
It's still there.

648
01:30:00,774 --> 01:30:02,820
Sir, it could be worse.

649
01:30:02,947 --> 01:30:05,743
Be thankful you kept your head.

650
01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:09,920
Oh, you're the boatman.

651
01:30:09,964 --> 01:30:12,760
Don't call me that.

652
01:30:12,804 --> 01:30:18,417
I have a name, Nanboku
Tsuruya, the playwright.

653
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:19,987
"Princess Sakura"

654
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:22,952
"Mr. Yoshida's daughter"

655
01:30:23,831 --> 01:30:27,881
"Princess Sakura will
marry a notable samurai."

656
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:34,933
"Her beauty like cherry
blossom will only improve."

657
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,965
She's supreme inside and outside.

658
01:30:51,856 --> 01:30:54,905
And the way she moans...

659
01:31:02,842 --> 01:31:04,010
Oh, gross!

660
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:39,367
Let me eat!

661
01:34:43,294 --> 01:34:45,215
Yes?

662
01:34:46,218 --> 01:34:47,303
You want some?

663
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:56,284
How's that, Honey?

664
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,294
Delicious!
