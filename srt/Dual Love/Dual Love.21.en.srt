00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,970
[Dual Love]

3
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,470
Qingge,

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,560
actually,

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,740
I've already guessed

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,550
what method you're going to use to save me.

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,510
So what?

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,160
I don't agree.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,950
I'm sure Chief Xie and Mr. Yan wouldn't approve either.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,600
They are my closest family.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,480
And on what grounds do you think you can disagree?

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,330
What do you mean

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,500
by that?

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,770
Your Lordship, are you a fool?

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,730
You should know

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,220
that no outsider has any say over my actions.

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,510
I understand now, Qingge.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,880
Since Chief Xie has betrothed you to me,

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,030
I'm your family too.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,890
I won't allow you to sacrifice yourself for me.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,289
You must live well for me.

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,260
Let's make this clear first.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,720
I won't be your concubine.

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,230
Of course not.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,289
I promise you a lifetime together,

26
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,430
with only the two of us.

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,390
Since we're a couple,

28
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,100
we are one.

29
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,830
Your Lordship, do you agree?

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,430
I do.

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,390
Good.

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,509
Then let me tell you.

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,910
We people of the martial world

34
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,759
never adhere to outdated rules of subservience and virtue.

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
I, Xie Tianba, hereby declare this.

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,110
Mo Haoran,

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,789
my life is in my own hands, not heaven's.

38
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,810
Your life

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,000
is also in my hands, not heaven's.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,390
♫Rain falls from the roof to the bottom of the bowl♫

41
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,680
♫We snuggle up to each other in front of the window♫

42
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,470
♫Your heartbeat♫

43
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,630
♫Is extremely gentle and lovely♫

44
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,530
♫It's destiny and fate♫

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,920
♫I've never hesitated to fall in love with you♫

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,270
♫Hold your fingertips in my hand♫

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,200
♫We'll march forward side by side along the way♫

48
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,160
♫I do believe love can make us connected♫

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,540
♫The moment we met♫

50
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,210
♫I can't believe I fell in love with you immediately♫

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,270
♫Protecting you♫

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,810
♫Is my fearless decision♫

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:11,990
Look,

54
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,950
one flat side facing up and the other facing down means "yes."

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,220
♫I'm so sure love can make us connected♫

56
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,410
Even the heavens are willing to help me.

57
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,240
Do you believe me?

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,510
♫I can be with you every day♫

59
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,040
At this point,

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,610
♫I have expectations because of you♫

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,630
how could I not?

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,680
Not good enough.

63
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,030
Your belief in me isn't firm enough.

64
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,810
♫We spend our life together♫

65
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,150
Let me ask again:

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,820
Do you believe me?

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,550
♫We hold our hands and promise each other that we'll be together forever♫

68
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,230
I do.

69
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,810
Do you believe me or not?

70
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,579
♫I do believe love can make us connected♫

71
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,120
♫Love your melancholy♫

72
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,800
I do.

73
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,180
♫Our eyes meet and ripples occur♫

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,190
♫We smile at the same time♫

75
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,020
♫How lucky I am to meet you in this life♫

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,430
Daodao. Daodao.

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,120
At a time...

78
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,950
Why has the Master chosen this moment

79
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,940
to have a falling out with Daodao and retreat into seclusion?

80
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,870
If something happens to Daodao...

81
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,350
Jinx, jinx.

82
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,250
May Buddha bless us. May our Buddha protect us.

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,880
It's driving me crazy!

84
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,260
Come out.

85
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,870
How is it?

86
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,610
How is it? How is it? How is it?

87
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,790
It's started. It's started!

88
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,710
They started after taking their vows.

89
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,430
Vows?

90
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,390
I've only heard of blood vows for sworn brothers.

91
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,850
This...

92
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,080
They need to take vows for blood transfusion healing?

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,020
They'll be husband and wife sooner or later.

94
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,390
Isn't it normal to make vows?

95
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,930
Fine, fine, fine.

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,720
You're right about everything.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,180
Hurry. Go check again and report back.

98
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,320
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,380
Quickly, quickly!

100
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,810
It's driving me crazy!

101
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,409
Why does something feel off?

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
What vows?

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,870
Really...

104
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,890
Amitabha, Amitabha, Amitabha.

105
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,640
Qingge.

106
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,420
Qingge?

107
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,590
Mo Haoran.

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,300
You're recovered.

109
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,710
Smell me.

110
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,090
There's no scent anymore.

111
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,550
You've really recovered.

112
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,140
Here, take this medicine first.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,480
It's alright now, Qingge.

114
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,050
We've done it, haven't we?

115
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,850
Mo Haoran.

116
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,630
From now on,

117
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,400
your life is mine.

118
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,590
From now on,

119
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,750
both my life

120
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,080
and my heart

121
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,150
belong to you.

122
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,900
Mo Haoran.

123
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,130
In the future, you should use more

124
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,610
gardenia incense.

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,840
That smells nice.

126
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,990
Daodao.

127
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,550
Daodao?

128
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,290
Daodao, you're awake.

129
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,370
Where's Mo Haoran?

130
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,510
What do you mean?

131
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,070
Daodao,

132
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,350
calm down.

133
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,360
Marquis Shen, he...

134
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,550
He didn't make it.

135
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,950
No way.

136
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,650
Yuan Ying.

137
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Yuan Ying!

138
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,940
Daodao.

139
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,830
Yuan Ying, tell me that Mo Haoran didn't die!

140
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,000
-Daodao, you've just recovered.
-Daodao.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,700
Yuan Ying has already returned to the capital to report Marquis Shen's death to the Emperor.

142
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,360
The Emperor was closely watching Marquis Shen.

143
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
Alright, Daodao.

144
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,350
Master.

145
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,090
Is it really okay for us

146
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,640
to deceive Daodao like this?

147
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,240
The Marquis of Ningyuan is a complicated and unpredictable man.

148
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
I treat him as my brother,

149
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,049
yet he wants to marry my daughter.

150
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,409
It's better for Daodao to believe he's dead.

151
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,690
Changxuan.

152
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,230
Now that our great task is accomplished,

153
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,690
I must fulfill my promise.

154
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,250
Of all my disciples,

155
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,909
you are the most trustworthy.

156
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,290
I plan to entrust Yanhua Mountain and Daodao

157
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,330
to your care.

158
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,620
Master.

159
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,720
Now that Daodao's martial arts skills are unrivaled in the world,

160
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,750
I believe she's better suited to be the sect leader.

161
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,350
You are my first disciple.

162
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,270
Are you trying to evade your responsibilities at a time like this?
