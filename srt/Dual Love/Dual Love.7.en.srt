1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,520
Drink up.

2
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,440
Do I really need to drink so much?

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,119
You said you'd help me, didn't you?

4
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,760
I said I could try it myself.

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,600
Let me.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,200
It's sour.

7
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,680
Let me.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,730
It's bitter.

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Let me.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,160
It's spicy.

11
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,960
It's alright.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,460
Is it really necessary to react so strongly?

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Qingge.

14
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,960
What exactly did you put

15
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,890
in the medicine?

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,900
I just added some night bright sand and such.

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,400
What is night bright sand?

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,530
It's bat droppings.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,160
Considering your reaction to drinking the medicine this morning,

20
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,220
let's try a medicinal bath this time.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,240
However,

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,160
this medicinal liquid is very potent.

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,560
Bear with it for a moment.

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,440
Wait.

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,970
It's a bit itchy.

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Itchy?

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,930
Here. It's also itchy here.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,650
My back is itchy as well.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
I can't take it anymore.

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,340
It's too itchy.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,660
It's too itchy.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,920
Itchy.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,880
Good thing I didn't let you soak in it.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,210
I'm dying of itchiness.

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,490
Oh my, why is it so itchy?

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,130
I'm dying of itchiness. I'm dying!

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Senior Sister.

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,160
We've been practicing kung fu all day.

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,079
I'm starving.

40
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,810
Let's hurry back for dinner, then.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,400
Senior Sister.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,760
Which admirer has sent that this time?

43
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,560
Qingge.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,920
Tomorrow, I'll attend the Demon Slaying Conference with the Martial Arts Alliance.

45
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,250
Please stay in Anle Town

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,920
and wait for my return, alright?

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,720
Of course not.

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
This journey is complicated and dangerous.

49
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,409
You really don't need to get involved.

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,080
How dangerous is it?

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,290
Tell me about it.

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
The weather is so nice today.

53
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,600
It's rare for us to be so leisurely.

54
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,840
Let's not talk about these things.

55
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Just keep me company.

56
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,500
Mother.

57
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,400
Since when

58
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,930
did you start liking dried fruits?

59
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
Do you know

60
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,360
who sent you these dried fruits?

61
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,600
I already know Chief Xie's

62
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
arrangements.

63
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,430
This is a map of Yanhua Mountain's mechanisms and secret passages.

64
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,490
It's made based on the one Daodao has.

65
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,560
You'll give this map to them,

66
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,360
let them go up the mountain themselves,

67
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,760
then I'll act as bait,

68
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,000
pretending to be severely injured,

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,040
lure them down the mountain into your encirclement,

70
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,920
so that you can capture them all at once.

71
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,240
That's the plan, right?

72
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,760
Yes.

73
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,490
That's correct.

74
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,320
Then, you must keep a close eye on Daodao.

75
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,520
Don't let her go back.

76
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,530
Otherwise, my master and I won't let you off the hook.

77
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,400
I wonder if you're ready, Chief Mo.

78
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
Everything is ready.

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
We'll depart on schedule tomorrow.

80
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,370
They're leaving tomorrow.

81
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,760
I hope Father and Senior Brother are prepared.

82
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,080
They'll be heading to Yanhua Mountain tomorrow.

83
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,039
When I hold off the Martial Arts Alliance,

84
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,770
how should I explain to Mo Haoran that I'm a witch?

85
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,360
Qingge.

86
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
You're working so hard for me.

87
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,650
I can't bear to see that.

88
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,260
It's not tiring at all.

89
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,880
I noticed you didn't eat much at dinner.

90
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,410
Don't starve yourself.

91
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,640
Mo Haoran.

92
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,880
You...

93
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,980
Do you have any wishes?

94
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,250
After your poison is cured,

95
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,770
I'll accompany you to fulfill them, okay?

96
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
My wish...

97
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,320
is to visit your family

98
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
so that they can feel at ease giving you to me in marriage.

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,930
Is that alright?

100
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,740
You promised it first.

101
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,740
No going back on your word.

102
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,160
Mo Haoran!

103
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,120
Be careful.

104
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,220
What was it?

105
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,280
Mo Haoran,

106
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
if, in the future,

107
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
you find out I've lied to you about something,

108
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,760
will you be angry?

109
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,760
As long as your love for me is real,

110
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I won't be angry.

111
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
I would never lie about that.

112
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,560
It's over.

113
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,800
Master has fallen.

114
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,920
What about me?

115
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
If you discover

116
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,480
that I've lied to you about something,

117
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,000
you're not allowed to be angry, either.

118
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,600
Okay?

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,800
Okay.

120
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,920
Okay.

121
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,040
Master,

122
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,840
have you really fallen in love with that woman?

123
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,720
That's none of your business.

124
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,850
None of my business?

125
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
Master, are you going soft on the demonic sect?

126
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,280
Conquering the martial world

127
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
and clearing all obstacles for His Majesty,

128
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,280
do you still hold on to your original intention,

129
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,880
Master?

130
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,440
I have never changed my mind.

131
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,880
You can rest assured.
