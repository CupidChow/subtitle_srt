[Episode 19 Both Love and Debts Can't Be Easily Repaid]

00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,920
[Dual Love]

3
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,040
I've looked through almost all the medical books in the world.

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,030
But there's still only one sentence I can find,

5
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,630
"Return to the source and learn from analogy."

6
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,170
What on earth does it mean?

7
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,090
When they were writing a book,

8
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,420
why couldn't they make what they were writing a bit clearer?

9
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,010
The method of using one poison to counteract another has been practiced a lot.

10
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,960
But there will be only one shot.

11
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,340
If a mistake is made, he will...

12
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,310
Mo Haoran,

13
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,789
how have you been?

14
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,410
Father, you're still sharp as ever

15
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,009
and full of vigor and energy.

16
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,050
Listen to what you said.

17
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,330
I am always sharp.

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,039
Come on,

19
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,840
spar with me for a few moves.

20
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,230
Daodao, you're not focused.

21
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,230
You shouldn't engage in martial arts when your mind is not focused.

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,290
Have you forgotten what I taught you?

23
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
I haven't.

24
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,229
It's just that...

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,880
I wasn't holding Qingge just now.

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,080
I wasn't used to this.

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
I don't think Qingge is what's on your mind.

28
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,730
Father,

29
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,640
tell me,

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,120
given how he treated us before,

31
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,630
I still keep thinking about him.

32
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,490
Am I being too weak?

33
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,880
I understand.

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,990
I didn't expect Lu to join the Blood Pagoda.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,220
Marquis Shen saved us.

36
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,190
Daodao,

37
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,990
a doctor should have a benevolent heart.

38
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,230
Save him if you want to.

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,030
Miss Xie.

40
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:20,910
Master.

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,980
Return to the source

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
and learn from analogy.

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,610
Return to the source

44
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,560
and learn from analogy?

45
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,920
What on earth does it mean?

46
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,410
Return to the source

47
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,100
and learn from analogy.

48
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,630
Miss Xie,

49
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,300
I offended you that day.

50
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,089
Please don't hold a grudge against Master.

51
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,070
After the poison is eliminated,

52
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,330
whether you want to punish or even kill me

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,410
is your say.

54
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,870
We people in the martial world

55
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,110
don't have to kneel when a mistake is made.

56
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,590
I came here today to ask you

57
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,310
about how Mo Haoran

58
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,880
was poisoned back then.

59
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,950
Back then, Empress Dowager Xiao wanted to control His Majesty,

60
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,350
so she poisoned him with the Jialan Poison.

61
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,540
Master used the blood deflection method

62
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,890
to deflect the poison onto himself.

63
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,980
You mentioned a secret medicine from His Majesty that day.

64
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,550
Why?

65
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,030
The medicine couldn't work?

66
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,030
It can just slow down the poison's spread to the heart,

67
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
in addition to pain relief effects.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Master must have known there was no cure,

69
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,950
so he used the blood deflection method

70
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,080
to save His Majesty.

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,260
Blood deflection method?

72
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,250
Blood deflection method.

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,980
Blood deflection method.

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,460
♫Stories center around sorrow and happiness♫

75
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,260
♫Avoiding worry♫

76
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,870
There is a cure.

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,260
♫Let's talk about our thoughts slowly♫

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,110
♫If one loves another one so deeply♫

79
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,900
♫He'll finally find himself black and blue♫

80
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,050
♫He'll spend the rest of his life panicking after survival♫

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,790
♫Not knowing where to hide♫

82
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,920
♫How sad he looks♫

83
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,170
♫He's all alone, and in the blink of an eye♫

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,810
♫He's crazy for love♫

85
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,310
Master, why are you out here?

86
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,750
It's a good day today.

87
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,290
I came out for some fresh air.

88
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,710
Now that I have the strength to leave my bed.

89
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,510
I don't know

90
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,130
if I have many more chances to see the sun.

91
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,409
Master, please don't talk like that.

92
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,130
It doesn't mean anything inauspicious.

93
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,670
Yuan Ying.

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,230
Did you send the things I asked you to prepare

95
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,590
to Yanhua Mountain?

96
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,910
I did.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,950
Good.

98
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,470
Maybe one day when she uses them,

99
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,250
she'll think of me.

100
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,660
I'm afraid she'll forget me,

101
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,250
yet I'm also afraid she won't be able to forget me.

102
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,750
What does he mean?

103
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,720
Is he trying to leave me an inheritance?

104
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,670
Who am I to him?

105
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,230
Why would I be entitled to his inheritance?

106
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,520
If he's going to die,

107
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,250
he should die far away from me!

108
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,240
Go back and tell your Master

109
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,430
he should take good care of himself

110
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,830
and I'll come to save him.

111
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,130
Don't think too much.

112
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,230
It's not the time for him to act like a tragic hero described in a novel.

113
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,110
Do you hear me?

114
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,150
Yes.

115
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,370
Go. Go.

116
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,150
Master!

117
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,350
The secret guard has returned from Yanhua Mountain!

118
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,910
Master!

119
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,230
Master, there's hope for you!

120
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,710
Miss Xie will surely be able to save you.
