[Episode 17: We're End Here]

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,820
[Dual Love]

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,200
Senior Brother,

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,060
how do you feel?

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,760
-I'm fine.
-Dad.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,490
This minor injury is nothing.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,500
It's a good thing you moved quickly when I unleashed my power.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,730
Otherwise, your internal injuries could have been severe.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,630
Your power was truly impressive this time.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,110
You instantly knocked out all my internal energy.

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,630
Master.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,620
This time, Daodao can dominate the martial world.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,270
Of course.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,350
After all, she's my daughter.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,740
Dad,

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,560
we've now been drawn into the power struggle at court.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,100
What should we do next?

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,750
Master.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,160
I... want to go to the capital to investigate.

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,950
I'll go with you.

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,180
Daodao,

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,360
this time it will be far more dangerous than the last.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,120
Senior Brother.

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,550
Uncle Lu died unjustly.

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,789
We must avenge him.

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,750
This time coming to the capital,

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,990
I must get a clear explanation from Mo Haoran.

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,510
Okay.

29
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,460
You've all grown up.

30
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,000
Those in the martial world should experience hardships.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
I won't stop you.

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,830
Go.

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,650
With me here, guarding Yanhua Mountain,

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,600
this place will always be our home.

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,560
Senior Brother?

36
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,310
Is something bothering you?

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,240
Tell me about it.

38
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,610
I thought...

39
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,660
that without the barriers of good and evil separating us,

40
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,610
we might still be able to be together.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,070
But...

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,329
it still doesn't work out.

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,280
He is a Marquis.

44
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,329
He always has to put the Emperor's orders first.

45
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,310
Today, he can set a trap for the Emperor;

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,230
tomorrow he'll have to set another.

47
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,210
These conspiracies and games are too cruel.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,640
Senior Brother.

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,030
Tell me...

50
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,350
how can he be so ruthless?

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,290
The imperial court and the martial world

52
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,950
are two different worlds after all.

53
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,110
He and I

54
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,900
end here.

55
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,990
Master.

56
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,720
Where's the antidote?

57
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,950
Here, let me.

58
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,430
Come on.

59
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,310
The antidote...

60
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,440
There are only two pills of antidote left.

61
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,100
It's okay.

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,140
Let's take a medicinal bath.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Yuan Ying.

64
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,340
Haven't you realized it yet?

65
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,810
The medicinal bath

66
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,330
can't detoxify the Jialan Poison at all.

67
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,030
Marquis of Ningyuan.

68
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,510
I've troubled Your Majesty

69
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,170
by having you come to my villa.

70
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,040
I...

71
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,170
I deserve death for this.

72
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,630
You have done so much for me.

73
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,409
How could I not show some understanding?

74
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,760
Xu Ruolian and the others have all been arrested.

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,409
The Blood Pagoda has been completely wiped out.

76
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,470
Fortunately, I...

77
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,290
have not failed in my mission.

78
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,380
Are you here to assassinate the Master?

79
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,290
The Master has been severely poisoned.

80
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,510
He doesn't have much time left.

81
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,240
There's no need for you to do it.

82
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,040
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,190
At that time, he was already severely poisoned

84
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,390
and had lost too much blood.

85
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,990
He even...

86
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,350
The Master really has feelings for you.

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Really?

88
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,270
You underestimate the Master's feelings.

89
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,990
Mo Haoran is ruthless and takes lives lightly.

90
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,890
How can someone without a heart claim to have genuine feelings?

91
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,120
You mean Lu from the Scorpio Gang, right?

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,790
He had already joined the Blood Pagoda a long time ago.

93
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,050
He was a spy planted by the Martial Arts Alliance among you.

94
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,030
You're lying.

95
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
Listen for yourself.

96
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,710
Xiao Maozhong has used Xu Ruolian,

97
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,640
Yu Xuan, and others as his pawns...

98
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,700
causing countless loyal officials to suffer over the years.

99
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,600
He should be sentenced to death

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,460
without delay.

101
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,630
Yes.

102
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,090
Congratulations, Your Majesty, on finally assuming full power.

103
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,290
Wugui,

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,950
you've achieved great merit by quelling the rebellion
and capturing the rebel leader this time.

105
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,950
Whatever reward you want, just ask.

106
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,390
Five years ago...

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,680
I had just ascended the throne.

108
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,630
Empress Dowager Xiao wanted to take advantage of my youth

109
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,230
and control me completely, so she poisoned me.

110
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,560
Fortunately, you arrived on time

111
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,420
and saved me.

112
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,700
But you were poisoned by the Jialan Poison instead.

113
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,200
Since then,

114
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,850
you've built a reputation

115
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,980
as a ruthless and treacherous person,

116
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,360
secretly clearing obstacles for me to take full control

117
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,190
while dismantling the Xiao family's power step by step.

118
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,750
You've been so loyal,

119
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,900
yet you've been misunderstood by everyone in the country.

120
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,560
Wugui, I am willing to fulfill

121
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,110
any wishes you have.

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,940
Your Majesty, serving you

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,400
is my duty.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,760
If you truly want to reward me,

125
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,870
please forgive me for the mistakes I made back then.
