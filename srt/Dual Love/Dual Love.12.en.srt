1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,400
Senior Sister, you're back.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,720
Thank you for your hard work.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,200
Has there been anything unusual these past two days?

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,190
Nothing unusual.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,790
No poison outbreaks either.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,450
Alright,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
you may leave now.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,760
Yes.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,320
Qingge.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,130
You're injured.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,010
Chief Mo, your inner strength is truly profound.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,140
Your spirit seems much improved.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,800
Qingge.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,760
Your blood energy is in reverse flow.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,400
You must immediately go into seclusion to recuperate.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,080
Otherwise, the consequences...

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,410
No need for you to worry.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,930
As for you...

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,080
You actually didn't run away.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,920
You even let them tie you up.

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,880
Wait.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,320
Who tied you up?

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,840
Why did Yan Changxuan betray Yanhua Mountain?

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,570
What other schemes do you have?

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,160
Qingge.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,240
Qingge!

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,000
Qingge!

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,360
Guards!

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Untie me quickly!

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,240
What have you done to Senior Sister?

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm tied up;

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,530
what can I do?

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Hurry and untie me.

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,240
Only I can save her now.

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,640
Qingge!

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,440
Qingge!

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,520
Qingge.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Bad guy!

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
What have you done to Senior Sister Daodao?

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,200
There's still another dose of medicine that needs to be decocted.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm injured.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,060
Come and help me decoct the medicine.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,780
I've hurt her so deeply this time.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,820
I'm afraid she won't forgive me, no matter what I do.

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,880
You think decocting the medicine will make she forgive you?

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,010
Senior Sister won't forgive a bad guy.

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Taotao.

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Then tell me

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,930
what I should do?

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Should I be in the cave?

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,970
How did I get back to my room?

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,480
Taotao.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,550
What did you bring?

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
You need to recover your body urgently

56
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,560
after the backlash from demonic power.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,500
Hurry and drink the medicine.

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,360
Did you decoct this medicine?

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,120
Senior Sister,

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,980
I decocted this medicine for you.

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
How would Taotao know what medicine I should take?

62
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,960
I told Taotao the prescription.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,460
You didn't poison it, did you?

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
You should be able to tell

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,690
if there's poison in it.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,610
How do you know this prescription?

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
Prescriptions for nourishing meridians are more or less the same.

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm not completely ignorant.

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,410
You should rest now.

70
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,740
I'll take my leave.

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,040
You clearly hurt me so badly.

72
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
Why do you keep pretending

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,760
to be so sincere?

74
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Do you think I'll forgive you just because of that?

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,080
Even if you die,

76
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,140
I still won't forgive you.

77
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Don't dream on.

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
Yes, Senior Sister.

79
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Don't forgive him.

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,080
But

81
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,720
Father told us

82
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
to repay kindness with kindness.

83
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,960
I only remember Master said that

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,040
we should repay grievances with grievances,

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,080
avenge enmity with enmity,

86
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,940
and express our anger on the spot.

87
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
You're right,

88
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,920
but

89
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,520
the grievances between Mo Haoran and me

90
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,159
aren't something

91
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
that can be easily resolved.

92
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,210
Don't leave.

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
You're awake.

94
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't leave.

95
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,160
Mo Haoran,

96
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,930
we are ultimately going to end up in a life-or-death situation.

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
This is clearly

98
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,610
the medicine bottle that my father always carried with him.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,920
So the medicine was given to you by my father?

100
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,640
You actually had collusion with my father?

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Oh, not collusion

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
but connection.

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,200
I wonder if Daodao is healthy right now.

104
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,409
There's no progress if I keep practicing like this.

105
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,920
I'm still concerned about my daughter's safety after all.

106
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,840
Forget it, forget it.

107
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,100
I'll stop practicing.

108
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,800
I'd better go check on my daughter.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
Since they know each other,

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,010
why has Father never mentioned it?

111
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,720
Is there an inside story for Yan Changxuan's betrayal of Yanhua Mountain?

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,050
I need to go ask Father for clarification.

113
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,080
Marquis?

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,090
Come in quickly.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,050
Marquis,

116
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,680
why did you come here?

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Chief Xie,

118
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,820
have you achieved great success?

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,880
I still have not made any progress.

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
From now on, our Yanhua Mountain

121
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,000
can only rely on Tianba.

122
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
Qingge indeed has great spiritual energy.

123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,159
Marquis,

124
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,159
today, you...

125
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,559
Marquis?

126
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,800
What Marquis?
