1
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,290
Who's there?

2
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,280
Watch out!

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,060
Qingge,

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
are you okay?

5
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,800
Where is he? Hurry and go after him!

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,120
Don't let him escape!

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,210
Senior Brother!

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,160
Daodao?

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,680
What are you doing?

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,840
I...

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
Senior Brother, is someone chasing you?

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,840
My room is right next door.

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,400
You can hide there for now,

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,660
and I'll cover for you.

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,890
Don't leave.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,840
If I don't go now, I won't be able to explain this!

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,480
If you leave,

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,920
the strong floral scent here

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,680
will expose the hidden Jialan Poison.

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
What are you doing?

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Stop right there!

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,160
Hurry up!

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,680
Forgive me for arriving late to the rescue.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,840
Are you okay, Master?

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
Where's that little devil?

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,450
I'm going to kill him today!

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,360
Everyone,

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,360
why have you gathered in force to

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,640
ruin my romantic moment?

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,220
Shameless!

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,050
Despicable!

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,440
Yuan Ying.

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,800
Yes.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,550
See them out.

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,080
Okay.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,040
What should I do?

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,500
They've seen everything.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,200
Qingge, you're my fiancee.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,130
Though this is awkward,

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
it's not a big deal.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Not a big deal?

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,220
Since they have witnessed our romantic moment,

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,600
I believe you

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,770
will definitely take responsibility for me, right?

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Chief Mo,

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,830
what exactly are you up to today?

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
My plans haven't changed;

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,760
it seems that you

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,640
prefer to act on your own.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,770
What do you mean by that?

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,980
You sent someone to assassinate her,

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,740
which truly attracted unnecessary attention.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
I have always acted with integrity.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,240
How could I engage in assassination?

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Then please keep the Martial Arts Alliance in check

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,120
and avoid any unnecessary complications.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Senior Brother told me not to overthink, and he can solve everything.

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,200
But he didn't explain what's exactly going on.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Miss Xie.

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,280
What's up?

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,680
The Talents Hall is having another meeting.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,610
I'll accompany you to check it out.

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Alliance Leader,

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Mo Haoran is still infatuated with women

65
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
at this point.

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
How can the great cause be achieved?

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,160
Chief Mo, you look radiant.

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Success in romance brings such joy.

69
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,120
Everyone,

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
what brings you here

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
to find me this early?

72
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Chief Mo, you left midway last time.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,360
We are here today to continue discussing the plan

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,200
of Demon Slaying.

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,000
Xie Mingyuan is preoccupied with martial arts

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,680
and has no ambition to unify the martial world.

77
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,570
Chief Mo, you're mistaken.

78
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,760
Xie Mingyuan has already mastered the eighth level of demonic power.

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
If we don't attack Evil Mountain now,

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,040
shall we wait until he completes his training

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
and brings bloodshed upon the martial world again?

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
How can one be judged

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,090
before the facts are established?

84
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,800
The so-called righteous sect and demonic sect

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
merely differ in our perspectives.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,760
Now,

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,000
if the martial world initiates an attack on Evil Mountain,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,320
who knows if the so-called righteous sect

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
has also become mad and demonic

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,060
in the eyes of the demonic sect's followers?

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,080
Mo Haoran.

92
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,960
I didn't expect someone of his status

93
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,680
to speak so reasonably.

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,740
Father,

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
I truly didn't misjudge him.

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,300
Have you heard?

97
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,200
You know,

98
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
there was a woman

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,240
in Chief Mo's bed yesterday.

100
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,440
Chief Mo didn't even have his clothes on properly!

101
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,840
And that woman's clothes...

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
It's really...

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,280
Who? Which woman are you talking about?

104
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,800
It's her.

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,170
That hoyden really lucked out.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,520
Qingge,

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,570
don't take what they said to heart.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
What I said before

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
was serious.

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Chief Mo,

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,360
there were some...

112
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,040
but,

113
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
we heroes of the martial world don't fuss over small matters.

114
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,100
You don't need to feel any moral pressure

115
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,280
about saying things like taking responsibility for me.

116
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,200
I think

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
love relies on mutual affection

118
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,810
rather than obligation...

119
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,770
Qingge, did you remember it wrong?

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,260
I never said anything about being responsible for you.

121
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,520
What I actually said was that

122
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,360
you

123
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
should take responsibility for me!

124
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,600
What do you mean?

125
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,210
I don't understand.

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,440
Qingge,

127
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,020
you are pure, kind,

128
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,560
lively, and straightforward.

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
You excel in medicine

130
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
and must also be skilled in swordsmanship.

131
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,420
Most importantly,

132
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
you have great ambitions

133
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,090
and care for all living beings.

134
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,840
Am I really that good?

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,240
Surely someone as wonderful as you

136
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,700
wouldn't refuse to take responsibility for me, right?

137
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
But what if

138
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
I've been lying to you all along?

139
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,330
What have you been lying about?

140
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I used to say I was the daughter of the Martial Arts Alliance Leader

141
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
and the most beautiful woman in the martial world,

142
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,780
but in reality,

143
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,920
it's Miss Xu who is the true beauty.

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,720
Alliance Leader Xu is the Martial Arts Alliance Leader in Central Plains.

145
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
I remember you said

146
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,680
you are from Medicine Valley,

147
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,920
which is far in the southwest.

148
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Your father must be

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,520
the leader from the southern region or the western territories.

150
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,160
As for the most beautiful woman in the martial world,

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,080
in my heart,

152
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,440
you are the most beautiful woman in both the martial world

153
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,880
and the entire world!

154
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,520
Really?

155
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,050
Alright,

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
then I'll take responsibility for you.

157
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,490
I didn't catch that;

158
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,540
can you say it again more clearly?

159
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
How could you not hear clearly?

160
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,240
I mean...

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,120
Watch out!
