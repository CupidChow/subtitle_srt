1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,080
Qingge.

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,080
Qingge.

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,440
Qingge.

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
I'll say it again.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
My name is not Qingge.

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,920
My name is Xie Tianba!

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,680
Chief Mo, you're really patient.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,520
You spent such a long time deceiving me.

9
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,300
Chief Mo, you still have such restraint.

10
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,110
It's this face

11
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,240
that made me fall for you at first sight.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,080
Chief Mo,

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,840
if I were to scar this face of yours,

14
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,840
would you still be this tough?

15
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,479
Even if you kill me,

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
I won't have any complaints.

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,600
Cut the crap.

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,560
But there's one thing I didn't deceive you about.

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Cut the crap!

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm sincere

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,640
towards you.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Sincere?

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,960
Sincere in trying to destroy my whole family?

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Sincere in wanting my family to be ruined?

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,920
Qingge.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,760
Chief Mo, since you came to Yanhua Mountain as a guest,

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,280
I will treat you well.

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,680
Mo Haoran,

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
these medicines and prescriptions

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,370
are left for you.

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,840
Qingge.

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,020
Qing...

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
It smells so good.

34
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,380
Jialan Incense has taken effect.

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
The poison hasn't yet invaded your heart and blood vessels.

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,220
You won't die just yet.

37
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,840
Taotao,

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,000
how is it?

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,080
It's fine.

40
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,040
I just need to apply some medicine.

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,720
Why are you here applying medicine all by yourself?

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Where's Senior Brother?

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,880
I haven't seen him for a while.

44
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,370
Senior Brother?

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Yan Changxuan?

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,320
Are you here?

47
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,340
Senior Brother doesn't seem to have left on his own.

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Does the Martial Arts Alliance have a backup plan?

49
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,720
Chief Mo has actually been captured by that witch.

50
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,320
I still find it a bit strange.

51
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,480
Luckily, Ruyan caught the little demon.

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,240
-Go. -We still have a chance.

53
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,700
Ruyan always considers the bigger picture.

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,730
However, Chief Mo's staying at Evil Mountain

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,540
must have some deeper significance.

56
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,160
Now that Yan Changxuan is in our hands,

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,000
I believe our future actions

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
will be much smoother.

59
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,320
Mom.

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,080
How about letting me handle this little demon?

61
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,280
Ruyan,

62
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,360
this little demon is crucial to our grand demons-slaying plan.

63
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,020
You need to control yourself.

64
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,770
Alright.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,130
I'll keep him alive.

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
Little pervert!

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,240
Big demon!

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,680
Miss.

69
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,720
That day, bumping into you while you were changing was an accident.

70
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,760
Besides, our Yanhua Mountain

71
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,490
is definitely not an evil sect.

72
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,080
Shut up!

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,960
Stop talking!

74
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,000
Fine!

75
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,820
If you want to hit me, do it.

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,010
But I'm warning you,

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,420
you must not get angry.

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,080
Anger is bad for your health.

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,840
It's absurd.

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
It's like playing music to a cow.

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,200
Unbelievable.

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,080
It hurts so much.

83
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,280
Mo Haoran,

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,409
where is Yan Changxuan?

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't pretend to be dead.

86
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,460
How could this happen?

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,110
Mo Haoran,

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,080
you can't die yet.

89
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,320
Qingge?

90
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,680
You're back.

91
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,330
Did you let me catch you on purpose?

92
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,860
Yan Changxuan is now in the hands of the Martial Arts Alliance.

93
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,710
I can't tell you.

94
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,280
Right.

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,130
You've planned this so carefully.

96
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,130
Of course you wouldn't tell me.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
But it's fine.

98
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,160
I'll go down the mountain myself to save him.

99
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,800
Wait.

100
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,410
What else do you have to say?

101
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,720
Yesterday, the Brahma Demonic Technique burst out of your body.

102
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,360
How are you feeling now?

103
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,010
How am I feeling?

104
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,169
I'm perfectly fine.

105
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm energetic,

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,299
feeling light and strong.

107
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,360
I don't need you to worry about me.

108
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Qingge,

109
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,520
the Brahma Demonic Technique bursting out is extremely dangerous.

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,600
You must go into seclusion immediately to recover.
