1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,960
It smells familiar.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,600
Last time I fell down here,

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,860
were you soaking in this medicinal bath?

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,880
Yes.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,760
You can tell the prescription

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,000
just by the smell?

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,360
Of course not.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
I have to taste it.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,440
Just kidding.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,170
If you really tasted it,

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,840
I wouldn't know whether to keep soaking or not.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,650
Is there anything else?

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,330
I'm just watching you soak.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,240
I want to learn how this poison and antidote

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,360
react in your body.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,060
What are you doing?

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,920
Didn't you want to observe?

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,580
Why are you closing your eyes?

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
One glance is enough.

20
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm leaving.

21
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,810
Senior Brother?

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,180
Why are you still here?

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,040
Isn't Yanhua Mountain

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
in an emergency right now?

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Of course, I didn't leave because of Yanhua Mountain.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,200
You look like you're really enjoying yourself.

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,079
Senior Brother,

28
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,800
there's something wrong with you.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Do you really care about

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,840
Yanhua Mountain's safety?

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,370
Don't worry, it'll be soon.

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
It'll be soon?

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
What will be soon?

34
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,620
Daodao,

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
I came here just to tell you

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,240
to make sure to stay safe.

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,900
Leave everything else

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
to me.

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,520
I have other things to do.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,450
I'm leaving now.

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,760
Men are so unreliable

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,700
that I can't trust any of them.

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,240
Am I really the only one left

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,160
at Yanhua Mountain?

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,800
I heard from the pharmacy owner

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,880
that there's a detoxifying herb called Shezhu Grass here,

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,880
which I vaguely remember counteracts Jialan Poison.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
Heavens, please grant me the favor

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
of finding it.

50
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,840
Marquis Shen,

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,560
every time I come, you're soaking in this medicine.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Has there been any improvement?

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm warning you,

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
if there's any improvement,

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,040
you mustn't use it on Daodao.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,360
Our master said

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,370
that was only a temporary measure.

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,760
Mr. Yan,

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,880
you're overthinking it.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How are your arrangements going?

61
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Leave it to me.

62
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,360
The Martial Arts Alliance will depart tomorrow.

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
You should go back first

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,000
just in case.

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
Chief Mo.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,080
Why did you call me here

67
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,890
in the middle of the night?

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
Iron Sword Sect.

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,760
Watch out!

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,060
Spirit Sword Sect.

71
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,360
Watch out!

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
Yiyang Palace.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,760
Chief Mo!

74
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,570
Alliance Leader Xu,

75
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,780
you're truly upright and honest.

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,480
It's you who's been blinded by that woman,

77
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,810
throwing the grand plan of the Martial Arts Alliance aside.

78
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
I've already obtained the map

79
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,159
of the secret passage and mechanisms of Evil Mountain.

80
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,360
We can easily storm the summit.

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,680
Chief Mo,

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
is that true?

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,330
I've said before

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
that my plans are always foolproof.

85
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,480
If anyone tries to interfere,

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,480
I'll have no choice but to send them to hell.

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,680
Alright.

88
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,640
Then I'll follow your arrangements.

89
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,640
Master,

90
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
this sounds like it's from Miss Xie's room.

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,360
It really wasn't me.

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Qingge.

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,040
Why are you here?

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
The medicine I made exploded.

95
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,320
Get out, quickly!

96
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400
I never expected

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
making medicine to be so dangerous.

98
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,159
It's okay.

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,500
It's not a big problem.

100
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,760
You...

101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,400
I haven't figured out how to make the antidote yet.

102
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,960
However,

103
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
I specially made this

104
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,740
Whole Tonifying Pill for you.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,280
Whole...

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
Tonifying Pill?

107
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,160
It's not bitter.

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,760
Try it.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Open your mouth.

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,160
I don't want to.

111
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,820
Just try it.

112
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,320
I won't.

113
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
You won't be a child anymore once you try it.

114
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,880
No.

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
It tastes good.

116
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
I promise you.

117
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,960
-Try it. -I won't eat it.

118
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,400
You...

119
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Master,

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
you ended up taking that

121
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,680
Whole Tonifying Pill?

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
No wonder you didn't sleep a wink last night.

123
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
I feel sorry for you, Master.

124
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,409
Where is Xie Qingge?

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Miss Xie?

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,340
She seems to have been digging

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,420
for wild vegetables in the grass.

128
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,580
Digging for wild vegetables?

129
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,530
Why are you here?

130
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,080
Look.

131
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,360
This is Shezhu Grass,

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,400
which should be able to counteract Jialan Poison.

133
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,680
Unfortunately, my uncles and aunts from Medicine Valley

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,940
haven't replied to me.

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,780
I have to figure it out myself.

136
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,270
Your poison is difficult to treat.

137
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,840
However,

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I'll try my best.

139
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
The thorns here are dense.

140
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,040
You should be careful.

141
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,840
It's not a big deal.

142
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,700
It is a big deal.

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,799
Yuan Ying.

144
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
Miss Xie, let me do it.

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,250
Is it enough?

146
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
Yes.

147
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,310
It's not enough.

148
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,970
Keep going.

149
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,320
Miss Xie,

150
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,400
if you have any problems detoxifying the Master,

151
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
just leave them all to me.
