1
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,280
Mo Haoran,

2
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,170
you can't just leave me behind.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,960
Qingge,

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,620
we've already arrived at the foot of Evil Mountain.

5
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,479
Everyone,

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,330
this is indeed the territory of the demon.

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,840
As expected, the streets are desolate

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,500
and the people are suffering.

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,320
Our mission is to slay the demon

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
and seek justice for the people.

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,000
Seek justice for the people!

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
Esteemed heroes,

13
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,440
this village is now deserted.

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,380
There are only a few empty rooms left in my house;

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,120
how about resting at my place?

16
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Perfect.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,450
Please lead the way.

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,079
Why is Aunt Li still here?

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,920
Didn't Yan Changxuan promise

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,720
to move everyone to a safe place?

21
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,200
This way, heroes.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
I've told Aunt Li so many times

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,880
that those stories are all nonsense

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,360
and not to deal with people from the martial world,

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,820
but she just won't listen!

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,640
Qingge.

27
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,600
Qingge.

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,300
We've reached the foot of Evil Mountain.

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
It's been a bumpy journey.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's find a place to rest first.

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,940
Chief Mo, you've become increasingly close

32
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,680
to that seductress in recent days.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
We're about to reach Evil Mountain;

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,490
why complicate things?

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,450
Where's the mechanism map?

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,290
Give it to me.

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,380
I'll take the lead.

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,580
Alliance Leader, you just follow me.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,280
Rest assured, Alliance Leader.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,400
I guarantee I can get everyone safely up the mountain

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,260
without losing a single soldier.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,640
Alright.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Then I'll trust you one more time.

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,840
Don't worry, Miss Xu.

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Once we reach Evil Mountain,

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,120
I will do my utmost

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,240
to protect you.

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,440
Miss Xu is the Alliance Leader's daughter.

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
Her skills are far beyond yours;

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
does she really need your protection?

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,400
Miss Xu is a young lady

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
who can't possibly imagine

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,060
how ruthless the demonic sect can be.

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,020
They have many wicked methods

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
that are hard to guard against.

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,650
That's true.

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
You don't know that

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,240
the demon named Xie not only committed evil himself

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,760
but also collaborated with the Haiqing Gang and the Luocha Sect,

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,960
practicing the sinister art of absorbing yin to replenish yang,

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,760
causing countless women to suffer.

62
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,200
If the great demon is like this,

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,260
then that little demon Yan Changxuan

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
is no better.

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,000
As the daughter of a demon,

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,040
she must have learned the same harmful practices

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,279
of absorbing yin to replenish yang.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,040
My father has been devoted to my mother his whole life,

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,960
never even considering remarriage.

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,400
Aunt Li pursued him for ten years,

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,960
but he never gave her a second glance.

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
How could these rumors be so disgraceful?

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,490
These are all baseless rumors.

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,980
Stop spreading such filthy gossip behind people's backs.

75
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,530
Sinister art of absorbing yin to replenish yang?

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Just wait and see!

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Yuan Ying.

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,080
Here.

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,980
Take Miss Xie back to Anle Town

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
tomorrow before dawn,

81
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
then meet me at Yanhua Mountain.

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,760
You still want to protect Miss Xie's life.

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,620
Just follow the order.

84
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,560
Mo Haoran.

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,840
Thank you.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,960
However,

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,560
from now on,

88
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,920
we'd better not meet again.

89
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,920
Qingge.

90
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,370
You're back.

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,409
What's this?

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,130
This is the antidote I just developed.

93
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,520
This time, without letting Yuan Ying test it,

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,780
do you dare to drink it?

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Qingge.

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,250
Is there anything else?

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Nothing,

98
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
I just want to look at you.

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,130
Is that not okay?

100
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,890
Of course it's okay.

101
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,890
You can look for as long as you want.

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,840
No!

103
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,760
Qingge!

104
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,800
You...

105
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
What did you just give me to drink?

106
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Qingge.

107
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
You can't do this.

108
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,200
Why not?

109
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't you truly like me?

110
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,130
Was everything before just a joke?

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
I truly like you.

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
Of course I'm sincere.

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,720
But I can't do this casually.

114
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,440
I like you,

115
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
and I will definitely marry you properly,

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
with a grand wedding.

117
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,970
Please don't be impulsive.

118
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
What is this?

119
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,360
Qingge.

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,280
So,

121
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,780
you have the same thoughts as I do.

122
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,200
No.
