[Episode 22: Mo Haoran, I Miss You So Much]

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,990
[Dual Love]

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,660
Master,

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,770
Daodao's martial arts are now unbeatable in the world.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,750
I think she's more suitable to be the sect leader.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,350
You're my Head Disciple.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,530
Are you trying to shirk responsibility at this point?

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,710
Master,

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,170
I already have someone in my heart.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,470
Someone in your heart?

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,990
Is she better than our Daodao?

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,230
Don't forget,

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,390
Daodao is the most beautiful girl in the martial world.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,150
You'll regret it.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,510
Master,

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,080
all these years,

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,590
I've always seen you as my own father,

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,320
and Daodao as my little sister.

19
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,940
We'll always be family.

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,230
Alright.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,700
[One month later]

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,770
Mo Haoran,

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,580
you've been missing for a month.

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,240
Dad and Senior Brother said

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,650
you're already dead.

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,770
But I don't believe it.

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,870
You fooled me once,

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,430
so you could fool me a second time.

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,860
I believe you're still alive.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,350
Senior Brother has gone down the mountain to Kunlun to find Miss Xu.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,880
Dad is always in seclusion.

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,520
This mountain has suddenly become so empty.

33
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,270
Mo Haoran,

34
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,509
where are you?

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,600
I miss you so much.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,100
The Kunlun Sect Leader's Token?

37
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,060
Why does Xu Ruyan want to see me?

38
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,890
Could something have happened to Senior Brother?

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,490
There are no guards at the gate.

40
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,030
It seems that Miss Xu is bearing

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,940
a heavy burden in rebuilding the Kunlun Sect.

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Xu Ruyan?

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,230
Yan Changxuan?

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,990
Come out!

45
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,829
Who's causing trouble here?

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,150
Why is it you?

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,290
What are you doing here?

48
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,840
Didn't you call me here?

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,390
Where did you get this Sect Leader's Token?

50
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,750
I found it in my room.

51
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,440
I thought something had happened to Senior Brother,

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,970
so I rushed over to Kunlun Sect to check on him.

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,460
If something happened to your Senior Brother,

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,590
what does that have to do with the Kunlun Sect?

55
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,310
Miss Xu,

56
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,730
my Senior Brother is deeply devoted to you.

57
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,130
His desire to make amends to you is sincere.

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,090
Miss Xu,

59
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,240
where is my Senior Brother now?

60
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,430
The Kunlun Sect has never guarded against Mr. Yan.

61
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,920
He is free to come and go.

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,920
I suppose

63
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,760
he finally found the Kunlun Sect cold and dull,

64
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,070
so he went down the mountain and left.

65
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,400
My Senior Brother left?

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,240
He's not the kind of person to quit halfway.

67
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,900
She will forgive me.

68
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,450
She won't forgive me.

69
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,720
She will forgive me.

70
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,010
She won't forgive me.

71
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,430
She will forgive me.

72
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,670
She won't forgive me.

73
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,210
She will forgive me.

74
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,390
She won't forgive me.

75
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,450
Oh my.

76
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,260
Yan, what are you doing?

77
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,339
Your Lordship, have you really settled everything now?

78
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,600
I've already said I'm no longer a Marquis.

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,150
Yan,

80
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,950
let's just refer to each other by names.

81
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,890
Then congratulations, Mo,

82
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,350
for being able to leave behind your heavy responsibilities

83
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,350
and live a carefree life from now on.

84
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,710
Despite that,

85
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,110
I'll be all alone in the future.

86
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,750
Mo,

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
if you have nowhere to go,

88
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,880
why not come back to Kunlun with me?

89
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,990
Kunlun?

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,420
Now I'm in Kunlun Mountain, taking orders from Miss Xu.

91
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,320
It was all your fault

92
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,370
for calling me here in such a hurry

93
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,350
to help you fake your death in front of the Emperor.

94
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,350
When I left,

95
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,500
I didn't even have time to tell Miss Xu.

96
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,180
I'm doomed.

97
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,010
It was all because we worked so well together before.

98
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,140
We've deceived Qingge several times.

99
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,870
I thought it would be better to do it with someone who was used to it.

100
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,790
I'm telling you,

101
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,850
now that I've left,

102
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,860
everything I did for Miss Xu before

103
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,190
doesn't count anymore.

104
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,360
I even helped you deceive our Daodao.

105
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,700
Look what you made me do.

106
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,840
On one side is my wife

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,470
and on the other is my Junior Sister,

108
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,200
and I've offended both of them.

109
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm doomed.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,460
Mo.

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,170
I've suffered heavy losses.

112
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,170
It's okay.

113
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,470
You still have me, a fellow brother who is in the same situation as you.

114
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,110
You?

115
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,440
Miss Xu, you truly are the most beautiful girl in the martial world.

116
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,350
If I were a man,

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,530
I'd like you too.

118
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,950
Let's not mention these trivial matters anymore.

119
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,950
Where do you think

120
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,970
we can find Yan Changxuan?

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,350
I received the Kunlun Sect Leader's Token

122
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,030
on Yanhua Mountain.

123
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,640
My Senior Brother should not be far from there.

124
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,870
Actually, before,

125
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,320
my mother

126
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,970
also gave a Kunlun Sect Leader's Token

127
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,770
to the Chief of Fengyu Pavilion.

128
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,030
Mo Haoran?

129
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,730
I knew he wouldn't easily give up his life.

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,840
Thank you.

131
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,080
-Steamed buns?
-Dried plum?

132
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,830
-Yan Changxuan?
-Mo Haoran?

133
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,790
I knew you weren't dead.

134
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,570
I've been waiting for you.

135
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,830
You finally came back.

136
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,810
I'm back.

137
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,590
This time,

138
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,770
I'll never leave you again.

139
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,490
What are you doing?

140
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,150
Why are we different from them?

141
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,390
Mo, what's going on?

142
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,810
Don't hit me!

143
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,010
Senior Brother,

144
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,159
why are you in the kitchen?

145
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm making a bowl of vegetable noodles for Miss Xu.

146
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,020
You've burned the kitchen down like a dozen times.

147
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,820
Are you sure you want to make the noodles yourself?

148
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,130
That was in the past.

149
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,330
I'm different now.

150
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,409
What are you here for?

151
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,900
Mo Haoran's health is poor,

152
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
so I made him a medicinal dish

153
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,830
to help him recover.

154
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,360
Go ahead.

155
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
Take it easy.

156
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,800
No, no, no, no, no!

157
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,850
It's fine, you go ahead and do your thing.

158
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,270
My little heart...

159
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,070
Pound! Knead!

160
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,910
Mo Haoran,

161
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,390
I made you a bowl of medicinal cuisine.

162
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,309
Hurry up and drink it while it's warm.
