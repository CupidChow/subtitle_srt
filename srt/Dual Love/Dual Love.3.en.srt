1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,200
Yanhua Mountain is Evil Mountain?

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,640
My father is not the Martial Arts Alliance Leader?

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
It's impossible.

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,400
There must be a conspiracy.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,200
Yanhua Mountain can't possibly be a demonic sect.

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,360
I won't worry about that Marquis of Ningyuan for now.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,560
I need to find a way to uncover the truth.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,520
But...

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,300
Why would Father lie to me?

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,240
Miss Xie, practicing with your blade like this

11
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,970
is really harmful to your body.

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,880
Worried about these things?

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll compensate you for the full price.

14
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,479
I'm not worried about these things.

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,820
I'm worried about you.

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,080
Worried about me?

17
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,840
Do you know why

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm in such pain now?

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
Do you know how it feels

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,289
to be deceived for eighteen years?

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,800
We are family!

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,800
Does he think if he's not the  Martial Arts Alliance Leader,

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,860
I won't acknowledge him as my father?

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
You should go.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,880
Chief Mo.

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,220
Miss Xie, are you feeling better?

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,640
Chief Mo.

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
I have a favor to ask.

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,160
You...

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,140
Can you take me to the martial arts assembly?

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
You're not going to kill the Marquis of Ningyuan?

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,560
We'll talk about that later.

33
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,360
Chief Mo.

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,480
Right now,

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,340
I just want you to take me to experience the martial arts assembly.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,210
But our Fengyu Pavilion has never had female disciples.

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,360
Then...

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
Older sister?

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,540
Little sister?

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,520
If those don't work,

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
you can say I'm your maid.

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,520
You are the daughter of the Martial Arts Alliance Leader.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
To say you're my maid

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,260
would be inappropriate, I'm afraid.

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,900
Chief, you flatter me.

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,200
I didn't mean to deceive you, Chief.

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
It's alright.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,880
Fiancée!

49
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,250
Fiancée works, too!

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
As long as you're willing to help, Chief Mo,

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
any identity will do.

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,930
Alright.

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,770
It's settled, then.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,460
He's actually willing to help me.

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,160
I must uncover the truth about this matter.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,640
If you have no other business,

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,760
I have some urgent matters to attend to.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,410
I'll have to see you out now.

59
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,560
Please.

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,850
I'm not leaving.

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Chief Mo, is your poison acting up again?

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,280
What symptoms do you have? I can help you.

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,880
Chief Mo.

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
Do you feel heartache, chest pain, or...

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
Can you stop making noise?

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,200
If you delay my master's detoxification,

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll kill you.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,640
Chief Mo, what symptoms do you have?

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
I can alleviate them all.

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,520
Miss Xie.

71
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,440
I beg you.

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
Please leave.

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
First room on the left.

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,880
First room on the right.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh, right.

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,810
First room on the right.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
Junior Sister hasn't returned.

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,210
I hope she hasn't run into any trouble.

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
Let me borrow Daodao's Night Walker's Robe

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
to avoid trouble.

81
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,540
I can't pull it off.

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,240
Miss, I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,960
I entered the wrong room.

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
Wait until I finish my business.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Do with me as you will at that time.

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
You audacious thief!

87
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,320
Despicable!

88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,040
Vulgar!

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll take my leave now,

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,490
but I promise I'll take responsibility for this.

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,900
The Alliance Leader has arrived!

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,960
Chief Mo.

93
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
On your sect's invitation,

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
this young lady's name wasn't mentioned.

95
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,840
Well...

96
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Qingge is my fiancée.

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,450
She's naturally a member of our Fengyu Pavilion.

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,220
Thank you all for waiting.

99
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,320
Today, we convene this martial arts assembly.

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm grateful for the support from all of you, the sect leaders.

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,880
I...

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,400
Chief Mo, you...

103
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,240
It's fine for Miss Xie to accompany Chief Mo usually,

104
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,480
It's fine for Miss Xie to accompany Chief Mo usually,

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,680
but today is the martial arts assembly!

106
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,740
I just got engaged the day before yesterday.

107
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,080
This is my fiancée,

108
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,320
Xie Qingge.

109
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,180
She insisted on coming to the martial arts assembly to broaden her horizons.

110
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,580
Thank you for just now,

111
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,600
or I wouldn't have known how to get in.

112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,060
Attacking Evil Mountain…

113
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,600
You'll have to stay close to me these days,

114
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,720
or we'll be busted.

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,080
He's committing all kinds of evil deeds…

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,340
That wouldn't be good.

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,140
The people near Evil Mountain

118
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,930
are all complaining and can barely make a living.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Our mission is to seek justice for them.

120
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,760
However, Evil Mountain is a natural fortress with many traps.

121
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,880
What's wrong?

122
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
We need to be fully prepared.

123
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,960
Help me. Don't let them find out.

124
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,400
Chief.

125
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,400
This place isn't fun at all.

126
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,320
Can you take me out to play?

127
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,610
How dare you!

128
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,840
What kind of behavior is this for a martial arts assembly?

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
The fragrance of gardenias is getting stronger.

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Let's go quickly.

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,960
With my lovely wife by my side,

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
I really have no interest in listening to Alliance Leader Xu's grand speech.

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,320
Please continue without me.

134
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,780
I'll go back to rest first.

135
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,440
Chief Mo.

136
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,780
Alliance Leader, this...

137
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,800
Master, be careful!

138
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,040
Watch out!

139
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
How did the poison become so severe?

140
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,200
Didn't you take the medicine I gave you?

141
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,480
Medicine of unknown origin.

142
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
How could I possibly give it to him?

143
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,680
You...

144
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,600
Qingge.

145
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,480
If you had honestly taken the medicine I gave you,

146
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,809
you wouldn't have to suffer like this now.

147
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,480
It's alright.

148
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,220
I can still hold on.

149
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
My father says

150
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,520
life is the most precious thing of all.

151
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,720
Can't you value your own life a bit more?

152
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,560
Are you worried about me?

153
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,640
If you die,

154
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,440
how can I continue enjoying the excitement of the martial arts assembly?

155
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,900
I didn't think it through.

156
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Please, carry on.

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,720
Get out.

158
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
I won't leave.

159
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,730
What are you going to do?

160
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Yuan Ying.

161
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,040
Get out.

162
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,480
Why is this so difficult to undo?

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Let me do it myself.

164
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,080
However…

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,140
However...

166
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,970
Why do I need to take off my clothes?

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,750
The acupoint charts I saw on the mountain

168
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,410
were all of unclothed bodies.

169
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,640
If you don't take off your clothes,

170
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,700
how can I clearly see your acupoints?

171
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,140
I feel much better now.

172
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,880
Why don't we do this another day?

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,920
No, listen to me.

174
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,510
Let's begin.
