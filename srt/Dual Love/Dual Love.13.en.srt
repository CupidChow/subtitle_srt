1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,400
Marquis Shen,

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,960
today...

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,640
Marquis?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,930
What "Marquis"?

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,160
Dad,

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,300
you've come out of seclusion?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,800
You really do know him.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,320
What's going on here?

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,360
Daodao.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,130
Why are you here today?

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
I was worried about you, of course.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,320
I've been guarding the Jingsi Garden every day,

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,250
and what do I get?

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,580
As soon as you come out,

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,240
you seek out our enemy instead of seeing your daughter.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,840
Daodao.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,800
I was wrong.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,280
Don't be angry, okay?

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,500
Who is he, exactly?

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,760
Let me introduce you.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,960
This is Shen Wugui, the Marquis of Ningyuan,

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,760
Marquis Shen.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Marquis Shen,

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,520
this is my daughter, Tianba.

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,720
What?

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,600
Shen Wugui?

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,760
Marquis of Ningyuan?

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,520
You?

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,240
It is I.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,080
You clearly know that you're...

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
a born eunuch.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,440
Yet you still wanted to take me as a concubine?

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,240
Mo Haoran,

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,720
you are utterly depraved, shameless,

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,560
and selfish!

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,039
Don't you know

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,560
whether I'm a born eunuch or not?

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,640
Alright, alright.

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,240
Daodao.

40
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,680
These are all rumors.

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,190
The reason I said those things

42
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,160
was to make you agree to marry him.

43
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,910
Why must I marry him?

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,360
I don't want you to get involved in

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,039
the great battle between Yanhua Mountain and the Martial Arts Alliance.

46
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,840
The Marquis of Ningyuan promised

47
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
to marry you and hide you away in his household,

48
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,320
ensuring your safety.

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,320
The Emperor was still young when he ascended the throne.

50
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,200
Empress Dowager Xiao indulged her brother, Lord Xiao,

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
allowing him to control the court

52
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,900
and harm loyal officials.

53
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,280
Lord Xiao has long harbored rebellious intentions.

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,140
Over the years,

55
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,039
several ministers who assisted in the government died unnaturally.

56
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,160
After my investigation,

57
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,680
it turned out to be the work of an assassination organization called Blood Pagoda.

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Congratulations to Alliance Leader Xu for taking charge of the Martial Arts Alliance.

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,090
Congratulations, congratulations.

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,450
You're too kind, sect leaders.

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,960
Now that I lead the martial world,

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,200
I have a small request for all of you.

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
Starting today,

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,400
our Martial Arts Alliance must also do its part

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,380
to bring peace to the country,

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,810
eliminate evil, and protect the good.

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,560
Then...

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
Those so-called righteous sects of the martial world

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
are actually assassins.

70
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,079
Xu Ruolian is in collusion with Xiao Guozhong.

71
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,760
The other sects

72
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,280
have been deceived by her role as the Martial Arts Alliance Leader.

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,880
That's why they've become their accomplices.

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
So our Yanhua Mountain

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,410
is not a demonic sect at all.

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,920
That's right.

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
It's all because Xu Ruolian covets our sect's secret martial arts manual.

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,320
She has distorted our techniques, calling them the Brahma Demonic Technique,

79
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,580
and has spread false rumors that our sect is a demonic sect.

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
With just the power of my Fengyu Pavilion alone...

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,240
it would be difficult

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,680
to capture them all so easily.

83
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,440
Therefore,

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I came up with the idea of joining forces with Chief Xie

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
to support the Emperor

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,660
and protect the realm.

87
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,560
I'll be relying heavily on your support

88
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
for this plan.

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,079
Since it's for the sake of the people,

90
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,680
I will certainly do my utmost.

91
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,079
Dad,

92
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,680
how's my swordsmanship?

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,040
Outside is my daughter Tianba.

94
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
She's gentle and kind by nature,

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,820
although she does speak a bit loudly.

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,180
Thinking back now,

97
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,320
that was actually the first time I saw you.

98
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,840
So the Marquis of Ningyuan isn't the top villain of this dynasty.

99
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,580
Then how come you're also the Chief of Fengyu Pavilion?

100
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,100
Fengyu Pavilion is the Emperor's secret guard organization.

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,760
I see.

102
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,950
Dad,

103
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
why didn't you tell me

104
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
about such an important matter?

105
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
If I told you,

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,640
with your personality, you'd definitely meddle.

107
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,120
-I. -No.

108
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,840
Be eager to help. Be eager to help.

109
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,400
I was just worried about you.

110
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,159
I didn't expect you to leave the mountain on your own

111
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,720
and end up at the Martial Arts Alliance meeting.

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,909
So I quickly asked the Marquis of Ningyuan and Yan Changxuan

113
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,840
to go to Anle Town to watch over you.

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,020
Changxuan,

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,260
be careful on your way.

116
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,120
So, Yan Changxuan didn't betray us?

117
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,500
This was all part of your plan?

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
That's right.

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,760
This was all arranged between the Marquis and me.

120
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,820
I'm sorry, Qingge.

121
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,680
I had no choice but to deceive you about some things,

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,000
but I've never lied about certain others.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
I hope you can forgive me.

124
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,880
Wait a minute,

125
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,840
is there something going on between you two...

126
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,440
Have I disrupted your plans?

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,420
Can I make up for it?

128
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
I've kept you by my side all this time

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
because Xu Ruolian discovered your true identity

130
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,960
and ordered the Blood Pagoda to assassinate you.

131
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,890
So I've caused you so much trouble.

132
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,880
I...

133
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,360
I originally wanted Yuan Ying

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,240
to quietly take you back to Anle Town.

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,840
It wasn't that night in Baihua Village, was it?

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,280
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,620
I've been using you all along.

138
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,680
Hey!

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,880
Do you think I'm a fool?

140
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,090
Daodao, you tell me,

141
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:52,320
what are you and the Marquis hiding from me?

142
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Chief Xie,

143
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,720
Qingge and I have already...

144
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,200
Dad!

145
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,120
How could there be anything between me and Chief Mo,

146
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
right?

147
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,740
You're really not lying to me?

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
Anyway, Dad,

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
if there are any plans in the future, you have to include me.

150
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,120
My Brahma Demonic Technique is still quite powerful.

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
I'm going to practice now.

152
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm leaving now.

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
-Wait, Daodao... -Dad, goodbye.

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm off.

155
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,200
Daodao!

156
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,640
Your Lordship,

157
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,100
what's wrong with Daodao?

158
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,000
Chief Xie,

159
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,080
I think my Jialan Poison is flaring up again.

160
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,140
I need to find Miss Xie to detoxify it.

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
See you later.

162
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,500
Your Lordship!

163
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,810
There's definitely something going on between you two.

164
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,880
Miss Xie.

165
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,810
Miss Xie.

166
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,600
You don't want to tell Chief Xie

167
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,920
about us.

168
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,240
Is it because you're still angry with me?

169
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
There is nothing between us.

170
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,440
That night in Baihua Village...

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,240
That night in Baihua Village...

172
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,820
I was being presumptuous.

173
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,680
Chief Mo.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,060
I've  ruined the plan you've been preparing for so long.

176
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,700
Eliminating the Blood Pagoda

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
is a great deed that benefits all under heaven.

178
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,920
I'll do my best to make up for

179
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
the trouble I've caused you before.

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,960
Qingge.

181
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,820
I've never thought of you as trouble.

182
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,890
Thank you for your magnanimity, Chief Mo.

183
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,840
Chief Mo.

184
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,280
Chief Mo?

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Chief Mo?

186
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,520
You haven't been taking medicine

187
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,920
or sealing your acupoints to contain the poison these past two days.

188
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,180
It must have been hard.

189
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,510
But that's the only way to deceive them.

190
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,800
Qingge.

191
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,130
I have to go now.

192
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,920
After meeting with them,

193
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,010
take the antidote as soon as possible.

194
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,680
Otherwise, the Jialan Incense will spread more quickly.

195
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,280
Got it.
