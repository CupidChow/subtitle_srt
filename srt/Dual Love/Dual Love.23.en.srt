[Dual Love]

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,070
Mo Haoran,

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,550
I made you a bowl of medicinal cuisine.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,410
Hurry and drink it while it's hot.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,760
What's wrong?

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,730
It isn't bitter at all.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,590
Try it.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,070
Qingge,

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,750
what did you add

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,480
to this medicinal cuisine?

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,000
Just some herbs that can replenish Qi and help you recuperate.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,640
You're not a kid anymore.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,250
Come on.

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,990
I'll do it myself.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,040
Drink it.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,690
How is it?

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,270
I told you it's not bitter at all, right?

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,490
Qingge,

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,590
I thought you would take this opportunity

21
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,870
to trick me and teach me a lesson again.

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,990
I'll definitely teach you a lesson.

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,820
As for tricking you,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,800
I'll save that for when I'm in a bad mood.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
You have forgiven me so easily?

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,820
Am I dreaming?

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,090
Dreams do end.

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,430
However,

29
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,490
the first thing you'll see when you wake up tomorrow morning

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,090
will definitely still be me.

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,509
Alright.

32
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,120
Here.

33
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,980
Don't eat this bowl of noodles.

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,790
I'll go down the mountain to buy a bowl for you

35
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,250
if you want to eat noodles.

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,030
What will you do in the future?

37
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,590
You mean

38
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,970
you'll go down the mountain every day to buy a bowl for me?

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,949
As long as you like it,

40
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,480
I'll go buy a bowl every day.

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,550
What if

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,420
I just want to eat the noodles with vegetables you make?

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,430
Then... Then I'll learn how to cook it as quickly as possible.

44
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,829
I'll learn to cook whatever you want to eat.

45
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,540
What are you waiting for?

46
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,150
Miss Xie.

47
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,490
Mr. Mo.

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,120
Changxuan.

49
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,030
My mother did many wrong things in the past.

50
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,990
She failed you.

51
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,579
Yet you still gave me

52
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,060
and the Kunlun Sect a chance to start anew.

53
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm very grateful to you.

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,910
Miss Ruyan,

55
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,550
what happened before is in the past.

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,160
And you haven't done anything wrong.

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,270
We're almost family to each other now,

58
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,750
right?

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,910
Daodao,

60
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,110
listen to what you said.

61
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,530
What do you mean by almost family?

62
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,060
We are family to each other.

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,720
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

64
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,790
Cheers.

65
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,030
Wait, wait, wait.

66
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,760
You

67
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,250
need to take good care of your body.

68
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,950
You can't drink alcohol.

69
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,150
Have some soup first.

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,400
I know you've been in good health,

71
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,350
but we've got so many to deal with in the sect lately.

72
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,350
You should still eat more to replenish your strength.

73
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,110
Okay.

74
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,990
It's delicious.

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,390
You should have some too.

76
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,700
Try some as well.

77
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,490
Put it here.

78
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,910
She's about to block you.

79
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,390
Come on.

80
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,080
Put it here, put it here.

81
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,510
Trying to set a trap for me?

82
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,640
That's impossible.

83
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,980
Why are they acting childishly?

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,710
Quite adorable though.

85
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,770
Your turn, come on.

86
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,780
Let's go.

87
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,420
Move aside, move aside.

88
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,180
Your turn.

89
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,280
Mo.

90
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,110
Daodao's blade skills

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,370
are getting more and more impressive.

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
Daodao

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,710
is skilled at both blades

94
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,510
and medicine.

95
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,830
She's quite fierce and capable.

96
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,630
Mo,

97
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,909
you may not lead an easy life after you marry her.

98
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,360
Miss Xu's whip skills have improved considerably as well.

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,050
Sect Leader Xu bears the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the Kunlun Sect.

100
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,980
There's much to be done at present.

101
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,580
Given her serious demeanor,

102
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,380
seems she'll have to be like this for a while longer.

103
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,300
Of course, I'll help Ruyan.

104
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,270
I just love the way she's being cold.

105
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,590
Then I'll dote on Qingge as well.

106
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,500
I just love how fierce Qingge is.

107
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,100
Well, Mo,

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
when will you return to Yanhua Mountain?

109
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,730
Don't you think

110
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,510
you should go back and ask my master's opinion about your marriage?

111
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,470
Also,

112
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,510
don't you think you two being here

113
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,070
are really affecting our private time?

114
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,690
Don't worry.

115
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,630
Tomorrow, Qingge and I will set off for Yanhua Mountain.

116
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,670
Really?

117
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,390
By then,

118
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,420
Qingge and I will wait for you on Yanhua Mountain.

119
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,330
Bring Miss Xu back to the mountain.

120
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,610
Just wait and see.

121
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,790
Great!

122
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,830
Have you thought it through?

123
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,600
You won't be a marquis anymore.

124
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,760
Are you willing to give up wealth and glory?

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,320
For you,

126
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
there's nothing I can't give up.

127
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,190
Then,

128
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,430
what about the young emperor you've raised since childhood?

129
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,800
♫Rain falls under the eaves, dropping into the bowl♫

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,890
Are you willing to part with him as well?

131
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,140
♫We snuggle up to each other in front of the window♫

132
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,000
The imperial power has returned to its rightful place.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,880
It's time for me to retire after my mission is accomplished.

134
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,950
♫Your heartbeat♫

135
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,670
Besides,

136
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,270
His Majesty probably

137
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,100
♫Is extremely gentle and lovely♫

138
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,220
wouldn't want an unrestrained Marquis of Ningyuan.

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
What about Yuan Ying?

140
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,030
If you're not going to be a marquis

141
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,000
♫It's fate, it's destiny♫

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,380
or manage the Fengyu Pavilion,

143
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,350
what should Yuan Ying do?

144
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,380
♫I've never hesitated to fall in love with you♫

145
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,590
Yuan Ying is His Majesty's secret guard.

146
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,400
It's something that His Majesty should arrange.

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,740
♫Hold your fingertips in my hand♫

148
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,850
However, Yuan Ying

149
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,310
also longs for the freedom of the martial world.

150
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,430
So, he'll come find us soon.

151
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,670
♫Along the journey, we walk side by side♫

152
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,190
Then what about your...

153
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,270
Why do you always ask about others except me?

154
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,620
♫I do believe love can make us connected♫

155
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,910

♫The moment we met♫

157

♫I can't believe I fell in love with you immediately♫

159
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,950
Has the remaining poison been cleared?

160
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,500
Are you happy living on Yanhua Mountain?

161
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,740

♫I'm so sure love can make us connected♫

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,070
No, I'm not.

167

♫I can be with you every day♫

168
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,400

♫We hold our hands and promise each other that we'll be together forever♫

173

he gave me several martial arts manuals.

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,990
I will practice martial arts diligently

175
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,990
and build my body,

176
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,310
striving to live longer.

177
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,640

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,520
♫Whether it's rainy or sunny♫

188
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,490
and the Ten Thousand-Wave Sword Manual.

189
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,550
And there's also a copy of the Sunflower Manual.

190
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,810
♫I'll be with you♫

191
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,330
The Sunflower Manual?

192
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,950
You haven't practiced it, have you?

193
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,280
♫I believe love can make us connected♫

194
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,990
Not yet.

195
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm planning to practice it.

196
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,300
What's wrong?

197
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,740
♫Listen to your breath♫

198
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,390
Don't practice it.

199
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,000
Just throw it away.

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,040
♫Our gazes meet, stirring ripples of affection♫

201
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,710
Why?

202
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,400
I'll tell you later.

203
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,710
Tell me now.

204
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,049
♫Our smiles are in perfect harmony♫

205
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,040
I can't tell you now.

206
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,220
Come on, tell me.

207
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,549
I really can't tell you.

208
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,880
♫How lucky I am to have met you in this life♫

209
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,230
No way.

210
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,669
You'll understand in the future.

211
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,230
If you don't tell me,

212
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,350
I'll practice the Sunflower Manual.

213
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,380
There's really nothing worth practicing.

214
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,350
Look at the stars.

215
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,140
No.

216
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:40,830
Count them.

217
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,630
Count how many stars are in the sky.

218
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,320
I don't want to.

219
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,450
The stars aren't as beautiful as you.

220
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,370
Really?

221
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,680
If you say something sweet, I'll tell you.
