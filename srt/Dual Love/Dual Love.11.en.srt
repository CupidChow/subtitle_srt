1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,080
Qingge.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,600
The Brahma Demonic Technique is extremely dangerous when it explodes within the body.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,660
You must immediately go into seclusion to recuperate.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,320
Chief Mo, you're surprisingly knowledgeable about the Brahma Demonic Technique.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,560
I'm truly sorry

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,440
that I didn't let all you righteous heroes

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,920
practice this supreme divine skill.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,520
Qingge.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,680
Don't act rashly.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,560
And don't go down the mountain recklessly.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,960
Yan Changxuan won't die anytime soon.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,220
Who do you think you are

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,120
to tell me what to do?

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,760
Qingge.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,480
If you trust me,

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,080
let me go back.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,780
I promise I'll bring Yan Changxuan back safely.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,520
Okay?

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,750
Do you think I'm a big fool?

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,960
Let you go back?

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,040
Dream on.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,360
Qingge…

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,760
One pill a day.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Don't let him die.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,039
Also,

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,180
change his dirty clothes.

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,000
Qingge.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Since Senior Brother was captured here,

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,880
he surely wouldn't be in the guest room.

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,690
Senior Brother.

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,480
Wake up.

32
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,680
-I'll eat a bit more.
-Wake up.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
Wake up!

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,730
Chicken leg.

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,640
How are you?

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,370
Are you hurt?

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,000
Daodao.

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,050
Why are you here?

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Do you have any food?

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm so hungry.

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,200
I knew they wouldn't feed you.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,079
Let me have a bite first.

43
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,880
Quick, quick.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Hurry and eat.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
After you finish, I can help you escape.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,690
It's really delicious.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
I can't leave yet.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,640
Why not?

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,440
Don't ask.

50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,690
I can't tell you.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,780
You go back to the mountain first.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,740
Are you hiding something from me?

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
You won't tell me anything I ask.

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,760
Fine.

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,170
Take care of yourself then.

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,920
Remember,

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,450
no matter what happens,

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,260
preserve your life first.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
I will protect Yanhua Mountain.

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,300
Yan Changxuan.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,950
I'll believe for now

62
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,079
that your feelings for me are genuine.

63
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,520
Mother.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,100
I've brought him here.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Have you thought it through?

66
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,079
Yes, I have.

67
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm willing to join the Martial Arts Alliance

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,420
and contribute to the eradication of Yanhua Mountain.

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
I only hope you, the Alliance Leader, can promise me

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,850
that after this is done, Ruyan and I...

71
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,110
Daodao.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,200
Miss Xu.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
If we capture Xie Tianba

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
and use her as bait

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
to lure Xie Mingyuan down the mountain,

77
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
we can surely wipe out the entire demonic sect in one fell swoop.

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,770
Senior Brother?

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,360
Don't call me Senior Brother.

80
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
Xie Mingyuan treated me like a slave.

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,640
I've wanted to kill him for a long time.

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,570
That's not true.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,600
Father has always treated you like his own son.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,730
I've always seen you as my own brother.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Own brother? Own son?

86
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,360
He didn't teach me the Brahma Demonic Technique.

87
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
He only taught me a few mediocre sword techniques

88
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
and made me manage your Xie family's

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,680
miscellaneous trivial matters.

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
Is that how he treats his own son?

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,240
The Brahma Demonic Technique is extremely negative.

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,960
Men need to wait until adulthood to practice it.

93
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,020
Father was doing it for your own good.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,280
Your father even wanted to betroth you to me,

95
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,210
have me marry into your Xie family,

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,680
and be a servant for life.

97
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,320
Did he ever consider whether I was willing?

98
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,990
Moreover,

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,960
back then,

100
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
you were caught in bed with that Mo Haoran,

101
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,920
becoming the laughingstock of the entire martial world.

102
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,650
How could I possibly marry you?

103
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,400
Look at Miss Xu.

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,760
She's chaste, self-respecting, admirable, and lovable.

105
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,890
She's a hundred times better than you.

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,880
So,

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
you actually betrayed your sect for a pretty face.

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
What I'm doing is called

109
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,480
"Abandoning darkness for light."

110
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,810
Why waste so many words?

111
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
Go. Go.

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,480
Go, go, go!

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,800
If you can't do it, let me.

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,810
Are you alright?

115
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,200
Chief.

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,940
You've come out of seclusion.

117
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,020
What are you two doing guarding here?

118
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,000
Senior Sister Daodao brought back a man tied up.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,330
He's locked in the cave.

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,200
What?

121
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
Should I not…

122
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, you.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Thank you, Chief Xie.

124
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,690
Marquis.

125
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,090
Are you alright?

126
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,400
My daughter didn't know how hard she was hitting.

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,730
You must have suffered.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
This is good, too.

129
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,680
Mr. Yan and I

130
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,610
have jointly performed a ruse.

131
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,280
This way, they will trust us without any doubt.

132
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Having loyal officials like you

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,040
is truly our dynasty's luck.

134
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,720
However,

135
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,800
in a critical moment yesterday, Qingge

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,040
forcibly broke through with the Brahma Demonic Technique.

137
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh no!

138
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,920
Daodao!

139
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
So impulsive.

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,960
This girl…

141
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,890
Chief Xie, please don't worry yet.

142
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,880
I've observed that Qingge has been fine from yesterday until today.

143
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Her energy and blood are both fine.

144
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,780
Then, where is she?

145
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,500
She went to rescue Mr. Yan.

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,610
Then, it's alright.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,450
Yan Changxuan will persuade her to come back.

148
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,250
Marquis.

149
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
I'll teach you the method to calm your heart meridians now.

150
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,320
When Daodao returns,

151
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
you must help her regulate her condition.

152
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,080
Chief Xie.

153
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,040
I'm tied up here.

154
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
How can I help her?

155
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,320
You were brought back tied up by Daodao.

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
We'll have to wait

157
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
for Daodao to return to release you.

158
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,120
How is it?

159
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,159
I'm not a bad father, am I?

160
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,720
Indeed.

161
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,120
Chief Xie.

162
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,620
What are you doing?

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Please.

164
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
If you try to leave by force,

165
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,020
those two young disciples at the door won't be able to stop you.

166
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,840
At this critical moment,

167
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,160
we can't afford to anger Daodao.

168
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,320
Don't you agree?

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,350
Just be good…

170
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,840
and wait here.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,260
Come on. Try to break free.

172
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,640
Perfect.

173
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

174
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Don't tell Tianba about my emergence from seclusion.

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,080
Understood.
