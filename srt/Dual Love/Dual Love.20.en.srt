1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,980
[Episode 20: He's dead, so I don't need to bother saving him.]

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,980
[Dual Love]

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,470
Master,

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,670
the secret guard has returned from Yanhua Mountain.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,230
Master.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,550
Master, there's hope for you to be saved.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,410
Miss Xie can definitely save you.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,400
Yuan Ying,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,190
what exactly did you tell her?

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,910
I just told her

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,540
the entire process of how you were poisoned.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,230
Oh no!

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,470
What's wrong?

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,800
Where's Yan Changxuan?

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,840
Contact Yan Changxuan quickly

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,890
and make sure he stops Qingge from coming to help me with the antidote.

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,370
While I can still move,

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,280
hurry and prepare the carriage

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,790
to go to Yanhua Mountain.

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,590
Let's go to Yanhua Mountain.

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,590
Hurry!

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,990
I don't agree!

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,710
Daodao.

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,750
I don't agree.

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,530
Don't look at me.

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,730
I don't agree either.

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,750
Why?

28
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,830
There's no reason.

29
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,960
It's too dangerous.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,800
Daodao,

31
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,190
my good girl,

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,940
how can you not value your own life

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,500
for an outsider?

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you really want to

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,950
leave your father

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,509
-to live alone in this world?
-Master.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,150
Mo Haoran is your close friend.

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,850
Don't you want to save him?

39
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,789
Actually, we're not that close.

40
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,560
They are not close.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,710
Just acquaintances.

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,990
Just acquaintances.

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,170
Father,

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,300
Mother didn't teach me that way.

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,560
A doctor should have a benevolent heart.

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,150
Yes.

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,110
Marquis Shen has done much for the martial world

48
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,669
and has contributed to the whole world.

49
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,199
Of course I want to save him,

50
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,470
but how could he compare to you?

51
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,390
That's right.

52
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,430
Father,

53
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,829
when Mother was in poor health back then,

54
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,740
you believed a folk remedy that human thigh flesh could cure all ailments

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,360
and nearly cut your own thigh.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,150
It was Mother who personally snatched the knife away.

57
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,870
Yes.

58
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,030
Your mother cared for me;

59
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,190
she couldn't bear to see me suffer even the slightest injury.

60
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,390
I regret it deeply when I think back now.

61
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,960
If I had really cut a piece of flesh

62
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,470
what harm would it have done?

63
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,870
Even if it was just to try?

64
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,590
Father.

65
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,150
I...

66
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,210
I feel the same way now

67
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,750
as you did back then.

68
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,630
I want to try too.

69
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,190
But, this... Well...

70
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,310
Don't divert the subject!

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,070
How can Marquis Shen

72
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,700
be compared to your mother?

73
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,730
I'll say it again,

74
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,550
I don't agree!

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,640
I don't agree!

76
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:58,690
Father.

77
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,910
I'm the only one in this world

78
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,680
who can save him.

79
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,010
Master.

80
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,390
You...

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,980
Master!

82
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,630
Don't be angry, Master.

83
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,829
Getting angry harms your kidneys.

84
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,060
You're just here to tease me, right?

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,470
Master, how could I dare?

86
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,950
Mr. Yan.

87
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,680
Marquis Shen.

88
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,520
Why have you come to Yanhua Mountain at this time?

89
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,680
How's Qingge doing?

90
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,070
I couldn't stop her;

91
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,600
she insisted on saving you.

92
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,190
If I die,

93
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,840
then there's no need to save me.

94
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,000
What do you mean?

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,310
I owe Qingge.

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,850
I've repaid her.

97
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,350
Are you playing your little games?

98
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,390
If you're not involved in a couple's business, what a waste!

99
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,070
There's no need for you to feel indebted.

100
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,200
Why don't you just be upfront about it?

101
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,360
I'll have Yuan Ying hold my funeral tomorrow.

102
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,600
Mr. Yan,

103
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,350
if you still consider me a friend,

104
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,880
bring Qingge to send me off.

105
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,100
Are you really going to have a live funeral?

106
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,000
That might not be very auspicious.

107
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,909
It's just a matter of a few days earlier or later.

108
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,240
What's the difference?

109
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,910
Daodao.

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,070
Go back.

111
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,140
I knew you were lying to me.

112
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,740
What are you doing?

113
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,250
Are you here for a funeral?

114
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,210
Whose funeral it is?

115
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,190
Why were you asking when you already know?

116
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,550
It's Master's, of course.

117
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,409
I've heard that

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,050
good people don't live long,

119
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,650
while bad ones can live long.

120
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,190
I don't believe that

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,630
he could die so easily.

122
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,110
Put down the coffin

123
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,830
and open it for me to see.

124
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,630
How dare you!

125
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,170
How can you be so disrespectful?

126
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,580
-Daodao!
-Miss Xie!

127
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,710
-Daodao!
-Miss Xie!

128
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,170
Daodao, what are you doing?

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,940
This...

130
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,740
She...

131
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,460
Come out!

132
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,630
Are you waiting for me to invite you?

133
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,750
Qingge.

134
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,050
Qingge, Marquis Shen is greeting you.

135
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,320
Daodao.

136
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,680
No.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,730
We're not that close.

138
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,420
Marquis Shen can just call me Xie Tianba.

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,880
Miss Xie,

140
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,550
why did you do this today?

141
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,750
I want to ask you

142
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,460
why did you do this?

143
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,560
Don't you

144
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,750
have anything to say to me?

145
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,230
I...

146
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,280
Don't say sorry.

147
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,310
You've already returned the Qingge Sword to me.

148
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,770
You don't owe me anything.

149
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,880
I won't say sorry.

150
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,430
I've already given you

151
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,050
what is most important to me.

152
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,830
I've given you

153
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,190
my heart.

154
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,310
So I don't feel like I owe you anything.

155
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,950
Qingge,

156
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,990
I love you.

157
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,820
So you lied to me that you were already dead?

158
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,500
Is this how you love me?

159
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,470
Qingge,

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,560
actually,

161
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,740
I've already guessed

162
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,800
what method you're going to use to save me.
