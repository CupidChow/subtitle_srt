00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,990
[Episode 18: Take the Sword and Go Back to Yanhua Mountain]

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,990
[Dual Love]

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,110
Since then,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,780
you've been building a reputation

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,580
as a ruthless, cunning villain,

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,360
secretly clearing obstacles for me to take full control

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,110
and dismantling the Xiao family's strong power step by step.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,040
You've been so loyal and virtuous,

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,650
yet misunderstood by everyone in the world.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,630
Brother, if you have any wishes,

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,290
I'm willing to grant them.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,930
Your Majesty, serving you

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,390
is my duty.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,750
If you truly want to reward me,

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,840
please forgive me for the mistake I made back then.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,350
Brother, what mistake did you make?

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,740
I once said

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,750
that the martial world was your threat.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
I was wrong.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,890
Your true threat is the greed in people's hearts.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,030
Even without the martial world, there's still the court,

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,090
and without the court, there's still the inner palace.

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,910
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
you can never eliminate the greed in people's hearts.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,100
Then what should I do?

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,450
You're no longer the weak child you once were.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,660
And you have loyal and selfless officials

28
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,920
like the Grand Tutor and Prime Minister.

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,810
The Xiao family has been eliminated.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Your Majesty,

31
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,320
you can rest easy.

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,920
After saying so much, what you really want

33
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,320
is for me to release those people from the martial world.

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,190
You could've asked me for anything,

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,720
and I would have granted it.

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,950
I know...

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,010
I don't have much time left.

38
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,210
I have no other requests,

39
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,920
just this one.

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,270
Alright.

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,230
I promise you.

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,140
The main culprit will face punishment under the law.

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
As for the others,

44
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,800
I will not pursue them further.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,070
Thank you,

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,910
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,450
Qingge?

48
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,030
Qingge.

49
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,950
Qingge.

50
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,130
Why didn't you ask the Emperor for the antidote?

51
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,160
We martial world people

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,690
can fight for our own lives!

53
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,690
Qingge,

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,120
you don't represent the fate of the entire martial world.

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,790
What about your fate?

56
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,350
I'm very content.

57
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,770
Meeting you

58
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,450
and falling for you

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,040
has been

60
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,370
the most unexpected surprise of my life.

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,020
Mo Haoran,

62
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,670
come out!

63
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,600
Are you really going to

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,260
hide like a coward, too afraid to show your face?

65
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,350
This is Qingge Sword.

66
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,110
I'm giving it back to you.

67
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,030
Go back to Yanhua Mountain.

68
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,520
♫We still remember our promises♫

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,870
♫But we've forgotten each other♫

70
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,630
Why is my sword

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,620
♫In the blooming peach blossoms, we've let spring down♫

72

♫We miss each other, each wandering alone♫

74
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,200
I happened to see it,

75
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,320
so I brought it back.

76
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,430
♫The water in my cup is called heartbreak♫

77
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,700
♫How could I ever forget the one etched in my heart♫

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,490
♫Those full of love are always hurt by the heartless♫

♫He's crazy for love♫

Mo Haoran,

86
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,340
I, Xie Tianba,

87
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,550
always repay grudges

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,860
and settle scores on the spot.

89
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,320
This favor of yours,

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,250
I'll remember to repay.

91
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,730
[The suburb of the capital]

92
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,270
I managed to escape unscathed

93
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,200
because you pleaded for me, right?

94
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,040
I don't have that ability.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,409
It was Marquis Shen who pleaded with His Majesty for you.

96
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,890
Then why did you come to laugh at me?

97
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,409
I...

98
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,960
I just wanted to ask you

99
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,110
what your plans are for the future.

100
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,940
Although Kunlun Sect has been purged,

101
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,530
there are still many loyal disciples who haven't left.

102
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,450
I'll return to rebuild the sect

103
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,230
and restore its reputation.

104
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,030
I'll help you.

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,870
That won't be necessary.

106
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,330
Nowadays, Evil Mountain—

107
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,730
no,

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,370
Yanhua Mountain—is unmatched in the martial world.

109
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,870
You have a bright future ahead.

110
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,400
Let's go our separate ways.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,730
Where is she?

112
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,780
She said she was going back to Kunlun.

113
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,350
Daodao,

114
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,810
where are you off to

115
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,670
in such a hurry?

116
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,890
I went to the Imperial Hospital.

117
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,790
What?

118
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,450
You went to the Palace?

119
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,290
It's rare for me to come to the capital,

120
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,190
so of course I wanted to broaden my horizons.

121
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,190
Tell me the truth.

122
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,120
Alright.

123
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,310
I went to see if there's a remedy

124
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,780
for Jialan Incense in the palace.

125
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,850
At this point,

126
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,070
you're still thinking about saving Shen Wugui?

127
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,110
It's still a human life, after all.

128
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,630
Plus, we owe him a favor.

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,960
Besides,

130
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,230
can't I improve my medical skills?

131
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,210
Fine.

132
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't just talk about me.

133
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,540
Xu Ruyan has already left, and you're not chasing her?

134
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,710
Miss Xu has her own responsibilities,

135
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,850
and I have mine.

136
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,750
Daodao,

137
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,570
this martial world

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
is no longer full of carefree adventure

139
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,290
as we thought when we were kids.

140
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,750
My silly Senior Brother has grown up too.
