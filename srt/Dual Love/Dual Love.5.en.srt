1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,480
Okay.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,320
Then I'll take responsibility for you.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,340
I didn't hear you clearly.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,520
Could you please say that again?

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,800
I said...

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,280
I said you're much better than...

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,010
that cruel yet incompetent Marquis of Ningyuan.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,000
I didn't get it.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,210
Could you please explain it more clearly?

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,840
How could you not hear clearly?

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,440
What I mean was...

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Watch out!

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,690
Are you alright?

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm fine.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,440
Chief Mo,

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,460
who's trying to assassinate you?

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,020
Just some scoundrels.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,039
Nothing to worry about.

19
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,039
Thank goodness.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,680
It isn't something from Yanhua Mountain.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,280
Qingge,

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,200
but you,

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,050
you'd better stick close to me these days.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,460
No problem.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,789
I'll protect you.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,820
Since you're going to protect me,

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
why don't you move to my backyard?

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,970
This way, you can protect me more closely.

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,400
Staying close to you is fine,

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,759
but being too close is not good.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,490
Like that kind of distance last night,

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,200
it was too intimate.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,640
What's wrong with that?

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,039
I declared our relationship

35
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,600
in front of the entire martial arts community.

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
My feelings for you are as clear as the sun and the moon.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,020
Doesn't that deserve a small reward?

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,560
Reward?

39
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,560
Reward...

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,520
Bye.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Yanhua Mountain's crisis hasn't been resolved yet,

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,200
and Mo Haoran and I are on opposite sides of good and evil.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
Was it too rash

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,720
to agree to be with him?

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,200
As for the most beautiful girl in the martial world...

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,120
In my heart,

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,400
Qingge, you're not just the most beautiful girl in the martial world,

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
but in the entire world.

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,690
Mom's not in the room again.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,250
She's always so secretive.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,650
Who is it?

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,690
Alliance Leader Xu?

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,380
It's a bit rude of you to visit so suddenly, isn't it?

54
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,640
I came to see you.

55
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,920
Me?

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Guard Yuan Ying, you're deeply loyal to Chief Mo.

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
This time, I came

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
to discuss something with you.

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,320
Perhaps

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,480
you and I could work together to solve a

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,650
small problem for Chief Mo.

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,810
A small problem?

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,360
Buns! Buns!

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
Hot, steamed buns!

65
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,080
Big meat-filled buns here!

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,320
Come, dear customer,

67
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,040
have one.

68
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,159
Big meat buns!

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,120
Buns!

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
Hot, steamed buns here!

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
Meat-filled buns!

72
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,000
I was planning

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
to treat you to a meal,

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
but it seems

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,860
there's no need for that anymore.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I still have one bun left.

77
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Do you want it?

78
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,440
Then,

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
give me half of it.

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,500
Take your time to eat. I have to go now.

81
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,450
Can Xu Ruolian's suggested method

82
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,910
really be trusted?

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,960
What if...

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
If it ends up hurting the Master, it would be terrible.

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,720
No,

86
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,770
I still need to go check.

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
I can't let them hurt the Master.

88
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
Candied haws!

89
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,930
Miss, would you like to buy some candied haws?

90
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,520
Here.

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,600
Miss Xie.

92
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,840
Why are you

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,730
avoiding me out of the blue?

94
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,560
Miss?

95
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,159
Thank you, young master.

96
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Candied haws!

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Take them!

98
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Chief Mo!

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Go. Let's go.

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,930
Are you feeling better?

101
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,090
Much better.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,520
Master,

103
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,730
are you alright?

104
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,800
Qingge has already contained the poison by sealing my acupoints.

105
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
I'm fine now.

106
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,280
Acupoints may not be enough.

107
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,140
I'll go prepare a medicinal bath.

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,400
Why are you still using that medicinal bath?

109
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,930
Is that more effective than the one I gave you?

110
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
But that's His Majesty...

111
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,080
What Majesty?

112
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,480
I managed to get some

113
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,210
detoxifying elixir that's been passed down from the royal family.

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,470
Then you should go take the medicinal bath now.

115
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,680
I'll go check it again carefully.
