[Previously]
The director said, in order for you guys to spend the night at school,

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,179
someone trustworthy must be supervising.

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,949
And that person is me.

4
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm freaking thrilled.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,049
Tomorrow,

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,533
if you just come to cheer for me,

7
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,192
I won't be scared of anything.

8
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:14,953
We've been waiting for this moment.

9
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:17,998
Let's not waste all the barbecue pork we've eaten!

10
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:19,961
I came as your audience.

11
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:21,861
I'm proud of you.

[Semester Break]

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,660
I used to dream of

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,020
sitting and relaxing

15
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,489
by the beach with someone I love once in a lifetime.

16
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,920
Surrounding us is the sand,

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,543
the sea,

18
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,400
the breeze,

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,013
and us.

20
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,725
But I know

21
00:00:58,123 --> 00:01:00,607
it can only be a dream.

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,361
Are you filming a music video or what?

23
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,209
Holy shit!

24
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,381
So am I not dreaming?

25
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:22,854
You're not.

26
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:27,730
You're listening to the sound of the waves.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,930
With...

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,590

[Student President Dude!!]

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,153
Hello.

52
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,893
Hello, Darling. What are you doing?

53
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:15,025
Darling, my ass.

54
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,909
I'm writing a song.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,179
I know you've been busy,

56
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,705
but we haven't talked since the first semester was over.
(T/N: They're using "ngup" as an ending particle. It's cuter than "khup.")

57
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,929
It's been just a few days.

58
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:31,274
It has been 13 days, 12 hours, 7 minutes, and 35 seconds.

59
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:33,503
Oh, stop it.

60
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:36,565
I know. I believe now that you're completely whipped.

61
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:38,951
I've been really busy.

62
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,150
I'm writing a song for Hot Wave.

63
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,312
All right. I can understand you.

64
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:47,185
I guess I'm the only one who's whipped.

65
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:54,530
I miss you, too, Mr. President.

66
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,849
What was that?

67
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,215
I didn't hear you.

68
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,300
The signal was bad.

69
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,540
Listen carefully.

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,286
Next week,

71
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:14,319
I'm going to P'Yak's bungalow for training.

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,512
He let us borrow it

73
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,420
to get some ideas for writing the song.

74
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,550
He said the beach there is gorgeous.

75
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,392
If I get to go lay down and listen to the sound of waves with my lover...

76
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,360
that would be nice.

77
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,874
And you're telling me this because?

78
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:42,270
Do you want to go lie down and listen to the sound of waves with me?

79
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,449
Just lie down?

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,580
If you want to know, get your mom's permission first.

81
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,461
I heard she's so protective of you.

82
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:01,029
Fine. I'll see you at the beach.

83
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,047
Goodbye. Kiss, kiss.

84
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,740
Mom, can I go on a beach trip with my friends next week?

85
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,545
You don't need to ask me, Tinn.

86
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:17,672
Last time when I took you to see the medical professor, you even left me suddenly.

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,170
Come on, Mom.

88
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,220
It was necessary. Please don't be upset.

89
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,585
I'm sorry. That was truly necessary.

90
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,083
- Who else is going?
- Many people from the Student Council.

91
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,600
But you normally don't like to go on overnight trips with friends.

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,718
Why do you want to go now?

93
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,410
Oh, you have a crush on someone, don't you?

94
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,424
- What?
- I knew it. It's so obvious.

95
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:47,387
People your age aren't driven by much.

96
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,439
Tinn, you can tell me.

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,270
You totally can. I won't stop you. You're grown up.

98
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,770
- Really?
- Yes.

99
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,724
Well…

100
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,095
Right! Is it Nong Jaa, the council's treasurer?

101
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,490
I think she handles work very well.

102
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,495
And the other girl, what's her name, Nong Idea?

103
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,570
That cute little coordinator, right?

104
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,341
Just tell me.

105
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,559
Gosh, Mom...

106
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,300
It's just a student council trip.

107
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,679
I'm going on duty. That's all.

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,148
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

109
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,310
Thank you for letting me go.

110
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,639
I love you so much, Mom.

111
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,145
Come on. I'm all smelly and sweaty.

112
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,719
It's totally fine.

113
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,870
Bye now.

114
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,770
Be good.

115
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,957
Mom, I'm leaving now.

116
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,619
Where are those painkillers the doctor prescribed?

117
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,603
Right here. I have enough for the whole month.

118
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:57,771
Okay. Have you prepared the pills for each day?

119
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,719
Look, I have enough for a whole week.

120
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,268
What about the hospital emergency number?

121
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,220
Come on, Gun.

122
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,910
You're the one going on a trip. I should be the one worrying.

123
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,775
Just go. Have a safe trip.

124
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,527
I can take care of myself.

125
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:15,729
Really? Behave yourself.

126
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,332
Take good care of yourself.

127
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:19,889
I'll bring you some snacks, Nong.

128
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,719
You buttface parent.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,791
Of course.

130
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,060
I'm off now. Give me a hug.

131
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,559
Travel safe, Son.

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,193
I will.

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,471
Left, right, left.

134
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,209
Hold. Hold.

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,860
And... stop.

00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,670
I am ready for a trip.

139
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,210
Take care of my bag, Nong.

140
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,994
- Sure.
- There are many important things there.

141
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:04,390
- Don't play around.
- I won't.
- All right, get in.

142
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,225
You guys are in such a hurry.

143
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,017
We've been waiting until our butts got numb.

144
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,699
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,548
I'm sorry, P'Win and P'Por.

146
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,230
Make yourself comfortable.

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,752
It's my family's van. I heard that Ai Tinn is coming, too, right?

148
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:25,926
So I asked my mom for this one.

149
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:28,660
Hello.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,679
If you want to release your grief, come to the beach with me.

151
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,039
What's up with you?

152
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,550
What brings you here?

153
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,571
Why? I want to come, too.

154
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:42,345
I told my mom I was going with the council.

155
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,712
That's why I brought him.

156
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:55,185
Why the hell are the student council members here?

157
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,390
Hey. Calm down.

158
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,061
I invited them.

159
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:02,561
They have been helping us.

160
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:06,180
All right, Guys. Let's go.

161
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,080
- The more, the merrier, right?
- Right.

162
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,912
- Yes, it's fun.
- Come on, let's go.

163
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,870
- Get in the van.
- Let's go!

164
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,280
I want the seat in the back!

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,626
I want the window seat.

166
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,236
Get in.

167
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,087
I've reserved a seat for you already.

168
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,280
You told me you liked to look at the view.

169
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,510
I'll take the front seat.

170
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,943
Ai Win.

171
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,059
What's wrong with Ai Sound?

172
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,327
I don't know what he's upset about.

173
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,550
He was fine just now.

174
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,790
- Don't mind him.
- Get in.

175
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,130
All set! Let's go!

176
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,145
Get inside!

177
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,827
Ouch!

178
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:02,370
Gun, what are you doing?

179
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,330
♫ Hey, fire ♫

180
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,950
♫ I thought I could do it but ♫

181
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,260
♫ The world stops spinning, leaving just ♫

182
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,620
♫ You and me behind ♫

183
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,360
♫ Dreams keep getting further away ♫

184
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,140
♫ I try to look for a better day ♫

185
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,230
♫ I want to get to the end of the runway but ♫

186
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,140
♫ I keep thinking and dreaming for more ♫

187
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,810
♫ I’m afraid to fail ♫

188
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,630
♫ Scared to try and fall ♫

189
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,620
♫ Because there’s no way to go ♫

190
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,250
♫ Left or right it’s a no-go ♫

191
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,040
♫ The only way is to step back ♫

192
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,630
♫ Retreat and fall flat ♫

193
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,160
♫ But today I have you ♫

194
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,450
♫ Come rain or shine ♫

195
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,060
♫ Your shoulder is there to get me through ♫

196
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,440
♫ I don’t know what tomorrow brings ♫

197
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,070
♫ But with you, I’m ready for anything ♫

198
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,100
♫ Wherever I look, you’re never far ♫

199
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,930
♫ Thanks for loving me and staying where you are ♫

200
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,010
♫ When I’m down, you’re right here ♫

201
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,300
♫ (You’ve got ma back back) ♫

202
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,280
♫ I’m never lonely when you’re near ♫

203
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,860
♫ Keep it up! Keep it up! Yeah! Yeah! ♫

204
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,970
♫ I want to shout at the top ♫

205
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,100
♫ Thanks for loving me and never stop ♫

206
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,741
Are you filming a music video or what?

207
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,421
Holy shit!

208
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,107
So am I not dreaming?

209
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,389
You're not.

210
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,436
You're listening to the sound of the waves.

211
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,630
With... my lover?

212
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,690
Hey, friends!

213
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:38,639
- What's up?
- Do you guys have sunscreen, my friends?

214
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,919
I don't have any.

215
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,930
Hey, friend. Do you have any, my friend Tinn?

216
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,100
Yes, I have some...

217
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,273
Gun, my friend.

218
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,929
It's over there, my friend Yo. You can go grab it.

219
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:53,495
Okay. Thank you.

220
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:00,120
We almost got caught.

221
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,803
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,512
It's okay.

223
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,552
Although we can't reveal ourselves,

224
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,512
we can level up our sweetness.

225
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:34,600
Here.

226
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,696
"To Khun Guntapon." Someone just sent you his love.

227
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:42,369
Thank you so much, Khun Tinnapob.

228
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,143
Where is the love?

229
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,327
So refreshing.

230
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,490
Do you want to feel refreshed, too?

231
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:01,280
I want to feel refreshed as well.

232
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,810
Let me.

233
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:12,894
Here.

234
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,239
Refreshing.

235
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,014
Is it very refreshing?

236
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:33,547
Very.

237
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,449
Guys! P'Yak messaged me saying there's a sacred temple around here.

238
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:41,430
All your wishes will come true.

239
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,929
Should we make a wish to win Hot Wave?

240
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,216
Oh, really?

241
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,835
Sure, let's go.

242
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,630
- Well, come on then.
- Let's go.

243
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,689
Come on!

244
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,400
Yeah, let's go.

245
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,830
- Let's go!
- Let's go to the temple!

246
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,910
Such a bummer...

247
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,579
How nice that there's a road here now.

248
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:11,033
I searched online,

249
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:14,457
and they said that people used to walk many kilometers to get here.

250
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,891
Yeah?

251
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,740
Hey.

252
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,580
Are you making a wish, too?

253
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,113
Sure.

254
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,909
There is something that I want, actually.

255
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,039
Please make our wish come true.

256
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,599
Satu!

257
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,515
You got it!

258
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:56,870
Buddha really answered us. It's really sacred.

259
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,414
I don't think so.

260
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,750
What Buddha?

261
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,209
It was my voice.

262
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,018
Hey!

263
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,320
P'Yak, how come you're here?

264
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
The sacred Buddha must have sent me.

265
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,266
You think you'll get to stay at my bungalow for free?

266
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,388
No way. Welcome to the hell camp.

267
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:21,616
I'll bring out your best skills.

268
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,965
Damn.

269
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,041
A hell camp?

270
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,299
Come on. Follow me, Kids.

271
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:44,523
We're tired already, Phi!

272
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:48,390
What? Keep it up. Keep running. Faster.

273
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,769
Don't be tired. It's not tiring.

274
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:55,494
This is nothing. I will turn Chinzhilla into Chin-Cheetah. Run!

275
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:56,787
Follow me!

276
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,985
Keep going! Don't fall behind.

277
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,390
- Are you tired?
- We are.

278
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,390
- Do you want to take a break?
- Yes, we do.

279
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,520
But I won't let you rest.

280
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,130
- Do 100 squats now. Go.
- Huh?

281
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,379
Don't "huh" me. I'm serious.

282
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:23,047
If you're slow, I'll make it 200.

283
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,591
Go on.

284
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,490
Quickly.

285
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,253
You, kids, are so slow.

286
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:31,999
One.

287
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,369
- Two.
- Go on.

288
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,690
My sweet time with him lasted less than a day.

289
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,020
How did my honeymoon trip turn into a music practice camp?

290
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,759
- My situation is worse.
- Six.

291
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,555
My baby duck hasn't got in the water yet.

292
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,189
Seven.

293
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,370
Hey. What the heck are the council members doing here?

294
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,664
Well... Here's what it is.

295
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:04,050
The school sent us here so that we can help in case there's a problem.

296
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,899
Come on, Little Duck.

297
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,220
Look at you.

298
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,580
Can someone like you help?

299
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,880
Seriously, what's your reason to be here?

300
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
Do you have a crush on my juniors?

301
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,368
No! No...

302
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:22,069
Nope... No...

303
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,769
We're just friends.

304
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,260
It's true. Why would I lie?

305
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,496
Right.

306
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:29,082
You guys said you're here to help, right?

307
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,489
Yes.

308
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,151
How about you help each other first?

309
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,389
You're overreacting.

310
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,586
Have you been watching too many comedy shows?

311
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:36,736
I'll make you guys go stay with the cows.

312
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,090
Hey, keep squatting!

313
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,440
Go on. 500 squats.

314
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,140
Is this guy a lunatic?

315
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,314
That was a close call, damn.

316
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,130
Keep going.

317
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,960
Phi, are we going to a music competition or are we going to war?

318
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,241
Hey. What are you complaining about?

319
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:06,699
If you think this is horseshit, go home then.

320
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm not forcing you.

321
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,009
You said it yourself.

322
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,958
Let's go, Guys.

323
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,770
And we will see that

324
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,461
our promise to win the competition doesn't mean anything.

325
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,871
I already graduated.

326
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:25,091
You don't care about me anymore.

327
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,880
That's right.

328
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,449
There, there. You're always like this.

329
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:42,224
You challenge us and then pull a dramatic act.

330
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,628
Fine then.

331
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,781
P'Yak, what would you like for us to train next?

332
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,780
All right.

333
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:52,741
This afternoon, I'll divide you guys into two teams.

334
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,550
Ai Gun and Ai Sound, you're in charge of writing a song.

335
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,679
What? Me, too, Phi?

336
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,720
Heck yeah. You two seem to have the most potential.

337
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,976
The rest of you, go practice.

338
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:05,640
Practice?

339
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,359
We didn't bring anything.

340
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,804
Don't worry, Nong.

341
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:12,580
With me, you will get all the things you need.

342
00:20:18,603 --> 00:20:19,936
Here.

343
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,759
I've got something to show you guys.

344
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,490
So, how is this?

345
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,620
How's this?

346
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,733
Shit!

347
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:36,318
Did you make so much effort to set these up for us?

348
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,669
We're sorry we didn't work hard enough before.

349
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,954
We're sorry.

350
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,053
It's okay.

351
00:20:43,054 --> 00:20:45,049
Actually, these are my band's instruments from last year.

352
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,450
We lost and were too lazy to bring them home.

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,193
The history doesn't sound so great.

354
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:57,500
- If we play his instruments, will we lose, too?
- Right?

355
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,980
Glass boy! I heard that!

356
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,249
If I didn't get so hot-headed last year, my band would be the champion.

357
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:06,929
Now let me hear you guys play.

358
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,780
One, two, three, go!

359
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,989
Hey, that's enough.

360
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:12,820
I haven't played yet.

361
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,084
I already know just by hearing this much.

362
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:17,259
Your skills aren't bad, actually.

363
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,170
You're just lacking something.

364
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,670
Oh, I know! We're missing Ai Gun and Ai Sound.

365
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,150
Did you forget? You told them to go write a song.

366
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,700
No. Not them.

367
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,890
But whatever it is, you guys must find out.

368
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,934
I have homework for you.

369
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:53,852
Can anyone please tell me why he wanted us to do this cover dance?

370
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:58,950
Oh, come on. He's crazy enough to tell us to worship the Holy Chinzhilla.

371
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,929
And the craziest thing is that instead of getting in the water, I have to teach you guys to dance.

372
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,850
This is crazy. It's just crazy.

373
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,030
Well, it's fine.

374
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,480
Let's say you're paying me for the gas to get here.

375
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,743
Of course, Por. I'll pay you guys with all I've got. Okay?

376
00:22:13,743 --> 00:22:16,213
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Ow!

377
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:18,925
Can you make it stronger? Ai Yo, that's too weak.

378
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,150
You got it, man.

379
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,230
Let's twirl!

380
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,565
Thank you all for listening to me.

381
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,623
How's the song going?

382
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,210
Before we talk about the song,

383
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,580
why the hell are you here?

384
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,180
I invited him here.

385
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,679
He can help us as an audience.

386
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,805
That way he can make comments. Right?

387
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,813
Yes, right.

388
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,160
That's right.

389
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,496
You two have been unusually close lately.

390
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:11,779
- What's going on?
- It's nothing. There's nothing.

391
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,759
I just…

392
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,664
want to help you guys.

393
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:16,790
Exactly.

394
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,639
I have no hidden agenda.

395
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,140
Right. Thanks a lot, friend.

396
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,970
It's nothing.

397
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,609
I'll go buy some water.

398
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,609
- Yes, go buy water.
- I'll go buy water. You want water, right?

399
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,210
You two go ahead and discuss work.

400
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,350
Yes, you're really thirsty, right?

401
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,479
Ai Gun, I've known him longer than you have.

402
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,442
I know what he's like.

403
00:23:44,443 --> 00:23:48,094
Someone like him is surely plotting against our club.

404
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,635
You better be careful.

405
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,101
All right.

406
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,965
I'll be careful.

407
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:59,260
Let's discuss the song.

408
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,065
What concept do you have for the song?

409
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,979
What I think,

410
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,606
for rock stars like us,

411
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:14,198
it should be about hopes

412
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,955
and dreams. That sort of thing, right?

413
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,799
In the middle of the song,

414
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,463
you'll get to do a wicked solo verse.

415
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:22,530
Is that a good idea?

416
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,867
For usual rock music, yes.

417
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,799
Don't you want to try writing a love song?

418
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,555
Oh, gosh...

419
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:33,800
A love song?

420
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,445
I'm just making a suggestion.

421
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,481
If you're not into it, it's okay.

422
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:43,309
It's not that I'm not into it.

423
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:46,922
But I'm more afraid our members won't be into it.

424
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:51,220
You know that our members aren't romantic.

425
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,594
There are none. None at all.

426
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,111
But there are many types of love.

427
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,999
Let's say puppy love or sweet love,

428
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,350
I'm not into them, either.

429
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,385
I prefer the tough kind of love.

430
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,713
Right.

431
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:14,438
I like that, too.

432
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:19,976
In the beginning, we just didn't stop fighting.

433
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:27,020
But in the end, before I knew it, they made me shy.

434
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,962
Ai Gun.

435
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,899
Hey!

436
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,826
When you say that,

437
00:25:40,826 --> 00:25:42,870
- is it because...
- Wait, no!

438
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,646
you know I like Ai Win?

439
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,300
Huh?

440
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,359
- You like Ai Win?
- Keep it down.

441
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,459
People will hear you.

442
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,573
Do you like Ai Win?

443
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,356
I do.

444
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:03,489
You've been avoiding him lately because of this?

445
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,800
Yes.

446
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,129
When I'm close to him,

447
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,017
I just don't know how to act.

448
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:13,743
When I'm near him, I feel so freaking awkward.

449
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,319
Should I just tell him honestly?

450
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,753
Hey.

451
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,229
Well…

452
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,461
Why is Ai Tinn taking so long?

453
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,067
- What?
- I think I should go get him.

454
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:30,856
What's taking him so long to buy water?

455
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,807
- I'll be back to talk to you later.
- What about me?

456
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,806
I'll talk to you later.

457
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,060
What? Ai Gun!

458
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,500
Hey, Ai Gun. Where are you going?

459
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,838
Ai Gun, come back.

460
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:56,724
So Ai Sound likes Ai Win?

461
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:59,169
Damn it. Why are you talking so loud?

462
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,103
Keep it down.

463
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:03,373
I'm stressed enough about the song.

464
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,824
Now I have to stress about Ai Win's matters.

465
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,249
They're in love.

466
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,191
Why are you stressed about it?

467
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:13,445
Let's say...

468
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:16,510
if Ai Win rejects Ai Sound,

469
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,377
our band will be totally awkward.

470
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:22,041
Worst-case scenario, we can disband.

471
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:26,872
I can't let him confess, no matter what.

472
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,249
Isn't that a little too mean?

473
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,370
Hiding feelings inside is torturous.

474
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,659
We should know it well.

475
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,006
I do.

476
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:42,760
But as the band leader,

477
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,159
I must do my best to maintain my duty.

478
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,358
At least until this trip is over.

479
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:58,329
Yes, I understand that to you,

480
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:01,373
the band is probably the most important thing.

481
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:03,009
Gosh, Ai Tinn.

482
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,012
Tinn... What's wrong?

483
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,779
Don't say that.

484
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,578
If you weren't important…

485
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:12,943
Tinn.

486
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,680
If you weren't important,

487
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,730
I wouldn't have invited you here.

488
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,400
Listen.

489
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:25,567
If I win the next round,

490
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,501
I'll tell people about us, on air.

491
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:35,890
Okay?

492
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,107
Huh? Do you like that?

493
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,349
Okay?

494
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,889
You won't do it.

495
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,497
Oh, I will.

496
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:45,350
Are you okay with that?

497
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,284
- Okay?
- I don't believe you.

498
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,118
I promise.

499
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,043
Fine.

500
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:01,419
One, two, three, four.

501
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,020
Five, six, seven, eight.

502
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,640
One, two, three, four.

503
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,049
Five, six, seven, eight.

504
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,930
Are you guys dancing a cover, or are you being possessed?

505
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,209
You fail. Practice again.

506
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:17,729
Gosh!

507
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,890
Our legs are breaking already.

508
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,790
Legs are breaking, huh?

509
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,580
How about you do more squats after running tomorrow?

510
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,190
Is that good? Any more complaints?

511
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,652
If not, go away.

512
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:34,281
Even if you didn't say so, we would leave anyway.

513
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:37,678
Hey, Songwriters. How is it going?

514
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:39,734
Get to it quickly.

515
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:50,223
"Summer." I haven't heard of the song.

516
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,539
Ha!

517
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,655
This is Paradox's song!

518
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:55,434
Do you think you're funny? Are you copying them?

519
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:58,786
I don't know. Writing songs is tough.

520
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:00,937
I don't even know where to start.

521
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:02,571
Here.

522
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,616
And you, Ai Sound?

523
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:06,566
Did you copy someone else like he did?

524
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,930
I've written a little.

525
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,591
A song on chasing dreams. It's typical.

526
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:14,913
It's not bad. But it's cliché.

527
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,220
I can't hear your voice in this song.

528
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,049
I want to hear what you're really into.

529
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,249
Do you feel me?

530
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,087
Write it again.

531
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,532
What I'm really into?

532
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,551
Since you guys have been practicing for a while now,

533
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:14,987
show me some progress.

534
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:17,475
You made us practice like we were going to debut as a boyband.

535
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,570
How can that help with playing music?

536
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,980
You don't have to speak. Just play.

537
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,560
Come on. I'll count for you.

538
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,670
One, two.

539
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,104
One, two, three, go!

540
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,238
Enough!

541
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,529
Great.

542
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:35,384
Superb. Excellent. Top-class!

543
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:37,219
Hold on.

544
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,049
They just hit one note. And they're top-class already?

545
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:42,263
You must use your heart to listen.

546
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:46,653
Now I know whom they got the silliness from.

547
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,206
Yeah. I think we're playing better now.

548
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,639
- Yes, true.
- True!

549
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,097
Have you realized it now?

550
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:56,460
What you're lacking is teamwork.

551
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,828
You told us to practice a cover dance because you wanted us to synchronize. Right?

552
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:05,882
And you glass boy, no need to speak.

553
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,179
This kind of thing, you must learn yourself.

554
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,700
This is just the beginning.

555
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,314
You guys still have a lot to work on.

556
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,711
Tiwson!

557
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:15,772
Yes! Yes, Sir.

558
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:18,281
Nothing. I was just about to say, take care of them.

559
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:19,396
- I'm off now.
- Sure.

560
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,251
Wait, no! I can't.

561
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:25,339
If I watch them, when will I get to play in the water?

562
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,710
- Play in the water?
- Yes.

563
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,254
- You want to play in the water?
- Yes.

564
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:30,169
- You want to play in the water?
- Yes, Sir.

565
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,465
What's it called in English?

566
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:35,388
- Sea.
- You're right.

567
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,379
No need to jump in the water. Go be a comedian.

568
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,020
You have a good sense of humor.

569
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,660
Knock, knock.

570
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,340
Why are you quiet?

571
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,290
Why don't you continue my joke?

572
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:49,635
Ai Yak, you jackass.

573
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,520
What a lunatic.

574
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,704
Sound is writing a love song.

575
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:05,468
I'm sure he's giving it to Ai Win once he's done.

576
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:07,270
What should I do?

577
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,090
How do you know?

578
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,459
He might be writing some other songs.

579
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,810
Even if he's writing a song for Ai Win,

580
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,839
it's not wrong, isn't it?

581
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,049
It is wrong.

582
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,983
Let's do this.

583
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:24,420
You keep an eye on Ai Win.

584
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:28,078
I will keep an eye on Ai Sound.

585
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,751
Let's go.

586
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,634
Tinn, quickly.

587
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:36,830
No.

588
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,400
See? We're too late.

589
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:47,359
Hold on.

590
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,304
Please don't. Let's go back.

591
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,110
What's up with you recently?

592
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,114
It's nothing.

593
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,023
Even if I was watching from Mars, I would be able to see that you're mad at me.

594
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:18,060
What are you mad at me about?

595
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,053
I said it's nothing.

596
00:34:21,054 --> 00:34:22,943
You should go now.

597
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:24,993
I'm continuing to write the song.

598
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,209
What song are you writing? Let me see.

599
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,174
Hey, give it back.

600
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:43,639
You said you would write a song about chasing a dream.

601
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,569
Why did it turn into a sweet love song?

602
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:50,389
Well... I want to explore different genres.

603
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,170
Do you feel anything after reading it?

604
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,503
I do.

605
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,240
I feel like this doesn't suit you at all.

606
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,285
It gives me goosebumps.

607
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,409
Give that back.

608
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,573
A dumbass like you will never understand.

609
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:30,750
What a waste of time.

610
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,583
Hey.

611
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:23,312
I saw everything.

612
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,525
It's okay.

613
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,557
If I were you, I'd be pissed, too. Damn it.

614
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:35,747
You wrote a song for him, and he badmouthed you back.

615
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:41,847
Actually, I wasn't that surprised.

616
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,780
Even if I told him directly, he would have turned me down anyway.

617
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,332
You saw it.

618
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,230
We are too different.

619
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,000
It's good we ended it this way.

620
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:14,937
You can put your mind at ease now.

621
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:17,632
This way, no one is breaking the club rule.

622
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,180
I'm sorry.

623
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,195
I was the first to break the club rule.

624
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:37,816
What?

625
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:45,615
Actually, I'm dating Ai Tinn.

626
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:01,358
How's that possible?

627
00:38:03,578 --> 00:38:05,452
When did it happen?

628
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,949
My couple is no different than yours.

629
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:19,340
Ai Tinn and I have nothing in common.

630
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,480
But our dissimilarities got us to this point.

631
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
But our dissimilarities got us to this point.

632
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,796
Just because you and Ai Win are so different

633
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:38,185
doesn't mean you two can't be together.

634
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,661
Trust me.

635
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:59,267
I changed my mind.

636
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,577
I will finish this song.

637
00:39:01,578 --> 00:39:04,070
That's awesome.

638
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,209
Thanks a lot.

639
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,738
I'll be the captain of your ship.

640
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:26,333
I'm not dreaming, am I?

641
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,823
You just told him about me.

642
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:30,623
You're not dreaming.

643
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,390
Should I flick your forehead? See if you are.

644
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,234
Instead of a forehead flick, how about a kiss on the cheek?

645
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,351
What?

646
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,467
No. I'm going to continue writing the song.

647
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,027
Wait.

648
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:51,801
Hey.

649
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,587
Let's switch, "to write a song" and make it, "to get married" instead.
(T/N: He's using wordplay in the form of "to do" something)

650
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,910
Getting married, my ass.

651
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,010
I'm going to leave. Let go.

652
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,210
Let go.

653
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:21,409
"It's sad as I have no one left..."

654
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,889
Hey! This is nice. I like it.

655
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,071
I'm starting to hear your voice in this song.

656
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:28,304
Keep it up. I'm waiting to hear it.

657
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:29,499
- Thank you, Phi.
- Sure.

658
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:31,200
I look forward to hearing it.

659
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:37,071
Ai Sound.

660
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,639
This is the bread you like. I got it for you.

661
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,290
It's my leftover.

662
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,421
And this, I bought it for you.

663
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,820
This is how you make it up to me?

664
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,689
It doesn't suit you at all.

665
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,590
Don't freaking drink then.

666
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,713
Thanks.

667
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,805
We're even now.

668
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,468
No. What you said was right.

669
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,549
That sweet love song is not me.

670
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,936
I will write a new one,

671
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,930
based on how I truly feel.

672
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,932
Wait to hear it.

673
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:16,262
I will.

674
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,690
Can't you sleep?

675
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,609
Yeah, that's right.

676
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,635
Ai Sound finished his song already.

677
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:55,976
I haven't made much progress.

678
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:57,709
Let me see.

679
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,224
When My Love Begins.

680
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:06,365
Taking High Risk.

681
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:08,023
Just Dreaming.

682
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:10,449
Love U 1M.

683
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,160
Sharks Like to Bite You.
(T/N: Cute way to say, "I like you")

684
00:43:13,787 --> 00:43:17,325
Are these lyrics or a song titles mashup?

685
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:21,039
I put together all the love songs I like

686
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,715
and wrote them down.

687
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:28,116
It might give me some new ideas.

688
00:43:29,636 --> 00:43:31,910
Well then…

689
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,150
you're missing the song, May I Kiss You Tonight?

690
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,929
Ah! Let me jot it down.

691
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,464
The song by P'Po Yokee Playboy.

692
00:43:42,465 --> 00:43:44,961
I like this song. Let me write it down.

693
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:48,554
And... Kiss.

694
00:43:48,554 --> 00:43:49,920
Kiss.

695
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,034
By Jetset'er.

696
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:54,770
That's not it.

697
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:59,400
Kiss… by me.

698
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,179
The lyric goes something like...

699
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:10,192
"Can I kiss you now, since they already know about us?"

700
00:44:14,981 --> 00:44:18,536
You were hinting at it for a while, and that's all you've got?

701
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:21,421
I'm serious.

702
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,993
Stop.

703
00:44:35,993 --> 00:44:38,613
Stop.

704
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,080
"Stop" by Groove Riders.

705
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,843
The new song I'm adding.

706
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,400
You can go now. Go.

707
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,356
Leave already.

708
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:12,492
I should continue.

709
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:41,985
Excuse me.

710
00:45:41,985 --> 00:45:45,453
Are you taking orders yet?

711
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,360
Yes, of course.

712
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,838
Wow. This is nice.

713
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:03,533
I usually order from the café next to the school, but they're closed today.

714
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:06,625
I never knew there was a café across the street from the school.

715
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:09,191
I'm glad you like it, Director.

716
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:11,069
Oh. Are you a student's parent?

717
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,493
Yes, I am.

718
00:46:12,494 --> 00:46:14,745
That's my son.

719
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,070
Nong Gun?

720
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,470
What a coincidence.

721
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,435
My son is Nong Gun's classmate.

722
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:31,440
His name is Tinn. I'm not sure if Gun mentioned him before.

723
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,960
Yes, I know him.

724
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,018
Tinn, who is the student president, right?

725
00:46:36,018 --> 00:46:37,910
He comes here a lot.

726
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:41,029
He even helps out sometimes.

727
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:43,874
Is that so?

728
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,933
How strange.

729
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:49,190
He never mentioned that to me at all.

730
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,798
Too bad Ai Gun isn't here.

731
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:56,390
He ran off on a trip to the beach.

732
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,754
Nong Gun is on a beach trip?

733
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,692
Tinn also went to the beach.

734
00:47:02,692 --> 00:47:06,380
Do you know which beach Gun went to?

735
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,980
I heard him say they were going to—

736
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,304
I'm so sorry.

737
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:13,669
I have a meeting to attend.

738
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,429
Let's talk again next time.

739
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,515
Of course.

740
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:17,912
See you later, Director.

741
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:20,140
Goodbye, Ma'am.

742
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,150
Come on. Make it quick.

743
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,150
Be strong. Don't be so slow.

744
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:35,780
Come on, quickly.

745
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:38,535
Right. Great.

746
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,387
That's all for today.

747
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:42,973
All of you, don't forget your homework.

748
00:47:42,974 --> 00:47:45,053
You're taking the final exam tonight.

749
00:47:45,054 --> 00:47:46,487
What?

750
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,080
What if we fail?

751
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:55,138
You, you, you, and you don't want to know what's going to happen.

752
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,760
[Sunset Fishing]

753
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,180
Stomp. Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.

754
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:07,496
Hey. Hurry up.

755
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:11,563
I talked to the resort personnel.

756
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:13,962
This is where you're taking the final exam.

757
00:48:13,963 --> 00:48:16,560
All of you must perform on stage.

758
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,366
I thought it was something scary.

759
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:21,009
You just want us to play live music.

760
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,009
That's easy-peasy.

761
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:26,594
You're right. A piece of cake.

762
00:48:26,594 --> 00:48:29,633
You're not playing music. You're dancing.

763
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:33,090
The customers will be the judges.

764
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:37,482
If you can't make their shoulders move,

765
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:38,759
you fail the test.

766
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,493
What?

767
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:55,132
Guys, I know you can do it

768
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,732
because you have such a great teacher.

769
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:02,700
Come on. Believe in yourself and make it happen.

770
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,289
Go on now. Get on with the show.

771
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,729
All right! Come on.

772
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,952
Let's do this!

773
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,190
Let's go!

774
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,400
♫ Yeah ♫

775
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,370
♫ I've been just, pickin' up pickin' up pickin' up
pickin' up pickin' up pieces of you ♫

776
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,842
If you're going to dance that well, be prepared to pick your fandom name!

777
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:08,641
You pass!

778
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:15,416
They're my dance students!

779
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,769
That was great!

780
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,155
Ai Gun isn't done with his song yet.

781
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,949
It's just you now, Ai Sound.

782
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,479
If you don't give me chills, you fail the test.

783
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,580
Do your best. I'm rooting for you.

784
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,880
I'm not much of a talker.

785
00:51:56,501 --> 00:52:01,916
So I would like to use this song to represent my feelings for someone.

786
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,430
♫ If not me ♫

820
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,013
Ai Sound.

821
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:35,993
Why do I feel like you just yelled at me through that song?

822
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,801
How do you know I wrote it for you?

823
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,900
It's so obvious.

824
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,481
I can see that from Mars.

825
00:55:49,336 --> 00:55:52,030
Why did you ask then?

826
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:53,863
Seriously,

827
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,840
since when?

828
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:01,294
Do you remember when we practiced badminton together?

829
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,519
It's pouring.

830
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,619
I don't have my umbrella.

831
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,959
I would be surprised if you did.

832
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,610
You even wore the wrong colored shirt.

833
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:26,958
Hey, can I go with you?

834
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,427
Let go. This one is mine.

835
00:56:31,427 --> 00:56:33,729
Don't even think I'm sharing.

836
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,941
Hey, Ai Sound! Are you leaving me here?

837
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:40,049
What if I get home soaking wet?

838
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,831
Don't you feel pity for me?

839
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,307
What if I walk home through the rain and get sick?

840
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:45,369
Let me go, too.

841
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,459
I told you my umbrella is small.

842
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,133
We can go together. It can shelter two people.

843
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,021
Let's go.

844
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:55,874
Be careful.

845
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,649
Look. I'm soaked.

846
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:03,640
Well, walk properly.

847
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,960
Look! I'm all drenched here.

848
00:57:12,669 --> 00:57:13,853
Are you?

849
00:57:13,854 --> 00:57:16,589
Yes. Look.

850
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,039
The umbrella is small, right?

851
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,834
Yes.

852
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:32,570
♫ If not me, then who would it be? ♫

853
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,740
You won't get wet now.

854
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,750
♫ Never out of your sight ♫

855
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,820
♫ It’d always be me ♫

856
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:41,875
What's wrong? Are you shy?

857
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,380
What? Shy who?

858
00:57:46,647 --> 00:57:47,970
Why is your heart beating so fast then?

859
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,010
♫ But let me ask who would you love ♫

860
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,950
♫ Other than me ♫

861
00:58:00,669 --> 00:58:05,656
Sometimes, things like this happen for no reason.

862
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:17,510
What if I say my heart never beats fast for you?

863
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,200
Then we're back to being friends.

864
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,653
Otherwise, what then?

865
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:41,315
Are you going to avoid me this time?

866
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:43,466
I'm not a loser like you are.

867
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,380
For something I don't know,

868
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:52,593
I'm willing to try.

869
00:59:03,134 --> 00:59:04,980
What do you mean?

870
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,638
I want to know what it's like when my heart beats fast, as you've mentioned.

871
00:59:13,876 --> 00:59:16,289
Can you teach me about it?

872
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,623
Are you sure you want me to teach you?

873
00:59:27,623 --> 00:59:29,614
I am.

874
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:31,974
Do you think you can do it?

875
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:35,670
I will try.

876
00:59:37,672 --> 00:59:39,729
I'm not promising anything.

877
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:41,680
So this is your way of hitting on me?

878
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,530
I'm getting goosebumps.

879
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:47,926
Yes.

880
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:52,099
Then I'll hit on you until your heart beats fast.

881
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,833
Okay?

882
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,203
Bring it on.

883
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,130
I'm not afraid of you.

884
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,930
Just wait and see then.

885
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,889
I talked to Ai Sound.

886
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,228
He said he wrote that song based on his own story.

887
01:00:17,229 --> 01:00:19,503
You won't be into it even if you sang it.

888
01:00:19,503 --> 01:00:22,309
You must find your own song.

889
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,961
Gosh, Phi...

890
01:00:24,961 --> 01:00:27,031
I'm afraid I can't finish it in time.

891
01:00:27,032 --> 01:00:30,369
You know, I haven't even finished one verse yet.

892
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:33,252
I believe you can do it.

893
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:34,813
I'm not putting pressure on you.

894
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:38,718
But our club's future is in your hands.

895
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:10,289
Get some sleep first.

896
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,792
You can continue tomorrow.

897
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:19,925
How can I sleep after hearing what P'Yak said?

898
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,285
Writing songs is so difficult.

899
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,758
It's not that difficult.

900
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,870
Because you're using this...

Why don't you try using this instead?

01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:12,590
♫ This is the love I’ll never hit undo ♫

987
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,220
♫ I will have only you ♫

988
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:20,280
♫ And everyday I will love you ♫

989
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,470
♫ I’m the defendant of love to you ♫

01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:28,760
♫ Feeling shy every time my crush gives me a smile ♫

991
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,660
♫ My heart flies high, it needs something to lean on ♫

992
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:39,260
♫ Where could I move on to, this unmovable heart is set on you ♫

993
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:45,190
♫ Can you love me too? ♫
