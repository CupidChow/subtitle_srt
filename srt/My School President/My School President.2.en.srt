166
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,449
should we give each club a chance?

167
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,919
But we have a limited budget, Tinn.

168
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,240
We should spend it on clubs with good performances, shouldn't we?

169

Well, that's true.

How can I help him?

179
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,619
All he does is eat barbecue pork and play video games. Just these two things.

How can he win any competition?

Did you watch too many cartoons?

there's one music contest in which my mom is a judge.

But it's a folk music contest.

That means, if we can show you our good performance within a week, you can't do anything to us.

00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:58,415
They say high school love is like a lit candle in the rain.

329
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:02,280
If I could get over him that easily, I would have done it long ago.

330
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,055
I just don't get you.

331
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,045
So many people want to be with you.

332
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:13,975
Seriously, why him?

333
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,873
Tinn.

334
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:20,375
I'm sorry, Dear.

335
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,309
The Director invited everyone to dinner.

336
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,369
Can you celebrate your birthday with Dad?

337
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,720
Dad is having his fan sign at the book fair today.

338
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,509
You're right.

339
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,279
Do you want to come with me to dinner? Want to?

340
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,940
It's fine, Mom. You can go ahead.

341
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,490
I'll go with my friend.

342
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,189
Okay. I'll see you later.

343
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,623
Bye.

344
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,264
Hello, Ai Tiw. Are you going home yet?

345
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,490
You're home already?

346
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,330
It's nothing, Dude.

347
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,545
See you later.

348
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:58,390
Shaved ice is served!

349
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,130
Why are you confused? This is my mom's shop.

350
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,265
Do we know each other?

351
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:07,549
Gosh.

352
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,434
Don't you recognize me?

353
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:12,799
I'm Gun. The kid at the back of the class.

354
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,300
But I didn't order this.

355
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,210
This here... is my treat.

356
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,805
Seeing your face makes me want to change my mind.

357
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,050
Go ahead and eat.

358
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,890
Is this your friend, Gun?

359
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,869
Yes, Ma.

360
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,365
He's head of the class.

361
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,805
- I'm befriending him so that I can copy his assignments later.
- You!

362
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,689
Make yourself at home, Dear.

363
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,230
As for you, the customers are all waiting. Hurry.

364
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,090
What was I saying...

365
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,079
Welcome to the mini concert at Mrs. Gim's shop.

366
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,270
For the first song, I like listening to it when I'm alone.

367
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:12,040
If you are feeling lonely, share this song with me.

368
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:34,659
♪ I was just someone in this lonely city  ♪

369
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:46,490
♪ I was just nobody until you came and took my heart  ♪

370
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,480
♪ Oh, the time has stopped ♪

371
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,709
♪ This city isn't lonely anymore ♪

372
00:24:56,709 --> 00:25:02,135
♪ Because I have you today ♪

373
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,435
Since that song,

374
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,460
he's the only one I want to be with for the rest of my life.

375
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,369
Shit! That's so damn romantic.

376
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:31,904
I'm sorry... for telling you to get over him.

377
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,355
If high school love is like a lit candle in the rain,

378
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,765
I, Tiwson, will hold an umbrella for you.

379
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:01,240
What should I do?

380
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,394
Come here. Quickly.

381
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,194
Come quick! Quickly!

382
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:07,420
Here's the thing.

383
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,709
Help me choose the cover for my new book.

384
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:14,955
I can't decide what color I should go for. Please help.

385
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:17,398
Sure.

386
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:18,979
- Dad.
- What?

387
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:25,510
Do you know of any shops that sell affordable musical instruments?

388
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,763
Dad?

389
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,894
Your mother didn't ask you to come and snoop, did she?

390
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:38,089
Okay, then. If you want guitars, go to Woeng Nakhon Kasem.

391
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:41,310
If you want amplifiers, look for the shop called Saowaluk at The Old Siam Plaza.

392
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:47,445
My friend Ai Au is a drummer. Tell him whatever type you want.

393
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,930
How come you know so much?

394
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,960
Follow me over here. This is my secret.

395
00:27:01,645 --> 00:27:04,675
Ta-da.

396
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:08,789
Do not tell your mom. Don't ever let her know.

397
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:11,499
So, why are you hiding it so secretively?

398
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,859
It's been an issue between your mom and me for so long.

399
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,580
I used to love playing music too.

400
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,074
But if she finds out its price, my happiness might vanish.

401
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:25,319
Now she's started to wonder what I'm hiding.

402
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,575
Can I leave my favorite guitar with you for a while?

403
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,889
Dad, I'll keep it for you.

404
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,050
What? Really?

405
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:40,169
That's wonderful! I don't know where I would have kept it!

406
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,235
I'm relieved now.

407
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,234
We practiced so hard. Should we reward ourselves with barbecue pork?

408
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:55,730
Barbecue pork, my ass! We can't even afford pork skewers.

409
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,884
We spent all of our money on the music studio.

410
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,089
I don't think we should resist.

411
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:04,159
Let's disband so we can have time to study like everyone else.

412
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,385
How can you say that?

413
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,529
Someone sent a message on the Music Club page.

414
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,630
The profile picture is a lion.

415
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,975
The Facebook account is called My Name Is Lion, What's Yours?

416
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,500
Do you guys know this person?

417
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,654
Is it your friend?

418
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:27,869
"I'm a fan of your band.

419
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,199
I heard your instruments were taken.

420
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,799
I might be able to help."

421
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,220
Hey!

422
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:35,699
We have fans too?

423
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,180
Well! Let's ask them to help!

424
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,615
Okay, hold on.

425
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,535
How can you help, Nong?

426
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:51,180
Try going to this place,

427
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,250
and you

428
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,650
will find out yourself.

429
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,749
Try going to this place, you will find out yourself.

430
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:05,229
Hey. That's our school.

431
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,695
I think it's the Student Council room.

432
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,550
Let me see.

433
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,720
It's like being tricked to go to the slaughtering room.

434
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:24,409
You're going to give your dad's favorite electric acoustic guitar to Ai Gun for free?

435
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:28,529
I'll just lend it to him. My dad doesn't play very often anyway.

436
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:32,239
I'll return it if he wants it back.

437
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,964
Why don't you just hand it to him at his club?

438
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,815
Why did you go through trouble using that fake account?

439
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,189
He got so mad at me recently.

440
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,709
I don't think he wants to talk to me.

441
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:45,540
That's why I came up with a plan.

442
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,500
I'll pretend I'm cleaning up this room and throwing things out.

443
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,220
Including that guitar. How's that?

444
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,860
Even a kindergartner wouldn't believe that!

445
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,970
What the hell kind of student council room would have an electric acoustic guitar?

446
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,380
Guys, I'm cleaning up here.

447
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,229
We're throwing stuff out. Can you guys take them away?

448
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:13,469
I'm not your damn servant!
(T/N: He's using informal pronouns)

449
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:15,560
If you want to clean up, do it yourself.

450
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,360
Do you see us as servants?

451
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,704
Do you think you can do anything just because you're the student president?

452
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:26,410
I guess we'll have to throw away the guitar and amplifier. It's taking up room.

453
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,154
Right?

454
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:29,514
Let's go.

455
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:31,995
Hey! Wait, wait.

456
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:35,530
Actually, we're not that mean.

457
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,090
That's right.

458
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,809
We can get rid of them for you.

459
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,689
Yes, that's right. We'll take care of it.

460
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,704
This much stuff is nothing. We'll throw them away.

461
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:45,590
- It's no problem.
- You guys will get tired, it's all right.

462
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,239
You can rest comfortably.

463
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,989
Hey, Guys.

464
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,914
Aren't you curious why an electric acoustic guitar is in the student council room?

465
00:30:55,914 --> 00:31:01,229
Why would we be curious? When you guys are stressed, you play the guitar to relieve it.

466
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:02,469
What's so strange about it? Right?

467
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:06,680
That's right. Right. Right.

468
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,149
Not strange...

469
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,135
It's not strange that their club ended up like this.

470
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,579
Thanks a lot, Nong Lion.

471
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,780
How did you know the council was throwing away an electric guitar?

472
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,335
I have a friend in the student council.

473
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,119
If others were as kind as the student council, that would be great.

474
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,655
We can get our instruments back.

475
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,579
There are still kind people out there.

476
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,405
You just need to fight a little.

Mrs. Mut has to make a clip teaching English.

If you help her, she will give you a keyboard for free.

P'Nicky from class 6/3 is rich.

If you help him throw a birthday surprise for Nong Koy, the girl he likes,

481
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,545
he will give you a bass for free.

482
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,924
- Who are you?
- Me?

483
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:42,224
I'm Koy's boyfriend!

484
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,110
Koy's boyfriend?

[Niyomsil Suksa High School]

486
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,540
Thanks so much, Nong Lion.

487
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,875

Only people in my club know that.

So, Ai Tinn, can you tell me now why you wanted me to help this club?

You even asked me not to tell him you're behind it.

Here's the story, Phi.

So that means you still don't know the rules to this club, right?

♫ If you only knew when I first saw you ♫

651
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:56,590
♫ You’re all I dreamed of, my heart skips
a beat when you’re near ♫

652
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:04,980
♫ When you’re by my side, when you look into my eyes ♫

653
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,580
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

654
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,610
♫ To hear my love ♫

655
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:21,040
♫ In your heart, if there’s no one, can I be that person? ♫

656
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,520
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

657
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,260
♫ To hear my love ♫

658
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:36,990
♫ Love me, would you love me, I wonder ♫

659
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:42,360
♫ Please tell me ♫

00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:58,640
