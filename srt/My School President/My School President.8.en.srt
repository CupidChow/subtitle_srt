00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,379
[Previously]
The Hot Wave audition result just came out.

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:06,240
Please be informed that Chinzhilla Band passed and is qualified for the next round!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,699
So that means you're one step closer to the goal.

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,231
What do you think of the club rule that says we can't have lovers?

5
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:15,959
She asked me out on a date. If you agree to change the rule, I will confess everything and ask her to be my girlfriend.

6
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,959
Who agrees to let Ai Yo have a girlfriend?

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,169
But I don't allow it, dammit!

8
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,079
If any of you can't do that,

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,170
just get the hell out of the club. Leave!

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,480
The rule says we can't have lovers.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,999
It doesn't say we can't have someone to talk to.

12
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:28,510
You said, that you'll only wait for me.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,490
Such an opportunity doesn't come along very often.
[Hot Wave Competition Day]

14
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,900
You know how lucky you are, right?

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,759
Yes.

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,579
Let's go over the questions again.

17
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,700
If they asked you, "Why do you want to join this faculty?" What will you say?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,899
You know? What musicians like me want the most…

19
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,029
- The next band on stage here uses the same band name as last year.
- isn't advice or nice instruments.

20
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:07,369
Let's see if something is going to happen this year.

21
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,120
- Please welcome Chinzhilla Band!
- It's the audience,

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,320
especially the person we want to perform for.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,779
Hello, everyone!

24
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:27,190
We're Chinzhilla Band!

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,680
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,573
Hey.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,839
Work hard on your practice.

28
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,409
[1 Week Before the Competition]

29
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,179
It's the final week.

30
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,613
Let's keep it up.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,913
Sure, Buddy.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,230
One, two, three, four...

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,979
What time is it now?

34
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,739
The school prohibits any club from holding activities after 6 p.m.

35
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,429
How should I punish you all?

36
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,763
Hey.

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,479
We're practicing to compete for the school.

38
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,289
We're not chilling out and eating barbecue pork.

39
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,439
So you're confessing that you did that before.

40
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,159
Should we press one more charge, Mr. President?

41
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,039
I'll deal with their leader.

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,859
You take everyone else out.

43
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:19,099
Of course. My seniors, please leave

44
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,840
if you guys don't want to be punished, too.

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,593
Come on.

46
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,420
Let's go.

[Music Club]

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,829
I pity your leader.

49
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,380
He will be severely punished by the President.

50
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,480
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,119
I'm just doing my job.

52
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,359
And other students reported it.

53
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,940
Please?

54
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,599
What do you want me to do? Huh?

55
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,309
I already don't have enough time to practice.

56
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:11,869
Do you want me to lose?

57
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,519
No, I don't want you to lose,

58
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,519
but rules are rules.

59
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,579
And I happen to be the one who controls the rules.

60
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,539
Then...

61
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,690
You can just make it right.

62
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,359
Let me spend nights at school.

63
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,020
I noticed other clubs were allowed to do that.

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,559
Do you think my mom will allow that?

65
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,899
Even if she's okay with it,

66
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,929
I'm not okay with you

67
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:39,199
huddling with your friends all week.

68
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,610
- Are you jealous?
- What jealousy?

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,730
All right. If you help me,

70
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,629
I promise I'll be a good boy this week.

71
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,439
Whatever you order me to do,

72
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,359
I'll do it all.

73
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,693
All right?

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,820
Do you think I'll give in if you say that?

75
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,260
But Mr. President,

76
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,940
don't you want to give me orders?

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,553
Huh?

78
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,883
Mmm...

79
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,733
Yes.

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,619
You've said it.

81
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,040
And where are you going?

82
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,679
How was it, Mr. President?

83
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,260
Shall we terminate their club?

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,373
No termination,

85
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,179
and the president was nice enough to ask the principal

86
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:02,089
if we could spend the night at school.

87
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,880

(T/N: He's using informal pronouns)

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,500
depends on you.

113
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,360
You only.

114
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,759
Mom.

115
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,789
You'll be taking the direct admission exam next month.

116
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,319
How's your preparation going?

117
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,560
I haven't started it yet.

118
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,530
I'm going to study then.

119
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,280
If you can get her permission,

120
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,110
For this week,

121
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,160
I will do

122
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,079
everything that you

123
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,029
want me to do.

124
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,200
Everything.

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,280
Everything.

126
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,959
Mom, the music club wants permission to spend the night at school to practice.

127
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,979
I didn't permit it at first,

128
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,159
but once I thought about it again,

129
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,940
if they won, they'd bring a good reputation to our school.

130
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,250
If you agree, please sign the approval paper.

131
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,349
But the school rule number 72 says,

132
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,679
only well-behaved students are permitted to stay over at school.

133
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:36,170
But they passed the audition.

134
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,219
Isn't that considered well-behaved?

135
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,419
Regardless, I don't trust them enough to let them spend the night at school.

136
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,520
Besides, there's no teacher willing to keep an eye on them at school.

137
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,140
What if... we don't need teachers... for that?

138
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,083
Hey.

139
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,329
I feel like we're going scout camping.

140
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,529
Ai Gun, I'm still curious.

141
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,939
How did you get the president to help us?

142
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,930
Oh, right, exactly.

143
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,619
Did you make some sort of secret deal with him that we don't know about?

144
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,100
That's right.

145
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,549
Hey!

146
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,249
What secret deal? Why are you so skeptical?

147
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,389
It's nothing.

148
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,539
The president wants us to win Hot Wave,

149
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,640
so he went to her and took the credit.

150
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,089
You guys go ahead to practice.

151
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,649
I'll be there once I'm done with the report.

Are you sure?

153
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,499
Yes. No more questions.

154
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:57,509
Let's go.

155
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,650
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

156
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,623
What?

157
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,739
You'll stay a whole week at school with this small backpack?

158
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:27,119
Wait a minute. Don't tell me you're staying over, too.

159
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:31,289
Well, the Director said, in order for you guys to spend the night at school,

160
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,019
someone trustworthy must be supervising.

161
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,230
And that person is…

162
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,243
me.

163
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,499
Why?

164
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:45,389
Are you afraid you won't be able to play if your lover watches?

165
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,989
It's not that.

166
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,419
I'm afraid you'd be troubled by that.

167
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:54,269
Instead of going home, you have to watch me practice.

168
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,650
Thinking about it bores me already.

169
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Do you think it's boring?

170
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,399
It is.

171
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,300
You just sit there for hours.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,149
It's not convenient.

173
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,900
To wash up, you have to use the school bathroom.

174
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,599
And you must sleep on the floor at the club.

175
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,029
It's jam-packed with people.

176
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,059
And the floor is hard.

177
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,920
Can you handle that?

178
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,019
Hey. Hey, Tinn.

179
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,880
Hey, Tinn!

180
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you listening to me?

181
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,873
I am.

182
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,180
Right.

183
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,459
It sounds pretty boring.

184
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm off to the council meeting then.

185
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,180
I'll see you tonight.

186
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,460
[Music Club]

187
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,799
Right,

188
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,509
I think that was good.

189
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,759
But…

190
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,289
we're losing it a little toward the end.

191
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:59,849
Should we go again?

192
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,509
Sorry, Guys.

193
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,989
I have a workshop to attend to prepare to film a series.

194
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,369
Will you excuse me?

195
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,549
Hey.

196
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:08,299
The competition is near.

197
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,859
But the schedule is conflicting.

198
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,060
What do you want me to do?

199
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,580
I'm not free like you guys.

200
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,833
What?

201
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,519
Come on, leave it.

202
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,679
He's the only one who didn't make any mistakes.

203
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,279
I think we should take a break.

204
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,819
I'm starting to get tired.

205
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:30,900
Yes, agreed.

206
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,479
Chef Por, what do you have for us today?

207
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,919
Hey, what are you guys doing?

208
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,200
Ai Tinn is going to be here soon.

209
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,209
I spied on them.

210
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,750
The student council will have a long meeting until 10 tonight.

211
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,920
So we're not eating barbecue pork today.

212
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,359
What are we eating then?

213
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:56,239
It's the menu you guys have been requesting.

214
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,280
What is it?

215
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,259
Freshly cooked Yakisoba!

216
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,740
Yeah!

217
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,669
We've got a complaint saying the soap in the bathroom is always out.

218
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:16,129
They want us to notify the cleaning crew

219
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,879
and tell them to keep refilling it.

220
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,879
Besides, epidemics are spreading.

221
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:22,980
The board is particularly worried about hygiene.

222
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,379
It's okay.

223
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,280
You can use mine.

224
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,499
Is it good, Tinn?

225
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,339
Very good.

226
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,873
Ai Tinn!

227
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,720
What the hell is wrong with you?

228
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,299
- The soap, right?
- Right.

229
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,550
Tiw, go ahead and handle it.

230
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,670
I trust you.

231
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,119
You all can go home now.

232
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,940
The meeting is over. You may go home.

233
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,809
We're done here.

234
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,230
- Let's go.
- Great job, everyone.

235
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,270
P'Tinn, I'm ready!

236
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,180
- For what?
- For catching the music club red-handed.

237
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,029
I spread this rumor saying we'd have a meeting until 10 p.m.

238
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,589
I bet they're partying and eating with so much joy.

239
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,690
Should we go catch them now?

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,689
- That's brilliant, Kajorn.
- Really, Phi?

241
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,830
I'm proud of you. Let me give you a hug.

242
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,989
Great job.

243
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,700
Thank you.

244
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,059
Welcome to this meal!

245
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,569
Hai! Itadakimasu!

246
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,140
- I ate it!
- Don't you steal that from me!

247
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,540
Shit! The authorities are here!

248
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,660
Clear off everything now.

249
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,490
- Huh?
- Ai Win!

250
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,920
I can smell Yakisoba.

251
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,149
Up there, for sure.

252
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,659
Hold on. My shoelaces are undone. Just a moment.

253
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:08,749
What is this, Phi?

254
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:10,809
Come on, before they realize we're coming.

255
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,243
Spray it.

256
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,000
Is the smell still here?

257
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,979
I think we're okay.

258
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,009
Almost screwed.

259
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,443
Hold on.

260
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,209
Whose water is this?

261
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,150
It's strange.

262
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,879
Whoa! This is booze.

263
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,419
Whose is it? Who brought it here?

264
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,160
It's not me!

265
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,400
Hey. It's not booze.

266
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,859
It's Sake.

267
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,420
It's an ingredient for Hot Pot.

268
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,919
Do you think the student council will believe you?

269
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,049
This could potentially get our club terminated!

270
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,249
What are we going to do?

271
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:52,580
We're coming.

272
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,619
Why would you say that?

273
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,799
I'm just a man with manners.

274
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,299
- Hey! Hey!
- Ai Por!

275
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,970
- Get rid of it!
- Get rid of it, Ai Win!

276
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,099
There is no hurry.

277
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:06,750
- What do I do?
- I don't know!

278
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,629
What did you do?

279
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,079
You could have hidden it.

280
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,449
Why did you drink that?

281
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,569
Ai Gun!

282
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,400
You crazy ass.

283
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,769
What do we do now?

284
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:26,350
Ai Por, it's you.

285
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,859
I want my microphone.

286
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,549
Guys, Ai Gun is drunk.

287
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:33,639
Who's drunk?

288
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:36,120
- You are!
- I'm not drunk, Ai Yo!

289
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,099
Drunk, my ass.

290
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,679
I'm Win, not Yo!

291
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,419
Yeah. Win, Yo, whatever.

292
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,000
- Give me the mic.
- Ai Gun!

293
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,800
Let me handle them.

294
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,190
May we inspect the orderliness as requested by the director?

295
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,990
Don't. Don't. Don't.

296
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,579
The club is unusually clean today.

297
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,390
Very good.

298
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,819
I'm going to smack you in the face.

299
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:21,230
- Ai Gun!
- Don't!

300
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,560
Hey. What's under that white cloth?

301
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,630
You're hiding it very well.

302
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,499
What are you hiding?

303
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,709
None of your fucking business. I'm going to hit you.

304
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,869
Don't! Don't!

305
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,439
No, don't!

306
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,470
What's the problem here?

307
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,340
It's nothing. My friend just wants to continue singing now.

308
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,339
Right!

309
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,579
I think we should go then.

310
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,239
Yes, I want to practice.

311
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,380
But not music practice, though.

312
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,190
Practice smacking you!

313
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,159
No, don't!

314
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,269
Don't you want to be a musician anymore? You want to be a thug, right?

315
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,899
If you don't stop showing off, I...

316
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:06,889
You what?

317
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,129
- I will...
- Will?

318
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:09,359
I will...

319
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,500
- You will?
- I will...

320
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,380
That served you right.

321
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,359
So, Mr. President, how was your night with the music club?

322
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,179
A complete disaster. I had to clean up his vomit all night.

323
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,849
Everything went wrong because of Ai Jorn.

324
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,739
Oh, come on.

325
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:43,869
I assigned Kajorn some presentation slides to do.

326
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,939
He probably won't bother you anymore.

327
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,800
But...

328
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,689
What you should be afraid of is someone else mingling with Ai Gun instead.

329
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,559
Let's keep this between us two.

330
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,093
Thanks.

331
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,823
Who?

332
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,409
Just keep calm, okay?

333
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:28,550
This morning, I saw your boy and Ai Sound together.

334
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,979
You're wrong!

335
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,319
I swear!

336
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,589
Are you sure you're the only one Ai Gun is talking to?

337
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,639
So what? I'm not an illogical person!

338
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,239
As long as he's not my lover yet,

339
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,729
I won't get jealous.

340
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,679
And you'll regret not believing my word.

341
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,639
♫ If you want to be just friends ♫

342
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,699
♫ Stay in that lane ♫

343
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:04,889
♫ If I cross the line, would you be mine? ♫

344
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:09,599
♫ Tell me, would you be ♫

345
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,739
♫ Standing right here with me? ♫

346
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,710
♫ Then stop being too friendly ♫

347
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,730
Stop, hold on. Hold on.

348
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,249
We weren't synchronized again this time.

349
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,819
How could we? Ai Pat is hitting off the beat.

350
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,299
So you're not off the beat at all?

351
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,789
You're more off beat than I am!

352
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,049
- You smartass!
- You, too...

353
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,649
Hey! Don't blame each other. We were all wrong. Let's start over.

354
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:40,559
Hey, wait. I'm sorry.

355
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,849
I have a workshop to get to. May I leave now?

356
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:47,199
Hey. Can't you see the situation? How dare you leave now?

357
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,959
- What?
- What the hell?

358
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:54,019
Ai Gun, how can you let that jerk leave?

359
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,169
What do you want me to say?

360
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,579
He's the only one who hasn't played wrong.

361
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,429
Worry about yourselves first.

362
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,230
Again. One, two, three, four.

363
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,330
Hey!

364
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,929
Ai Pat, can you focus? You, too, Ai Yo.

365
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,890
You and you as well.

366
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,539
I did it just fine.

367
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,520
Okay. Let's start over.

368
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,500
One, two, three, four.

369
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,473
Damn it!

370
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:34,630
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

371
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,069
If you guys are not serious, just go home.

372
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,941
What a freaking waste of time.

373
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,070
- Hey.
- Ai Gun.
- We're sorry.

374
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,550
Ai Gun. Gosh.

375
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,600
Fine, just leave then.

376
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,750
What's the matter?

377
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,189
You usually get mad only at me.

378
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,350
How can I be chill?

379
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,139
Look at them.

380
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,440
The practice isn't going anywhere.

381
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,459
The more it's like this, the more you have to be patient.

382
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,680
Your friends are freaking out.

383
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,220
I'm just afraid we'd lose.

384
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,859
Everybody is scared. Even I am.

385
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,459
You need to cool it down and be their anchor.

386
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,000
You're their leader.

387
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,670
How can I cool down?

388
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,279
We barely have time left.

389
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,430
The competition is very soon.

390
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,770
You want to cool down?

391
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,963
One second.

392
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,263
Hey!

393
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,130
Ai Tinn, you asshole!

394
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,429
Is it better?

395
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:38,469
If not, try shouting your lungs out underwater.

396
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,149
Come on. Just try it. Don't you believe me?

397
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,679
So? Feeling better?

398
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,280
Let me try again.

399
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,423
Is it better?

400
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,929
It's better.

401
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,570
Thanks.

402
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,199
I'll definitely catch a cold. Can you help me?

403
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,510
All right.

404
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,859
Ai Gun, what are you doing?

405
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,350
I want Mr. President to cool down, too.

406
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,750
What should we do?

407
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,230
Should we go find him?

408
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,210
What do you think, Ai Win? Should we?

409
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,009
He will come back once he's okay. We can apologize to him then.

410
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:16,589
I get why he's stressed out.

411
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,979
But he's been gone for so long already.

412
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,119
I'm starting to get worried.

413
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,730
- Shoot.
- The Director is here.

414
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,789
- Hello, Miss.
- Hi.

415
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,440
I'm here to check in on you guys.

416
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,129
And... where is Tinn?

417
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:36,049
He went out a while ago. We're taking a break now.

418
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,739
Where did he go?

419
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,140
He isn't in the student council room either.

420
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,790
Uh…

421
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,179
We're not sure.

422
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,080
Are you the last one who saw him?

423
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,090
If someone saw us like this,

424
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,020
what would we say?

425
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,280
Tell them we swam

426
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,590
and had a hot first kiss underwater.

427
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,709
- Good idea?
- Kiss, my foot.

428
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:16,860
Let's dry up before we go back.

429
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,289
See?

430
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,120
It's good I'm here watching you practice.

431
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,870
Or do you not like it?

432
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:31,289
Come on. Who wouldn't like that?

433
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,099
Having someone to support here. I'm just afraid those guys will find out.

434
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,450
When I said I felt bad, I meant it.

435
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,330
I don't want to trouble you.

436
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,299
Trouble? There's no trouble at all.

437
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,359
Back then,

438
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,550
all I could do was support you anonymously.

439
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,389
This year, I get to cheer for you this close. What could be better?

440
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,430
Damn you.

441
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,460
You're so whipped.

442
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,120
That's all I can do, though.

443
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:29,330
I can't help you with music like someone else can.

444
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,590
Who are you talking about?

445
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:43,290
One of your friends who is quite good at music.

446
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,780
I see that you always help him.

447
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,910
I see.

448
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,920
Who?

449
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,710
Ai Sound?

450
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,979
I don't know. Someone.

451
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,569
Are you jealous?

452
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,819
Jealous? No. I don't know.

453
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,060
Are you jealous?

454
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,969
- I'm not.
- Are you jealous?

455
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:08,129
Tinn.

456
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:10,919
- Look at the sky. It's pretty.
- Tinn.

457
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,559
Tinn, are you here? Tinn.

458
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,940
Tinn?

459
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,620
Tinn!

460
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,343
Tinn.

461
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,480
Where is he?

462
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,473
Tinn.

463
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,699
Tinn. Where did he go?

464
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,370
We just wrung out our clothes.

465
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,840
Guys, has Tinn come back?

466
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,580
Not yet.

467
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,939
- P'Noi...
- He's here, Ma'am.

468
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:03,620
Tinn.

469
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,229
What's going on, Mom?

470
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,060
I should ask you that question. What happened to you?

471
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,310
I called you so many times, why didn't you pick up?

472
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,999
And why are you both soaking wet?

473
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,839
I didn't bring my phone with me.

474
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,020
Gun and I went out to buy some snacks. It was pouring outside.

475
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,829
We ran through it.

476
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:29,560
Okay. Let's go to the principal's office.

477
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
There's a towel you can use to dry off before you get sick.

478
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,963
Come on.

479
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,950
Goodbye.

480
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,609
You dry yourself, too. We're competing soon, you'll get sick.

481
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,500
All right.

482
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,520
Thanks.

483
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,053
I mean,

484
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm... sorry.

485
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,489
I've been feeling so pressured lately.

486
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,279
And I mistakenly took it out on you guys.

487
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,770
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,103
Hey.

489
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,010
Don't apologize. It's our bad.

490
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,820
We were playing badly.

491
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:46,669
How about we practice all night tonight?

492
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,489
Shall we practice all night?

493
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,359
Let's do it.

494
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,839
We will practice until dawn.

495
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,159
- And!
- Hugs! Hugs!

496
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,993
Hugs! Hugs! Hugs!

497

Mom, I'm sorry for making you worry.

Never mind that, Dear.

Tinn, I actually have good news for you.

501
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,809
What news?

502
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,600
The Professor of Medicine is having a seminar at our school.

I'll take you to see him.

It will make your interview with him go more smoothly.

I'm going to introduce you to him for now.

Guys, my workshop got moved earlier today.

I'll be back as soon as it's done.

Guys. I'm going to get something to eat. I'll be right back.

I'll be back soon.

All right, let's leave him be.

516

What song are we playing? I'm ready.

Why are you guys screaming "barbecue pork"?

I want to practice.

We have more practice.

Let's say I didn't hear anything.

527

All I know is that you guys will practice really hard.

So this is your workshop, huh?

533
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,160
I knew it. A perfectionist like you would never miss a practice.

Hey.

What's wrong with your wrist?

537
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,700
I carried a burden like you guys so much that I got wrist tendonitis.

Why didn't you tell us?

Why are you acting cool?

I'm effortlessly cool without acting.

I was afraid you guys would be more discouraged.

Hello, Papi Tinn. Long time no see.

634
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:43,870
Today, Khun Gun is taking us on the school tour where Chinzhilla Band originated,

635
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,349
the band that joined the Hot Wave competition.

Where are we right now?

637
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:53,500
It's the path I use every day.

638
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:56,679
Sometimes I go to class. Sometimes I go to the toilet to poop.

00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:06,229
- What's that?
- There?

644
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:10,000
So this is where we do morning assembly every day

645
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,190
and listen to the school president ramble.

646
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,802
I have no idea why he's so talkative.

647
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:20,537
- People just want to get to class.
- Really?

648
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,310
And right over there is my classroom.

649
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,391
I sit at the back of the class.

650
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:30,289
I let the nerds sit in the front.

651
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,789
But I don't know why…

652
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,723
one student in front of the class

00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,916
Well…

655
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,254
I wonder if he has feelings for me.

656
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,342
If you don't look at me, how do you know I look at you?

657
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,489
Uh…

658
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,921
Let's go see…

00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:25,629
So?
