But Ai Sound said it would be more interesting if we made a music video.

166
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:50,140
So here I am burdened about how to make the music video.

167
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,159
Would you like my help?

168
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,429
Where did you come from?

169
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,820
Don't mind a nosy boy like me.

170
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Here's what you don't know.

171
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,429
Ai Tinn and I always make promo videos for the student council.

172
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,959
What videos? Aren't you the only one in charge?

173
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,360
Come on. Don't be so humble, Buddy.

174
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,660
Right. You're right.

175
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,910
Don't butt in. It's my club's business.

176
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,539
It doesn't concern you guys.

177
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,639
Let's go, Ai Gun. Go set up for shooting.

178
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,203
Come on, quickly.

179
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,487
That asshole Sound. He's such a pain.

180
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,684
No wonder he's been your all-time rival since childhood.

181
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,344
Right.

182
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,228
Let me be frank here.

183
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:41,844
I think Ai Sound is planning to steal Ai Gun from you.

184
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,568
- Oh, shit.
- I can feel it.

185
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:46,568
Damn. I got goosebumps saying it.

186
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,368
That's my arm hair!

187
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,459
[Music Club]

188
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,669
Ai Gun, stretch that until it's taut.

189
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,120
We will key in the CG background later.

190
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,479
Where is Ai Win, by the way?

191
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,440
He's quite late.

192
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,139
Hey, sorry. I got up late.

193
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,072
Why are you in the PE uniform?

194
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,170
I got the dates mixed up.

195
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,772
Why? Are you bullying me?

196
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:21,226
I can still study no matter what I'm wearing.

197
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:24,527
You can study, all right. But you can't shoot the MV wearing this.

198
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,715
Your shirt color is the same as the green screen.

199
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,799
We can't key in the background.

200
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,503
Are you stupid or stupid?

201
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:32,612
Wow! You're so troublesome.

202
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:36,039
I will just take it off and shoot. Are you happy now?

203
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,934
If you're going to fix your problems ignorantly, you might as well fix your disposition!

204
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:42,452
You asshole! How about I shut your mouth with my feet?

205
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:48,308
- Bring it on then!
- Asshole!

206
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:51,495
See? If you had let me help, this wouldn't have happened.

207
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,411
You need help from professionals.

208
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:57,699
Quit bragging. Just state your idea.

209
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,432
If it's bad, I can go home.

210
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,949
Okay.

211
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,870
The MV of this song is exceptionally made. It has more than 100 million views.

212
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,120
So I'm using its popularity for our own good

213
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,032
by making a parody MV of the real "Just Being Friendly" MV.

214
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:16,459
Hold on. So are we making the real MV or the parody? I'm confused.

215
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,976
It will be like the original MV,

216
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:23,204
but instead of male-female couples, we will have BL couples.

217
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,160
Why BL though?

218
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,351
The original MV has three couples.

219
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,724
And you guys can make three couples too.

220
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,344
Besides, you all are close.

221
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,872
So the first couple is the condo couple,

222
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,644
Ai Gun and Ai Tinn.

223
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,579
Hey! How come?

224
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,443
We have many members in the club. Why is it Ai Tinn?

225
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,296
Because Ai Tinn looks like the guy in the original MV.

226
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,750
Why are you asking so many questions? That's enough.

227
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:51,870
The next couple, the badminton couple. Ai Sound and Ai Yo.

228
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,899
Hey! No way!

229
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,484
Just thinking about it makes me want to pass out!

230
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,775
Yo. He fainted.

231
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,365
Yo.

232
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:09,329
Okay then. Ai Win, you take his place.

233
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,535
Are you sure? He can't even wear the right color shirt.

234
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:13,719
I will replace Ai Yo.

235
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:17,310
Does the MV have a scene where we hit each other with the rackets? I want a battle! Asshole!

236
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,859
- Hey, no!
- Bring it on.

237
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,180
Settle down. Settle down.

238
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,759
Why is it that when I see you two fight, I feel like shipping?

239
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,531
All right. The third couple, the noodle shop couple.

240
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:37,379
It's down to you, Ai Pat and Ai Por. Does anyone have a question?

241
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,000
I do.

242
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,012
Do we need to practice making noodles until we look like pros?

243
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:44,551
How about half a year?

244
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,960
Like when big stars prepare for their movies. Does it sound good?

245
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,731
Are you opening a noodle shop or what?

246
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,872
That's not necessary.

247
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:53,323
Being close is the key

248
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:57,047
so that when we film, the chemistry will show.

249
00:15:57,048 --> 00:16:00,270
Chemistry?

250
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,608
That seems like too much.

251
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:05,299
That's all. Okay?

252
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,973
All right, let's go.

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,376
"36 Questions That Will Get Us Closer."

254
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,793
What for?

255
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,390
Ai Tiw suggested we answer them. That way, we would get closer.

256
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,019
So when we film the MV, we will look really close.

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,332
How does filming the MV help make any progress?

258
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:55,704
I spent nights with him, yet I made zero progress.

259
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,376
Filming the MV is just the start.

260
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,592
The real deal is right here.

261
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,775
What is this?

262
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,519
"36 Questions That Will Make People Fall in Love."

263
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,888
This is exaggerating. How can questions and answers get people to fall in love?

264
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:14,567
You just don't know anything.

265
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:19,206
These are questionnaires created by psychologists, aiming to help people get to know each other deeply.

266
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:23,699
My sibling never fails to get a lover because of it.

267
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,011
- For real?
- Yes.

268
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,439
Why didn't you show me this treasure earlier?

269
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,527
I would have been dating Ai Gun by now!

270
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:34,175
Right?

271
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,204
Damn right!

272
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,400
Let's check out the first question.

273
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,452
If you could invite anyone to dinner, who would that be?

274
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:50,663
Of course, the members of Paradox band.

275
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:53,000
The idea gives me joy already.

276
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,719
What about you? Who?

277
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
Me?

278
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,512
It's…

279
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,416
It's…

280
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,770
my dad. He's such a good cook.

281
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,492
Okay. Move on to the next one.

282
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:19,516
Do you want to be famous?

283
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,499
Of course I do.

284
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,750
That way,

285
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,750
I can financially support my mom.

286
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,040
As for me,

287
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:36,183
I've never thought about it.

288
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:37,943
Come on.

289
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:42,643
If you don't want to be popular, why did you run for student president?

290
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,760
I ran for student president

291
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,280
because I wanted to help someone.

292
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,749
That's all.

293
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,053
Who is that?

294
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,924
Is it the person you like?

295
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,484
Why do you want to know?

296
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,935
Let's answer the next one. We got a lot left.

297
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,568
It's the wrong side.

298
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:29,857
Right.

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,230
Next question.

300
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:42,069
[Auntie Pao's Traditional Noodles]

301
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,796
I asked the auntie. We will shoot the noodle-making scene here,

302
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:48,632
so I want you guys to practice for today.

303
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,547
- Where is she anyway?
- No idea.

304
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:54,167
Probably in the restroom.

305
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,296
Okay. Good then.

306
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,271
Ai Pat, make me one Tom Yum Small Noodle Soup.

307
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:01,470
Are you sure?

308
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,408
Just do it. The auntie is nice. Let's try.

309
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:06,220
You got it.

310
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,472
Por, pass me that bowl.

311
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:15,499
- Damn. Looking good.
- Of course.

312
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:18,519
- Ai Por, you season it.
- Yes, Chef.

313
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,672
And it's ready to be served.

314
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,749
Why is the color different from Auntie's noodles?

315
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:37,776
Ai Pat, taste it.

316
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:40,120
What? Why don't you try it?

317
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,160
I'm the director. If I eat and get sick, this project is over.

318
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,270
What the...

319
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,276
Yeah, you do it.

320
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,120
Fine. I'll do it.

321
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,189
How is it?

322
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,019
- So damn yummy!
- For real?

323
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,983
You're praising your friend too much. Let me try.

324
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:01,816
If you don't believe me, try it.

325
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,049
Wow! So good.

326
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,480
Ai Por, you can be her competitor.

327
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,120
That's true.

328
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,220
Did you secretly take cooking classes?

329
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,819
Hey! It's really good.

330
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,030
I told you.

331
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,044
Let's share it!

332
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,947
Tom Yum Small Noodle Soup. Thank you.

333
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:27,407
Tom Yum Small Noodle Soup.

334
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:30,430
- Tom Yum Noodles here.
- Ai Por, two bowls of Tom Yum Small Noodle Soup.

335
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,390
Ai Pat, 2 bowls of Tom Yum!two

336
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,008
Tom Yum Noodle Soup. Okay. Thank you.

337
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,644
What is happening here?

338
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:41,779
- Hi, Auntie. We were just learning, but Ai Por happened to make super delicious noodles.
- Hi.

339
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:44,447
So people gathered around to come eat.

340
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:46,348
Do you want to taste it, too?

341
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,740
At my own shop?

342
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,324
Please get in line. We accept cash only.

343
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,510
Ai Pat, don't forget the two bowls of noodles.

344
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,172
- Come on, hurry up.
- I'm trying.

345
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,139
It's just an MV. Do we really need to practice?

346
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,111
Ai Tiwson told us to.

347
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:10,799
But if you're scared, run along home.

348
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,228
Who's scared of you?

349
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:16,804
I'm just afraid you would lose and be too discouraged to shoot the MV.

350
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,409
Game on.

351
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:28,047
Just work on your service reception.

352
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,320
Show me all you got.

353
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,130
I'm just warming up. I haven't played in a long time.

354
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:53,559
Ah. Take your time then.

355
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,476
Come on.

356
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,047
Was this round a warm-up too?

357
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,104
It's real this time.

358
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,988
Don't tell me you don't know how to play badminton.

359
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
Do you want me to coach you?

360
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:31,149
Take hold of the shuttlecock.

361
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:34,445
Hold the shuttlecock right here, not too high, not too low.

362
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:38,259
This is how you hold the racket. Grab it firmly. It will be gripped between your fingers.

363
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,632
Face the racket open, it's really important.

364
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:42,892
Then you swing at the shuttlecock.

365
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:45,892
Try it. It's not that hard.

366
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,567
Hey, focus!

367
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:55,436
Face the racket open. Don't forget that.

368
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:59,020
I told you to hold the racket like this! How many times have I told you?

369
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,184
Hold the shuttle. Face the racket out and hit.

370
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,044
Try it again.

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,709
- Damn it.
- You jerk! Don't you get what I said?

372
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,449
Don't you know how to do it? Learn some sports and don't just flirt with girls!

373
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:13,583
Enough! You're supposed to teach, not yell at me.

374
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,919
What the hell! I was trying to teach you!

375
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,553
You dummy!

376
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,400
The next question.

377
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,144
What's your best memory?

378
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:29,684
The best?

379
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:32,090
So I need to pick only one, right?

380
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,800
That's tough.

381
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,540
The best?

382
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,150
Probably when

383
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,680
my dad bought me the first guitar as my birthday present.

384
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:01,218
What about yours?

385
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,880
What a coincidence.

386
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:10,228
Mine happened on my birthday as well.

387
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:13,500
But on that day…

388
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,280
my mom and dad didn't have time to celebrate it with me,

389
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,544
so I went to sit sadly at this one shop.

390
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,368
And…

391
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:31,712
the shop's singer got up on stage and sang me a song.

392
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,311
That's the best birthday present ever.

393
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:37,583
Really?

394
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:41,283
Which shop? I want to hear the live music, too.

395
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:46,979
No. I don't know.

396
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,647
Which one?

397
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,592
It was a long time ago. I can't recall.

398
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,383
Come on.

399
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:54,599
Let's change the question.

400
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,816
Here. My turn.

401
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,308
What's your worst memory?

402
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,260
The worst memory?

403
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:19,272
Probably what I told you before.

404
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,550
It was about a test in singing class,

405
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,900
and I forgot the lyrics.

406
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,096
It was so embarrassing.

407
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,260
What about yours?

408
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,139
Wow. What a coincidence.

409
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:50,980
Mine happened when I took my first singing class test, too.

410
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:55,152
I got the full score.

411
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,568
How was it bad then?

412
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,841
Well,

413
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,240
by the time I was celebrating,

414
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,728
my mom called and told me

415
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,748
that my dad got hit by a car.

416
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:53,648
I was about to call to tell him I got the top score.

417
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,064
It should have been the happiest day of my life, right?

418
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,033
But…

419
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,928
it's just the day I want to forget the most.

420
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,080
After your dad passed,

421
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,600
how were you holding up?

422
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,140
I was missing him.

423
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,193
I was lonely.

424
00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:01,280
Sometimes, I saw my mom crying alone.

425
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,624
I was pretending I was okay.

426
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:14,143
I was fine so that my mom wouldn't be worried.

427
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,700
When our loved ones are gone,

428
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:25,516
they don't just go empty-handed.

429
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,800
They take our hearts with them.

430
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,044
I feel like there's a hole in my heart.

431
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,420
No matter what I use to fill it,

432
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,260
it's never been whole.

433
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,700
It's okay.

434
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,424
[11:10 p.m.]

435
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,060
Yes! Found my wallet!

436
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,700
Why the hell are you here?

437
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,950
Did you come to bully me again?

438
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:44,906
I came to look for my wallet.

439
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:51,544
And I saw a loony person playing badminton by himself.

440
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,968
Badminton requires two players.

441
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,656
What are you confused about?

442
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:03,806
Serve the shuttle over the net.

443
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,620
Come on.

444
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,170
Serve it just the way I taught you.

445
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,456
You almost got it. Keep it up.

446
00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:32,317
Hey!

447
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:47,616
You've gotten better.

448
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:00,040
We will film the noodle shop couple first.

449
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,119
Then we'll move on to the badminton couple.

450
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,429
Okay.

451
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:05,828
When will Ai Pat get here?

452
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:16,336
Hey Ai Por, I heard you guys practiced making noodles. Was it fun?

453
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:17,600
I was fine.

454
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,070
But Ai Pat made so many that his hands got cramps.

455
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,704
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:25,224
I feel so bad for him.

457
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:27,831
What about your couple? How did it go?

458
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:29,439
My couple?

459
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,943
Ai Tiwson gave us questionnaires to ask each other.

460
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:36,352
But as the questions go, at some point,

461
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:40,204
I am just too afraid to hear them.

462
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,428
I'm afraid of the answers.

463
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,928
I'm scared of getting ahead of myself.

464
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,950
Are you still talking about the MV?

465
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,720
What? The MV, of course. I'm talking about the MV.

466
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,895
- MV.
- Yes.

467
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,724
Hey, Ai Pat!

468
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:06,840
What happened to your hand?

469
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,443
It's because of you. You kept telling me to practice making noodles,

470
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:12,030
and now I have wrist tendonitis.

471
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,256
How would I have known that would happen?

472
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:16,640
- Ai Yo!
- What?

473
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,200
- You take his place.
- I can't handle it.

474
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,780
Hey!

475
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,079
Ai Yo, hang in there!

476
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,380
Okay, how about this? We'll go film the badminton couple first.

477
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,015
We'll come and film this later.

478
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:31,160
- Ai Yo.
- Trust me. I'm the director.

479
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,480
Five, four, three, two. Action!

480
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,604
Good. Cut! Passed!

481
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:42,880
What? I practiced all night.

482
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,487
That's all you want?

483
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:48,500
Well, this scene isn't the highlight of the MV. Let's move to the next scene.

484
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,092
- There's more?
- Yes.

485
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:54,268
Didn't you watch the reference I sent you? It's the kiss scene.

486
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,801
What?

487
00:33:56,856 --> 00:34:01,459
For this scene, the one who has a secret crush will pick up the medal and move his face closer.

488
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,390
Have you decided who has a secret crush?

489
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,280
Well, that will be up to you guys. Decide on your own.

490
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,989
- You like me.
- No, you like me.

491
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,629
- You like me.
- You like me.

492
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,810
- I said it first.
- No way. You like me.

493
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,010
Rock paper scissors, okay?

494
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,256
Have you decided?

495
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:28,420
Okay. Ai Pat, put the medal on them.

496
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,268
May I?

497
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:37,359
Perfect.

498
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,940
Are we okay? Lights, ready?

499
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,220
Five, four, three, two. Action.

500
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,905
Okay.

501
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,920
Ai Win, point at your head so Ai Sound can sniff you.

502
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,080
Ai Sound, pick up the medal to kiss.

503
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:02,236
Ai Win, grab the medal and move your face closer.

504
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,404
Let me do it over.

505
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,832
Can I try it again?

506
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,830
Okay. That's fine.

507
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,072
Give me the continuation. Ready?

508
00:35:37,072 --> 00:35:40,170
Five, four, three, two. Action.

509
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,924
I can't.

510
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:57,074
What a waste of time.

511
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,160
Cut. Cut! Cut!

512
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,500
Great job! Pass!

513
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,760
Ai Sound, of course you're a professional!

514
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:29,800
Let's shoot the next one. Come on.

515
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,533
Let's go.

516
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:04,580
We have three questions left.

517
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,348
The next question is...

518
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:12,848
Say what you like about the other one.

519
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,430
- I'll go first.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,336
I think I like…

521
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,224
I like…you…

522
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:35,368
I like listening to you sing.

523
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:39,930
Okay. But I hate.

524
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,159
Hate what?

525
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,099
Your perfectionist behavior.

526
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,565
You're supposed to say what you like, not what you hate.

527
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:47,590
I'm not done yet.

528
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,490
Maybe it's because you're so detail oriented,

529
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,540
when you listen to my music, you give it all your attention.

530
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,700
And that gives me the energy to sing.

531
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,790
Really?

532
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,356
I didn't know that.

533
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,222
That just gave me the energy to listen to your music.

534
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:19,888
Next question. Hold this.

535
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,600
It's my turn to ask.

536
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,524
If we became close friends one day,

537
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:30,020
what would you like me to know in advance?

538
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,336
I snore. In case you don't like it.

539
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:36,020
I already know that. You don't need to warn me.

540
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,440
During that tutoring session we had,

541
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,670
you snored all night. I couldn't sleep.

542
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:47,120
What's yours? Anything you want to tell me?

543
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,288
To be honest, I get scared so easily.

544
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,255
Easily scared?

545
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:55,789
Yes.

546
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,210
What are you scared of?

547
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,670
You don't seem to be scared of me at all.

548
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,799
Has this ever happened to you,

549
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,768
there are things you want to ask,

550
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:15,760
but you're too afraid to?

551
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,690
Because you're scared of the answers.

552
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,888
What do you mean?

553
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,530
Do you have something you want to ask me?

554
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,285
Hm?

555
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:45,632
- Ai Gun.
- Huh?

556
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:48,100
Is there anything you want to ask me?

557
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,320
Here. Right here.

558
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,920
- Huh?
- Wait.

559
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,370
It's the last question.

560
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:04,064
Look into the other person's eyes for one minute and ask any question.

561
00:40:04,064 --> 00:40:06,890
That person must answer truthfully.

562
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,768
Sure. All right.

563
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,733
Here we go.

564
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,948
You want to ask me who I like, right?

565
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,840
Yes.

566
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:46,884
I think you know.

567
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,076
I'm guessing I know as well.

568
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:57,310
How do you think the one I like will respond to that?

569
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,420
Why are you asking me? I'm the one asking you.

570
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:10,389
Um.

571
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,173
Well...

572
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,404
They will probably say...

573
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,304
"I'm sorry.

574
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:25,830
My club rule forbids me from having a lover."

575
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:47,890
Yeah, I thought so, too.

576
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,280
That's why I'm afraid to

577
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,790
tell them how I feel.

578
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,432
Hey, hold on.

579
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,616
But... it doesn't mean they feel bad about it.

580
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,600
Yeah, it's fine. I understand.

581
00:42:22,312 --> 00:42:27,500
Let's just forget what we talked about today.

582
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,887
When we work together tomorrow, let's do it as friends like usual.

583
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:34,521
That's all there is.

584
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:40,208
Got it, Friend.

585
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,403
See you, Friend.

586
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,370
[Broken]

587
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,700
Hey.

588
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,850
Calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.

589
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,320
Friend, my ass.

590
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,254
I don't want to be your friend.

591
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:26,612
I want to be your boyfriend.

592
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:29,800
Gosh! That club rule is so dumb!

593
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,220
But you knew Ai Gun would say that, didn't you?

594
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,964
He's the band leader.

595
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:35,804
Of course, he needs to keep the rule.

596
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:38,600
I know that, too, but it still hurts.

597
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,288
Who would have known that a heartbreak would hurt like this?

598
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,034
- Please help me.
- Calm down.

599
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:50,629
Think about it. If Ai Gun didn't like you at all,

600
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,503
he would have rejected you already, right?

601
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,799
But he used the excuse that it's against the rules.

602
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,704
This means he might be waiting until he wins the Hot Wave competition.

603
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:01,200
Oh, right.

604
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,359
That's true.

605
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,088
You're not trying to trick me into getting my hopes up, are you?

606
00:44:05,088 --> 00:44:07,640
When there's love, there's hope.

607
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,007
How about this? Just be his friend for now.

608
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:13,600
Show him you can wait for him

609
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,500
I'll do my best.

610
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,610
"Do my best," dammit, no!

611
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,000
I don't want to be his friend.

612
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,087
What kind of friend says goodnight before bed?

613
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:25,452
You're losing it.

614
00:44:25,452 --> 00:44:28,402
I don't want to imagine the MV shooting tomorrow.

615
00:44:35,032 --> 00:44:37,840
Even my bed hates me.

616
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,350
Come on in, Guys.

617
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,040
Wow.

618
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,110
This room is awesome.

619
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,144
It's so damn spacious.

620
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,319
Make yourself at home. It's my sibling's place.

621
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,543
No! I meant, it's Ai Tinn's place.

622
00:44:58,543 --> 00:45:01,909
I sleep over often, so I'm familiar with it.

623
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,309
You guys can go set up. We will start shooting now.

624
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:07,599
Okay.

625
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,748
- By the way, Ai Tinn, your room is so damn spacious.
- It's so big.

626
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:13,616
Why didn't you invite us for a sleep-over sometimes?

627
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,163
Hey!

628
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,516
Hi, Friend.

629
00:45:20,516 --> 00:45:22,860
Do your best today.

630
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,193
Here.

631
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,292
Okay, Friend.

632
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:46,290
Hey, Friends, do you want some snacks?

633
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:55,900
In the next scene, you guys will eat cup noodles.

634
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,440
You guys can playfully tease each other.

635
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,068
Can I improvise?

636
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:04,191
Have Ai Tinn eat messily and I'll wipe his lips

637
00:46:04,192 --> 00:46:05,942
to create a lovely moment.

638
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:10,965
Are you sure? I think the old script is lovely enough.

639
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:14,024
Trust me. It's super lovely, I'm telling you.

640
00:46:15,968 --> 00:46:18,001
Sure.

641
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:20,720
If my friend Gun says so,

642
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:23,050
I'm okay.

643
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,649
Very nice,

644
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,192
my friend Tinn.

645
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:29,730
Okay.

646
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,564
Why do they keep emphasizing the word "friend"?

647
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:36,279
They might be in character and trying to follow the MV.

648
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,844
"Just Being Friendly," you know?

649
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:42,709
Are you guys ready? Ai Win, give them the cup noodles.

650
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,688
Careful. It's hot.

651
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,820
Let's get started.

652
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,919
Five, four, three, two. Action.

653
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,007
Are you hungry?

654
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:55,320
Here. Open your mouth.

655
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,620

♫ I can’t be just friends with you ♫

816
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,820
♫ I wait for you to give me a clue ♫

817
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,110
♫ If friends are all we can be ♫

818
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,890
♫ Then stop being too friendly ♫

819
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,460
♫ I try not to feel what I shouldn’t feel ♫

820
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:46,060
♫ When we get too close, too real ♫

821
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,090
♫ My heart is full of questions ♫

822
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,300
♫ More than I can bear ♫

823
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,300
♫ Tell me if you dare ♫

824
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,620
♫ If you want to be just friends ♫

825
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,710
♫ Stay in that lane ♫

826
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,980
♫ If I cross the line, would you be mine? ♫

827
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:08,650
♫ Tell me, would you be ♫

828
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,680
♫ Standing right here with me? ♫

829
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,110
♫ If you never feel the way I do ♫

830
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,440
♫ I can’t be just friends with you ♫

831
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,150
♫ I wait for you to give me a clue ♫

832
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,280
♫ If friends are all we can be ♫

833
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,990
♫ Then stop being too friendly ♫

834
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,539
Should I cross the line, or will you do it?
