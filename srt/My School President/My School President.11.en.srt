Say hi to the camera, Guys.

170
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,650
- Hello!
- Hello!

171
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,400
Gun, are you okay?

172
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,290
I'm okay!

173
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,470
Do your best.

174
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,669
Are you guys ready?

175
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,303
We are.

176
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,100
- The band...
- Chinzhilla! Chinzhilla!

177
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,430
Chinzhilla! Chinzhilla! Chinzhilla! Chinzhilla!

178
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,710
Chinzhilla! Chinzhilla!

179
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,340
My apologies.

180
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,040
Can we continue tomorrow?

181
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,653
Ai Gun!

182
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,110
What just happened?

183
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,879
He hasn't sung for a while.

184
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,700
He might be getting stage fright.

185
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,499
He will be back in no time.

186
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,420
He won't.

187
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
Don't waste your time waiting.

188
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,690
Just cancel this freaking band.

189
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm out.

190
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,720
Ai Win, where are you going?

191
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,169
Come back and apologize to your friends.

192
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,580
Ai Win! Ai Win!

193
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,230
Ai Win!

194
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,630
What the hell...

195
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,569
Does your band...

196
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,870
have some sort of issues?

197
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,490
Ai Win!

198
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,810
Ai Win.

199
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,380
Stop right there.

200
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,249
How can you say that shit?

201
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,439
Apologize to your friends right now!

202
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,539
It's not just Ai Gun who can't play on.

203
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,559
I can't either.

204
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,699
Every time I pick up the bass,

205
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,350
I think if I hadn't made mistakes, our band wouldn't have lost.

206
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,439
What do you want me to do?

207
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,660
Ai Gun doesn't get me! Ai Yo doesn't get me! Ai Por doesn't get me and Ai Pat doesn't get me!

208
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,559
No one understands. I'm so disappointed in myself. Don't you get it?

209
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,010
What do you expect me to do?

210
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,719
What do you want me to do? No one gets me!

211
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:53,060
What do you want me to do?

212
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,890
No one understands me.

213
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,339
- They don't understand me! I'm disappointed in myself!
- Enough!

214
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,340
That's enough!

215
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,400
You have no idea how much I tried.

216
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,779
I tried my best.

217
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,020
I made mistakes. What can I do now?

218
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,729
I made a mistake!

219
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,020
It's okay.

220
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,160
- You don't under—
- Enough!

221
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,330
I really tried...

222
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,130
I really did.

223
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
Next time,

224
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,210
let me know whatever you're going through.

225
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,040
Okay?

226
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,440
We're a couple.

227
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,983
Okay?

228
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,890
Stop blaming yourself.

229
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,540
I... am sorry.

230
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,160
I shouldn't have rushed you.

231
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,040
I thought this event could motivate you again.

232
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,180
It's not your fault.

233
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,510
I was the one who ruined everything.

234
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,580
You've always been there for me.

235
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,280
I've lost so many times.

236
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,100
But this time…

237
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,580
Damn, it hurt the most.

238
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,710
You're feeling this because you did your best.

239
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,240
There's nothing to regret.

240
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,490
My best?

241
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,570
You remind me of when P'Yak lost Hot Wave.

242
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,980
He couldn't play on like I can't now.

243
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,249
Sit over there.

244
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:46,940
Please have a seat, Phi.

245
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,540
P'Yak, sit down.

246
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,273
Have a seat.

247
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,909
Why did you bring us here?

248

You know we quit playing.

249
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,679
I'm not asking you to play.

I'm playing for you.

251

Our song will comfort you guys.

252
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:19,780
Comfort us? You guys?

253
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,879
How about you learn to play the chords right first?

254
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,319
So what if you lost? Start over.

255
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,420
At least

256
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,760
you all did your best.

257
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,680
Our best?

258
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,700
Don't you say that to us again.

259
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,600
You guys will never get how we feel.

260

Today,

261
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,220
I think I get it now

262
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,170
when people say,

263
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,280
"It's okay. You did your best."

264
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,010
I keep asking myself today.

265
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,010
If I had sung better that day,

266
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,820
or if I had written a better song,

267
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,580
if I had arrived at the Hot Wave venue sooner,

268
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,550
would everything change?

269
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,093
Ai Gun.

Lift up your face.

What are you doing?

272
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,680
I saw it in a movie.

273
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,440
It said if we do this, we won't cry.

274
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,930
It's okay.

275

Whether you win or lose,

276
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,040
I will always be right by your side.

277
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,620
I'm not going anywhere.

I don't think anyone will come back.

Come on. Wait a bit longer.

I think they'll come back this time. Trust me.

Sorry, Buddy.

I have to go.

It's over.

289
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,270
I prepared barbecue pork as a surprise to celebrate Chinzhilla's comeback.

290
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,440
Look now.

291

I am the one surprised now.

Are you and Ai Tinn free?

293
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,990
Interested?

294
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,600
Ai Tinn just messaged me saying he's taking Ai Gun home.

295

But we wasted your time.

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,839
Then... How about you pay me with your barbecue pork?

301
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,020
I've heard about chef Por for so long.

- Yes.

you'll love it from the first bite.

Of course.

- Should I dip it in the sauce?
- No.

00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,260
Ouch! Ow! Ow! My back!

504
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,420
Argh! My back! Lift me up!

505
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,990
Ouch! My back!

506
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,460
- I'm carrying the stuff for you here.
- Can you walk faster?

507
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,880
- I'm carrying the stuff for you here.
- Can you walk faster?

508
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,999
♫ Wherever I look, you’re never far ♫

509
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,920
♫ Thanks for loving me and staying where you are ♫

510
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,840
♫ When I’m down, you’re right here ♫

511
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,340
♫ (You’ve got ma back back) ♫

512
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,140
So exhausted.

513
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,840
Come on, let's go.

514
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,380
Ai Yo, help me carry!

515
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,176
Why is all his weight on me?

516
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,530
Let's go.

517
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,593
Damn it. Ai Por alone is tough enough for us.

518
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:35,731
Someone just had to show off. Hurry up.

519
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,640
Hey, do it gently.

520
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,250
I'm exhausted.

521
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,510
We're all tired.

522
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,880
Does anyone have water? I'm thirsty.

523
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:49,099
Let's take a break here.

524
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,363
No, we don't have any.

525
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:54,552
I didn't think we would have to go through this much trouble.

526
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,240
We only have this red soda for the offerings.

527
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,109
Guys, it's okay. I'll walk down and buy you some.

528
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:05,359
You shut it.

529
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,700
Look at you. How can you even walk?

530
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,032
Should we rest?

531
00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:13,660
Yes. Let's take a break.

532
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,940
[Ohishi Tea]

533
00:45:26,328 --> 00:45:29,380
Take it. I only have one bottle.

534
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,110
I'll let you drink it first, and then you can share with the rest.

535
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,791
You want me to hide it from my friends?

536
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,084
I can't.

537
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:40,560
- Do you want me to throw it away?
- Hey.

538
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,532
I'll share it with them later.

539
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,620
Ai Gun, do you want to take my place?

540
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,772
Hey, Ai Gun, what's wrong?

541
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,143
Why are you two hugging?

542
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:57,519
It's nothing.

543
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,220
If nothing, then why are you guys hugging?

544
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,853
He's a little dizzy, but he's fine. You guys can go ahead.

545
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:03,768
Ai Gun, you're dizzy? What's wrong?

546
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:05,539
- He's fine.
- Do you have a fever?

547
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,564
You're tired, aren't you?

548
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,260
It's nothing.

549
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,280
You're being a cheat!

550
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,689
I just said I was thirsty.

551
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,649
Can I have some? I'm thirsty. Give me that.

552
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,060
I want some, too.

553
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,272
- I want some, too!
- Let's get some!

554
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:35,320
Are you guys forgetting me?

555
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,590
Right. Sorry.

556
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,960
Here.

557
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,269
There's nothing left!

558
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:51,400
- I'm sorry!
- I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty! It's sweltering!

559
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,070
Go and lift him up.

560
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,509
It's so hot.

561
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,589
- Ouch!
- What's wrong?

562
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:58,970
My back hurts.

563
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,350
I'll buy you some later.

564
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,524
- I can't go on.
- You're okay.

565
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:38,820
Hey. Let's take a break.

566
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,820
When will we get there?

567
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,544
According to the GPS, we're close.

568
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:55,555
Close to halfway.

569
00:47:55,555 --> 00:47:56,739
Damn it.

570
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:58,883
We've walked forever and haven't reached halfway yet.

571
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:01,069
Are we going to make offerings or going on a "journey to the west"?

572
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:02,309
Don't complain.

573
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,940
We're slow because I have to carry you.

574
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:07,200
I know, but I can't go on anymore.

575
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,279
Let me drink something. Please, I'm begging.

576
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:10,634
- No, Ai Pat.
- These are for the offering.

577
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:12,113
Please. I can't carry on.

578
00:48:12,113 --> 00:48:15,320
No, Ai Pat. You can't drink that. It's for the offerings.

579
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,742
Otherwise, there won't be enough for the offerings.

580
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:18,992
Why would we walk all the way here just to let you drink it?

581
00:48:18,993 --> 00:48:22,020
Screw it! I'm thirsty!

582
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,961
- Ai Pat, are you out of your mind?
- Hey, Ai Pat!

583
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:26,419
- Pat.
- I'm thirsty!

584
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:28,169
What the hell are you doing? Stop!

585
00:48:28,169 --> 00:48:31,164
Hey! Ai Pat, you asshole!

586
00:48:31,164 --> 00:48:33,220
Why the fuck would we walk so far up here then?!

587
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,390
Well, I'm thirsty.

588
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,564
And you think we're not?

589
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:38,669
- I'm thirsty, too, you asshole!
- Hey! Hey!

590
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,730
Let's do this.

591
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,343
You guys stay here. I'll go get the drinks.

592
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:45,019
You can't go like this.

593
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:49,129
You don't need to go. He should go so he can stop being so fucking selfish!

594
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,940
Who's selfish? Isn't it you!

595
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,719
When was I being like that?

596
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,399
Since we competed.

597
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,649
You always wanted to rearrange this and that. You messed up our band.

598
00:48:57,649 --> 00:49:00,210
And you didn't make mistakes at all, right? Was I the only one wrong?

599
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,453
Can you even play the drums?!

600
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:03,905
If you're going to blame me, blame that asshole Yo!

601
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:06,699
That jerk! It was all over the place and he made so many mistakes!

602
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:09,810
What mistakes? I was trying to cover up Ai Sound!

603
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,488
You jackass. Why are you saying that?

604
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:14,089
Because you all sucked. That's why I had to carry you all.

605
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:16,428
Why can't you become a world-class musician if you're so great?

606
00:49:16,428 --> 00:49:18,631
Asshole! Don't get smart with me!

607
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:21,048
Why don't you play as great as having a smart mouth, Jerk?

608
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:22,810
So what? You bastard!

609
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,840
- Hey!
- You're friends!

610
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,590
Stop it!

611
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,720
Calm down.

612
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:39,490
- Asshole.
- That's enough.

613
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,740
Both of you.

614
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:46,148
Will anything get better if you fight?

615
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:47,665
You don't get to talk.

616
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:50,543
What do you do every day aside from stopping fights?

617
00:49:50,544 --> 00:49:52,920
We lost because of you.

618
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,959
Right.

619
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,290
It's my fault.

620
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,819
I was the one who made our band lose!

621
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:15,351
It was me! Only me!

622
00:50:15,352 --> 00:50:17,524
Are we done here?

623
00:50:17,524 --> 00:50:19,180
You just realized that, Asshole?

624
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,340
We lost because of you, Ai Gun.

625
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,535
We lost because of you.

626
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:25,031
We lost because of you.

627
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,687
We lost because of you, asshole Gun!

628
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:29,950
Because of you, Bastard!

629
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,032
How could you say that?

630
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,783
- Gun! Don't!
- Hey!

631
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:37,429
Gun, stop.

632
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:40,500
You've always been like this, you dipshit

633
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,284
Ai Gun, that's enough!

634
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:45,780
Enough! I've had it!

635
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,076
It's nobody's fault.

636
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,900
If there's anyone to blame, blame it on me

637
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,400
for dragging you all up here.

638
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,730
Please stop fighting.

639
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,048
You want me to beg? Should I?

640
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:08,970
Should I beg for that? Please, Guys. Please. Please.

641
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,856
How long have we been friends?

642
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,249
Shit.

643
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,845
I'm sorry, Guys.

644
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,524
I started this.

645
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:26,304
Ai Por, I'm sorry.

646
00:51:26,304 --> 00:51:29,612
Ai Yo, I'm sorry.

647
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:33,029
Ai Sound, I'm sorry.

648
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,508
Ai Gun, I'm sorry.

649
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,170
Ai Win, I'm sorry.

650
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:44,529
Ai Por, I'm sorry.

651
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:46,063
Ai Sound,

652
00:51:52,228 --> 00:51:53,861
I'm sorry.

653
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,101
Ai Gun,

654
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:14,820
I'm sorry.

655
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,728
Crying like a baby.

656
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:43,160
We can't even manage to make offerings.

657
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,772
This is so us.

658
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:52,510
It's not just Ai Por who wanted to make offerings.

659
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,484
On that day, I didn't wish for us to win.

660
00:52:55,484 --> 00:53:00,080
I only wished not to have anxiety on stage.

661
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,790
I wished for myself to wake up in time for the competition.

662
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,500
But I didn't get any sleep at all.

663
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,600
Honestly,

664
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,550
I wished that my wrist tendonitis didn't act up.

665
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,344
As for me,

666
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,010
I wished not to be hot-headed like P'Yak and make us lose.

667
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,184
Our wishes came true,

668
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,900
yet we still lost.

669
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:35,368
Damn us.

670
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:44,892
Are you going to let it end like this?

671
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:54,700
Aren't you tired of hearing people say we suck?

672
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,320
We never succeed in anything we do.

673
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,852
All we do is eat barbecue pork.

674
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,770
Your high school lives

675
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,570
are almost over.

676
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:18,009
Don't you want to succeed in anything for once?

677
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,900
I...

678
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,870
will continue going upward to make the offering.

679
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,199
Who's coming with me?

680
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,689
I will.

681
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,250
Me, too.

682
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,644
- Me as well.
- I'm going.

683
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,943
Me, too.

684
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,250
That's it.

685
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,329
Love each other a lot.

686
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,770
You guys are in the same band.

687
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,748
I love you guys.

688
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:45,790
I love you guys.

689
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:50,664
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

690
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:52,426
That's all we need.

691
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,500
That's all it took.

692
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,950
No more of that.

693
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:17,008
Guys, your drink is here.

694
00:55:17,008 --> 00:55:19,510
- I want one.
- Please give me one.

695
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,030
Water please!

696
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,050
So refreshing.

697
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,020
Come on. Let's go.

698
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,330
Let's go. All set.

699
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,110
All done.

700
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,976
Do you have to make any offerings?

701
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,208
I must be the one to ask you.

702
00:56:31,616 --> 00:56:34,760
I wished for whatever

703
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,650
you wished for to come true.

704
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:42,012
Right.

705
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:45,410
You haven't told us what you wished for.

706
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,556
That's right.

707
00:56:57,444 --> 00:56:59,320
You know what?

708
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,140
I was so scared

709
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,410
to be the club head.

710
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:10,639
We joined it together.

711
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,879
We played music together.

712
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,364
We were punished together.

713
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:22,656
And one day, I had to lead you guys.

714
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:30,983
I was afraid I would lead our band to failure.

715
00:57:30,984 --> 00:57:35,420
I was afraid our club would get terminated because of me.

716
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,200
But my biggest fear

717
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,490
was that I would make you disappointed.

718
00:57:52,912 --> 00:57:57,800
On that day, I didn't wish for us to win Hot Wave.

719
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,370
I wished for you guys

720
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,530
to not regret being in this club.

721
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,340
Gosh!

722
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,710
Then go ahead and make your offering for your wish.

723
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,012
We've come this far

724
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,544
because of you.

725
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,580
Come on.

726
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,120

- Yes?

731
00:58:58,123 --> 00:58:59,309
What are you doing?

732
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:00,779
Are you sneaking peaks at Korean celebrities?

733
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,110
Are you out of your mind?

734
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,888
Have you seen this?

735
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,040
Tinn went to help his friend sing at his upperclassman's bar.

736
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,629
The video is on the bar's page. Lots of people shared it.

737
00:59:13,629 --> 00:59:16,476
Are you sure?

738
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:18,180
Tinn is singing?

739
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,140
Can you believe it?

740
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,130
After that day,

741
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:32,552
Tinn had always refused to go up on stage.

742
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,103
Whenever he felt hesitant,

743
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:39,472
he let me decide for him.

744
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:41,319
Hold on.

745
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,412
Is he the singer you told me Tinn has been close to?

746
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:48,605
Yes.

747
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,696
You've been having a hard time sleeping

748
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,430
because of this, right?

749
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,253
Yes.

750
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:15,100
Our son used to cry on stage whenever he got on stage.

751
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,359
But look at him now.

752
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,548
He's happy.

753
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:22,636
Shouldn't we be happy, too?

754
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:37,772
What if this world is so cruel to our son?

755
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:56,384
If this world is cruel to our son,

756
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,236
we should be his peace of mind

757
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,820
when he comes home, shouldn't we?

758
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:21,649
Five, four, three, two, one.

759
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,950
Surprise!

760
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:31,316
We're paying back for the last time we let you eat alone.

761
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,980
Thank you, Guys.

762
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,900
When did you prepare this?

763
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,124
I was with you guys the whole time.

764
01:01:38,124 --> 01:01:40,252
We're superhuman.

765
01:01:40,252 --> 01:01:43,350
Seriously, when did you guys find time to do this?

766
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:45,236
I prepared this.

767
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:51,904
How did you get here?

768
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:56,390
I saw you were quite upset.

769
01:01:56,390 --> 01:02:00,068
I want to do whatever makes you feel better.

770
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,492
Did I miss something? What is happening?

771
01:02:07,492 --> 01:02:08,950
What did you miss? It's nothing.

772
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,159
Just hurry up and shove it in your mouth!

773
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,620
Let's save our energy for prom night tomorrow.

774
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,008
What did you two talk about? I want to know, too.

775
01:02:14,009 --> 01:02:15,240
Think about prom night.

776
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,879
Save your energy for prom night.

777
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,019
- Eat, eat, eat.
- What are we waiting for?

778
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:20,668
Let's eat!

779
01:02:20,668 --> 01:02:21,970
Save your energy for prom night.

780
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,368
Put that in too.

781
01:02:24,368 --> 01:02:25,843
I noticed you're sitting far from the grill.

782
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:28,493
I was afraid you couldn't reach it.

783
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,332
Thank you.

784
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:39,830
It's so good.

785
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:42,643
- Do you want more?
- Just eat. I'm good.

786
01:02:42,643 --> 01:02:44,844
- I want some water.
- Wait!

787
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,868
Your leg hurts. Let me do it.

788
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,670
Here.

789
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:06,482
Did you forget something?

790
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,520
My leg hurts, not my arm.

791
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,964
Let's eat.

792
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:21,664
Anything else you want? Let me get it for you.

793
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,940
Sure, here.

794
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:35,165
Ai Gun.

795
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,628
Eat a bit.

796
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:43,520
Are you worried about singing at prom night?

797
01:03:45,544 --> 01:03:48,640
Leave that for later.

798
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,412
Eat for now.

799
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:52,988
Eat the pork too. It is so good.

800
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,143
Okay?

801
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,368
I want to eat veggies.

802
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:03,076
[Incoming Call - Yak]

803
01:04:03,076 --> 01:04:04,660
Hey.

804
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,829
P'Yak is calling.

805
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:07,459
What?

806
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,819
- Seriously?
- Is he maybe hiding around here?

807
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:11,240
What?

808
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,941
No, he's not.

809
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,695
Hello, P'Yak.

810
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:17,335
How are you guys?

811
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:18,792
Are you guys feeling better?

812
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:20,770
I'm worried.

813
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:23,870
Thank you.

814
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:27,848
I didn't know you could be cute and kind.

815
01:04:27,848 --> 01:04:29,219
Of course, not.

816
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,917
I just called to brag to you losers about something.

817
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:33,589
Listen carefully.

818
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:37,960
My band just won the freshmen music contest.

819
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,839
More importantly, we beat our Hot Wave rival.

820
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,740
How satisfying!

821
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,300
Okay. Okay.

822
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,975
If you're done bragging,

823
01:04:48,976 --> 01:04:50,279
I'm going to hang up.

824
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,980
Hey, hold on.

825
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:54,769
Listen first. I'm not done yet.

826
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:58,304
I just want you to know that we got back to playing music

827
01:04:58,305 --> 01:05:00,799
because we heard this one song.

828
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,351
I'll send it to you.

829
01:05:03,352 --> 01:05:05,663
It might help you too, like it did to me.

830
01:05:05,664 --> 01:05:07,297
Okay?

831
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,543
What?

832
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,230
- What?
- Huh, what song?
