... about phasing out clubs. Can you please handle it for me, Tinn?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,160
I haven't saved his ass for not even five minutes,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,680
and now I have to terminate his club myself.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,999
Just turn this crisis into an opportunity. Use your power as the student president to make it happen for him.

5
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:11,620
I heard your instruments were taken.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,610
I might be able to help.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,680
I thought singing for two hours was brutal.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,080
But they've been performing for four hours.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,899
Your beloved won't survive this.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,589
What ulterior motive do you have for helping us?

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,749
I... am going to make you win the Hot Wave Award.

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,983
I promise.

13
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,459
After your strong dedication,

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,890
congratulations to Chinzhilla Band

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,780
for winning the Hot Wave Music Awards 2022.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,979
Mr. Student President,

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,970
instead of rehearsing how to give him an award, why don't you find a way to help him?

18
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,580
If he loses,

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,619
you won't be able to date him, according to the club rules.

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,139
What can I do?

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,319
I can't play music.

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,440
All I do is listen to his music a thousand times over.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,600
And in those thousand times,

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,990
did you find any weaknesses?

25
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,449
I only found cuteness.
(T/N: Weakness and cuteness sounds almost the same in Thai)

26
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,440
What the hell kind of person is so damn cute?

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,013
When I listen to his music, I see his face popping into my mind.

28
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:10,940
Even now, I'm seeing him standing there, looking so cute.

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,820
Who are you talking about?

30
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,080
When did he get here?

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,713
A while ago.

32
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,440
I'd like to discuss something.

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,080
You... told me that you'll help me, right?

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,799
Yes. Don't you believe me?

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,819
No matter how hard it is, you will help?

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,099
Yes.

37
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,139
I, Ai Tiw, and everyone in the council are willing to help you.

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,599
Good.

39
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,449
I've got the Hot Wave application form.

40
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,439
The problem is that a teacher needs to sign it off.

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,620
The teacher wouldn't agree to sign it for me.

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,359
What? Which teacher? What's their name?

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,900
I'll go and deal with it for you right now.

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,629
How can I sign it?

45
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,920
Our school has a rule that states those who want to participate in extracurricular activities

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,319
must be well-behaved students.

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,099
How are they not well-behaved students, Mom?

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,580
Well,

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,120
they may not be great, but they're trying to improve.

50
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,380
Oh, they are the students from the Music Club.

51
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,230

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,079
What are you guys up to?

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,850
No, Ma'am.

00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:30,813
Don't scold him. You know that Ai Gun isn't good at mathematics.

165
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,775
Have you ever seen him doing the account books for his mom's shop?

166
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:37,199
Enough, Ai Por! You're adding insult to injury.

167
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,380
Let's do this. I'll tutor the rest of you.

168
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,736
As for you, Ai Gun, you must have a private session with Ai Tinn at his safe house for a week.

169
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:47,204
Fine.

170
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:48,776
What safe house?

171
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:52,950
The place where you hide out to study before exams.

172
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,409
Ow! Oh... t-that's right. Right.

173
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,760
Excuse me for a moment.

174
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,713
Where the hell is this safe house?

175
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,489
I know you don't have one.

176
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,648
It's my sibling's place. He isn't there now.

177
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,891
I'll let you use it. Unless you want to take him to your house.

178
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:14,316
Are you crazy? If my mom knows I'm helping him, she'll be furious.

179
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:18,280
Right? It's the only way to help him.

180
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:22,071
Isn't it like I'm taking advantage of him?

181
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:25,825
I let you use it for tutoring him, not to score him.

182
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:32,549
Hey. I told my mom.

183
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,880
When should we start?

184
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,799
Just go tomorrow. Pack your stuff and go to his place.

185
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,233
Okay.

186
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,375
Now the only thing that's left is for you to get your mom's permission.

187
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,084
It shouldn't be that hard.

188
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,873
I don't know.

189
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:49,060
I never asked her permission to spend the night at anyone's house.

190
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,693
What?

191
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,513
Don't be shocked, Tinn.

192
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:08,411
I'm just your imagination.

193
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:14,117
Whether I get to go to Hot Wave depends on you.

194
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,667
Mom, Ai Tiw asked me to stay over at his place to study together.

195
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,080
How many days, Dear?

196
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,830
Just a week.

197
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,220
A whole week?

198
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,719
Let's forget about it.

199
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,297
We don't want to bother his parents.

200
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,017
Mom.

201
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:53,349
Well, Ai Tiw wants me to tutor him.

202
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:57,569
That's good. I think we should let Tiw stay over at our place instead. How about it?

203
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:00,651
Yes. I think that's good.

204
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,184
Don't you want to spend nights with me,

205
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,900
Tinn?

206
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,259
Mom, we can't study here

207
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,830
because the neighbor turns on really loud music.

208
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,457
I... can't concentrate on studying.

209
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:25,311
- Okay. Then I will make a report on them.
- Yes, we'll deal with it.

210
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,752
Yes. They must learn their lesson.

211
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,880
I'll handle it for you.

212
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,414
Screw it!

213
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,650
If your mom is this difficult,

214
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,930
I give up. Bye!

215
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,861
But I think we should let Tinn go.

216
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,185
So the atmosphere is different.

217
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,080
I mean, for us.

218
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,641
Honey!

219
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,498
Please, Mom?

220
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,690
- Fine.
- Really?

221
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,448
But... you must call and update me every night. Do you understand?

222
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:09,078
Sure. Thank you, Mom.

223
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,099
Hey, now. You must thank this person here.

224
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:15,014
Thank you, Dad.

225
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:17,580
Do you want a sister or a brother?

226
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,330
- Gosh, Dad.
- Honey!

227
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,010
It's for a whole week!

228
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,567
Should we make a basketball team?

229
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,063
It's so nice.

230
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,321
Damn. This is luxurious.

231
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,461
Oh, my bad.

232
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,062
I haven't been here for so long.

233
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,640
Make yourself at home.

234
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,980
Where's the bathroom?

235
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,096
Bathroom?

236
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,439
I need to pee.

237
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,067
That way… maybe?

238
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,616
Just go look around.

239
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:07,425
Yeah, you clearly haven't been here for so long.

240
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,114
Ai Gun's studying mode...

241
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:39,169
How cute!

242
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,597
Damn, my heart hurts.

243
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,945
Done.

244
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,695
Can you check it?

245
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:00,340
He strangely finished fast.

246
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,340
Shit.

247
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,510
What a nerd. Where did you get it?

248
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,382
Don't act like you don't have your own pencil case.

249
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:15,439
Gosh. We don't use a pencil case in this generation.

250
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,640
We just borrow from friends.

251
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,082
This is why I'm not surprised you only got two points.

252
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,854
So, now you know what I'm like.

253
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,953
We can take a break now, right?

254
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:39,021
- I'm tired.
- Break?

255
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,310
Yes.

256
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,596
You got 2 points out of 20, and you're still going to take a break?

257
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:46,914
We haven't been studying for even two hours.

258
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:54,711
You know what? Those were the longest two hours of my life.

259
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:57,349
Let's take a break.

260
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:59,850
My head is about to explode.

261
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:10,700
When you tutor Ai Gun, you can't go soft on him.

262
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,080
No! There are many subjects left to study. Look.

263
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,757
Come on. I can't take it anymore.

264
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:19,640
Even half an hour is okay. Please?

265
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,722
Please, Mr. Student President.

266
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:24,392
Please, Mr. Student President?

267
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:30,010
Please... Please... Please?

268
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,649
Hey! I told you to stand your ground.

269
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:38,688
You're a devil who must push him to get to Hot Wave.

270
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,089
Shut it!

271
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,571
If you can't finish it today, there's no eating.

272
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,208
I just want to be his lover.

273
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,261
Why is it that the harder I try, the more he hates me?

274
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:00,899
You're doing the right thing. Someone like Ai Gun needs hard pressure.

275
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,836
And the perfect person to do that is you.

276
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:06,637
Keep that in mind.

277
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,339
You take the bed.

278
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,490
I'll sleep on the floor.

279
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,233
No way. It's your room.

280
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,188
I can sleep on the floor.

281
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,830
You sleep on the bed.

282
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,900
No, it's fine.

283
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,871
I'll sleep on the floor there.

284
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,946
If you sleep on the floor, you won't get a good night's sleep.

285
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,718
If you don't get a good night's sleep, you can't concentrate.

286
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:58,889
If you can't concentrate, you won't be able to study.

287
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,836
If you can't study, you can't pass the exams.

288
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:03,582
If you don't pass, you won't get to compete in Hot Wave.

289
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,731
Fine. That's enough.

290
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,457
I'll take the bed then.

291
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:11,505
You're so dramatic.

292
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,655
Okay.

293
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,913
Hey.

294
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,661
Have you paired up with anyone?

295
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:46,995
What?

296
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,830
Not yet.

297
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,045
Why do you ask?

298
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,134
I have not either.

299
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:00,540
Should we pair up?

300
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,437
Didn't you say, "Only after Hot Wave"?

301
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,004
What does Hot Wave have to do with anything?

302
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:17,359
I meant the ballroom dancing mid-term test.

303
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,610
The test is in pairs.

304
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,964
Sure, that's great.

305
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,084
We'll be spending nights together after all.

306
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,325
Can you dance?

307
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:34,170
You're clearly insulting me.

308
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,291
All right, get up.

309
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,268
You simply have no idea.

310
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,942
One, two, three.

311
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:33,847
What's wrong?

312
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,419
It's nothing.

313
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,491
I'm sleepy.

314
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:55,499
I'm going to sleep.

315
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,333
Goodnight.

316
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:53,970
I've got some documents for you to sign.

317
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,719
Sorry to interrupt.

318
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,759
- Please continue.
- Ja! This isn't—

319
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,854
Hey, Ja.

320
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,938
Forget about it.

321
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:06,877
Leave her.

322
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:09,279
Do you see what I mean?

323
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,953
I can dance with you just fine.

324
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:15,479
But when I danced with Ai Gun, I couldn't even move my feet.

325
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,140
In short,

326
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,433
it's because I'm not as cute as Ai Gun.

327
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:20,939
No wonder.

328
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,220
When I danced with him, my heart didn't stop pounding.

329
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,999
If it goes on like this, I won't be able to dance.

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,219
And Ai Gun will fail the test.

331
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,210
He won't make it to Hot Wave.

332
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,890
And we can't be lovers.

333
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,741
Hey! Come to your senses.

334
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:40,609
Come to your senses, Dude.

335
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,186
It's not strange that you're shy.

336
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,227
You two have barely spoken since you met each other.

337
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:48,653
Now that you two are spending time together, find a chance to flirt with him more.

338
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:50,376
You won't be as nervous.

339
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:52,690
Flirt? I don't know how.

340
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:54,787
Go and watch those romantic dramas.

341
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,400
You'll learn how to do it.

342
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,266
I don't usually watch this kind of series.

343
00:22:58,267 --> 00:22:59,879
Have you seen the series "Bad Buddy"?

344
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,930
I'm so into it right now.

345
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:06,400
Ohm and Nanon, right?

346
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,604
No.

347
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,505
There's one actor with curly hair.

348
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,632
I think his name is Mark Pakin. Check it out.

349
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:13,399
Sure. Okay, fine.

350
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,096
Thank you, man.

351
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:16,553
Bye.

352
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:17,987
See you.

353
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,851
Now, why don't you try doing this question here.

354
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,054
There's still more left?

355
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,820
Fine. I'll do it.

356
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,620
I'm putting on some music.

357
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:35,225
Now that you two are spending time together, find a chance to flirt with him more.

358
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,212
You won't be as nervous.

359
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,451
What are you listening to?

360
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:48,484
Can I listen to it, too?

361
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,277
It's the song "Close"

362
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,993
by Scrubb.

363
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,177
You… brought a speaker?

364
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:09,417
Yes. I saved up for so long to buy it.

365
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:21,008
A ballroom dance song?

366
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,860
The speaker has a nice sound, doesn't it?

367
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,454
Of course.

368
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,764
It's 9 correct out of 20, which is considered better.

369
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:50,150
Next is Chemistry. Did you print out the notes I sent you?

370
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,420
Hold on a moment.

371
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,087
I forgot. Can I borrow your printer?

372
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,322
You ran out of ink.

373
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,648
There, there. Don't be sad.

374
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:20,540
I'll refill it for you.

375
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,334
Now we'll give it a test.

376
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,429
When did you take my photo?

377
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,729
No matter when,

378
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,448
you're always in my sight.

379
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,379
But that's fine. Anyone can refill the ink with this model.

380
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,231
Even my mom can do it.

381
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,284
See. Look.

382
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,854
You do this.

383
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,974
Done.

384
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,660
Then... I'll test it for you.

385
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,279
Oh, there's no need.

386
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,256
It works on any phone's operating system.

387
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:04,890
I'll print it out for you.

388
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,482
- Hey!
- Huh?

389
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:10,082
What is it?

390
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,168
Oops!

391
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:18,194
How is it your picture?

392
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:20,079
Sorry!

393
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,940
My finger accidentally tapped this picture.

394
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:30,915
There, there. Let me print out the chemistry notes.

395
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,399
Oh, Director, isn't Nong Tinn going home with you today?

396
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,912
He went to spend the night with his friend to study.

397
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:45,107
Ah, he's a real hardworking student.

398
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:47,669
- I will excuse myself then.
- Sure.

399
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,275
Goodbye.

400
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Honey! What are you doing here?

401
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,157
I came to pick you up.

402
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:17,439
Someone here might miss her son so much that she wouldn't go home.

403
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,434
No, I wouldn't.

404
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,437
Then who were you calling just now?

405
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,529
I was just worried about him, Honey.

406
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,949
Our son has never spent the night anywhere else.

407
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:42,048
Just like you, who has never driven home alone, right?

408
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:44,816
Honey, Ai Tinn has grown up.

409
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:48,310
He can take care of himself. Don't worry.

410
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,425
What should we eat, Dear?

411
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:02,642
You can't!

412
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:06,197
Are you really going to eat instant noodles every day?

413
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:09,891
I'm afraid you would waste the time to study.

414
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,620
I can call and order something in then.

415
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,370
It's fine. I bought fresh ingredients already.

416
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,499
If you want it done quickly, chop this for me. Come on.

417
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,258
I'll wash the vegetables.

418
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,179
Oh, no. I don't know how to chop vegetables.

419
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,051
What should I do? It's so difficult.

420
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:38,160
You're such a nuisance.

421
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,217
If you're looking at me this much, you'll cut your finger. You cutie.

422
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:47,570
Oh, no. I don't know how to chop vegetables.

423
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,700
Why is it so difficult? Gosh.

424
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,780
Move over! I can't rely on you for shit.

425
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,064
Chopping vegetables is so easy. What a young master.

426
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:01,261
Why the hell are you standing there like that?

427
00:29:01,262 --> 00:29:03,362
Get out of my way.

428
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,890
Aren't you going yet?

429
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,168
You're in the way.

430
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,333
These are basic dishes, so we don't waste time to study.

431
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,901
Go ahead and eat.

432
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,090
You can cook this well?

433
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:27,804
This is very ordinary, Nong.

434
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:31,570
I'm the son of a dessert shop owner.

435
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:34,399
I have to have some kind of talent.

436
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,093
My mom is a teacher, yet I can't teach you well.

437
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:41,407
Do you know what you take after her?

438
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:43,368
Strictness.

439
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,367
Just eat.

440
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,401
Ai Gun.

441
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,083
What is it?

442
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:13,060
It's nothing.

443
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,283
Ai Tinn.

444
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:37,297
Would anyone know that the Student President eats so messily?

445
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,090
Do your best, Guys.
[The mid-term exams]

446
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,619
Give it all you've got!

447
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,031
For Hot Wave!

448
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,354
For the club!

449
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:07,507
For P'Yak!

450
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:08,862
For all the BBQ pork we've eaten!

451
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:10,616
Three and four!

452
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:14,770
Chin-zhil-la!

453
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,568
Let's go!

454
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:19,737
Wait...

455
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:22,731
Pen. I forgot a pen.

456
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,627
Take my pencil case.

457
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,728
I know you'd love to steal it.

458
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,750
Get in there already.

459
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,663
So easy.

460
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,795
Get in there already.

461
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:19,339
Remember. I taught you everything on the exam.

462
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:30,145
[A]

463
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:35,658
Keep fighting.

464
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:50,934
Hey Ai Tiw, the questions you let us work on,

465
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,709
were on the exam exactly the way you taught us.

466
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,496
When I asked for more jotting paper, Mr. Decha was stunned.

467
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:58,640
Sure, right.

468
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:01,890
We must give all the credit to him, Mr. Tiwson.

469
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:03,439
One, two, three.

470
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,939
Thank you, Father.

471
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,090
So this is the feeling when a dad knows his kid passes the exam.

472
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,480
Damn.

473
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,330
Easy, man.

474
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,760
Easy, Dad.

475
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:18,530
Hold on. Don't celebrate yet.

476
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,870
The last boss is still in there.

477
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,237
He's taking so long.

478
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,854
Here he comes.

479
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,077
So was he able to do it?

480
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,479
Was it all right? Why did you take so long?

481
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,682
I finished super quickly, so I reviewed it just to make sure.

482
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,740
That's my boss.

483
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,334
Yeah!

484
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:30,847
Yo, why are you standing over there?

485
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:36,212
I guess the written exams should be okay.

486
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:41,320
It is now down to you whether you can dance with him or not.

487
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,320
There are only two subjects left.

488
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,825
Can we chill out before studying?

489
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,248
I was just asking.

490
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,762
I knew you wouldn't allow that.

491
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:14,945
Sure. Let's do that.

492
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,714
Are you serious?

493
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,464
What do you want to do?

494
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,800
Why don't you join me?

495
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,022
When I was a kid,

496
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:40,400
my dream was

497
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,490
to have a private pool at home.

498
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,357
I asked my mom to take me to a water park every week.

499
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:54,371
It is now down to you whether you can dance with him or not.

500
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,400
What are you thinking about?

501
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,437
Are you happy you won't have to tutor me anymore?

502
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,903
And you?

503
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:15,278
Are you happy?

504
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,249
Very much so.

505
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,134
From now on, I can dedicate all my time to Hot Wave.

506
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,668
Why did you want to join the Music Club?

507
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:34,767
Nosy.

508
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,661
Just kidding.

509
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,740
Why do you want to know?

510
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,310
Well,

511
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,534
I should know everything.

512
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,222
You know what our school is like.

513
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,777
Wayward students like us...

514
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,450
If we're not famous or an athlete,

515
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:12,865
no one would want to befriend us.

516
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:16,430
The Music Club

517
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,840
is my only safe zone.

518
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,313
What about you?

519
00:37:24,313 --> 00:37:26,490
Why did you join the student council?

520
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,928
Did your mom force you?

521
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,130
Well...

522
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,940
I'm not good at playing music.

523
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,096
My athletic skills are just okay.

524
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:51,819
So I thought it would suit me better if I was a backup, helping people get to their dreams.

525
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,014
Wow, smooth answer.

526
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:01,188
Have you used that line to flirt with anyone?

527
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,998
You.

528
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,496
Do you want to rehearse the dance? Let's rehearse.

529
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,222
Right here?

530
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,170
There's no music.

531
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,820
Yes.

532
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,553
Right here.

533
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:36,222
I'm…

534
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,622
still curious about something.

535
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,950
Let's do it.

536
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:47,257
Where?

537
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:48,790
Right here?

538
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,993
Yes.

539
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,541
What's wrong?

540
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,360
The pool is closed.

541
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,808
Gosh, Phi.

542
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:58,162
The mood was interrupted.

543
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,010
Let's get back to your room.

544
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,457
I'm cold now.

545
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:02,790
Come on.

546
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,619
Hey.

547
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:13,493
Sleep on the bed with me. It's our last night.

548
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,667
I told you I always toss and turn. It's fine.

549
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:22,097
That's not true. Your sheet isn't as messy as mine in the morning.

550
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:25,159
Come on. Before I change my mind.

551
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,193
Sleep.

552
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:43,861
Hey.

553
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,163
What?

554
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,842
Can I ask you something?

555
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,677
But you can't ask why.

556
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:54,410
What is it?

557
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,660
Can I look into your eyes?

558
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,160
Why?

559
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,328
I just told you not to ask.

560
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,913
Like this?

561
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:00,270
I'm…

562
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm drowsy.

563
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,650
I'm going to sleep.

564
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,876
So have you still not figured out if you're still shy toward him?

565
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,148
The next pair, please.

566
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,937
Tinn.

567
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:34,204
It's our turn. Come on.

568
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,140
My legs hurt.

569
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,131
You can dance with Ai Tiw.

570
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,981
What do you mean, your legs hurt?

571
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,900
Come on. Quickly.

572
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,640
Hurry up.

573
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:55,968
Go on, Tinnapob. Show your friends that the top student can move.

574
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,075
But when I danced with Ai Gun, I couldn't even move my feet.

575
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:11,904
If it goes on like this, I won't be able to dance.

576
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:15,529
Ai Gun will fail the test. He won't make it to Hot Wave.

577
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,615
Ai Gun will fail the test. He won't make it to Hot Wave.

578
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:23,655
Ai Gun will fail the test. He won't make it to Hot Wave.

579
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,157
He won't make it to Hot Wave.

580
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:32,890
Take it easy

581
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,840
and close your eyes.

582
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,053

Good job!

627
00:48:48,787 --> 00:48:50,949
Go get an A!

628
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:56,520
A moment ago, I imagined you two dancing at a ball wearing tuxedos.

629
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,259
I'm having chills. Awesome job!

630
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:01,045
Give them a big hand.

631
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:04,485
See? I told you.

632
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,019
You can do it.

633
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:09,216
You did great.

634
00:49:11,913 --> 00:49:14,929
This is unbelievable, Director.

635
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:19,882
We passed all the subjects on the mid-term exam.

636
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:24,755
That means…

637
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:27,310
Here you go, Ma'am.

638
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,140
[Permission to perform at Hot Wave Music Contest]

639
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,760
Thank you, Ma'am.

640
00:49:47,224 --> 00:49:50,190
Hot Wave, we're coming.

641
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:55,909
- Let's celebrate with barbecue pork!
- Yes!

642
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,460
Barbecue pork! Barbecue pork! Barbecue pork!

643
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,640
You guys go ahead.

644
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,980
You better come and pay for it! We'll finish everything.

645
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,821
Congratulations.

646
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,427
Oh, I got something for you.

647
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,050
Here.

648
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:39,463
Keep it,

649
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:42,524
since you already messed it up.

650
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,430
Thank you. For this...

651
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:50,971
And…

652
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,953
for tutoring me.

653
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,494
Let's go, Tinn.

654
00:51:07,413 --> 00:51:09,419
I'll take my leave now.

655
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,524
Can I look into your eyes?

656
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,509
I'm drowsy.

657
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:33,150
I'm going to sleep.

[Next Episode]
I listened to all of our previous songs.

660
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,382
They were all terrible.

661
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:20,540
It's time we find a new member.

662
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,574
Hi.

663
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:24,320
I'm Sound.

664
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,474
We haven't seen each other for some time.

665
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,798
I heard you're the student president now.

666
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:29,058
Hey look, a guitarist with over 1 million views for each song.

667
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:30,692
Ask him to join our band.

668
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:32,379
I will take you guys to Hot Wave.

669
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,609
If you're still the band leader,

670
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,821
you guys will never make it to Hot Wave.

671
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:38,408
Well, Ai Sound is indeed a better leader than I am.

672
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,380
Then let me... quit the band.

673
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,649
This is your freaking golden chance, man!

674
00:52:42,649 --> 00:52:44,552
You can pursue him all you want now.

675
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:46,403
He's allowed to date.

676
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,070
♫ I long for your words, whispering those sweet words ♫

677
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:55,650
♫ If you only knew when I first saw you ♫

678
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:02,980
♫ You’re all I dreamed of, my heart skips
a beat when you’re near ♫

679
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:11,370
♫ When you’re by my side, when you look into my eyes ♫

680
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:14,990
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

681
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,000
♫ To hear my love ♫

682
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,430
♫ In your heart, if there’s no one, can I be that person? ♫

683
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,020
♫ A little closer, please come a bit closer ♫

684
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:35,740
♫ To hear my love ♫

685
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:43,380
♫ Love me, would you love me, I wonder ♫

686
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,600
♫ Please tell me ♫

687
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:05,040
