I was so scared to be the club head.

[What are these kids playing, Director?]

336
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:15,390
[This can make Tinn look bad.]

337
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,520
[He looks like Tinn, but I hope it's not him.]

338

340
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,772
Hello.

341
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,247
Have you seen it, Honey?

342
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,716
I have.

343
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:39,276
All my peers are whining about it.

344
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:42,956
How are you holding up?

345
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:51,130
Honey, why aren't other people as

346
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,350
kind as the characters in the series we watched?

347
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,160
We can't force people, Honey.

348
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,468
It's down to us whether we're as kind to our son as those in the series.

349
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:24,612
Hey.

350
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:30,084
I'm not changing my mind.

351
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,910
I'm just here to collect my stuff.

352
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:38,399
It's true.

353
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,550
Tinn really helped that club in secret,

354
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,900
but it was only in the beginning.

355
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,336
Other than that, we must give the club members credit for their work.

356
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:51,288
They almost brought glory to our school.

357
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:57,228
Seriously, Kajorn.

358
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,820
If it's not the music club that you dislike,

359
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,320
if it's some other club,

360
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,540
would you be this mad?

361
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,528
Don't try to defend your friend.

362
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,360
Okay.

363
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,632
It's fine if you don't believe me.

364
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,340
Then ask yourself this.

365
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,148
If Ai Tinn was really biased all those times,

366
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,748
would he have been able to fool you up until today?

367
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:55,729
You know?

368
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,990
Netizens are arguing whether it's GunTinn or TinnGun.

369
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,144
What's the difference?

370
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,959
Hey, that's a no.

371
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,415
It must be GunTinn, all right.

372
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,049
Oh?

373
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,959
What are you laughing at?

374
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,220
It's nothing.

375
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,590
I'm just thinking that maybe

376
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,680
we were too afraid.

377
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,400
The feedback is actually great.

378
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
Do you think

379
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,660
I should tell my mom?

380
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:41,040
You can try.

381
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,644
It might not be as bad as you think.

382
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,369
Damn. They're giving me goosebumps.

383
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:54,060
At first, when I saw him in the Music Club, I didn't think he was queer

384
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,679
because he seemed like a rockstar on the surface.

385
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,709
No wonder he always came to me for advice.

386
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,712
Crap! He sends shivers down my spine.

387
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:03,500
Mine too.

388
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,700
Are you here to use the bathroom?

389
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:19,780

394
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,980
It's okay.

395
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,961
Easy, there. Easy.

396
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:16,772
I'm right next to you.

397
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,903
You have me.

398
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,008
It's okay.

399
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:26,628
Come here.

400
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,935
Don't listen to him. I won't let that jerk off!

401
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,863
Gun,

402
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,304
I'm sorry.

403
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,431
I was just joking around, chit-chatting with my friend.

404
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,090
I didn't mean to insult you.

405
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,399
Okay, let me make a confession.

406
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,450
I was a bit shocked.

407
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,288
You're a rockstar, so I thought you were manly.

408
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:05,689
Hey!

409
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,976
Hey, hey.

410
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:11,059
Hear me out first. I understand you guys.

411
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:13,379
Gay and queer series are popular these days.

412
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,795
You guys are at an exploring and learning age. Take it easy, all right.

413
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:19,910
I've never prohibited you guys from anything.

414
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,330
You can be a homo rockstar and play Gay-rock music all you want.

415
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,285
What the hell kind of teacher are you? Huh?

416
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,551
It's because I'm concerned.

417
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,480
As your teacher, I'm truly concerned.

418
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,979
Before you do anything, you should at least think about your parents.

419
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,109
Especially you, Tinnapob.

420
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,620
Don't you know that your future is so bright?

421
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,797
Do you realize your mother is this school's director

422
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:43,460
who is at the peak of her career?

423
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,309
Don't you know how much she's struggled to get here?

424
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,744
Don't let it be ruined because of these things.

425
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:51,370
It took everything to build, but if it's destroyed one day...

426
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,980
You!

427
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,450
What's the situation?

428
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,895
Decha reported this to Ai Tinn's mom.

429
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:24,268
He wants her to punish Ai Kajorn.

430
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:26,212
He wants payback, I guess.

431
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,815
What a fucking coward.

432
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:31,416
I can't believe I used to respect him.

433
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,775
Have they been in there a long time?

434
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,309
Yes, a while now.

435
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:43,796
That's basically what happened, Director.

436
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:47,328
I was just chit-chatting with my friend.

437
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,384
What about you three?

438
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:57,428
Is there anything you want to explain further?

439
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,470
That's how it went.

440
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,880
Except for the fact that if Kajorn hadn't done it, I would have.

441
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,520
I hope you give a fair judgment on this case.

442
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:20,712
Kajorn wasn't wrong. He did it to help me.

443
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:24,320
If you're going to give punishment, please discipline me.

444
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,535
That cannot be.

445
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,736
Whoever did wrong must take responsibility.

446
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,676
Kajorn,

447
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,860
you'll be on probation for now.

448
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,430
If something like this happens again,

449
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,805
let me know immediately.

450
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:53,704
Don't use violence to solve problems. Do you understand?

451
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,831
Thank you.

452
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:01,119
Hey! That's it?

453
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,929
He punched me in the face!

454
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,370
He should be expelled for that.

455
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,760
If you're not satisfied with my judgment,

456
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,439
you may write a complaint.

457
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,040
But don't forget to add every detail truthfully.

458
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,476
So that's how it is.

459
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,607
Because you raised your son this way,

460
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:25,439
that's why his character is like this.

461
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,028
Just like you.
(T/N: He used an informal pronoun of "you" which is very rude)

462
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:29,439
Speak nicely to my mother.

463
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,219
- I'll say it like this! What are you going to do?
- Stop.

464
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,054
- What are you going to do?
- Let go!

465
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:35,172
Let go of my son!

466
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,820
As the director,

467
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,370
all I can do is submit a report regarding your behavior to the school board.

468
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,479
But as a mom,

469
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,679
my son can like whoever he likes.

470
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,800
Stay out of it!

471
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,756
If I hear anything filthy from you again,

472
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:56,260
your penalty will go far beyond this.

473
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,615
I'm sorry, Mom,

474
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:28,166
for not telling you anything.

It's okay, Dear.

476
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,380
I was the reason you were so afraid to tell.

477

I'm sorry.

478
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,992
Both of you.

479
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,309
I'm sorry.

480
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,580
I love you.

481
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,636
Excuse me.

482
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:06,055
I didn't want to interrupt, but…

483
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:08,306
the prom is about to start.

484
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,416

485
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Excuse me.

00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,340
Oh, Kajorn.

You're a council member. Won't you go keep things in check?

Of course, Phi.

Please excuse me.

668
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,732
Then sign mine.

669
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,739
What should I write down?

670
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:16,699
I can't think of anything.

671
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:19,424
Just write whatever.

672
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:24,200
Then I'll write down what I feel that I'm too afraid to say.

- Have you waited for long?

How about a drink? Come inside first.

Wow.

When he can't write, he cooks.

- Was there something?
- Oh, yes.

910
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:03,860
My mom wanted me to give steamed bread and Thai custard dip to you, Director.

911
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,090
Oh, yes, thank you.

912

I've seen this kind of guitar on the internet.

Hey! Since you got the new guitar,

01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,819
how about you play for him?

940
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,560
Are you sure? What song should I play?

941
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,920
How about the song that you called and asked me to help write?

942
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,580
That one.

943

- It's a different song.
