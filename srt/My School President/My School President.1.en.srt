This isn't the first time your club has caused us trouble.

80
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:06,519
All right. I'm well aware of your concern, Vice Director.

81
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,639
However, we cannot just eliminate students who fail

82
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,449
and shut down the club where they showcase their talents.

83

But Director, those who did wrong must be punished.

85
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,439
Your punishment is to forget about this matter.

It's a great chance for us to start over

- Keep it down.
- To prevent the same incident from happening,

99

- Over there, that's the Director's son.
- we will be stricter with school clubs' activities.

Do you think he heard me?

101
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,739
Probably not.

He hasn't blinked.

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,880
Clubs that are not beneficial to the school will be terminated.

Patchara has something to say.

107
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,579
According to the school policy, article 18, paragraph 2,

108
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:31,660
the student president is the only one who has the sole authority to do anything about the school clubs.

109
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:40,670
Then I wish the new student president is kind to your club.

110
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:55,889
Darn. I shouldn't have declared war against Potjanee.

111
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,999
Don't stress yet.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,150
There are many candidates for student president.

113
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,819
You can choose the one on our side.

114
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,000
They are all students who side with the teachers.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,050
They will surely terminate our club to please Potjanee.

116
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,950
Should we just disband before that?

117

I thought you would come up with a good idea.

119
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,563
It didn't help at all.

120
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,153
Let's do this.

121
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,580
I'll run for the student president myself.

122
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,139
Your idea is as bad as mine.

123
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,870
Apart from us, who would vote for you?

124

We never know.

125
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:42,820
People might want a student president who is useless, foolish, and dumb

126
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,139
to oppose Potjanee. Right?

127
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,810
He's dumb and useless.

128
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:54,199
Hey! If he's chosen, he'll have to quit the club.

129

If that can save our club,

130
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,953
I'll do it.

131

Hello, friends.

My name is Pakpian Riannirun.

154
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,319
I plan to rehabilitate the canal behind our school to serve as a new landmark.

155
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,750
What's the purpose?

156
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,190
We spend most of our time in the classroom, don't we?

157
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,190
Don't tell me you like to take a bath in the canal, Khun Pakpian.
(T/N: Khun is a formal gender-neutral honorific to refer to someone)

158
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,220
Yeah! What's the use of that?

159
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,389
To me, school is not a place,

160
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,340
not a GPA,

161
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,280
but it's memory.

162
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,930
High school life comes only once.

163
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,799
Will you focus only on studying?

164
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,030
If I'm chosen,

A group who likes to play music so loud it disturbs the other clubs.

True. I don't think we have enough time.

Give the garland to the band you like.

The school board inquired about the termination of the clubs.

667
00:51:48,389 --> 00:51:51,173
The Director told us to confiscate all the musical instruments.

668
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:54,379
It's because the Music Club members caused trouble last year,

669
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:56,995
I have to sell their instruments to get enough money to pay for compensation.

670
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:58,329
This time, I really can't handle it.

671
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:01,279
Please just return the musical instruments to me.

This is the last chance in your high school life.

Do you want to regret not doing it for the rest of your life?

675
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:09,298
- I think you should take some rest.
- Your voice is gone.
