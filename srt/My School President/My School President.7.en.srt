The song we're playing for the audition is…

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,519
"Just Being Friendly."

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,008
We're supposed to do a simple cover.

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,752
But Ai Sound said it would be more interesting if we made a music video.

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,500
These are questionnaires created by psychologists, aiming to help people get to know each other deeply.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,325
My sibling never fails to get a lover because of it.

7
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,591
You want to ask me who I like, right?

8
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:20,720
I think you know.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
I really tried to be your friend,

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,684
but I can't do it.

11
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:25,920
And do you think I can?

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,500
Good morning.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,863
First of all, I would like to congratulate our marching band

14
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:40,583
for winning second place in the music competition.

15
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:42,584
A round of applause, please.

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,296
If it's that hard,

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,000
we don't have to be just friends.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
It forbids you from having a lover.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,350
But it doesn't forbid me from hitting on you.

20
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:58,536
This spot right here is reserved for me.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,927
Why the hell is he talking so damn much?

22
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:06,369
It's burning hot here.

No matter how tough your challenges are,

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,967

27
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:21,868
"Even stones get shaped by daily drops."

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,927
When will he stop rambling? My friend is turning red and is about to faint!

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,192
Right. Why is he rambling so much?

30
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:36,780
Shit! The Hot Wave audition result just came out.

31

- Let's take a look.

32

The Hot Wave results are out?

33
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,419
- Let's look at it.
- I'm too scared to look!

34

35

Stop it!

Please be informed that Chinzhilla Band passed and is qualified for the next round!

After three years here, I finally feel like I exist today.

65
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,090
Should we design our autograph now?

66
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,631
Should Chinzhilla be signed in Thai or English?

67
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:32,929
I think it should be in English.

68
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,460
So we will have international fans.

No. I'm… just asking for opinions.

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,593
Because love is a dream's worst enemy.

161
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,350
Do dreams carry any meaning

162
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,700
without someone thou love to share them with?

163
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,332
Hey. Those guys will see.

164
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,172
If thou art afraid of people finding out about us,

165
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,780
how about we go on a date in town?

166
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:04,173
I promise I won't bother thee again.

167
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,900
Hey, Ai Tinn.

168
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,460
Are you done here? Have you spoken to him?

169
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,980
People are waiting for you at the council.

170
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,400
I'll catch up with you. You go ahead.

171
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,845
Okay. Come quickly.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,860
Just think about it, alright?

173
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,859
Hey, Guys!

174
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,385
I just met Teacher Mut.

175
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:44,505
She gave me five tickets to the aquarium, but I'm not free this Saturday.

176
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,246
Do you guys want some?

177
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,926
Can I have two?

178
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:52,040
Why? Are you going with Ai Win?

179
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,599
Yes. He's been saying he wants to go hang out.

180
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,799
Ai Win wants to go look at some fish?

181
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,090
Yes. He was complaining about wanting to see some fish. So I'm going to take him.

182
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,466
How about you? Do you want some?

183
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,633
I'll be right back.

184
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,686
Two tickets... Two tickets...

185
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,525
Screw it. I can just sell these.

186
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,946
Surprise!

187
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,199
All right.

188
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,840
I'll be on my way then.

189
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,600
Take some rest, my child. I'm going to bed.

190
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,390
My room is on that side over there.

191
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,520
Ow!

192
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,960
Hey. You don't really have to dance in this scene.

193
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,939
So? I want to dance. I'm into the scene.

194
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,572
It's fine. Let's move to the next scene.

195
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:33,493
Juliet is yearning for love.

196
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,845
Romeo, you son of a bitch, Romeo!

197
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:40,106
Why are you such a jerk?

198
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm freaking disappointed.

199
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,880
I don't think those are the lines.

200
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,359
So what? This is how I want to act it out.

201
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:54,959
If you're not happy, you can act with someone else.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,770
Hey.

203
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:00,500
I think my child is tired.

204
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,019
How about we let him rest for a while?

205
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,185
Guys, let's go grab some snacks.

206

The snacks are on that side! Ow!

- What?

208
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,550
What's wrong?

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,340
It's nothing.

210
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,594
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

211
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:20,793
I said it's nothing.

212

Come on. I'm serious.

213
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,079
Why do you care?

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,030
Why don't you make time to eat your brownies?

215
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,473
What brownies?

216
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,652
- Oh. You saw it?
- Yes.

217
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:42,639
Do you think I'm stupid?

218
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,625
It's not what you think. Listen to me.

219
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,585
I don't even know that girl.

220
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,026
I have no idea who she is.

221
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,739
Surprise!

222
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,629
I made them for the first time. I'm not sure if they're good.

223
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,907
You might have mistaken me for someone else.

224

Oh, come on. Of course, not.

I shall be on my way then.

I don't want to bother your music practice. Bye bye.

Bye bye.

Music practice? I have no music practice.

I'm rooting for you, P'Yo.

233
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,525
Who the heck is Yo?

234
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:35,932
You're a pretty good storyteller.

235
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,839
Why don't you take the screenwriter job instead of Ai Tiwson?

236
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,870
I'm not making that up. It's true.

237
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,280
I was going to show you the snack box.

238

Maybe it's supposed to be your friend's. Hold on.

239

Here it is. There's a note here as well.

"I'm rooting for you, P'Yo."

Is it your friend Yo?

242
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,019
I don't think so. There are many people named Yo.

243
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,019
I was using Tinder, but I was too scared to use my own picture.

244
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,520
I was afraid it would break the club's rule.

245
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,899
Ouch!

246
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,599
But you weren't afraid to break the law? Huh?

247
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,713
You're using another person's picture.

248
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,659
I'm sorry, Mate.

249
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,732
Anyway, Nook messaged me first.

250
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:27,032
She goes to an all-girls school nearby,

251
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,979
and her big brother is into music.

252
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,105
So we kind of hit it off pretty well.

253
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,879
And how long are you planning to lie to her?

254
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,299
Huh?

255
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,805
I plan to tell her the truth.

256
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,805
That's why I asked you about the club rule the other day.

257
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:43,079
She asked me out on a date this Saturday.

258
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,569
If you agree to change the rule,

259
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,772
I will confess everything and ask her to be my girlfriend.

260
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,279
You're probably thinking,

261
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,850
"I should get rid of that rule", aren't you?

262
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,379
As if you're not thinking it.

263
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:26,079
You know that without this rule, you can cross the line to be with me.

I'll protect it with my life.

No.

It's just a regular pick. I'm only returning it.

But what I really want you to safekeep are our club rules.

Especially the no-lovers rule.

275
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:20,385
You might think it's nonsense,

But love is the curse for us musicians.

277

Don't let love take away Hot Wave like it did to me.

can you allow pets in the club too?

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,906
What? I'll be dressing up, too.

324
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:13,490
That's your business. Wear whatever you want.

325
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,485
Am I still the focus here?

326
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,989
Ask him. He's not listening to you.

327
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:20,712
Yes. We're focused.

328
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,859
You weren't listening to him.

329
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,110
He's stressed. Can't you see?

330
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,799
You dressed up so handsomely.

331
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,065
Are you excited to go on a date with me?

332
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,599
No.

333
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,639
Well. What about you?

334
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,945
Did you fall into a bucket of perfume?

335
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,596
Isn't it good, though?

336
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,779
It smells nice and cheerful.

337
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,550
Hey.

338
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,626
Sorry, Guys.

339
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:06,153
Sorry.

340
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,059
Why did you guys dress up so nicely?

341
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,325
I'm totally outshined.

342
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:14,959
Hey, you're thinking too much.

343
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,679
You don't look bad. You're totally handsome.

344
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,919
- P'Yo!
- Yes?

345
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,049
Hey, Ai Yo!

346
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,366
Why don't you take Nook inside now so that you guys can see everything?

347
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:33,499
Here, here. Yo.

348
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,919
Your name is Yo.

349
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,004
This is for Nook. And for Nook's friend.

350
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:38,731
- I am Pai.
- Okay, Pai.

351
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:41,619
This is for Tinn. Your name is Tinn.

352
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,169
And this is for me, Gun.

353
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,019
Should we go inside?

354
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,710
- Sure.
- Let's go.

355
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:53,353
That was a close call, Dude.

356
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,789
This is the music club.

357
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,690
Make yourself at home.

358
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,313
But it is a little messy.

359
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:12,133
Let me help.

360
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,819
Win, can I get your LINE ID?

361
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:21,229
I like rap music, too.

362
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:24,065
When I find cool songs, I'll share them with you.

363
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:25,652
Ah, of course.

364
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:27,219
Here, just scan it.

365
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,129
Okay. Thank you.

366
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:32,632
You can message me about anything, not just music.

367
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:34,946
Sure. If there's anything I need to say, I'll message you.

368
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,529
What do you like to eat, Four?

369
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,119
Why? Are you asking me to dinner?

370
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,325
I cook pretty well.

371
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,830
Are you ready?

372
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,112
Yeah, sure.

373
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:48,372
Before we start, let me tie you guys up.

374
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:50,345
Do we need to? It's just a rehearsal.

375
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,459
So you'll get used to it. Wouldn't that be a good thing?

376
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:54,912
Oh, right.

377
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,179
Great. Then tie us up really tightly.

378
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,459
Here, let me help you.

379
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:04,113
- Okay. We'll start from the first scene.
- Hold on one second.

380
00:24:04,113 --> 00:24:05,259
Hello.

381
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:06,799
Sure. I'll be down to get it.

382
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,980
You can leave it at the counter.

383
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,246
The food is here. Can I please get an extra hand?

384
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,609
- Hold on.
- I'll go with you.

385
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,783
Let me help. You two stay here.

386
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:18,353
What? Hey! I'm coming, too.

387
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,883
Ai Sound.

388
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,110
What?

389
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:30,080
I... need to pee.

390
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,925
Why are you telling me?

391
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:35,359
Hey! I need to pee.

392
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,359
That bastard, Ai Pat, tied us so tight.

393
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,539
- I need to pee now.
- No.

394
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,692
Let's go.

395
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,709
I'm not going.

396
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,485
- Go.
- No.

397
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:46,766
Ouch!

398
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,746
It hurts.

399
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:51,210
Get up. You're heavy.

400
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,859
Why on earth do I have to be attached to you?

401
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,330
- Ouch!
- Stay like this then.

402
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,600
You're heavy. Get off me.

403
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,330
No. Let's stay like this, you asshole.

404
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:03,890
- Fine. Let's go to the restroom.
- Okay.

405
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:05,859
- Can you hurry? I need to pee.
- Can you just walk properly?

406
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:07,659
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,519
See? We're knocking people.

408
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,979
Where are you going? Pee right here.

409
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,226
Come here. That's too far.

410
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:17,080
Damn it, it's such a hassle!

411
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Don't peek at me.

412
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,939
It's tiny.

413
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,340
I don't see it, even if I peek.

414
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,840
I'm in a good mood today because I got a girl's chat ID.

415
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:33,180
Actually, you've never been hit on, have you?

416
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,279
I knew it.

417
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,526
You refused to amend the rule for Ai Yo because you're jealous.

418
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:43,647
What? I'm the kind of guy who turns down many people on Tinder.

419
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:45,539
- Really?
- Yes. Why would I lie?

420
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,740
- Are you sure?
- I am.

421
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,599
Delete her chat account then.

422
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,759
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Do it now.

423
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,249
- I will. Don't challenge me. I'll remove it.
- Yes, I'm challenging you.

424
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:55,785
- I will. I'm peeing.
- Do it right now. Do it right now.

425
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:57,249
I will. Don't test me!

426
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,209
Delete it now. Use your other hand, it's free.

427
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,045
Just you watch. I'm going to tell Ai Gun.

428
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:03,830
Walk properly.

429
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,640
I just found out they were dating.

430
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,726
No wonder no guy has ever been successful in chasing them.

431
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,499
It hurts, right?

432
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,633
Do you get how Ai Yo feels now?

433
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,692
- I get that.
- Good.

434
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:32,113
I get that if I don't get to date, no one gets to date either.

435
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:34,626
We will all be single!

436
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,599
Fish.

437
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,546
That fish is pretty.

438
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:05,260
That one too.

439
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,810
This one as well.

440
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,313
Hey.

441
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:19,446
We'll get exposed!

442
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,812
P'Yo!

443
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,810
It is so big in here.

444
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:34,272
- Sure.
- Right.

445
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,686
So how's your practice for the cover dance competition going?

446
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,713
Me? Doing dance covers?

447
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,360
Um.

448
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,667
What cover dances?

449
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,399
She's into it. So I just went with the flow.

450
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:50,780
I'm sorry.

451
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,919
Right. I… I do cover dances.

452
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,780
You must be exhausted.

453
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,459
You need to prepare for the Math Olympiad as well.

454
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,459
Where do you find the time to model?

455
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,780
Cover dances, Math Olympiad, modeling too?

456
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,480
That's a lot.

457
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,785
Let's just forget about that.

458
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,493
Let's go see all the fishes over there.

459
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:13,433
Come on.

460
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:17,126
I am so sorry.

461
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,893
Wow!

462
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:26,560
Damn, they're big.

463
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,419
Come here.

464
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,053
What are climbing gouramis?

465
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,103
Come here, climbing gouramis.

466
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,350
[How to make a QR Code keychain]

467
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,350
[1. Take your photos.]

468
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,560
[2. Send them to us. We'll generate the QR code containing your photos.]

469
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,045
Ai Yo, look. QR code keychains.

470
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:59,793
We should put our MV song in here.

471
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,092
Do you want to buy it? It can be considered a memento for our first date.

472
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,080
What first date?

473
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,879
Why are you here?

474
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,080
Nook is using the restroom.

475
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,412
It's so cool.

476
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,653
Do you want to take photos?

477
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:21,413
Then we can upload the photo to the QR code.

478
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:25,520
Come on.

479
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,710
Let's not before he sees.

480
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,667
Ai Yo is going to walk over soon.

481
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,760
Why are you scared? One, two.

482
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,592
- Hey, Guys!
- See, he's here.

483
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:36,479
Help me get a chance to be alone with Nook,

484
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,830
so I can finally clear things up with her.

485
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,970
Fine. I'll help find a way.

486
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,630
Pai, the fish feeding show is about to start.

487
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,205
Should we go now?

488
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:56,420
What about Nook?

489
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,029
Nook went to get us the seats already. Right?

490
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,145
Right.

491
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:03,679
Let's go.

492
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,112
Hey, where's everybody?

493
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:20,809
They went ahead first.

494
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,899
I'll take you. This way.

495
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,532
- Come on.
- Okay.

496
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,773
Let's go quickly.

497
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,619
Tinn, I think Ai Yo is taking longer than necessary.

498
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,140
I'm scared her friend will get suspicious.

499
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,492
Don't worry.

500
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,473
Look at her.

501
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,152
She seems sleep-deprived.

502
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:53,186
Right?

503
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:57,519
Maybe... she had too much lunch.

504
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:06,059
This feels more like our date now.

505
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,040
Date, my ass.

506
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,272
- You know what?
- What?

507
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,825
Sharks, they may bite you.

508
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:24,300
But I like you, no bite.

509
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,510
Are you flirting or what?

510
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:35,406
Let me teach you something.

511
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:40,613
If you want to hit on someone, use your own line.

512
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:43,146
Sharks, they may bite you.

513
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:12,366
Sharks, they like to bite.

514
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:16,193
I do too, but only the one I like.

515
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,473
Bite, my ass!

516
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,059
Looking at your reaction,

517
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,720
I bet you like the one that bites you.

518
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,150
Hm?

519
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:35,280
Ow!

520
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Bite, my ass!

521
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,409
Nook, can I talk to you for a moment?

522
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,659
Did P'Yo send you to tell me he wants to break it off?

523
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,560
- What?
- P'Yo is acting strange today.

524
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,710
He isn't like the P'Yo who's been talking to me through chats.

525
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,160
Because he's not P'Yo.

526
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,970
The one who's been chatting with you this whole time,

527
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,900
is me.

528
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:24,592
I didn't mean to lie to you.

529
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:29,453
My club has this rule that bans us from having lovers.

530
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,346
That's why I used my friend's photo.

531
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:40,980
What about when you told me that you do dance covers...

532
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,133
Or that you compete in the Math Olympiad,

533
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:46,019
you're on the national esports team, and you're in 4th grade in Buddhist Theology?

534
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,732
Is there anything that you mentioned that is true?

535
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:52,893
There's one thing that's always been true.

536
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,446
It's…

537
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:57,546
I…

538
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,393
My name is Yo.

539
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,413
Yo.

540
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:29,979
Here.

541
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,713
Thank you.

542
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,733
I saw Nook's friend taking her away.

543
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:40,140
Did you end it well?

544
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,220
It ended with a slap here.

545
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:45,319
Oh.

546
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,953
Come on.

547
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:53,945
No matter how lonely you feel, you can't lie to people like that.

548
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:55,533
Got it?

549
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,300
Actually, I started talking to her that day,

550
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,152
the day you said my skills were bad.

551
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:07,809
I just wanted some support.

552
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,819
Then I found her. She had always been so supportive.

553
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:14,893
Until one day,

554
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,730
I regained my confidence.

555
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,980
I shouldn't have done that to her.

556
00:35:58,026 --> 00:35:59,659
Damn it!

557
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,819
Hey.

558
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,825
That's enough!

559
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:06,032
I won't stop!

560
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,144
I'll keep playing until my fingers are cut in half. Shit!

561
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:10,826
Ai Yo! Give it a rest.

562
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:12,973
That's enough, Yo.

563
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,306
I'll let everyone vote again.

564
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,750
I don't know if I got this wrong,

565
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,860
but I think you've been singing better.

566
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,819
That's funny. I haven't done anything differently.

567
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:43,973
Really. Especially love songs.

568
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:47,219
You didn't seem to be into them before.

569
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,580
I don't know what or who makes you sing better,

570
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,246
but I think it's good for you.

571
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,366
Who agrees to let Ai Yo have a girlfriend?

572
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,293
Hey.

573
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,186
- You guys have said it.
- Yes.

574
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,370
Don't change your mind.

575
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,599
What are you waiting for? Call her.

576
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,560
Hurry up.

577
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,493
Guys,

578
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:16,413
I think Nook has blocked my number.

579
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,566
Come on.

580
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:20,879
Don't give up yet.

581
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,100
I have an idea.

582
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,120
But this will require

583
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,710
quite a bit of people.

584
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,650
Nook!

585
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,080
Nook, are you home?

586
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,153
Nook, are you in?

587
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,400
Nook!

588
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,253
Nook.

589
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,592
P'Yo! What bring you here?

590
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,560
And why did you bring so many friends?

591
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,719
Don't take this the wrong way. I just want to make it up to you.

592
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,150
Can you come down here and talk, please?

593
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,146
I'm happy for you! So happy for you!

594
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,973
Go for it, man.

595
00:39:11,426 --> 00:39:15,913
P'Yo, why are you here? We are over.

596
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:19,766
I know that you hate liars the most.

597
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:24,426
But today I came to make one lie come true.

598
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,699

See? I can actually dance.

643
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:24,300
Aren't you scared the neighbors will yell at you?

644
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,019
I am.

645
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,240
But I'm more scared of losing you.

646
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,592
I know I've lied about many things,

647
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,740
but there's one thing that has always been true.

648
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,820
It's my feelings for you.

649
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,600
I'm having chills.

650
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,890
But I like that.

651
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:52,313
Teaching you all to dance wasn't a waste of my time after all.

652
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,259
Since I'm already here, and the vibes are just right, how about we tell them about us too?

653
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,066
Can you give me one more chance?

654
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:09,473
I promise I won't let you down.

655
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,906
But I don't allow it, dammit!

I was curious who was flirting with my little sister.

I didn't think it was you guys.

659

Is Nook your sister?

660
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,012
She must be my mother! Of course, she's my younger sister!

661
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:45,099
Didn't I tell you to follow the rules?

662
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,705
If any of you can't do that, just get the hell out of the club.

663
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:52,652
Go! Why are you still here?

664
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:55,039
Leave my house. Get out!

665
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,970
Are you going or not?

666
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,930
P'Yak!

667
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,140
Hurry!

668
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,205
Hey. So did Ai Yo quit to be with Nook?

669
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:11,760
Not only did he stay, but he's also practicing harder than before.

670
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,360
He said he would try to win P'Yak's heart.

671
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,765
That's why he dragged everyone there to practice.

672
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:20,116
I escaped to come here with you.

673
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:27,180
I thought the club rule would change

674
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,600
if I helped with the dancing and singing. But it didn't.

675
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,445
Isn't it such a hassle trying to pursue me?

676
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:41,106
If you were chasing someone else,

677
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:43,859
you would already have a lover by now.

678
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,393
It's all right.

679
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,093
I don't want to hit on anyone else.

680
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,390
You're the only one I'm waiting for.

681
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:03,110
Aren't you afraid I would waste your time?

682
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,893
Why would I be?

683
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,233
I've had eyes on you for two years,

684
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,473
and now I'm right by your side.

685
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,370
What else should I ask for?

686
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,253
Though the rule still remains,

687
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,726
something has changed.

688
00:45:31,753 --> 00:45:33,386
What is it?

689
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,433
I think love isn't always bad.

690
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,800
Maybe it will encourage Ai Yo to practice harder.

691
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,240
Maybe…

692
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,810

if we could spend the night at school.
