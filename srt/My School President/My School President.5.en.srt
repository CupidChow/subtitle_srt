[Previously]
It's time we look for a new member.

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,540
Ai SoundAbout, a guitarist with millions of views that I once mentioned.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,920
Ask him to join us.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,369
You guys dare to go to Hot Wave when this is how you rehearse?

5
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:12,999
You are the most problematic, Ai Gun. The reason your band sucks is that you spoil them too much!

6
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,440
I quit the club.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,439
I haven't seen you smile like this in a long time.

8
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,009
Since you left Music Club.

9
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,619
It's time for you to move on. A lot of people are waiting for you there.

10
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,920
Do you want to take a photo with me?

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,250
Smile, Mr. Student President.

[School Counseling Department]

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,409
I want to be a doctor.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,320
Think carefully.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,779
Studying for medical school is tough, and the workload will exhaust you.

16
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,789
I haven't mentioned the back pay yet.

17
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:52,000
And don't even think to say,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,700
"I want to go to med school in order to take care of my parents when they're old."

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,080
In real life, you will barely make time to see them.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,640
All right, Sir.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,340
I like Communication Arts,

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,399
but my parents want me to study Engineering.

23
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,790
What do you want to do after graduation?

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,799
Be a manufacturing supervisor?

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,799
Nice payment, but if you think again, you'll need to spend your life in the countryside.

26
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,929
You'll get to come to the cities once in a while. It's a living hell.

27
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,049
Are you sure?

28
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,179
I want to be a teacher.

29
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:28,200
Get out!

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,690
I want to be a singer.

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,749
You can scold me any way you want. Please feel free to do it.

32
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:35,180
I used to have a band, too,

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,669
but I was stupid enough to believe my school counselor and became a teacher.

34
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:41,969
Look at how my life is now.

35
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,869
How is your band now, Sir?

36
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,799
We played at many bars.

37
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,559
One day, a talent scout found us. We signed with them.

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,803
Are you serious?

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,229
Anyway, they didn't give us any work. We were back to being bar musicians.

40
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,079
Some of us are music teachers. Some are even food delivery riders.

41
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,209
So did you guys literally disband?

42
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,070
But if you work a little harder,

43
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,669
play at a bunch of bars in one night, you might be able to make a good living.

44
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,850
My friends' band did that.

45
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,719
Finally, the singer had vocal cord disorders,

46
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,853
and they disbanded.

47
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,719
They went back to their old jobs as usual.

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,920
Okay, I'm back to farming.

49
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,131
Guys! It's time we submit the Hot Wave application.

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,090
Why are you guys making such dull faces?

51
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,059
This is the day we've been waiting for.

52
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,159
The counselor discouraged them big time.

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,039
Of course, they're dull.

54
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,310
Don't get stressed out.

55
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,420
Say we win Hot Wave,

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,189
then everything will get better.

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,290
And if we lose?

58
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,560
It's still time if we want to disband now and go back to studying for university.

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,990
What the heck are you saying?

60
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,169
Who would change their mind, right?

61
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,580
Right.

62
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,359
But my direct admission exam result will be announced next week.

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,259
Can you wait until then?

64
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,909
If I don't get accepted, then I can start making a new plan.

65
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,610
My dad wants me to learn car repair at his auto shop.

66
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,689
He wants me to take on the business.

67
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,679
He doesn't believe I can make a living as a musician.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,279
My parents are okay with this because I told them I joined Physics Club.

69
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:35,239
They hired a physics tutor to teach me after school every day.

70
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,420
I have to start tomorrow.

71
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,510
Poor guys.

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,200
Lucky for me, my parents understand.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,299
They filled my work schedule until next year.

74
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,560
I might not have enough time to practice with you all.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
If that's how it is,

76
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,280
we should just disband.

77
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,660
If you guys don't give everything you got,

78
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,749
let's just not start at all.

79
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,300
You have until the end of this month.

80
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,930
Go make up your mind.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,190
Then come back and tell me what you want to do with Hot Wave.

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,273

What are you doing here, playing basketball like in the music videos?

98
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,769
Don't you have music practice?

99
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,209
Or are there any other problems?

100
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,849
Ask them yourself.

101
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,779
Each person is just...

102
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,809
We've fought together this far.

103
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,010
Why are they hesitating now?

104
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,143
You're right.

105
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,130
But look around you.

106
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,779
Everyone is studying.

107
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,080
They must feel bad if they aren't.

108
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,419
What's up with the adults anyway?

109
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,420
They like making decisions for us about everything.

110
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,979
They couldn't do it, so their children must carry on their dreams.

111
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,890
You're right, but...

112
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,299
I think they mean well.

113
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,749
Take my mom as an example. She wants me to get into med school

114
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:12,039
because she thinks it's stable.

115
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,949
Whose side are you on exactly?

116
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,789
Your side, of course.

117
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,290
I don't believe you.

118
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,413
You don't believe me...

119
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,393
You don't believe me.

120
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,893
Am I on your side now?

121
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,309
Is this enough?

122
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,970
Yes, it is.

123
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,800
It is?

124
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,570
Let's do this.

125
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,510
Are you free this evening?

126
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,090
I know a really nice milk bar.

127
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,619
- I'll take you there.
- Okay.

128
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,459
I'll even treat you. Do you want to come?

129
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,729
Hey. Don't you have practice, Dear?

130
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,939
- I…
- Hold it.

131
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,620
You came with the student president.

132
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,909
Did you cause trouble again?

133
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,030
Gosh... you're making accusations.

134
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,489
I didn't do anything. The club is on break.

135
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:18,500
So I brought you a customer.

136
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm upset. I'll go to another milk bar.

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,150
There, there. I'm sorry.

138
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,980
Come on. Take a seat.

139
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,959
I'll serve you very special shaved ice.

140
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,240
Come on. Sit down.

141
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,440
You're pretty close to your mom.

142
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,860
Not as close as you and your mom.

143
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,390
You're with her 24 hours a day,

144
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,560
both at home and school.

145
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,110
Hey!

146
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,980
- Ma? Are you okay?
- Ma, what's wrong?

147
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,839
- Ma? What happened?
- Are you okay, Ma?

148
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,019
Ma!

149
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,690
Let's take her to rest, Ai Gun.

150
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,079
Ma, what's wrong? Ma!

151
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,379
Can you hear me?

152
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,619
Let's get her to rest.

153
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,179
Do you have an inhaler?

154
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,480
Look on the counter.

155
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,179
- Ma!
- Move over.

156
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,799
Ma, what's wrong?

157
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:09,789
Find something to fan her with. Get her to the couch.

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,933
Here, Ma.

159
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,779
Our employee is on maternity leave,

160
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,279
so my mom has to do all the work alone.

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,630
Look. She hasn't eaten yet.

162
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,989
You should take her to see a doctor.

163
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,409
- Would you like that?
- No, it's fine.

164
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,239
This happens quite often.

You can't do it alone, Buttface.

All right.

I've been wondering. Why is this kind of shaved ice called Jumba?

178
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,659
Some say the colors remind them of the outfits the girls, who dance Jumba, wear.

You trying to irritate me, aren't you?

180
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,900
What's for sure is that Mrs. Gim's shaved ice

181
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,680
tastes like someone dancing in your mouth.

182

How is it?

183
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,580
It is seriously like someone is dancing in my mouth.

184
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,629
It tastes exactly like the shaved ice your mom makes.

185

You remember the taste?

186

Of course.

We can only put it on a plate.

Would you be okay with that? You go clear that table.

There was a mosquito.

00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,790
I should be home a little late today, Mom.

497
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:13,280
I got caught up in the… student council work.

498
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,010
Yes.

499
00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:18,884
I'll be home as soon as I can.

500
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,991
Hey. How did it go?

501
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,559
Was it okay?

502
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,840
I was super nervous.

503
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,476
Feel my hand. It's still cold.

504
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,388
It is really cold.

505
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,039
Did it go the way you practiced?

506
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,773
It didn't.

507
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,903
I did nothing wrong this time.

508
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:56,904
I got all the notes right.

509
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,420
Thanks for helping me practice.

510
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,480
Hello.

511
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,096
How did my friend do?

512
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:13,715
He's one of the best in high school that I've met.

513
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:17,900
So... does it mean my friend is

514
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,590
ready to be an artist then?

515
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,720
Well,

516
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,376
there are a few uni boys who are more skilled and ready to debut.

517
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:32,744
Come one. It's okay.

518
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:36,035
Work on it more and audition again next year.

519
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:37,836
I'll be waiting, okay?

520
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,740
Gun, it's okay.

521
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:50,748
You can come again next year.

522
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:54,364
I'm all good. I'm okay.

523
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,188
Next year, it is.

524
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,039
Okay, okay. Here we go.

525
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,569
Welcome everyone back to "Rap of War."

526
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,849
Who is our next pair?

527
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,551
Our next contestant is new here.

528
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,292
He's actually my friend.

529
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:20,879
Wow!

530
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:26,009
Please give it up to the new rapper with the clean and handsome look,

531

Let's not waste any more time.

Please welcome our first runner-up in the last competition, Lekcifer.

534
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:50,700
Winny Da Pooh, I'll let you choose if you want to start first or go after me.

535

We're starting! Woo!

536
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,512
- You can go first.
- Lekcifer, are you ready?

537
00:36:58,513 --> 00:37:00,176
I'm so ready. Let's do it.

Calm down, everyone. Now what?

552
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,639
Nong Pooh, are you ready?

553
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,610

Hang on, Guys.

560
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,890
Don't boo him yet.

561
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,453
Let's hear his story first.

562
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:48,530
My friend right here was called back to work by his dad.

563
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,990
But he ditched his work to play video games.

564
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,930
And that game addict is bold enough to step on this stage.

565
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,752
Don't you think that's pretty cool?

566
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:06,915
You are great! You are great! You are great!

567
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:11,480
You are great!

568
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,414
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

569
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,210
What are you waiting for?

570
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,013
Give him the beat!

571
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:23,249
Let's go! DJ! Let's get it!

572
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:53,232
I'm sorry.

573
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:55,845
I shouldn't have taken you there.

574
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,250
It's fine.

575
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:06,705
At least now I know my place in this industry.

576
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,309
Don't think like that.

577
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,314
It's not that you're not good.

578
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:15,430
It's just that someone might be better.

579
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,100
Next year will be your year.

580
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:28,754
What if next year,

581
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:32,136
there's someone better again?

582
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,260
But maybe...

583
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:49,030
I'm not good enough for this industry.

584
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,892
Whatever. I will practice again.

585
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:53,340
I'm okay.

586
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,661
I will practice for next year.

587
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,409
Hey! Gun, watch it!

588
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,700
It's okay.

589
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:17,461
You're safe.

590
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,189
It's okay.

591
00:41:39,518 --> 00:41:41,151
Gun.

592
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:44,185
I got you.

593
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,073
It's okay.

594
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:50,390
It's okay.

595

[School Milk]

596
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,336
How did it go?

597
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,430
I didn't pass.

598
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,558
But it's good this way.

599
00:42:12,558 --> 00:42:16,668
I didn't really feel the connection between me and them.

600
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:18,200
Yeah?

601
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,199
Have you eaten? Should I make you an omelet?

602
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,201
It's okay, Ma.

603
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:27,139
I'm not hungry. I'm going to go change my clothes.

604
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:30,808
Thanks a lot for today.

605
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:42,696
I should get going then. Goodbye.

606
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:44,579
Hold on.

607
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,640
Seriously,

608
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,727
he's not okay, is he? Be honest.

609
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,260
Like father, like son.

610
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:20,137
Mom, let me help clean up.

611
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:21,771
Sure.

612
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,195
I think I'll apply for Business Administration.

613
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,671
What?

614
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:42,304
Don't you want the Faculty of Music anymore?

615
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:43,652
Well.

616
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:47,434
Say I'm an executive,

617
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:49,430
wearing a suit and tie,

618
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,430
you can brag about me to the auntie next door.

619
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,374
Am I the reason?

620
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,520
No, I am the reason.

621
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:11,167
I can't take care of you by doing what I love.

622
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:15,270
If dad knew I suck so bad,

623
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,825
he would be so disappointed.

624
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:24,456
Will you be happy with that, Gun?

625
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,387

P'Tinn, this is the revised version of the sports day's timeline.

661
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:00,884
Approved. Great job. Very good.

662
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:02,409
Wait. You haven't even looked yet.

663
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:04,779
I trust you. It will turn out great.

664
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:07,452
You can go home now. Go, Guys.

665
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:08,819
Why would anyone work anymore?

666
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:11,285
All right, then. Will you excuse me?

667
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:13,359
Well, well. Someone is in a very good mood.

668
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,042
Gun is back to fighting again, right?

669
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:20,177
That's right. I can put my mind at ease for a while.

670
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:21,193
Ai Student President!

671
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:23,376
What is it? What is it?

672
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:25,892
I submitted the Hot Wave application this morning.

673
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:29,432
The staff called me and said, "Hey, you forgot to attach the file."

674
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:32,939
Once I was sending the file, the internet was all down.

675
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:34,276
There's no Wi-Fi here either.

676
00:49:34,276 --> 00:49:36,159
The internet is down too.

677
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,512
The application will be closed in 10 minutes.

678
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,751
Right, there's Wi-Fi at the pool.

679
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:48,054
- Got it?
- There is, but the signal is really bad.

680
00:49:48,054 --> 00:49:49,982
Try standing here.

681
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:51,316
Got it?

682
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:55,444
I guess the router is upstairs.

683
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:56,653
Damn it.

684
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:58,356
I'm running out of time.

685
00:49:58,356 --> 00:49:59,940
Get me a ladder.

686
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,425
- Ai Gun, I can't take it anymore. Just hurry.
- Hey!

687
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:03,139
I got the signal, Tinn! Tinn!

688
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:04,844
Hurry up!

689
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:06,980
- Ouch!
- Ouch! That hurts.

690
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,060
It hurts.

691
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,730
You got it, didn't you?

692
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,849
I did.

693
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,543
Thanks.

694
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:28,150
I've done so much for you. You have to be the champion.

695
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:36,760
I mean, for telling my mom I wasn't okay.

696
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,520
Thanks for that.

697
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,079
Thanks to you as well.

698
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,713
For what?

699
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,090
Before this,

700
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:53,125
I didn't know why I should be a doctor.

701
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,660
All I knew was my mom wanted me to be.

702
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:03,320
But after I helped you out and took care of your mom,

703
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,930
I realized

704
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,170
that being a doctor can be good too.

705
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,680
I can take care of the person I love.

706
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,680
You're talking like you already have someone you like.

707
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,350
I don't.

708
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,923
I don't believe you. Spit it out.

709
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:30,988
I don't.

710
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:33,309
- Who is it?
- No one.

711
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:36,640
- Why can't you tell?
- Because you haven't competed in Hot Wave yet.

712
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,868
But what does it have to do with Hot Wave?

713
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:56,194
Your club rule forbids you from dating.

714
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,292
So you like to mess with my club

715
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:05,089
because the one you like…

716
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:06,473
Yes.

717
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,442
Now that you know,

718
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:12,293
are you okay with that?

Each of you will write down a song. And we will do the lucky draw.

721
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:48,511
The song we're playing for the audition is…

722
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:52,109
- What are you up to?
- I'm listening to a song and interpreting it for the audition.

723
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:54,509
It should be more interesting if we give it a music video (MV).

724
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:55,799
Would you like me to help?

725
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:57,782
These are questionnaires created by psychologists.

726
00:52:57,782 --> 00:52:59,010
They help you get to know each other better.

727
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,772
Ai Tiw suggested I take these questionnaires.

728
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:03,701
It might help make us look closer when we actually shoot the MV.

729
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:09,579
If one day we become close friends, what would you like to warn me about in advance?

730
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:11,655
Actually, I've always…

731
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:16,330
liked you.
