All of you must pass every subject during the mid-term exams.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,989
You dumbass! How did you even get through to become a senior?

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:10,020
You must have a private session with Ai Tinn at his safe house for a week.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,119
This is unbelievable, Director.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,440
We passed all the subjects on the mid-term exam.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,699
Thank you. For this...

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,989
and…

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,750
for tutoring me.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,040
- All right.
- Go ahead and show him.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,180
Guys.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,410
There's a song from a band I want you to listen to.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,430
- What band?
- Sure.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,340
- That's easy to do.
- Giving critique.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,180
Let's hear it.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,969
Oh, the bass can't keep up with the rhythm. They suck.

16
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,599
The keyboard isn't so bad. But I can do better.

17
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,940
You can do it. You're the best, man.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,719
The drum isn't played firmly.

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,149
If that's all they can do, tell them to disband.

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,370
What band is this?

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,890
They suck so bad!

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,800
I told you! They suck!

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,821
- That's terrible.
- They're unacceptable.

24
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:00,959
They can't compare with us. We're the Hot Wave champion to be.

25
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,900
Of course, we are.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,390
This is our band!

27
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,470
I listened to all of our previous songs.

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,740
They were all terrible.

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,180
Well, we don't have a guitar solo.

30
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,260
I told you to practice, Ai Asshole Yo.

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,780
- It's you!
- It was you!

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,819
- You!
- It's you!

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,553
Stop!

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,959
I think it's time we look for a new member.

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,420
- That's right.
- Agree!

36
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:33,799
It's easier said than done.

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,429
If our school had a god-like talented solo guitarist like that, we would have found them already.

38
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,880
- Right!
- Right!
- Right!

39

No matter what, our band

40
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,090
must have a solo guitarist.

41

About him dying his hair gray?

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,330
The teacher just said he's a celebrity.

62
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,599
Not that.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I meant he looks familiar.

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,193
Oh, I know!

00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,230
See? I knew it.

Yes, ask him to join.

I haven't been able to find anyone.

103

To put up a poster, you must first receive approval from the student council.

Why don't you ask Ai Sound? Isn't he your old friend?

Ai Sound is not my friend.

He's my top rival, actually.

140
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,559
We've competed in everything since middle school.

141

Scores, sports, and even popularity.

142
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,830
No doubt, hot people like us always have competitors.

143
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,050
Anyway,

144
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,800
even if I asked him to help, he probably wouldn't.

145
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,099
What a pity.

146
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,249
If Ai Sound joins Ai Gun's band, they can surely win Hot Wave.

147
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,600
And you will get to date him.

Right? It's been going on forever.

I know the student council and the Music Club are enemies.

165
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,559
You've been trying to terminate the club but never succeeded, right?

166
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,809
That's not it. It's—

167
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:08,899
So you're trying to prevent me from joining because you think my talents will make them win Hot Wave, aren't you?

168
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,049
- What are you talking about?
- Since you think this way, it makes me want to join the Music Club.

169
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:16,290
I'll help them win Hot Wave and smack you with the trophy.

170
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,470
What the heck just happened?

171
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,020
I didn't think it would be so easy.

Why are you here?

174
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,149
I heard that you guys don't get along with the student president.

175
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,760
Then we have the same enemy.

176

I'll take you guys to Hot Wave.

It's the School Activities Fair next week.

178
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:44,799
I'm planning to have a mini-concert.

179
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
- We'll sell tickets and raise money for our club.
- That's good.

180
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,950
As for the song we'll perform, "Your Shoulder,"

181
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,660
the staple song of our seniors.

182
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,009
Okay, then. Should we practice now?

183
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,859
Let's do it.

184

Hey!

It's time for my tutoring classes.

208
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,210
You can't blame me. Ai Win took so long on the toilet.

209
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,099
- What? I couldn't help it, could I?
- It's your fault.

210
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:05,361
We can practice tomorrow.

211
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,239
We can't. Tomorrow is my dad's birthday.

212
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:09,890
The day after tomorrow is our movie day.

213

How can we forget that?

214

We've wanted to see it for so long.

215
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,630
Then we can practice on Friday.

216
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,999
Hey! What the hell are you guys up to?

217
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:20,360
You guys dare to go to Hot Wave when this is how you rehearse?

218
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,250
Relax, man.

219
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,250
Can't you see that everyone has personal matters to tend to?

220
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,899
You are the most problematic, Ai Gun!

221
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,539
The reason your band sucks is that you spoil them too much!

222
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,879
Hey! You better watch what you say!

223
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,479
You shut your mouth.

224
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,979
How about you play the bass right first?

225
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,689
And you Ai Pat, how the hell are you playing? It's off beat.

226
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,039
Ai Por, your keyboard is excessive.

227
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,369
And you, Ai Yo, you always play the chords wrong.

228
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:45,799
I only had to listen to your song once, and I already know.

229
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,579
Has Ai Gun ever given you guys comments like this?

230
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:50,659
Let me tell you guys something.

231
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,210
The band leader is supposed to bring out the finest potential in each member.

232
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,889
If you don't believe me, why don't you let me take your place?

233
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,779
Then go ahead.

234
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,530
I want to see if your skills are as good as your mouth.

235
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,899
Damn. When did we become so good?

236
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,249
Do you understand now, Ai Gun?

237
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:41,929
If you stay the band leader, you'll never make it to Hot Wave.

238
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,159
You shut your mouth right now.

239
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,669
If it wasn't for Ai Gun, this club would have been terminated.

240
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,820
Why don't we vote then?

241
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,800
Whether you want me or Ai Gun to lead you to Hot Wave.

242
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,783
What's wrong?

243
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:20,520
Why are you sitting here all alone, looking gloomy?

244
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,070
Don't you have to rehearse with your friends?

245
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,390
No.

246
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,290
Who wants Ai Gun as the band leader, raise your hand.

247
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,380
I'm not surprised that your band is so messed up.

248
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,900
I vote for Ai Sound.

249
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,469
Well...

250
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,979
Ai Sound really is a better leader than I am.

251
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,839
Do you think we will accept him?

252
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,090
We vote for you no matter what.

253
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,600
If you don't agree to it,

254
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,150
I quit the club.

255

256
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,279

- Hey, Ai Gun!

258
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,300
- Gun, Dude!
- Gun!

259
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,850
Don't you think you're too dramatic this time?

260
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,820
We've worked so hard to get here.

261
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,300
But if I stayed, would you guys listen to Ai Sound?

262
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,149
Besides, he sings better than I do.

263
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:36,239
He's more knowledgeable about music than I am.

264
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,639
If we won the Hot Wave Championship without you,

265
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:41,040
what the hell would we do with it?

266
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,259
Well,

267
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,330
it's a way to reclaim our club's reputation.

268
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,910
It will avenge P'Yak.

269
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,140
If you guys really love this club,

270
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,800
listen to what Ai Sound says.

271
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,179
That's the story.

272
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,810

I always practiced until the sky went dark.

275

Hey!

276
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,380
You left a mark on my hand.

277
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,350
It's the student council stamp.

278
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,039
If you're lonely or have nothing to do,

279

you're welcome to hang out there.

280
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,919
Consider it me giving you permission.

281
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,400
It's messy, can you see?

282
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,863
Anyway,

283
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,410

Sure.

285

Damn it. I shouldn't have asked Ai Sound to join Music Club.

286
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,949
Who would have thought he would seize the power?

287
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,983
You're wrong.

288
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:49,140
Don't you know this is your golden chance?

289
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,919
How?

290
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,029
Look at Ai Gun right now. He's so lifeless.

291
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:56,999
Ai Gun isn't a member of the Music Club now.

292
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:59,499
That means you can pursue him all you want.

293
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,350
He can date.

294
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,943
That's right.

295
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,820
I just made it all easy.

Right?

That's great.

298

Can you accompany Ai Tinn to the booth inspections?

This is Jedi's electrostatic sword.

The sword will gain the 'Force' and make these objects rise.

Soft power? More like "hard sell."

00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,218
I want to know the reason.

658
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,755
It's a long story. I'll fill you in later.

659
00:44:56,755 --> 00:44:58,619
Just eat, Win.

660
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,198
Fine. Let's eat.

661
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,747
Ai Win, you stole mine!

662
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, come on.

663
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,446
You jackass.

664
00:45:09,446 --> 00:45:12,451
Guys, I'll be right back.

665
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:14,790
- Where are you going?
- Where are you off to?

666
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,560
- Where are you taking my pork?
- Did you take all the pork?

667
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,650
Where are you going?

668
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,527
Guys, please help me return these tables and chairs.

669
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:26,660
- Kajorn.
- Yes, Phi?

670
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,497
Help me lift this.

671
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,460
If you don't use a mirror,

672
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,189
how can you clean it completely?

673
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:54,640
It was all dusty when you were moving stuff.

674
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,550
Here.

675
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:14,020
Why are you here?

676
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,174
The café is already closed.

677
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:21,147
Here.

678
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,920
I knew you would be hungry.

679
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:28,793
We were celebrating with barbecue pork.

680
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:31,699
We didn't want to throw it away. There's some food left.

681
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:33,280
Thanks.

682
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,951
I heard that many people went to watch you.

683
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:40,840
I'm happy for you.

684
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,990
Actually there's...

685
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,510
one thing that I want to do.

686
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,431
If it's about singing, I told you, you don't have to.

687
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:29,940
You have completed your duty here.

688
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,855
But you haven't done your duty yet.

689
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:36,114
What duty?

690
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:40,100
Didn't you say the highlight here

691
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,060
was a photo with Mr. Student President?

692
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,590
Do you want to take a photo with me?

693
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:52,182
You stamped the ticket for me when I hadn't even done it yet.

694
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:55,294
Isn't it like I was cheating?

695
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:56,660
Come on.

696
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,670
Come here.

697
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,564
This is the spot, right?

698
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:02,060
Come on.

Guys, if we win Hot Wave, everything will get easier.

719
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:24,300
And if we lose?

720
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,939
We've fought together this far.

00:49:25,939 --> 00:49:27,281
It's not the time to hesitate now.

722

My band members play music for fun.

They didn't expect to get serious about it.

724
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,369
Now I'm thinking if I should go back to studying and apply for a good faculty.

- Can you handle it?
- I can.
