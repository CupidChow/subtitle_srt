00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:40,320
This Friday, Tutor Nop, a famous tutor, will come to our school

333
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,185
and provide a tutoring session at the main auditorium from 1:00 p.m.

334
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:46,119
Why is he rubbing it in?

335
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,879
To give you a better idea of how cool Tutor Nop is,

336
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,350
I'll play you his Physics Formula song as an introduction.

337
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,904
That sounds familiar.

338
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:11,419
Why does Tutor Nop's voice sound like Ai Gun's?

339
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,844
Because that's Ai Gun's voice.

340
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,100
Did Ai Tiw put on the wrong music?

341
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,200
I don't know.

342
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,312
Tiwson.

343
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,669
What song are you playing?

344
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:25,263
This is not Tutor Nop's song.

345
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:27,629
Oh! Did I just play the wrong track?

346
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:32,520
Right. I just put on Chinzhilla's song.

347
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,920
The track is called Just Being Friendly.

348
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,273
I heard they're competing at the Hot Wave Final this Friday.

349
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:44,068
If they win, it will be the first time our school has won the Hot Wave championship.

350
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:47,556
What an event to root for!

351
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:50,135
You can watch the tutoring video again later.

352
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:55,544
But this competition comes once in a lifetime.

353
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,928
Shit. Did they really get to the final?

354
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,039
Really?

355
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,530
- Should we go watch?
- Yes, we should.

356
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,303
- Yes, let's go!
- It should be fun!
- Let's go!

357
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:10,500
That's my band, Juniors.

358
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,039
Please come and cheer for us.

359
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,290
You guys, too, please.

360
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,880
Thank you. Bye.

361
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,095
See you.

362
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,570
Why is Ai Tiw talking so much?

363
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm waiting to hear about Tutor Nop.

364
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,520
Gosh, Ai Por.

365
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,271
Ai Tiw is helping us promote.

366
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:29,504
Don't forget to say thanks.

367
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,010
Come to think of it, Ai Tiwson is very kind.

368
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,599
He's been helping us with many things.

369
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,500
Does he like someone in our group?

370
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,910
- Is it you, Ai Win?
- Did you think before speaking, huh?

371
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,709
Do you have a problem?

372
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,089
Ai Por, is it you?

373
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,732
Right. Is it you, Ai Por?

374
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,736
Does he have a secret crush on you?

375
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:47,269
Huh?

376
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,680
Ai Tiw.

377
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:53,583
Can you please handle

378
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:55,972
the council meeting today?

379
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:58,215
I've got something I have to do.

380
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,860
About Ai Gun's mom, right?

381
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,680
Do your best, man.

382
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,860
What do you think his reaction will be about me not telling him?

383
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:11,570
But his mom asked me not to.

384
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,312
Why is it happening now?

385
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:18,130
Can't it wait until Hot Wave is over?

386
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,487
I think there's only one choice left.

387
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,055
You have to hide it really well,

388
00:27:23,056 --> 00:27:26,948
or you just tell him honestly.

389
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,749
I have to go now.

390
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,464
Good luck, man.

391
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:36,704
Thank you, man.

392
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:47,567
Tinn, are you free this evening?

393
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:50,023
Can you come watch us practice?

394
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:53,012
I want to know if I'm singing any better.

395
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,356
I probably have to run an errand.

396
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,224
What errand?

397
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:10,610
Something about the council.

398
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,340
Is your errand more important than listening to me sing?

399
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,804
No, it's not that.

400
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:19,839
I want to hear you sing, but I don't think I can ditch that.

401
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,139
Right, fine. Then just go ahead with your errand.

402
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,190
I won't bother you anymore.

403
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,293
Ai Gun.

404
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,132
Listen to me.

405

[Incoming Call]

406
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,448
Hello.

407
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:41,232
Yes, I'm her son.

408
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:54,356
Are you okay, Ai Gun?

[Emergency]

412
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,360
The patient is conscious now.

413
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,099
Luckily, someone called an ambulance in time.

414
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,507
The doctor is examining her condition.

415
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,319
I'll call you once it's done.

416
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,853
Yes, Ma'am.

417
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,247
When you said you needed to do something,

418
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,248
was it about my mom?

419
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:01,608
Yes.

420
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,368
How long have you known?

421
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:12,007
More than a week.

422
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,070
More than a week?

423
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,279
And when were you planning on telling me?

424
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,279
Or would it be at her funeral?

425
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,847
It's not that, Ai Gun.

426
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:24,198
Please hear me out first.

427
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,983
The CT scan result came out.

428
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:29,072
Please come inside to talk to the doctor.

429
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,408
I'm coming with you.

430
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,916
Stay the hell out.

431
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,820
She's my mom.

[Emergency]

433
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,319
So there's really a tumor, around the size of a ping pong ball.

434
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,980
It's what causes headaches and unconsciousness.

435
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,648
I suggest you get an operation as soon as possible before it grows bigger.

436
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,336
Will that be dangerous, Doctor?

437
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,215
Honestly, it's an operation that has risks.

438
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:33,639
If it wasn't really necessary, I would have suggested other methods.

439
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,956
But in this case, an operation is inevitable.

440
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,660
Please discuss this together.

441
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,052
Excuse me.

442
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:59,154
This is a serious matter. Why didn't you tell me?

443
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,609
Gun.

444
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,944
I have only you left.

445
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,276
When it was Dad,

446
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:17,312
I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.

447
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,604
On that day,

448
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:27,160
Dad just dropped me off at school like usual.

449
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,884
Please don't leave me like that as well.

450
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,432
If you died, who would I live with?

451
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,208
I can't live alone.

452
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,156

you won't leave me.

I didn't want to worry you.

464

Ai Tinn tattled to you

465
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,644
that I can't sing, didn't he?

466
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,524
You're my son.

467
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:13,828
Of course, I know what's bothering you.

468
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,080
I don't know.

469
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,844
I'm your son, yet I had no idea you're sick.

470
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:32,200
Don't be mad at Tinn.

471
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:36,800
I asked him to cover it up.

472
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,959
If not Tinn, I wouldn't ask anyone else to handle this important matter.

473
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,660
What did he do for you?

474
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,136
Why are you adoring him so much?

475
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,404
He didn't do anything for me.

476
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,128
But he did so many things

477
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:07,828
for my son

478
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,524
that you don't know about, right?

479
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,404
When he was helping out at the shop,

480
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:29,827
I was talking to him and teasing him.

481
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:36,504
I squeezed it out of him until he confessed he has liked you since grade 10.

When he found out your club was about to get terminated,

485
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:54,660
he ran for Student President

486
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,740
to save your club.

487
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,989
About the garlands when you competed in the folk music contest,

488
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:10,384
he was also behind it.

489
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,549
Do you remember when you told me

490
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,647
there was a fan named Lion,

491
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:23,367
who always messaged you and helped with many things?

492
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:25,676
That's the student president.

493
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:33,131
Do you get it now why I told you not to be mad at Tinn?

494
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,164
He's the kind of person you should do your best to keep, Son.

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,412
Why are you out here?

496
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,220
