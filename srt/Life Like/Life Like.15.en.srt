17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,560
Chairman Du,

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,920
it's a wonderful night.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,240
Do be sure to drink more.

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,200
Chairman Du.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
Here's

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
to a fruitful partnership.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,200
Yamamoto,

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
you're being too formal.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,840
Chairman Du.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,360
I think

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,560
Ms. Man Li's had
a little too much to drink.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,120
She's a bit drunk.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
If you're worried,

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,640
I can send her home.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
What do you say?

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,920
You can send her home,

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,440
but don't take advantage of her.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Of course.

35
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,120
Ms. Man Li.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,360
Wake up.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
Go home and sleep it off.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
Easy now.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Where's Musheng?

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,090
He went to take a leak.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,000
The lazy will find
many excuses to avoid work.

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,000
Boss.

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Where's Man Li?

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,120
She drank too much.

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Yamamoto sent her home.

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,160
He also gave a generous gift.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,480
We'll enjoy it later.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,800
What gift?

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,490
You'll see when we get back.

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Do you really like Zhou Musheng?

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,960
A little.

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,400
You know this.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
People like us

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
shouldn't get involved in relationships.

55
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,200
What's more, Zhou Musheng's
with the North City Chamber of Commerce.

56
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,040
He's unreliable.

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
But Hong,

58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
I think he's different from the rest.

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Different how?

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,840
Birds of a feather,
they're all the same.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
He's maybe just better looking.

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,920
(Should I really not let myself
fall for him?)

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,760
Hong,

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm craving cake from Yangtze Hotel.

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Let's go buy some.

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
You'll get fat.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,360
Hong, you're the best.

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,320
You're such a handful.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh, my little darling.

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,640
You smell so nice.

71
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,920
You're a feisty one.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,040
I like that.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
Oh, darling.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,160
We're almost there.

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
Darling,

76
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,640
we're here.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,640
Isn't that Man Li?

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,080
I think it is.

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,680
That man looks a lot like Yamamoto.

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,200
What's she doing with him?

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Let's follow them.

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,280
Come on.

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
We're almost there.

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
Don't worry. We'll be home in no time.

85
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
Oh, darling!

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
I think

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
she's been drugged.

88
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,840
Seems like it.

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
After everything she did to you,
should we still help her?

90
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,840
Regardless,

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
we can't let Yamamoto
take advantage of her.

92
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,680
Come on.

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
Ms. Man Li,

94
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,440
you've finally

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,040
fallen into my hands.

96
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,800
You wench!

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
How dare you hit me!

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,880
Excuse me.

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I'd like to ask

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,720
about the room ahead…

101
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,200
Man Li. Man Li.

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,880
(What exactly
did Yamamoto give as a gift?)

103
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,720
(No wonder Liu wasn't at dinner today.)

104
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,160
Hey.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
I haven't seen Liu all day.

106
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Where is he?

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Is he not back yet?

108
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,520
Oh.

109
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,960
He went to Yamamoto's place.

110
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,760
He's busy.

111
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
To Yamamoto's? For what?

112
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,160
Apparently,
Yamamoto prepared a hefty present.

113
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,800
He went specifically to fetch it.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,980
What exactly is the gift?

115
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,320
Oh,

116
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,280
how should I know?

117
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,920
Just wait and see.

118
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
Anything else?

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
If not, I'm going to the restroom.

120
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,320
Zhou Musheng.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
The boss wants to see us.

122
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,520
Coming.

123
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Spill it!

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
Speak!

125
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,680
Answer me!

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,240
Speak!

127
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,040
Or I'll kill you!

128
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,920
Mr. Yamamoto.

129
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,480
The goods

130
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,120
you wanted are ready.

131
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,080
They'll be delivered on time tomorrow.

132
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,560
There's a mole inside

133
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,960
the North City Chamber of Commerce.

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,280
Get Tan Fei to talk

135
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,560
and you'll know who it is.

136
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,920
Talk.

137
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
Who allowed you to take that shipment?

138
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,080
I don't know what you're talking about…

139
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,440
Don't play dumb.

140
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,480
To live

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
or die,

142
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,160
the choice is yours.

143
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,680
I don't know what to say…

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Speak up! Say it!

145
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
Who's the mole?

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Liu.

147
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Bring him in.

148
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,920
What happened?

149
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,720
There's a traitor among us…

150
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
You're both students.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
Get your buddy to talk.

152
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
Tan Fei,

153
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,120
I can't stand this torture anymore.

154
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,040
Stop holding out.

155
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,160
Just tell them.

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
