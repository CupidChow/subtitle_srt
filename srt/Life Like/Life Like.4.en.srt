How do you know I got shot

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,800
because of Du Hongyue?

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,240
It's Liu.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,760
Liu told me.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,280
Why would Liu tell you that?

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,960
That's what he told me.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,480
Believe it or not.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,440
Hey.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,520
Who leaked the news?

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
Everyone's been contained?

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,760
Handed over to Man Li.

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Please spare us.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,520
We didn't betray you.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,200
It wasn't us!

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Betray the Chamber,

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
and this is what you get.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,920
Your aim's getting better and better.

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,240
No wonder you're
our Chamber's sharpshooter.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Of course.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
Thanks to your guidance.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,560
What's it got to do with me?

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Bad luck.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
Zhou Musheng, new at the liaison office,

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,680
took a bullet for me during a deal.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,520
He's still in the hospital.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
Zhou Musheng?

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,320
From Nanpu School?

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,480
Yes.

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,360
I used to teach him at Nanpu School.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
He's your senior, in a way.

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,160
I remember him.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360
He was a star at our school.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,760
Two years above me.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Since you know each other,

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
come with me,

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
let's visit him in the hospital.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,920
How's his injury?

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,080
Is his life in danger?

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Why do you care so much?

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,520
It's normal to care for
a fellow schoolmate.

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,440
You talk too much.

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,680
Look at her!

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,320
She snaps at me every time.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,600
You

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
don't start trouble.

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,080
Don't provoke our Miss.

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,280
Or you'll get scolded.

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
Boss.

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,880
You're so obviously biased!

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Hey, Boss!

67
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,240
So, are we going to the hospital?

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Of course we're going.

69
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
If not the hospital, where else?

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,880
Quit it, or we'll end up in a ditch!

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,040
Musheng.

72
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,240
Feeling better?

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,960
Much better, sir.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
Senior. Do you still remember me?

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,880
Man Li.

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,400
You...

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,760
Man Li

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
is a key member of our Chamber.

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
You're her senior.

80
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,240
From now on,

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
take good care of her.

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
So, Man Li

83
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,840
is with you too, sir?

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,920
Then from now on,

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,360
please be patient with me.

86
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,080
Hey,

87
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
enough already.

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,080
He's still injured.

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,440
Get well soon.

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Thank you, Yao.

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,920
Sir.

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,280
The doctor said

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm almost fully recovered.

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,200
After a few days' rest at home,

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,840
I can return to work.

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,280
Rest a few more days at home.

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
When you're fully recovered,

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,200
come back to work.

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,080
Senior.

100
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
When you're recovered,

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
I'll come visit you at home.

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
No need, that's too much trouble.

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,960
Alright.

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Get some rest.

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,360
We'll take our leave now.

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,920
Okay, sir.

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,960
Musheng.

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,080
Have an orange.

109
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,280
Hey.

110
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,240
You sly fox.

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,000
Using five scoundrels as scapegoats.

112
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,480
Killing two birds with one stone.

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Sometimes you need a villain's way

114
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,520
to beat a villain.

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
Impressive.

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,520
Thanks for the compliment.

117
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,120
By the way,

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
how's

119
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Zhou Musheng doing?

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Don't worry.

121
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,300
He's discharged and home now.

122
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,880
Good to hear.

123
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Who is it?

124
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,640
Came to see if you're dead yet.

125
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,280
So vicious for someone so young.

126
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
If I died,

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,880
would you inherit my fortune?

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,320
How's your wound?

129
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,040
So impatient?

130
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm a decent man.

131
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
Not into daytime indecency.

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,920
What are you thinking about?

133
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,360
No wonder.

134
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,440
You got yourself shot.

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,080
See?

136
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,560
A woman's heart is the cruelest.

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,840
I'll do it myself.

138
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,400

Look at this.

It hurts here.

163
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,320

Closer.

167
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,440
A bit closer.

168
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,120
I can't take it anymore.

169
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000

Why are you here?

176
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,360
I made chicken soup just for you.

177
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,200

178
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,720

I'm Musheng's woman.

Musheng is sick,

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,080

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
Don't listen to her nonsense.

194
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,320
Come.

195
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,400
Dalang, take your medicine.

196
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,760
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

197
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,400
Let go.

198
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,800
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

199
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,280
Hot!

200
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,720
I...

201
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,680
I'll get a towel!

202
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,680
Here.

203
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,720
I'll wipe it for you.

204
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,240
I'll do it.

205
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,160
I'll do it.

206
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,640
I'll wipe it.

207
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,090
I'll do it.

208
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,600
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

209
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,920
Or

210
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
should I do it instead?

211
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,680
Are you okay?

212
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,280
Senior.

213
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,640
Your wound's healed,

214
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,900
better head back to the Chamber.

215
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,040
Take care.

216
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,880
Why is

217
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,760
Rose here?

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,640
That girl is amazing.

219
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
When she first came to Night Shanghai,

220
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,600
those big bosses adored her, loved her
to death, loved her like a toy motorcycle.

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,120
Shut up.

222
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,000
Go home.

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Senior.

224
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
The way your junior calls you

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,440
feels so affectionate.

226
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,840
Wipe it yourself.

227
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,060
(Night Shanghai)

228
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,960
I...

229
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,560
I...

230
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,120
Hong.

231
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
You're going to kill me.

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,640
Why are you here, Hong?

233
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,600
I've got something to tell you.

234
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,200
I heard

235
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,480
that batch of arms
was safely delivered to the front.

236
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,440
Good.

237
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
Shows that Cao Yu

238
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
can still handle things.

239
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,280
Here.

240
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
New mission.

241
