Yao?

You're here this early morning.

69
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,360
Is it something urgent?

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,520
Morning?

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
Look at the time now.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,680
Are you without a watch?

73
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,560

into my place last night.

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240

75
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,400
You were lucky enough

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,600
to wake up late.

77
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,360
Captain Luo.

78
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,280
Good morning.

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,320
Morning...

80
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,920
Good morning, Ms. Rose.

81
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,760
Who would wake up sleeping next to her?

82
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,280
Well,

83
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,920
Yao,

84
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,640
have a seat here.

85
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,920
Go back inside and put on some clothes.

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
Yao.

87
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,480
Why are you here this early morning?

88
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,680
Yamamoto will be holding a banquet.

89
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,960
Boss wants you to join it.

90
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,480
(Yamamoto...)

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
(That's a Japanese.)

92
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,640
Today?

93
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,800
Now.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Oh?

95
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,760
If so, I'll go get ready now.

96
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,640
Go ahead.

97
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
Get yourself ready.

98
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,880
I'll wait for you here.

99
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
You should wait outside.

100
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,660
Wait for me out there.

101
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,200
I was standing there for so long.

102
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,200
Wait...

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,620
It's all right to wait for you in there.

104
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,720
Wait...

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,480
Hey.

106
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Hurry up.

107
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,840
What's the matter?

108
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
You seem distracted.

109
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,640
Yamamoto

110
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
is a Japanese?

111
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Zhou Musheng.

112
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
Quick.

113
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,480
Coming.

114
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm off.

115
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,040
Mm.

116
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
Xu.

117
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
Head to the tailor's.

118
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Your outfits are ready.

119
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,440
That was fast.

120
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,600
Didn't you say it'd take several days?

121
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,200
Those outfits are for you.

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,240
Of course I had to make it quick.

123
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Wait for my return.

124
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,840
Zhou Musheng.

125
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,920
Well,

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
come home soon.

127
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,360
Sure.

128
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,160
Let's go, Yao.

129
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,560
Let's go.

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,520
Captain Luo.

131
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,480
Good luck.

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,400
Sure thing!

133
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,640
This has been an extraordinary day.

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,200
(What is she)

135
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,920
(up to again?)

136
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm telling you, Yamamoto.

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,320
Du Hongyue has never trusted me.

138
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,000
When it comes to you, he...

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,880
Do you get it?

140
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,400
Are you telling the truth?

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,680
Playing dumb, huh?

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
You know it all too well.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,240
Someday,

144
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,640
if I

145
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,560
become the chairman
of North City Chamber of Commerce,

146
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,080
I will take our chamber of commerce

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
to new heights.

148
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
It belongs to me

149
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
and you.

150
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,720
As soon as

151
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,040
I get rid of him.

152
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Here.
