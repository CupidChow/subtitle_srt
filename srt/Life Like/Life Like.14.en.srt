Tanghulu!

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
Plump and sweet tanghulu!

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,320
Hello,

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,040
children.

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,400
Want one of these tanghulu?

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,200
It's free
if you don't find it sweet.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
I want to eat tanghulu, Yi.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
You glutton.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,320
All you do is eat.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,520
You'd lose all your teeth
from all these sweets.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm not afraid of that.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
I just want to eat it!

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,480
Fine.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,120
One tanghulu, please.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Here,

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
take it.

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,320
Xu.

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,850
There you go.

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,080
You eat first.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,240
You go first.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,440
It's so sweet!

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,080
This is so fun!

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,920
How fun!

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
This is so exciting!

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Rose?

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,640
Why are you here?

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Detective Cao.

45
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,250
I'm here to collect my outfits.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you usually

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,760
have yours made here?

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,800
My friend recommended it to me.

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,640
Here you are.

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,000
Sure.

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,280
Well,

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,320
has Mr. Zhou been busy these days?

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,980
It's been a while
since he was last here.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
I have no idea either.

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,320
Here you go.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,840
Mm.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,620
Just leave it to me.

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,200
Detective Cao.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,640
I'll head back now.

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,080
Well,

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,240
Rose

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,480
is Zhou Musheng's girlfriend.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
I know something more juicy.

64
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,490
Want to hear about it?

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Cut to the chase and tell me already.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,040
Rose

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,440
is Red Bean.

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,000
Red Bean is Rose.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Zhou Musheng is unbelievable.

70
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,900
(Yamamoto)

71
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,520
The big fish

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,800
is taking the bait soon.

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,560
Chairman Du.

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Long time no see.

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,120
It's been a while,

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,200
Yamamoto.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,720
Well,

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,600
how fortunate you are.

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
You have

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,440
such a beauty with you.

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,680
I really envy you.

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,000
You flatter me, Mr. Yamamoto.

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
These two

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
are my students

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
and capable assistants.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
(They're now his capable assistants.)

87
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
(What am I to him, then?)

88
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,690
I've heard a lot about you,

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Musheng.

90
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,640
Mr. Yamamoto.

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,680
(Darn it.)

92
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
(After everything I've done for you,)

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,320
(I'm still less than this Zhou Musheng.)

94
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,680
Everyone.

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
This way, please.

96
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
Ms. Man Li.

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,720
Will you

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
sit next to me?

99
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Everyone,

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,800
may we have a pleasant cooperation.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,640
Let us have a toast to that.

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,320
(Cooperation?)

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,000
(Looks like
Du Hongyue's dropped the act.)

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,240
(He's going to work
with this Japanese man openly.)

105
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,380
May our cooperation be a pleasant one.

106
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,480
However, Yamamoto,

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
considering how things are,

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,200
we still need to keep a low profile.

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,780
That will ensure
our long-term cooperation.

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,320
What say you?

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,760
Of course.

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
How thoughtful you are.

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,000
Cheers.

114
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,960
(Darn it.)

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,720
(Trying to stay reputable
while doing evil, huh?)

116
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,720
Ms. Man Li.

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,280
Will you have a drink

118
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
with me?

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,400
I should give a toast
to you, Mr. Yamamoto.

120
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,760
How smooth and delicate your hand are.

121
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,920
You sure can hold your liquor.

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,480
(What a shameless thing.)

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
Mr. Du.

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,840
Could I have a word with you out there?

125
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,960
Sure.

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,960
Let's go.

127
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
Everyone, please enjoy your meal.

128
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Senior.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Where are you going?

130
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
I need

131
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,920
to use the washroom.

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
Here, Man Li. It's just two of us here.

133
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
Let's drink.

134
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,640
As if I haven't had enough of it.

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,720
Go away.

136
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,800
Wait a second.

137
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,280
You could entertain that man just now.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,040
But you refuse to drink with me?

139
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,390
Are you looking down on me?

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
Yes.

141
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
Here, Captain Luo.

142
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,760
It's just a drink.

143
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,840
So,

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,640
are you happy now?

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,040
Among all the women I know,

146
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
I admire you the most. I mean it.

147
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,400
You've been honey-tongued today.

148
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
Have you done something wrong?

149
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Do you hear yourself?

150
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,520
I've always been guilty of something.

151
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,960
Chairman Du.

152
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
Have the drugs ready?

153
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
It's no big deal.

154
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
What matters is

155
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
whether or not

156
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,160
you can pay for them.

157
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
Many people

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
covet them.

159
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,440
We've agreed on the price, no?

160
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
That was before.

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
Chairman Du.

162
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,920
You sure are calculative.

163
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,800
How admirable.

164
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
