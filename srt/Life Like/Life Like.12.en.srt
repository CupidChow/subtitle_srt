It's all right.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
I'm here for you.

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,920
It's time to eat.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:18,880
Hey.

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
Use your chopsticks.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Well, did you make all this?

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,200
Who else could it be?

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,520
Zhou Musheng.

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,080
Thank you.

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,460
What are you thanking me for?

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,420
Thank you for taking care of me.

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,600
I lost my parents when I was young.

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
Apart from Hong,

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,880
no one has ever treated me this kindly.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,840
And...

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,640
What?

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
There's my sister too.

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,440
I have an elder sister.

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
But we got separated

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
many years ago.

37
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm starving, Yi.

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
Xu.

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,040
I'll go get us something to eat.

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,360
Wait for me here.

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
I'll be right back.

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,080
Mm.

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
Make it quick.

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
I'll be waiting for you here,

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
and I won't go anywhere.

46
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,360
It'd been days,

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
but she never returned.

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,760
(Until one day...)

49
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,280
Little girl.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
Why don't you go home?

51
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm homeless!

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,240
Here.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,080
Eat this.

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,080
Slowly.

55
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
Will you come with me?

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Mm.

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Come home with me, okay?

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Besides Yi and Hong,

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,080
you're the first one who made me feel

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,880
well taken care of

61
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,200
and cared for.

62
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm truly grateful.

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,360
Do you still remember

64
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
your original name?

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,320
My name

66
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
is Zhen Xu.

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
Zhen Xu?

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,800
Xu...

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
That makes us

70
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,800
a match made in heaven.

71
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Why do you say so?

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Xu.

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
Musheng.

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Life like.

75
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,200
You've

76
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
got a point.

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
All right.

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,520
For the sake

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,640
of this feast you've got me here,

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,040
I'll take you

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
to a nice place after this.

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

83
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,240
Get this lady some outfits.

84
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,760
We want

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,040
the trendiest styles of all.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,520
Sure.

87
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,240
Here, follow me.

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Not only is this lady pretty,

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
but she also has a nice body.

90
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,040
Those outfits will look great on her.

91
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,200
Do you always
have your outfits made here?

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,140
That's right.

93
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,440
Although the tailor

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
is talkative,

95
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
he's rather skilled.

96
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
Oh my.

97
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
Things have been busy here lately.

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,360
It'd take a while
until her outfits are ready.

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
So be patient.

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Work on hers first.

101
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Make it quick.

102
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,160
Why?

103
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,560
Are you in a rush to marry her?

104
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,160
Mm.

105
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm marrying her.

106
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,080
Hurry up.

107
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,800
You talk too much.

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,400
Wait.

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Miss.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I suggest you

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
to think twice before marrying him.

112
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
You need to pay more to take my hand.

113
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,280
What a miser you are.

114
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,160
It's not easy to make money
in this difficult world.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
We're off.

116
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,740
(Rose is Red Bean.)

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,200
Boss.

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
Yamamoto called

119
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,860
and invited us to have a meal
with him tomorrow.

120
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
He's here in Shanghai?

121
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
Yes.

122
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Judging from his tone,

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
he'll be here for some time.

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
Make an appointment with him.

125
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
We'll do it together

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
with Zhou Musheng.

127
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,200
Huh?

128
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Fine.

129
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
Just spit it out.

130
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
Do you find Zhou Musheng

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,920
trustworthy?

132
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
Whether or not he's a loyal subject,

133
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,960
I should make him work.

134
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,320
