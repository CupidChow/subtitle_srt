Tan Fei,

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
Stop holding out.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,040
Just tell them.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
Life will be easier.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
Traitor.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,760
You're just a flyer boy.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,200
What do you even know?

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,000
An easier life, huh?

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,800
And you know better?

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Then talk!

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
This isn't the place

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
to play hero.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,200
Stop dreaming.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,840
I can die,

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,880
but I'll never sell anyone out.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,960
Still acting tough?

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,920
I'll make you…

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Liu.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,920
Allow me.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,200
Go ahead.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,920
Teach him a lesson.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,040
Talk!

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,400
Talk!

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
Talk!

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,200
You're awake?

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,480
Wait here.

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll get you something to eat.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,280
Mom…

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
Mom…

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,960
Get inside, quick!

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Mom…

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,880
Shh.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,920
No matter what happens,
don't make a sound.

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't come out.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,990
Take care of your sister.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,680
Mom…

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,400
Shh.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,600
Xu,

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm going to find some food.

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
Wait here.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,520
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,480
Okay.

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,960
Come back soon.

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,640
I'll be right here.

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,760
I won't go anywhere.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,880
Xu!

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Xu!

64
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,080
Xu!

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,720
(Xu,)

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,360
(is that you?)

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,160
Such a pretty face.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Hit her!

69
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:35,752
Have some porridge.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't act all kind now.

71
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't need you
to meddle in my business.

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,200
You need to eat
to have the strength to yell at me.

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
I'll feed you.

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
Eat.

75
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
Cry if you want.

76
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,000
You'll

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,520
feel better.

78
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Man Li…

79
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
Idiot! What are you doing in my bed?

80
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,720
Idiot!

81
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,760
Get out!

82
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,680
Sleep a little more.

83
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,960
Get up and put on my clothes.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,040
I need to go out.

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
Where are you going?

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
To Night Shanghai.

87
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,520
Chairman Du.

88
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,440
I think

89
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,280
Ms. Man Li's had
a little too much to drink.

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
She's a bit drunk.

91
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,600
If you're worried, I can send her home.

92
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,280
You can send her home,

93
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
but don't take advantage of her.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
(Du Hongyue.)

95
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,080
(My so-called master…)

96
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,520
- Ms. Man Li.
- Ms. Man Li.

97
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,080
Get lost!

98
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
Du Hongyue, come out here!

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,400
Dad!

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,920
Hey.

101
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,080
What's this?

102
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,120
Dad,

103
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,840
this jade pendant's so pretty.

104
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,400
It's our family heirloom.

105
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,960
When you grow up and get married,

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
I'll pass it to you. All right?

107
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Okay.

108
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
(Du Hongyue,)

109
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
(so it was you!)

110
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,280
Tell us now,

111
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,960
and maybe we might let you live.

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
The mole is…

113
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
This is no good!

114
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
He bit his tongue!

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,200
Quick! Pry his mouth open!

116
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Get up!

117
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,360
Wake up!

118
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
Finish your sentence before you die!

119
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,200
Get him to the hospital.

120
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,600
I want him alive.

121
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
(Tan Fei's final words)

122
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
(revealed two things.)

123
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,920
(One,)

124
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
(he'd rather die than betray anyone.)

125
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,000
(Two,)

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,720
(the mole knew nothing.)

127
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
(It was his final consolation,)

128
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,400
(and Zhou Musheng's
worst fear confirmed.)

129
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Mr. Yamamoto.

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,320

They'll be delivered on time tomorrow.
