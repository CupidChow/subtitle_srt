Du Hongyue.
The North City Chamber of Commerce.

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,560
Are they really worth your loyalty?

Why are you being so nice?

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
Because I missed you.

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,680

92
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160
Tell me.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,040
How did you end up getting caught?

94
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
We intercepted

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,160
Du Hongyue's shipment
for the higher-ups.

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880

Senior,

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,600
I overheard something.

102
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,560
Yamamoto and his men

103
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,840
are going to the Chamber
of Commerce for medicine.

104
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,440
If you ask me,

105
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,720
that's their real objective.

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,040

107
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,440

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,240

Captain Luo wants some water.

112
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,840
Give it to him.

113
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,720
Didn't you say you wanted water?

114
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Come on, drink.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000

116
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,320
Up here.

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,480

118
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,280

121
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,320

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,280
Look.

124
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,600
Open the door.

125
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,440
Just a sip.

126
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,200
Wait here.

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Drink.

128
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,160

132
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,280
make me carry all this stuff and

133
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,720
stand here talking to you, did you?

134
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,800
Oh.

135
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,760
Come in.

136

Don't be so nervous.

137
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,920
I'm here to see Rose.

139
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,600
Grocery shopping.

140
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
What are you standing for?

141
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,600
Sit down.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600

No, thank you.

148
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
You really love Xu.

149
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,520
You take care of her.

150
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,040
You protect her.

151
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080

152
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,440
you treat her badly,

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
I will never stop haunting you.

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,680
my brother-in-law.

164

stay for lunch.
