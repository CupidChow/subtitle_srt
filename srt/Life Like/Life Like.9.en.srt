Here.

I'll get us a better ride next time.

Hey…

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,760
I won't let it happen again.

That's all
the great Night Shanghai star's

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,760
giving me?

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Take it or leave it.

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,920
I'll take it.

55
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,680
We're here.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,400
Let's go.

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
Boss, about the medicine shipment
for Yamamoto…

58
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll give him a call tonight.

59
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,800
We'll coordinate then.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,080
What's wrong?

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Are you scared?

62
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,040
No.

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
A bug flew into my eye.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,560
Better?

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,320
Mm.

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh?

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
You're here, Musheng.

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Yue.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,680
Yao.

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,880
Chairman Du.

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Captain Luo.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, well,

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,720
Musheng sure has a way with women.

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,640
Won over Ms. Rose herself.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,040
All thanks to you, Yao,

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
for arranging our meeting.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,080
If it isn't the star of Night Shanghai.

78
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,560
The Rose in daylight is even
more captivating than at night.

79
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,920
Thanks for the compliment, Captain Luo.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
Let's start the feast.

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,840
The wine's here!

82
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,480
Come on.

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,500
Pour one out for the Boss.

84
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,680
Here.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,440
Why is she everywhere?

86
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,600
Ms. Rose is Musheng's friend.

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,720
Friend,

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,880
not wife.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
Well, well.

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
Who's upset the princess

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,280
of the North City Chamber of Commerce?

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,360
Ms. Man Li's upset.

93
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,840
This should be fun to watch.

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Shut your trap.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Here.

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Musheng,

97
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,720
this first drink's for you.

98
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,320
You saved my life.

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,320
Yue,

100
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,240
don't say that.

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,520
You're making me embarrassed.

102
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,760
Chairman Du,

103
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,920
let me toast you.

104
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
Thank you for looking after Musheng.

105
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Drink slowly.

106
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm fine.

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Some women can be so spoiled.

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,840
Rose,

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,600
here.

110
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
A toast to you.

111
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm glad you came.

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
Ms. Rose.

113
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
Let me give you a toast.

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,600
Oh, dear.

115
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,280
Rose,

116
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,440
your dress is soaked.

117
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Maybe

118
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,400
you should take care of that?

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
I'll go freshen up.

120
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,880
I'm sure

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
you didn't mean

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
to spill.

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,800
You…

124
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Give me a hand!

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Let's carry on.

126
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

127
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,720
Bottoms up!

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,060
No one's leaving till we're all drunk.

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,880
Keep going.

130
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,440
Come on.

131
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,960
What's up?

132
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,640
We haven't decided the winner yet, right?

133
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm afraid of you?

134
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,120
Go on!

135
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
Yao, play him!

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,560
Come on.

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
Hurry up!

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,520
Come on.

139
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,080
Drink!

140
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,640
See?

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,280
You lost.

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
Musheng's got skills.

143
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
Luo Zhenyao can't keep up.

144
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,160
Idiot.

145
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,400
You sure you got this?

146
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,840
Get up, you.

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,040
Six.

148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,160
Six.

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Five!

150
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,200
Musheng lost.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Come on. Drink!

152
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
You're not any better, Musheng.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
Chairman Du.

154
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,720
Ms. Rose.

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,840
Ms. Rose, Musheng's had
too much to drink.

156
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,160
You should stay

157
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,120
and take care of him tonight.

158
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,280
Of course.

159
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,840
You really

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,040
don't miss a chance

161
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,120
to charm everyone, do you?

162
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,800
You guys stay too.

163
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,320
Play some mahjong.

164
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,240
Loosen up a little.

165
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,400
Musheng.

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,920
Time to play some mahjong…

167
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,720
Come on. Hurry up!

168
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,520
Everything's ready.

169
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,520
Come on. Let's play some mahjong.

170
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,480
Let's play mahjong.

171
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,620
We've been waiting for everyone
to gather for a game.

172
