00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,400
- Did you find it?
- Did you find it?

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
When I arrived,

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Mr. Song was already dead.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
What's this?

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,400
Something I found at Mr. Song's house.

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Red Bean?

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,400
At the Song Residence,

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,920
I saw a silhouette that looked a lot
like Rose from Night Shanghai.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
I suspect

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
Rose is actually Red Bean.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
If

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,200
Rose really is Red Bean,

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,320
then she might know
where the students are.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,280
I've tested her,

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,640
but found no flaw.

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
So that means,

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,080
Red Bean is quite a heroine.

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,040
She only kills those who deserve to die.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,240
If I could meet her,

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,900
that'd be a blessing of three lifetimes.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,960
If she joined our cause,

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,000
we'd be unstoppable, right?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,760
Wouldn't we?

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,000
You wish.

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,480
Hey,

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,960
if Rose really is Red Bean,

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,880
then when necessary,

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,240
you could use
those special methods of yours

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,400
to test her.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,760
Yeah,

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,320
try her out.

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,240
Get lost, both of you!

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,360
What's this?

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,040
Something I found at Mr. Song's house.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
It's all just names

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,640
and a key.

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Keep it for now.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,240
Might come in handy later.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Hey,

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
got a light?

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,720
Any progress today?

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,760
Progress?

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,000
Nothing found.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This place

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
is like a ghost town every day.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,640
Then why are you still standing here?

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Hey!

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,240
Musheng,

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,000
what a coincidence!

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,120
I was just passing by your place.

67
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll leave you be.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,600
I'll go now.

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Go on!

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,000
Silly.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Boss,

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,600
the spies we planted
near Zhou Musheng's house

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
have all been exposed.

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,640
A bunch of fools!

75
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,760
Can't even handle something so simple!

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
Send a few sharper ones next time.

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes, Boss.

78
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,760
I'll arrange it right away.

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Yao.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,600
Sir.

81
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
Musheng,

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
how's your recovery going?

83
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Thanks for asking, sir.

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm almost fully recovered.

85
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,680
Don't call me sir,
it sounds too distant.

86
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Just call me Yue.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,040
I wouldn't dare.

88
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
You risked your life

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,520
and took a bullet for me.

90
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,560
From now on,

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
you're my brother.

92
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,520
Then,

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,640
I'll take you at your word.

94
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,960
Yue.

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Oh wow,

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,000
Miss Man Li seems cheerful today.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
The flowers smell nice.

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Keep your nose away from me.

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
Who are they for?

100
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,040
Of course

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
it's for Zhou Musheng.

102
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,640
That's not appropriate.

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,280
What do you mean?

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
Let me explain it to you.

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
You like Zhou Musheng,

106
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
and you're giving him roses.

107
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,680
Think about him and Rose,

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,280
so you chose the wrong flower.

109
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Then,

110
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
what should I give?

111
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,560
Chrysanthemums.

112
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
They fit perfectly.

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,320
Nothing nice ever comes from you.

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,120
Good luck.

115
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
I heard

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Mr. Song was killed.

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,920
I heard that.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,320
He smuggled weapons
and medicine for the Japanese.

119
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Must have been very rich.

120
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
A real traitor.

121
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,480
But now he's dead.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
No use keeping those treasures

123
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
at his house.

124
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,440
I get it.

125
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
I'll go talk to his family.

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,000
Talk how?

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,280
Make them understand what's best.

128
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,320
They'll get the point.

129
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,400
I told Luo Zhenyao

130
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,840
to handle this.

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,240
But I don't trust him.

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,800
You go instead.

133
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,120
Remember,

134
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,840
keep it quiet.

135
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
Don't worry.

136
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,680
Even ghosts won't know.

137
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
It's not ghosts I fear.

138
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
It's people

139
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,040
worse than ghosts.

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,800
Musheng.

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,760
For you.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,240
Hope you recover soon.

143
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm fine already.

144
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,600
Thanks.

145
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,920
Man Li.

146
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,920
You're getting more and more unruly.

147
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,960
Yue.

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,480
Don't tell me you're mad at this?

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Yue,

150
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
I want

151
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,960
to have dinner with Zhou Musheng.

152
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,720
Is that okay?

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,120
You really leave me no choice.

154
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
Be back early.

155
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,880
Okay.

156
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Hello, both of you.

157
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,560
Right this way.

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,240
This way, please.

159
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
What would you like to order?

160
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,120
Two sirloin steaks.

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
One bottle of red wine.

162
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:31,960
Thanks.

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,800
Sure.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
Drinking at noon?

165
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,160
Won't Yue mind?

166
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,160
It's fine. He's used to it.

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,480
He treats you quite well.

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,480
I help him a lot.

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
So for little things,

170
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,160
he turns a blind eye.

171
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
Both eyes, sometimes.

172
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,240
Man Li. I've got something to do.

173
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,240
Can't stay for lunch.

174
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,690
Next time.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,320
Promise.

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,640
Hey.

177
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,560
Senior.

178
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,240
Musheng.

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
Come.

180
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,590
I'll show you something.

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,760
(The moment he sees
that little fox, Rose,)

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,120
(he loses his soul.)

183

(Song Residence)

184
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
Why did you bring me here?

185
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
You'll see soon.

186
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
