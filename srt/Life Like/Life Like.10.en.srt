17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
Boss,

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm tired. I don't want to play anymore.

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,080
Win a bit of money,
and she's already trying to run.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,520
That's Man Li for you.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,680
Get some sleep.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Tomorrow,
we'll have Man Li treat us to a meal.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,120
Sure, as long as you pay for it, Boss.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,400
All right.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,520
As you wish.

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
What are you up to,

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,760
skulking around at this hour?

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Were you waiting for Zhou Musheng
to fall asleep so you could go out

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,760
looking for excitement?

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Yao,

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,040
what's that supposed to mean?

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
Don't play innocent with me.

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,080
Everyone knows what you're after.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,400
I have no idea

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
what you're talking about.

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
You're sticking with Zhou Musheng

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
because you want someone powerful
to depend on.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,320
So, be my woman instead.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm more reliable.

40
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
When you run
the North City Chamber of Commerce,

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,160
I'll hold onto you tight.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,960
But you don't call the shots yet.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
Oh, come on…

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,320
That's only

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,080
a matter of time…

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,960
Hey!

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Took you long enough to get that water.

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,480
You…

49
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,240
Yao.

50
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
You even woke Yao up.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,680
I got lost on my way back.

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,720
All the rooms look the same.

53
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,720
Enough.

54
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,080
Yao, we'll let you rest.

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,040
Say good night to Yao.

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,800
Good night.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
We're leaving, Yao.

58
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,104
(Zhou Musheng,)

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,240
(don't get too full of yourself yet.)

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,480
I was only getting a glass of water.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,160
Next time, tell me
what you're going to do

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,400
and where you're going first.

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
There are too many eyes watching you.

64
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,660
It's not safe out there.

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,600
Got it?

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,640
Got it.

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
And

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,040
stay away from Luo Zhenyao.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
Are you jealous?

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,640
Yes.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,880
You're cute when you're jealous.

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,640
I like seeing you like this.

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,360
Do you like that?

74
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,400
Zhou Musheng.

75
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
You're awake.

76
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,480
You wrinkled my dress.

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
I've got

78
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,480
to get back to work.

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,120
If I stay any longer,

80
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
I won't be able to feed myself.

81
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,760
Can't you stay?

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,680
Stay?

83
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,420
Are you going to take care of me, then?

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,960
I can do that.

85
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
You better keep your word, then.

86
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,800
They're probably still asleep.

87
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,320
Tell them

88
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,600
I left.

89
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Be careful.

90
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
You didn't buckle your shoes.

91
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
Silly girl.

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,640
Time to go.

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,760
Mm.

94
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,920
I'm off, then.

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
Musheng.

96
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,880
I've liked you since we were in school.

97
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,960
Do you know
how many years I've liked you?

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Man Li,

99
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
you saw it yourself.

100
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
I already have a girlfriend.

101
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,920
Am I not even

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
as good as a performer
from Night Shanghai?

103
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
You're an outstanding woman.

104
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
You'll find someone better.

105
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
I don't want them.

106
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,840
You're the only one I want…

107
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,240
Control yourself.

108
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
(That vixen.)

109
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,080
(She'll pay for this.)

110
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,840
Boss.

111
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,440
I think Man Li's really fallen

112
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
for Zhou Musheng.

113
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,480
But he doesn't seem to feel the same.

114
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
They're both

115
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,480
your students.

116
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,320
Why not help them out a little?

117
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,840
Who does Rose think she is?

118
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,520
She's just a performer.

119
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,280
Stop meddling
in other people's business.

120
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,720
Focus on your own.

121
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,920
Yamamoto's coming

122
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,920
in a few days.

123
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,400
Oh, right.

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,200
He's here

125
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
to talk about the medicine deal.

126
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
I've already set everything up.

127
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,520
