16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,480
A series of assassinations have occurred
throughout the country.

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
The methods were distinct,

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,400
clean, and precise.

19
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,520
All victims were traitors of the nation,
collaborators, or gang leaders.

20
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
For a time,
there was bloodshed and chaos,

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,840
yet everyone applauded.

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,120
No one knew who the killer was,

23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,880
only that they went

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,000
by the codename

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200

You're back.

29
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,600
Mm.

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
How did it go?

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,440
Tell me!

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,560
Hong,

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,160
you still don't trust me to handle things?

34
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,620
Of course, everything went smoothly.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
Good.

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,720
After your set,
head to the private room.

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,720
Chairman Du from the North City Chamber
of Commerce wants to see you.

38
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,800
North City Chamber of Commerce?

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,320
Musheng.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
You ready yet?

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
The boss is here.

42
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
Oh.

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
Yeah, I'm ready.

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Boss.

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,440
Musheng's here.

Yao.

47
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,280
Sir,

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,720
it's been a while.

49
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,960
I've been waiting

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,760
for your arrival.

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,280
Sit.

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,640
Let me introduce you.

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,400
This is

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,160
Captain Luo, head of the North City
Chamber of Commerce's

55
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
operations unit.

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
Zhou Musheng.

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,240
He was a prominent figure
in our school back then.

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,480
Now, he's running the liaison office

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,590
for the Chamber of Commerce.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
I expect

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,920
you two to work well together.

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Captain Luo.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,680
I look forward

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
to working with you.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
Have we met before?

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Hong said

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
I should bring a bottle

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,640
to liven things up.

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll start

70
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
with a toast to you.

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
Bottoms up. Please, go at your own pace.

72
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,560
Straightforward.

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,640
Ms. Rose.

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,160
It's no wonder
you're the belle of Night Shanghai.

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,040
Musheng's an important guest tonight.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,280
Take good care of him.

77
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
Of course.

78
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,440
All right, then.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,640
I'll get going.

80
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,680
Zhenyao.

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,040
Make sure Musheng gets home later.

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,360
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,840
Have you got his accommodation sorted?

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,720
Yes, sir.

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,360
Musheng,

86
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
enjoy yourself.

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Ms. Rose,

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
take good care of Musheng.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,680

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,640
