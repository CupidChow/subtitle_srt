17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,120
Boss, you wanted to see me?

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,920
Did you

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,240
send Zhou Musheng back last night?

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Yeah, we did.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,920
He even took Rose home.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,920
As the saying goes,

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,280
even heroes stumble
when faced with a beauty.

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,640
(Who knew
Zhou Musheng was such a gentleman?)

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,800
(This is a pleasant surprise.)

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,240
You didn't see

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
how many positions they…

28
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,320
Musheng.

29
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,200
You're here.

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,920
Sir.

31
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,240
Sir.

32
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
I hope I didn't disturb you.

33
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
Not at all.

34
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,160
Musheng.

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
You must be tired after last night.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
It's a good thing you're young.

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,920
You don't look run down.

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,400
You tease.

39
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,640
Sir.

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,320
I heard

41
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,000
you like this kind of thing.

42
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,120
This is from my hometown.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,560
They say

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,360
it came from the palace.

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,440
Your family owns

46
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
these sorts of rare items?

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,670
It was passed down through generations.

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,560
It's not worth much.

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,980
It's just a little something from me.

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,440
Please accept it.

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
There's an operation tonight.

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
Wait in the office.

53
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,800
When the time's set,

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
I'll have Liu notify you.

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,160
What operation?

56
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,360
A while back,

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
we intercepted a weapons shipment.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,320
We found a buyer, so I figured
we should deal with it.

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
We should move it off our hands quickly.

60
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
What happened?

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,520
There's a traitor among us…

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Understood.

63
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
Who are you looking for?

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh,

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
isn't this Ms. Rose?

66
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,440
What brings you here?

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm looking for Zhou Musheng.

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,400
Please.

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
(This is a test.)

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,920
(Zhou Musheng knows
that this batch of weapons)

71
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,200
(was the one the North City
Chamber of Commerce intercepted,)

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320
(the shipment meant for the front.)

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,120
(However, he can't leave now.)

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,560
(How can he get the word out?)

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
He's inside.

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,240
Go on in.

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
What are you doing here?

78
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,800
You just took up your new post.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
I came

80
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,640
to congratulate you.

81
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm just a singer at Night Shanghai.

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't understand any of this stuff.

83
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160
You only came

84
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
to congratulate me?

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
You told me

86
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
to put on a good show last night.

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm here to perform for you.

88
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,040
Oh!

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,280
Sorry!

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,000
My goodness!

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In the office?

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
Well, I'll be going then…

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,080
What's wrong?

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,480
Liu, did you need something?

95
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
Sorry

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,160
to interrupt.

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,760
Not at all.

98
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,480
We were just…

99
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,120
Hey.

100
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,160
You don't have to explain.

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,040
I get it.

102
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,160
There's business.

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
7 PM tonight,

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
Riverside Pier.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
I'll head off now.

106
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Goodbye, Liu.

107
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Carry on.

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,060
Since I'm not needed here,

109
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll take my leave too.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Wait.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're leaving so soon?

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,400
I don't want to keep you from work.

113
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
I was supposed

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,790
to pick up clothes from the tailor
this afternoon.

115
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,780
Something came up.

116
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,760
I can't make it.

117
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,000
Could you

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
do me a favor

119
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,880
and pick them up?

120
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,480
Musheng,

121
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
am I supposed to start

122
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,880
getting used to this new role?

123
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
We'll both

124
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,920
have to adjust.

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,840
7 PM tonight,

126
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
Riverside Pier.

127
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
(7 PM tonight,)

128
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
(Riverside Pier.)

129
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,680
(It might be that shipment of weapons.)

130
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
I need to check it out.

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,040
Hello.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,780
Zhou Musheng sent me
to pick up his clothes.

133
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,100
(Pickup name: Zhou Musheng)

134
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,320
All right.

135
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,260
Please give me a moment.

136
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,600
What's your relation to him?

137
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
My relation?

138
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,440
You'll have to ask him.

139
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,460
(7 PM tonight, Riverside Pier.)

140
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,960
The shipment
the Chamber of Commerce seized

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,960
will be sold to the Japanese tonight
through Scarface.

142
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,280
Those traitors…

143
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Who's there?

144
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,480
Yue.

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,340
It's been a long time since we last met.

146
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,920
I hope you've been well.

147
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,120
Liu, get the car!

148
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,480
Act

149
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,760
when necessary.

150
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,360
Let's go.

151
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,640
(Oh, no!)

152
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,360
