17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,960
Boss.

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Tan Fei

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,320
confessed.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,380
(Zhou Musheng)

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,360
How could it be Zhou Musheng?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
Why couldn't it be Zhou Musheng?

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,120
Boss,

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,040
haven't you always told me that saying?

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,720
You can know a face, but not a heart.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,480
Liu!

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,880
Boss.

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,520
Bring Zhou Musheng

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,480
to the interrogation room.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,680
Go on.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,680
(Zhou Musheng,)

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,600
(you're finally getting
what's coming to you.)

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,800
What happened to your arm?

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
All for the sake of work.

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,040
It's a small injury.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,240
Go back and get some rest.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,760
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,440
I'll get going then, Boss.

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,720
Talk!

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,920
Still not talking?

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Answer me!

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,440
You think you're tough?

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Let's see if your mouth is tougher
than my whip.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,960
Answer…

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,440
Hold it.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,000
You're my student.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
You should know

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,200
that the sooner you confess,

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,580
the sooner you'll be free.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Sir,

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,960
I know.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
But can I

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,040
ask you a few questions?

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,120
Go on.

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,000
First of all,

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
why did Tan Fei

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,640
suddenly change his attitude?

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Second,

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,280
why did he

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,760
only ask to see Captain Luo?

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
Third,

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,480
I didn't even know

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Tan Fei had woken up.

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Why

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
was he rescued

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
right after Captain Luo showed up?

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,300
What are you trying to say?

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,600
Those are some good questions.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,040
Boss,

71
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,360
actually, I thought

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,680
the same thing too.

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,320
Luo Zhenyao,

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,880
he…

75
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,840
And back when

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,640
Tan Fei tried to kill himself,

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,400
I was right there in the room.

78
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
Why didn't he accuse me then,

79
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,620
but wait until after he tried
to kill himself to point fingers at me?

80
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,480
Don't you think that's strange?

81
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,560
You're saying

82
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
Luo Zhenyao staged
the whole thing himself?

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Whether

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,480
it's true or not,

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,440
I'll leave that to your judgment.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Talk!

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,320
Answer me!

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,350
I'll whip it out of you!

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,640
I've got to go away for a while.

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,440
Eat on time

91
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,320
and sleep on time

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,480
while I'm away.

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Oh?

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,160
Who's got you so distracted?

95
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,640
You've been out of it all day.

96
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,520
It's just…

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
the way Zhou Musheng left the other day.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
I can't shake the feeling
something was off.

99
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Oh, come on.

100
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Just relax.

101
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,480
Your man's not running off anywhere.

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,960
Talk!

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,160
Talk!

104
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
Talk!

105
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,480
Hey.

106
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,400
Step out for a minute.

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,920
That Tan Fei finally confessed.

108
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,200
So you two

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,440
were in on it together, huh?

110
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,480
You came up with the plan,
he played the part,

111
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,120
and together you dumped the blame on me.

112
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,960
You're the director.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
He's the actor.

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,240
What?

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,490
Are you planning to put on a show
at Night Shanghai next?

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,580
What are you after?

117
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,280
Good thing Boss isn't stupid.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,640
If he'd believed you,

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
I'd be the one in your place.

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,960
You two nearly got me killed.

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
Right-hand man, my foot.

122
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
You did this to my left arm, didn't you?

123
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,200
Now I need two people
just to help me put on a glove.

124
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Two!

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Luo Zhenyao,

126
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
you've been waiting for this day

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
a long time, haven't you?

128
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,160
That obvious, huh?

129
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
Where's Tan Fei

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,840
hiding?

131
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
Have you lost your mind?

132
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
How would I know where he is?

133
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,080
I should be asking you that!

134
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,200
You want to earn yourself
some credit, right?

135
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,480
Come here.

136
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,120
I'll tell you.

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,200
Zhou Musheng!

138
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,440
Let go of me!

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,960
Talk!

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,680
You dog!

141
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,640
Scoundrel!

142
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,680
I'll take care of Rose

143
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,800
for you

144
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
from now on.

145
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,160
Luo Zhenyao!

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,000
Come at me if you've got the guts!

147
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Don't you touch her!

148
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll kill you!

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh?

150
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,200
What happened to your ear?

151
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Got bitten by a dog.

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,600
What are you doing here?

153
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,280
Why?

154
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't come by?

155
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,400
Come here.

156
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,720
You can guard against anyone,

157
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,160
but not someone from your own house.

158
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
What's going on?

159
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
We found the mole.

160
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Who is it?

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Zhou Musheng, duh.

162
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,120
Who else, me?

163
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,800
It can't be him.

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
You never believe me.

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Where is he?

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,720
Inside.

167
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Hey.

168
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,440
Where are you going?

169
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,200
Listen to me.

170
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
No one sees him

171
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,200
without my permission.

172
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't tell me you still like him?

173
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Of course not.

174
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,320
Looks like
it all worked out in your favor.

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
One less obstacle in your way.

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,360
Right.

177
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
With your looks,

178
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,920
you can have any man you want.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,720
Don't forget our deal.

180
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,180
I need to get my ear checked.

181
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
It's killing me.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
See you around, Yao.

183
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,400
(Luo Zhenyao definitely)

184
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,680
(wants Zhou Musheng dead.)

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,640
(Should I tell Xu about this?)

186
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh.

187
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,040
If it isn't Ms. Man Li.

188
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Hong.

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,100
Why aren't you going in?

190
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
I'm here to see Rose.

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,720
Is she around?

192
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes.

193
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,990
She's in the dressing room.

194
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,040
I'll take you to her.

195
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,560
Thank you.

196
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,320
Rose.

197
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes?

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Man Li's here.

199
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,680
Man Li.

200
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,520
What brings you here?

201
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Ms. Man Li.

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
I've got something to do.

203
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,500
I'll let you two talk.

204
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:48,960
Mm.

205
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Call me if you need anything.

206
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,600
What's wrong?

207
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,890
What brings you here so suddenly?

208
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,480
It's…

209
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,440
Zhou Musheng.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
Du Hongyue suspects him
of being the mole.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,080
They've locked him up.

212
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,520
What?

213
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
He can't be locked up.

214
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,880
He told me he was going
out of town for business.

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,320
Calm down.

216
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
Word is,

217
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,600
it's got something to do
with that student, Tan Fei.

218
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,120
Man Li.

219
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,360
Help me.

220
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,440
I must see him.

221
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll find a way.

222
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,120
I have to see him.

223
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,480
You'll see him.
