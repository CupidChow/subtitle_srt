00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,600
(Did he notice something?)

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,440
I heard Mr. Song

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,320
was assassinated by a killer
that goes by "Red Bean."

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,520
"Red Bean"?

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,600
The red bean
that grows in southern lands?

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,760
Your palms are sweating.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,600
Of course, you're gripping me so tightly.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,980
Who are you looking for?

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,240
Good day, Mrs. Song.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm Zhou Musheng
from the North City Chamber of Commerce.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,600
This is my friend,

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,280
Rose.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,480
I've heard of you.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
I knew sooner or later

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,440
someone would come looking for us.

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Let's talk in the room.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,160
Please have a seat.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,160
Serve the tea.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,040
Let's not beat around the bush.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,720
I'll be blunt.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,600
Mrs. Song,

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,640
the people despise collaborators.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,440
Mr. Song is dead.

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,100
Those precious items he had

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,350
would be better off with someone
who knows their value.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,440
Song only collected them as a hobby.

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,760
Are you

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
a fellow collector?

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,770
I don't know much about them,

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
but my boss is an expert.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,240
Why not bring out a few pieces

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,760
for him to appraise?

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,560
That can be arranged.

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,040
We only ask

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
that he put in a good word for us

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
with the higher-ups.

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Song

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,520
is dead.

55
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,920
Can these matters

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,840
end here?

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Leave a chance

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,120
for me and my children to survive.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,600
I don't get to decide
who gets labeled a traitor.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
But you came to the right person

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
to make a plea.

62
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,080
I can try to speak for you,

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,080
depending on your course of action.

64
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,990
It's customary to bring gifts
when meeting for the first time.

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,280
Right.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,320
Please feel free to look around.

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
If anything suits you,

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
I'll have my people pack it up.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,240
You can take your time
to admire them at your leisure.

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
We couldn't possibly.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,880
Come, Rose.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,990
Take a look around.
If anything catches your eye,

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
tell Mrs. Song.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
This, this,

75
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,520
and those…

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
All of these.

77
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,320
This, that…

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
And all of these.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
I'll take all of them.

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,720
All right.

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
There are too many eyes during the day.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
I'll send someone to deliver them
to your residence tonight.

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,480
Our boss has just

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,880
this little hobby.

85
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,160
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

86
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,000
It's late.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,240
I won't keep you for dinner.

88
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
What's that smell?

89
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,840
Those are the dogs Mr. Song kept.

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
I found them dirty and smelly,

91
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,040
so I locked them up.

92
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,840
(There's something suspicious here.)

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,640
You two have a safe trip.

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Mrs. Song.

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,040
I'll report

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,960
what you told me to the boss.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
But if today's matter leaks,

98
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,560
you'll be responsible.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,040
It won't.

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,920
My lips are sealed.

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
(Hmph.)

102
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
(Robbing people
while looking so respectable.)

103
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,960
(How hypocritical.)

104
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
Let's go.

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,320
That traitor hoarded

106
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,920
many treasures.

107
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,520
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,240
This one looks nice.

109
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Consider it my appearance fee.

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Money grubber.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm a popular singer.

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,440
I charge well.

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,460
Can you fit all of that in your purse?

114
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,120
I'll be off, then.

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,320
Let me know if anything like this

116
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,440
comes up again.

117
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,850
You're leaving just like that?

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,320
What?

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,520
Are you inviting me to stay the night?

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,300
Did the Song Residence

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
bring up any memories?

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,880
Not really.

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
But that treasure room

124
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
does seem familiar.

125
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,040
Probably because these treasures
all seem so dear to me.

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
If there's nothing else,

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm going to bed.

128
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Any luck

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,680
finding the students?

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,990
There's a traitor among the students.

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
The mole sold

132
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,160
the students' information to Song.

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,280
To curry favor with the Japanese,

134
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
he kidnapped a bunch of them.

135
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,760
Much time has passed,

136
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,180
and I still haven't found
where the students ended up.

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,760
What's that smell?

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
Those are the dogs Mr. Song kept.

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,720
I found them dirty and smelly,

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
so I locked them up.

141
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,280
(That room.)

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,920
(The students.)

143
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,520
Extra, extra!

144
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,680
Read all about it!

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
This is what I found
at Mr. Song's residence.

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,840
These are all just names.

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,520
And a key.

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,800
(There's definitely more to that room.)

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,840
(That key)

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,920
(might be the key to that room.)

151
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
What do you want the key for?

152
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
I might know

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,320
what it's used for.

154
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
