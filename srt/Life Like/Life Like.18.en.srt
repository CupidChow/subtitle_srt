- Rose.

20

You go first.

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,160
I still haven't thanked you

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
for last time.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
You don't need to.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
I wish you and Zhou Musheng

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
all the best.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,840
If he ever treats you badly,

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
tell me. I'll set him straight.

28
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:13,272
That reminds me.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,840
We're living in turbulent times.

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
You should be careful
where you're staying at Night Shanghai.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,200
If any sleazy old men bother you,

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,080
just tell them

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,320
you're my sister.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,520
I'll look out for you.

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,160
Sister,

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,320
my respects to you.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,080
You're

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,160
too polite.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Man Li,

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
don't you like Zhou Musheng anymore?

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,760
Just a man.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
We can't let him get between us.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Thank you.

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,320
So dramatic.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,160
Cheers.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,440
It's too dangerous.

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,390
I'm not agreeing to this.

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,360
I know Du Hongyue too well.

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,560
He's suspicious of everyone.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,260
I have to put myself in the middle of it.

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
I disagree too.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Hear me out.

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,120
If I do this, first,

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,120
we can

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
take down Luo Zhenyao.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
He's a real problem

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,920
and will interfere with my mission.

58
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,840
Secondly,

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
Du Hongyue needs to go through
a real setback

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
before he'll really trust me.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,760
Thirdly,

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,430
I'll need you guys to help me out.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
How?

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,800
I need you to use the chaos
to get Tan Fei out.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't look like

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm walking to my death…

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,680
Don't say that!

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
It's bad luck.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
Be careful.

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
You're being too sentimental.

71
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,520
Cao,

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,560
while I'm gone,

73
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
take care of Rose for me.

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
I won't.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,700
She's your woman.
Take care of her yourself

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,760
when you come back.

77
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
Take care.

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,840
Take care.

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm off.

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
Back in school,

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,960
Zhou Musheng didn't know

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
much of anything.

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,440
You're kidding.

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm not.

85
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,200
He never told me that.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,520
Guess he was embarrassed.

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,990
He doesn't seem like
that kind of person though.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,640
I'll ask him about it later.

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,640
Oh, here.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,960
I bought you some pomegranates.

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,040
You bought them for me?

92
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,440
Yes.

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
That's so sweet of you.

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
How'd you know I love pomegranates?

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
I loved them too when I was little.

96
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,240
See you.

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
(When she was little?)

98
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,240
You're the best.

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,080
These pomegranates are so sweet.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,640
Don't cry.

101
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,960
I'll buy you more.

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
I want them…

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
I'll get them later.

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,400
Pomegranates…

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Don't cry.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
I'll buy you more later.

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,440
You're back.

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,960
What were you doing?

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,600
Your face is filthy.

110
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,760
Take a look.

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,120
I made all of this for you.

112
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,000
You made all this?

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,320
Try it.

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,080
The food looks good.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
It's delicious.

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll try some too.

117
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,280
It's so salty!

118
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Maybe I should

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
just take you out instead?

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,800
No, really, I love it.

Tan Fei.

He's even making demands now.

190
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,160
What?

191
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,840
He wants to see me specifically?

192
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,780
All right, then.

193
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Go see

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,240
what he wants.

195
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,760
Okay.

196
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,880
I'm going.

197
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,360
(What's that Tan Fei)

198
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,720
(up to?)

199
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,700
(Zhou Musheng)

200
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,920
Zhou Musheng.

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
Heavens helped me.

202
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
You knew.

203
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,840
You knew and didn't say anything?

204
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,200
You son of a tramp!

205
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
You almost got me killed!

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
Killed!

207
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,640
You knew…

208
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
Captain Cao.

209
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,480
Let's go.

210
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,160
How's Zhou?

211
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,630
We'll talk after we get out of here.

212
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,180
What's going on?

213
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,000
Captain Luo!
