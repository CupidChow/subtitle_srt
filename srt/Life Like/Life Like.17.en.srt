Wait.

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,720
Oh?

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,080
Ms. Rose.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,040
You're early today.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
Musheng didn't come home all night.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,920
I'm worried.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,920
Move aside.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
I'll take you to him.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,000
This way.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,080
Musheng.

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,200
Musheng!

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,640
Musheng.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,160
You're a lucky man.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,040
Look.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,240
Ms. Rose brought some porridge for you.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,200
Uh…

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,920
Liu,

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,520
I made plenty.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,880
Why don't you have some too?

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
I don't like porridge.

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,600
You two enjoy it.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,040
How

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
is he?

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,300
Rushed him to the hospital.
He's alive, but still unconscious.

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,040
Well, I'm full.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,240
I'll head back now.

43
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:50,865
What's going on with you lately?

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,880
You didn't come home last night.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,690
Let me lie on your lap.

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
I was just too tired.

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
I feel much better.

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,040
Let's go home.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
How's Tan Fei?

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
Still unconscious.

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,760
We don't know when he'll wake up.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,320
Keep an eye

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
on this matter.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't worry, Boss.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm more anxious about it than you.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Before he bit his tongue…

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,440
Get out!

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,990
I'll leave you two to it.

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
Answer me.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,360
Did you give me to that Japanese man?

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,840
Don't get angry.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,040
You enjoy

63
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,200
the chamber's benefits,

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
so you should be ready

65
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,360
to give something back when needed.

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
And if I refuse?

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,040
Listen to me.

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,160
If you refuse,

69
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
then there's no place for you here.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
Think it over.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,480
(Du Hongyue,)

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,100
(you'll get what's coming!)

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Get out!

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,600
Yamamoto caught Tan Fei

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,190
and handed him to Du Hongyue.

76
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,400
Do you think he'll give you up?

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,480
He won't.

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
He bit his tongue

79
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,440
right in front of me.

80
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,480
He's got guts.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
I have to find a way to get him out.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,880
I'll help you.

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,840
Thank you,

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,080
Xu.

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
Right.

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Last night,

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,400
I saw Yamamoto take Man Li
to the Yangtze Hotel.

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
You sure?

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Of course.

90
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,960
Yamamoto drugged her

91
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:31,640
and tried to assault her.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,840
That scumbag!

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
Then what happened?

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
Hong and I saved her,

95
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,120
and we left Yamamoto

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
a little surprise of our own.

97
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm glad it all turned out fine.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
I can't believe they'd do that.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
What's the matter?

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,320
Feeling sorry for her?

101
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,160
I…

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm not.

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
Man Li

104
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
might be spoiled,

105
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
but she's not a bad person deep down.

106
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
Are you

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
jealous?

108
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,600
Yes.

109
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,680
I am.

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
So what?

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,560
You're my man.

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
I love seeing you jealous.

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
Well,

114
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
you can only love me in this lifetime.

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
Got it,

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,920
Zhou Musheng?

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
Not just this life.

118
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
The next,

119
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,990
the one after that,
and the one after that,

120
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,680
I'll only love you.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Ms. Rose.
Please make yourself comfortable.

122
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll be done soon.

123
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,320
All right.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,720
All right.

125
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,960
Come back for it in two days.

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,840
All right.

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,440
Ms. Rose,

128
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,320
Here to pick up
Mr. Zhou's clothes again?

129
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Yes.

130
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,520
You're a good girl.

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,760
Mr. Zhou

132
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
is a blessed man.

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,700
Here you go.

134
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,560
I'll get going, then.

135
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,500
(Tan Fei's injured and in captivity)

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,200
How is he?

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,560
Badly hurt.

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
He's still in critical condition.

139
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
Do whatever it takes.

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
He has to stay alive.

141
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,600
We'll do our best.

142
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Yao.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,740
What did the doctor say?

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
He said a bunch of stuff I didn't get.

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
But basically, he's done for.

146
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Luo Zhenyao!

147
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,600
So this is where you've been hiding,
you scum!

148
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,040
- Come with me!
- Wait, Man Li…

149
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,520
You can talk things through.

150
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,920
Stay out of this.

151
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
Don't you dare follow us!

152
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,600
Wait…

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,200
I can explain!

154
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Man Li,

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
let me go!

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
People are watching!

157
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Did you

158
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
spike my drink?

159
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,080
You saw me do it?

160
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,280
Who else

161
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,640
would use such filthy tricks?

162
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,440
You're awake.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,240
I was just following orders.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,280
I had no choice.

165
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Whose orders?

166
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Du Hongyue's?

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
I didn't say that.

168
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,360
Man Li,

169
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,640
you've been

170
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,840
risking your life for him

171
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
for years,

172
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,400
and now

173
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
he sells you out

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,280
to please the Japanese.

175
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,440
Even I feel sorry

176
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
for you.

177
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,360
You think you're any better?

178
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,040
You've been by his side
all these years too.

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you see your name

180
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,240
on his right-hand list?

181
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
If he'd betray me,

182
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,560
he'll betray you

183
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,800
too…

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
That's why

185
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,520
we should work together

186
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
to maximize our mutual interests.

187
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
Tomorrow,

188
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
give Luo Zhenyao the note

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
with my name.

190
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,840
Tell them

191
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm your contact.

192
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
No.

193
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,440
That's too dangerous for you.

194
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,960
Don't worry.

195
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
I can handle myself.

196
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,240
Senior…

197
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,280
Take care…

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,800
You too.

199
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Whatever you decide,

200
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
I'll back you up.

201
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,320
So

202
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
that's a yes?

203
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
Deal.

204
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
Pleasure working with you.

205
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,600
So…

206
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
How about drinks at my place tonight?

207
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Get lost.

208
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,920
Hey.

209
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,280
You two done fighting?

210
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,680
Just talk it out.
We're on the same side.

211
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,520
Yeah, yeah, we're all good now.

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
Just a misunderstanding.

213
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,400
Right, Man Li?

214
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,960
Then I'll get going,

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,680
Yao.

216
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
(They've made up already?)

217
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,200
(Those two are definitely
up to something.)

218
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,920
Pomegranates!
Plump and sweet pomegranates!

219
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,880
Hello, Miss.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,980
Would you like some pomegranates?
They're sweet.

221
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Try one.

222
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,640
Yi, have one.

223
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,160
Sure.

224
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,360
Pack a few

225
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,160
for me.

226
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,760
All right.

227
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,200
How much?

228
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
Two copper coins.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Thank you.

230
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
Here you go.

231
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,580
(Night Shanghai)

232
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,800
Man Li.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,480
Hey.

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,840
Rose.

235
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,160
Were you looking for me?

236
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
No.

237
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,960
I was just passing by.

238
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,280
Oh.

239
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Did you just get off work?

240
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,040
Yes.

241
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,080
I just got off work.

242
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,440
Want

243
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,800
to grab a drink together?

244
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,520
Sure.

245
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,680
I'm free tonight.

246
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,280
All right.

247
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

248
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,400
What are you doing around here?

249
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Just picking up a few things.

250
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,160
Well, if it isn't Night Shanghai's Rose.

251
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,080
Where are you headed?

252
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,760
Go away.

253
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,800
You go away!

254
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Man Li!

255
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,320
Let's have

256
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,320
a drink together.

257
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,240
Let…

258
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Let's not go home until we're drunk…

259
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,800
Get lost.

260
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
It's a misunderstanding…

261
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,240
Are you all right?

262
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
I'm fine.

263
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,340
I didn't scare you, did I?

264
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,580
No.
