17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,360
Hey.

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,400
Stop sleeping.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,920
Get lost!

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,760
Go away.

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,620
(Song Residence)

22
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,720
Why are you here?

23
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,560
I haven't heard from you
for so many days.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,920
I was worried sick.

25
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,720
Lucky.

26
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,990
I'm not dying that easily.

27
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,500
It's fine as long as you're okay.

28
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,480
Du Hongyue

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,320
is ruthless.

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
If you're with him,

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,240
you must stay safe.

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
About the students,

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
did you find anything?

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
There's a traitor among the students.

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,080
That person secretly sold student info

36
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,480
to Song.

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,680
Song, to please the Japanese,

38
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,200
secretly captured a batch of students.

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,120
It's been so long,

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,280
I still don't know their whereabouts.

41
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Those students must be in danger.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,790
No. I must get discharged quickly.

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,920
You take care of healing,

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,480
I'll personally check Song Residence.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
I'll go then.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,560
I know best

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
about those students.

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,920
You might

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,480
put them in danger.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,040
Take care.

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Boss, are you okay?

52
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Get out!

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,560
If you weren't allowed in,
don't come in.

54
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
Crazy woman!

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,760
You dared to trap me!

56
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,040
(So much like Rose.)

57
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,040
Who's there?

58
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
This way!

59
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,760
Yo.

60
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Musheng.

61
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,080
What brings you here?

62
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,160
I came to find Rose.

63
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,400
Rose.

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,160
Musheng is here for you.

65
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,640
Oh, okay.

66
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,880
Are you ready?

67
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,040
Almost.

68
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
Come, sit.

69
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,640
This way please.

70
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,520
Girls always take their time.

71
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,680
Are you ready?

72
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,840
Hurry up.

73
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960
How many times have I told you?

74
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
Ready.

75
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
Every time I have to remind you.

76
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
My head's about to explode.

77
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,160
Hey.

78
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
Stubborn girl.

79
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,720
Then,

80
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,280
you two talk, I'll go first.

81
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
These past few days,

82
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
you didn't come see me.

83
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
Still angry huh?

84
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,920
Don't you have your junior?

85
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,280
Why bother with me?

86
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,190
What did it get stained with?

87
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Looks like blood.

88
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,880
It's lipstick.

89
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,680
When I was doing makeup,

90
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,240
it accidentally got on me.

91
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,120
Doesn't really look like it.

92
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Look again now.

93
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,360
Sweet and lovely.

94
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,040
Delicate as silk.

95
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,360
Rose.

96
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,400
Ready?

97
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Ready.

98
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,320
I'm coming out.

99
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,560
Hurry up.

100
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
These earrings

101
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,200
really suit you.

102
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
Musheng.

103
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
You have great taste.

104
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,600
Master.

105
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
Master.

106
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,960
Master.

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
Detective Cao.

108
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,040
Please make sure to find the murderer.

109
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,360
Give justice to our master.

110
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
Did Mr. Song

111
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,240
offend anyone before he died?

112
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,880
I know nothing

113
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,560
about the master's affairs outside.

114
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,000
Who could he have offended?

115
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,480
Master.

116
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,600
