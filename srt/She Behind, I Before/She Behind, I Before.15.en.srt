00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,904
=She Behind, I Before=

2
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,880
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,540
Don't look at me that way.

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,080
We are different from Xiong.

5
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,620
Tell me.

6
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,160
Tell me everything about the Gate.

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,790
Hundreds of years ago,

8
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,120
the ancestors of the Lu clan

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,580
have long been
the guardians of the Gate.

10
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,370
The Gate does not stay in one place.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,620
Every time it moves,

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,370
we will know.

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,580
The ones it chose

14
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,950
are called the Sacred Women.

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,700
Once they enter the Gate,

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,410
we'd worship them.

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,120
(More than eighty years ago,)

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,870
(my clan followed the Gate
to Furong Village.)

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,910
(At that time,)

20
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,910
(there were wars.)

21
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,870
(My people lived in fear,)

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,410
until the arrival of a foreigner,

23
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,580
(named K,)

24
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,540
(who's attracted by the legend
of the Lu clan.)

25
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,330
The war-torn village

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,700
was on the verge of collapse.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,450
This foreigner

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,580
became a protector.

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,790
We could feel

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,450
the power of the Gate in the villa.

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,290
They wanted to possess
the power of the Gate,

32
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,500
but were not the chosen ones.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,160
So,

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,870
they found a way,

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,410
using sweet talk,

36
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,700
to deceive most of the villagers

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,660
to sacrifice themselves to the Gate

38
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,750
through accidental death.

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,830
Aren't you also
making deals with the Gate?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,080
No, we're different.

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,500
In fact, the Gate does not kill.

42
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,580
Some even made a wish in the Gate

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,660
to return to their loved ones,

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,290
then they walked out of the Gate.

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,000
So can I understand it this way?

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,120
What the Gate wants

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
is merely people's strong desires.

48
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,950
I guess so.

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,000
You want me to enter the Gate?

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,660
Don't you want to save
your sister and your friends?

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,950
What about you?

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,910
What do you want?

53
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,330
We don't want anything.

54
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
This is

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,910
what makes us different from K.

56
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,790
We don't get anything directly

57
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,330
from the Gate.

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Of course.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,370
I understand your fear.

60
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,910
I can also let you

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,540
experience the power of the Gate first.

62
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,750
Don't worry.

63
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,750
As long as you don't make a wish,

64
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,200
I can bring you back to reality.

65
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,370
Daizi.

66
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,160
Daizi.

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,370
Dailing.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Dailing.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,950
Daizi.

70
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,790
Daizi.

71
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,580
Dailing.

72
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,410
Dailing, is that you?

73
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,160
Daizi.

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,290
Are you in there?

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,370
Dailing.

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,750
I'm in here.

77
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,200
But I can't open the door.

78
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,910
(Younger Sister, Zhou Dailing)
Can't you either?

79
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,870
Perhaps,

80
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,870
it's because
I haven't really entered the Gate.

81
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,450
Then leave.

82
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,540
Daizi.

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,500
What exactly happened?

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,840
(Elder Sister, Zhou Daizi)

85
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,830
After Bu Na died,

86
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,040
I found Xiong,

87
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,950
and he found me.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,750
He lured me into the Gate

89
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,290
in the illusion.

90
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,410
No.

91
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,830
No.

92
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,790
No.

93
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,950
This isn't the real world.

94
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,830
I want to get out.

95
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,580
I want to get out.

96
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,330
But the Gate has chosen you two.

97
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,330
What can I do?

98
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,700
Chose us?

99
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,370
Zhou Daizi.

100
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,330
If you don't enter,

101
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,410
I'll just find your sister then.

102
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,000
Perhaps it's because you two are twins,

103
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,660
the Gate has chosen both of you.

104
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,160
So it doesn't matter

105
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,450
who enters first to me.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,250
Hello, Zhou Dailing.

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,500
What are you doing?

108
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:37,290
I've just returned from
the police station. I'm exhausted.

109
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,660
I've thought about

110
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,500
the novel we discussed that day.

111
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,500
You asked why the heroine refused

112
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
the power to travel through time,

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,700
but just wanted one chance to do so.

114
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,750
I think it's not right.

115
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,950
Why?

116
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,790
Isn't it a foolish act?

117
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,410
It's not a choice for her,

118
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,450
but about survival.

119
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,660
Forget it. I won't argue with you.

120
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,580
I have things to do.

121
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,160
Hold on.

122
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,700
I must convince you.

123
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,750
Call me back in half an hour.

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,910
After I entered the Gate,

125
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,120
I made a wish to the Gate,

126
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,330
wishing you
to travel back to the present,

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,750
so you can figure everything out

128
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,370
when facing the Gate.

129
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,120
Perhaps,

130
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,370
it can change both of our fates.

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,160
You've done well.

132
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,750
I also used this ability

133
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,450
to wake up in Xiong's illusion.

134
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,500
How did you do that?

135
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,700
This way, you can feel Yingxin?

136
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,040
It helps me break free
from the illusion.

137
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,790
Where is this?

138
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,500
This is the world inside the Gate.

139
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,450
This

140
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,700
seems like a real world.

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,290
Perhaps that

142
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,410
is a real world indeed.

143
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,580
Why do you say that?
