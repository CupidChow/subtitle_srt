00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,816
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,000
You are just glorifying their sacrifice

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,580
and ignoring their suffering.

5
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,620
Is this selflessness?

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,660
This is a group selfishness.

7
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,750
What did you say?

8
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,750
I have experienced
what Yue's been through.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,580
She voluntarily entered the Gate

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,790
for a kind old woman.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,450
But her pain

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,410
and her hatred towards her clan

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,790
were also true.

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,450
Do you know
what wish she made in the end?

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,830
She lifted the drought.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,750
- You can't defame her like this.
- She made

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,000
a wish for rain to moisten the earth

18
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,660
until her parents,

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,330
Yan,

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,290
and the old woman passed away.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,160
And then?

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,580
Tsunami.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,620
Let me be alone.

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,540
Why are you so foolish?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,790
You could stay away from all this

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,200
and live well.

27
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,410
But it's okay.

28
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,450
I can understand you.

29
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,700
Because if it were me,

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,540
I would do the same.

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,830
I have done what I promised you.

32
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,750
I have come back to see you.

33
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,450
You really were charmed by me

34
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,950
as you said.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,660
You had nothing to do with this.

37
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,790
It was I who ignored Yingxin's request

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,790
and got you involved.

39
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,540
This time I bid you both farewell.

40
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,080
But it's okay.

41
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,000
I will save you both.

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,370
The people nowadays

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,620
are cold-hearted,

44
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,660
nothing like the former Sacred Women.

45
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,330
She is not fit to be called
the Sacred Woman.

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,330
What about my son then?

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,620
The Clan Chief said she would save him.

48
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,250
In my opinion,
we should teach her a lesson.

49
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,580
Don't do it.

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,660
The Clan Chief
told us not to corner her.

51
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,870
What if she runs away?

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,450
She is to enter the Gate.

53
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,830
It's not like it will kill anyone.

54
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,790
Have you thought it over?

55
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes.

56
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,410
So when would you...?

57
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,540
I won't enter the Gate.

58
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,330
What?

59
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,950
What about your friends?

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,950
Maybe I enter the Gate,

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,040
and my friends still die,

62
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,700
so will I.

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,450
But you...

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,370
Didn't you enter the Gate?

65
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,250
Didn't you see your sister?

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,040
It's just another world.

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,580
There are too many flaws.

68
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,750
What?

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,250
I didn't expect

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,750
you have the ability
to create the illusion,

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,790
and it's even stronger than Xiong's.

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
What do you mean?

73
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,330
Why did Yu Pengliang

74
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,120
tell you everything?

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,950
To avenge Zhou Daizi?

76
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,040
He said he liked Zhou Daizi, right?

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,040
So you figured it out

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,370
I am not Zhou Daizi,

79
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,660
but Zhou Dailing.

80
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,370
But you missed

81
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,830
the most crucial clue.

82
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,580
Tell me.

83
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,870
Tell you?

84
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,120
What's in it for me?

85
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,750
Yu Pengliang is not dead.

86
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,000
But we used a secret technique

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to make him appear as if he's dead.

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,700
But in fact, he's almost there.

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,950
He's only got his last breath left.

90
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,700
What did you say?

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,540
He won't last past dawn tomorrow.

92
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,950
Can you save him?

93
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,080
I can't.

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,250
Take him to the hospital.

95
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,910
Then tell me your secret.

96
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,660
I...

97
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,410
Time travel is not a one-off.

98
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,120
I can go back to the past

99
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,910
into my sister's body.

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,450
No wonder...

101
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,580
Yu Pengliang treats you...

102
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,370
So it was you.

103
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,410
So can you take him to the hospital now?

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,750
Of course.

105
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,410
But it's useless.

106
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,910
The only way

107
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,290
is for you

108
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,660
to enter the Gate.

109
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,330
But now I understand.

110
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,540
You said
you don't want to enter the Gate.

111
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,120
It's all just a bluff.

112
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,040
Choose a time.

113
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,080
I'll wait for you.

114
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
I think you dislike

115
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,910
these plants.

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,870
People change.

117
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,620
Perhaps one day

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
you'll like them too.

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Is that so?

120
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,040
Yes.

121
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,620
(Elder Sister, Zhou Daizi)
Maybe this time,

122
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
you will make a different choice.

123
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:05,330
(Younger Sister, Zhou Dailing)

124
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,750
Do you hope so?

125
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,500
I don't know.
