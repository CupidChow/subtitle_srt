=She Behind, I Before=

2
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,912
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,750
You look good.

4
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,910
You know

5
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,120
this is only temporary.

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,410
It's okay.

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,950
As long as we get
Zhou Daizi enter the Gate.

8
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,450
How?

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,660
The Gate can
give Yan Yingxin such great power.

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,620
It must be because Yan Yingxin,

11
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,330
compared with all other girls,

12
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,120
has stronger emotions.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,120
I could indeed try.

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,910
Do you...

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,700
To weave an illusion
from human emotions and memories,

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,870
yet not affected by human emotions.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,330
This is the power the Gate granted me.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,580
Besides,

19
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,950
I never had feelings for her.

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,700
Sorry.

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,000
I was overthinking it.

22
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,700
Hello, excuse me.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,450
You are...

24
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,870
Police.

25
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,250
What's the situation?

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,000
We got a report.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,370
At 11:30 PM,
the village suddenly lost power

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,410
and neighbors heard screams.

29
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,660
Once it was restored,

30
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,830
neighbors came to check

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,700
and found the host dead at home.

32
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,660
Per our initial findings,

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,540
this family had five members.

34
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,830
A couple

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,120
with two daughters and a son.

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,250
The eldest girl
disappeared six months ago.

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,370
But the family did not report it.

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,450
These are the clues
we've gathered so far.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,790
The girl's father was stabbed to death.

40
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,830
Did you see what happened?

41
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,870
The village lost power.

42
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,120
When it was restored,
he was already dead.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,870
Someone deliberately did it?

44
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,000
Power cables were tampered with,

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,950
and he was also stabbed to death.

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,540
If it's not intentional,

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,790
there's no need to do so.

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,250
It's murder.

49
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,290
Perhaps neighbors noticed something.

50
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,120
Or,

51
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,620
my actions have been detected.

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,250
Got it.

53
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,120
But at least,

54
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,870
this case

55
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,790
has caught the attention of the police.

56
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,700
They won't do it again
in a short period.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,830
But it indicates

58
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,790
that your situation will be
even more dangerous.

59
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,830
I get it.

60
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,950
Everything goes with the plan.

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,250
Okay.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
This place really looks eerie.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,830
Got no other option.

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,540
If we want to hide,

65
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,160
we can only come to this place.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,040
Based on our assumptions,

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,620
if the victims are girls

68
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,910
similar to Bu Na

69
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,080
or Yingxin,

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,540
Xiong will have 20 days' rest.

71
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,910
If the victims are girls

72
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,040
with low value,

73
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,120
then he will have
about seven days' rest.

74
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,200
What you need to do

75
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,660
is to find the victims
during this period,

76
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,040
and use the power of police,

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,910
to escalate it,

78
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,040
trying to reduce their chances
for action.

79
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,200
Force them to come to me.

80
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,450
You stay with me

81
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,580
and protect me.

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,950
Rest assured.

83
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,410
I will protect you.

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,290
Okay.

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,160
Let's go.

86
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,410
What's the use of this?

87
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,450
For a test.

88
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,370
Liang.

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,330
Liang, this is the file you wanted.

90
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:26,848
(Yu Pengliang)

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I got it.

92
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,330
Look.

93
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,580
I think I know this person.

94
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,290
I've seen photos of Yingxin with her.

95
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,790
Yingxin also said

96
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,790
that they are besties.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,870
(It's Jiao. I'm going to kill her.)

98
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,120
Yingxin.

99
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,200
What's wrong?

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,080
Do you remember what I told you?

101
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,500
After waking up from the illusion,

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,120
Yingxin and I now have a connection.

103
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
I can see this,

104
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,660
so can she.

105
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,910
You mean,

106
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,620
Yingxin went to look for Jiao?

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,700
Yes.

108
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,080
I felt her hatred and sadness.

109
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,250
She'll be okay, right?

110
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,620
This is the wish she made.

111
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,870
She'll be fine.

112
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,040
No way.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,950
I need to find her.

114
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,080
She'll be fine.

115
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
You wait here.

116
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
I'll be back soon.

117
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,080
I've already lost her once,

118
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,000
and I can't let her be alone again.
