=Episode 13=

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,120
It's only one hour left.

4
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,000
Why hasn't Daizi woken up yet?

5
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,330
Doctor.

6
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,080
I've found
that my friend is deceiving me.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,200
About what?

8
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,830
She borrowed my money
for her mom's treatment.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,870
But her mom

10
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,160
had passed away last year,

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,750
and she didn't tell me this.

12
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,410
Doctor.

13
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,870
Can you accompany me to a place?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,910
Of course.

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,660
I heard this pool
is going to be torn down

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,910
and transformed into a sky garden.

17
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,000
Back when my dad was still working here,

18
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,040
he would always sneak me in to play.

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,120
I've explored every inch,

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,620
even the ventilation ducts.

21
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,580
Later on,

22
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,830
he drowned here.

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,830
It was a drunk guest

24
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,040
who was causing trouble

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,040
and accidentally drowned him.

26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,370
That person held power and influence.

27
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,410
He compensated us money,

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,580
and that's it.

29
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,580
If one day,

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,410
this place becomes
like it was in my memories,

31
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,200
maybe I will

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,620
end my life here too.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,120
Sorry.

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,370
Why am I telling you all this?

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
It's okay.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,330
I'm your therapist.

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,910
You can tell me about it.

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,370
Doctor.

39
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,410
Ever since I dreamed about
my friend's past,

40
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,290
it seems her sorrow

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,790
has become a part of me.

42
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,790
Plus...

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,450
Never mind.

44
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,830
Life must go on.

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,830
What happened?

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm fine.

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,080
I might be having illusions.

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,450
Do you

49
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,450
like her?

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,660
Speak up.

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,250
Just break her mind

52
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,450
and let her kill herself.

53
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,370
Why do you do this?

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,160
I think you

55
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,160
shouldn't have come here.

56
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,040
She is my best friend.

57
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,080
I betrayed her for you.

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,040
You can't do this to me.

59
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,200
So what do you want now?

60
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,160
She could just die.

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,950
Why did you send someone
to repair that swimming pool?

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,000
Hush.

63
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,790
Someone is coming.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
I underestimated you.

65
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,830
She alone

66
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,830
endured the pain of two people by force

67
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,200
and was betrayed by her closest friend.

68
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,410
Tell me,

69
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,750
how did you break free
from the illusion?

70
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,790
But you still felt compassion.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Otherwise, why is it that only Jiao

72
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,080
coaxed the other girls?

73
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,330
Yes.

74
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,200
She was too kind.

75
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,370
I've never seen

76
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,750
anyone react so strongly

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,500
to my illusion.

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,790
She's so empathic

79
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,160
to what Jiao has gone through.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,790
For Jiao,

81
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,870
she could do anything.

82
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,870
So, you see,

83
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,250
empathy

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,500
is such a terrible thing.

85
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,910
Alright.

86
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,200
Tell me.

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,910
How did you break free?

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,620
You don't have time to know that much.

89
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,540
You're awake.

90
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,580
- Let them go.
- Sit down.

91
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,580
Sit down.

92
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,500
Zhou Daizi.

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,580
I really have to thank you
for pushing me.

94
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,330
You've made me realize

95
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,000
the desire to survive

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
is the best thing to exploit.

97
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,370
You're different from the others.

98
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,540
You are chosen by the Gate.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,330
Let me tell you.

100
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,750
As long as you enter the Gate,

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,620
you can make a wish.

102
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,870
Then I wish you to die.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,910
You might not have this chance.

104
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,790
Zhou Daizi.

105
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,080
While you're still conscious,

106
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,000
make a wish inside,

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,290
then you won't have to die.

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,830
Get lost.

109
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,830
Looks like you're pretty stubborn.

110
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,750
It's okay.

111
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,910
I still have a way.

112
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,040
Zhou Daizi.

113
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,040
What if it were your friend?

114
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,290
Don't.

115
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't.

116
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,580
Don't.

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,040
Don't.

118
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,910
How did he die so quickly?

119
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,080
Yingtian.

120
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,620
Daizi didn't get a chance to react,

121
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,660
and he just died.

122
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,660
Drag him over there.
