=Episode 6=

3
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,700
Daizi.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,660
Wake up.

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,290
Daizi, wake up.

6
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,330
Kid.

7
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,370
Do not be afraid.

8
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,080
This is not death.

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,080
Who are you?

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,870
Call me K.

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,830
K?

12
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,950
Mom.

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,290
Don't cry.

14
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,750
Maybe I really can save the villagers.

15
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,830
(Daizi.)

16
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,000
(Wake up.)

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,790
(Daizi, wake up.)

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,830
(Daizi.)

19
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,790
(Wake up.)

20
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,410
(Daizi, wake up.)

21
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,000
I've dripped her the tenth drop
of blood from the middle finger.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,250
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

23
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,540
This method can wake one up

24
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,910
from the illusion,

25
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,950
except she's in a very deep illusion.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,910
As for which kind it is,

27
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,830
she can only rely on her own.

28
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,750
Rely on her own?

29
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,080
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,500
I shouldn't have let you come alone.

31
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,540
Daizi.

32
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,540
You're awake?

33
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,580
That's great.

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,950
Finally.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,120
You...

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,620
Why are you sorry?

37
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,660
Nothing.

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Nothing.

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,750
Do you feel okay?

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,200
It seems like

41
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,870
I had a very long dream.

42
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
It's a sad,

43
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,450
helpless dream.

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,910
What kind of dream?

45
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,120
Well,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,410
I sent myself

47
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,250
into

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,950
the Gate.

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,700
Gate again.

50
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,500
Again?

51
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,370
I dreamt of Daizi before.

52
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,830
She mentioned this.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,160
This...

54
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,080
This is just a dream.

55
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,450
No.

56
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,870
This is so real.

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,910
Let's get up.

58
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,540
I haven't entered Furong Village yet,

59
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,620
and so much has happened.

60
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,040
If I really go in,

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,500
will there be

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,120
more interesting things waiting for me?

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,500
I remember, in the dream,

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,500
the villagers asked me
to make a wish to the Gate,

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,500
saying they needed a lot of rain.

66
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,500
Perhaps all of this is real.

67
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,200
Why?

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,410
This place experienced a tsunami before.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,120
Yes.

70
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,950
Maybe she

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,040
still harbors hatred.

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,500
What's wrong?

73
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,290
I don't know.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,290
I suddenly feel so sad.

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,950
(At this moment,
Yu Pengliang still worries.)

76
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,330
(Zhou Daizi ventured alone into danger,)

77
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,000
(which was exactly
what Yu Pengliang intended.)

78
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,250
(And the mastermind behind it)

79
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,080
(is the other power, the Lu clan.)

80
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,410
There is bloodstain.

81
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,330
This looks very fresh.

82
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,080
Like it's been spat out
from one's mouth.

83
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,870
I have a premonition

84
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,160
that we're getting closer to him.
