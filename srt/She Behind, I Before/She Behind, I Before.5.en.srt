=She Behind, I Before=

2
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,851
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,910
Wait.

4
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,500
Protect Bu Na?

5
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,250
If Bu Na doesn't die,

6
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,330
could I find the answer?

7
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,330
You're awake.

8
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,580
Here, have some water.

9
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,580
Who are you?

10
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,620
Where am I?

11
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,500
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,790
I am Yan.

13
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,540
This is my house.

14
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,330
Yan?

15
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,160
You passed out,

16
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,370
so I carried you back here.

17
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,700
Don't get me wrong.

18
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,950
Yan?

19
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,540
I'll go get a doctor.

20
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,290
Who am I?

21
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,330
You are Yue.

22
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
Yue?

23
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Yue?

24
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,950
Yes.

25
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,080
I am Yue.

26
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,370
(My name is Yue.)

27
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,370
(I used to be an orphan.)

28
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,080
(They took me in)

29
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,000
(and gave me a warm home.)

30
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,870
Dad, it's time for the meal.

31
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,830
(My dad is a famous doctor
known far and wide.)

32
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,200
(Rich people
would pay a lot to hire him,)

33
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,580
(yet he often provides free services
to the villagers.)

34
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,950
(This guy likes me.)

35
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,620
Daizi.

36
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,000
Daizi.

37
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,080
Daizi.

38
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,000
Wake up.

39
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,830
So hot.

40
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,870
What's going on?

41
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,910
As you said,

42
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,830
I let her come alone.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,950
She has passed out now

44
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,410
and couldn't wake up.

45
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,040
(Later on,)

46
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,410
(a disaster occurred.)

47
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,040
(It was a drought.)

48
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,080
(A drought like no one had ever seen.)

49
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,660
(Dad, known as a miraculous doctor,)

50
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,080
(could do nothing.)

51
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,120
(He couldn't produce food,)

52
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,660
(nor could he beg for water.)

53
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,290
(He can only watch people)

54
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,040
(die before him.)

55
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,580
(The Gate has chosen me.)

56
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,700
(They said,)

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,580
(as long as I enter the Gate,)

58
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,910
(this bizarre disaster will end.)

59
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,120
Mom.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,660
Yue.

61
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,410
- Yue.
- What's wrong?

62
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,330
Yue.

63
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,580
You...

64
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,450
- Yue.
- Catch her.

65
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,120
Yue, run.

66
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,080
Run far away from Furong Village.

67
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,580
- Yes, yes.
- Mom.

68
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,620
Run now!

69
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,250
- Run.
- Mom, no.

70
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,080
Mom.

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,200
- Run
- Run.

72
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
Mom.

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,700
Go, run.

74
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Dad.

75
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Run.

76
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,700
(Yan wants to take me away.)

77
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,450
(And my parents have packed my luggage.)

78
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,540
(But,)

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,370
(they chased after us.)

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
You can't force her.

81
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,540
The Gate only accepts those
who enter of their own free will.

82
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,830
I will enter by myself.

83
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,370
Yue.

84
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,580
Daizi.

85
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,540
Wake up.

86
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,160
Daizi, wake up.
