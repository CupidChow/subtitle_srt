3
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,370
The Gate is indeed unfair.

4
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,950
But none of that matters anymore.

5
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,290
Perhaps.

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,500
However,

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,700
after three hours,

8
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,870
you will be very weak.

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,540
Then, Yan Yingxin

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,500
can do whatever she wants.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,660
It seems

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,370
within three hours,

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,700
I have to deal with you.

14
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,580
What's your plan?

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,700
You

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,370
are too naive.

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,540
Have you ever thought

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,500
why even a tsunami

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,040
can't harm this villa?

20
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,040
Why?

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,410
It doesn't matter.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,660
Anyway,

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,870
when we are in this villa,

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,950
my abilities will become stronger.

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,540
Dream.

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,040
Congratulations, Yingxin.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,700
You are now officially an artist.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,910
Thank you.

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,120
He has good taste.

30
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,750
Come on.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,870
Right, Jiao.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,000
We've known each other for so long,

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
yet you never talked about your family.

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,750
I don't have a family.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,830
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,950
I-I didn't mean it.

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,160
Don't be sorry.

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,830
I wish it.

39
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,830
Less than two hours to go.

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,160
Just now, Xiong disappeared in a moment.

41
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,290
Did he enter Daizi's mind?

42
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,540
He's bewitched so many people.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,950
His ability to create illusions
must be strong.

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,660
Doctor.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,750
Perhaps the things in my dreams

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,700
are all real.

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,830
Why would you think that?

48
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,040
I looked into my friend's history.

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,500
Some things can't be found,

50
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,000
but the things that can be found

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,450
essentially all match up.

52
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,910
Then why would you

53
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,290
need to do this?

54
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,910
If this is true,

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,500
then at least I should help her.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,750
Then,

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,540
can you do me a favor?

58
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,290
Go ahead.

59
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,000
Can I borrow half a million?

60
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,500
As long as you act,

61
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,910
you can make a lot of money.

62
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,790
As soon as I have this half a million,

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,540
I can pay off the debt,

64
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,120
and see my mom.

65
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,200
Perhaps,

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,290
she's the one in this world

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
who truly considers me family.

68
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,540
I've previously tested it with Daizi.

69
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,290
The later it gets,

70
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
the stronger the wind.

71
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,200
And the wind chimes

72
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,950
become louder.

73
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,120
She has tested it many times.

74
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,870
There should be no problem.

75
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,620
Hello.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,250
Yan Yingxin, right?

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,410
Want to be a star?

78
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,450
Okay,

79
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,580
I'll give you a chance.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,450
Let her come for the audition.

81
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,160
Hello.

82
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,370
Excuse me, where is the audition?

83
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,160
Over there.

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,450
Thank you.

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,250
Doctor.

86
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,700
I'm in so much pain.

87
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,250
Do you hate them?

88
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,790
Yes.

89
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,580
Take a good rest.

90
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,250
Don't cry.

91
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,410
I think I understand.

92
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,620
This is how you

93
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,080
made Yan Yingxin feel

94
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,620
strong compassion and empathy for Jiao.

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,700
That's why she acted that way.

96
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,700
I don't know how you sober up.

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,450
But this time it's different.

98
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,790
As long as I'm here,

99
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,750
I can make you become Yan Yingxin again.

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,120
Here's the half a million.

101
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,080
You...

102
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,370
Now many roles

103
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,160
have started to come my way,

104
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,410
despite they're not major though.

105
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,910
Don't worry about me.

106
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,160
I mean it.

107
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,040
You said that you really
enjoy writing a diary.

108
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,290
I found this diary to be very beautiful.

109
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,700
Here you are.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
It's only one hour left.

111
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,000
Why hasn't Daizi woken up yet?
