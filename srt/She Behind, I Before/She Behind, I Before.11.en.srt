00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,944
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,160
The police are already investigating me.

4
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,160
What should I do?

5
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,000
Hurry up and find Zhou Daizi.

6
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,750
Will she enter the Gate willingly?

7
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,950
As long as you find her,

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,200
I have my ways to deal with her.

9
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,096
(Unknown Caller)

10
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,330
Come out.

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,000
Come out!

12
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,450
Listen.

13
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,620
I sense
that Yingxin has run into trouble.

14
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,290
You must take the knife from Jiao.

15
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,750
It has the power of the Gate.
Yingxin can't handle it.

16
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,910
Got it.

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,950
Yan Yingxin.

18
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Look.

19
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,620
He killed you,

20
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,620
yet he gave me something
to save my life.

21
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,700
He still loves me.

22
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,330
He doesn't love you at all.

23
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Yan Yingxin.

24
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,040
Why didn't you kill me?

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,750
Why did you spare my life?

26
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,700
I won't apologize to you.

27
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,830
I owe you

28
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,950
this.

29
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,370
Someone told me

30
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,540
Yingxin went to find Jiao.

31
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,160
So Yan Yingtian has gone to help.

32
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,540
You will surely be exposed.

33
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,750
What's going on?

34
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,830
He's so impatient.

35
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,080
If I were him, I would have gone too.

36
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,080
Then you must be careful.

37
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,620
I'm already on my way.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,450
A fierce battle is about to begin.

39
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,000
Be careful.

40
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,660
It's you who told

41
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,620
Daizi and Yingtian

42
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,200
that Yan Yingxin went to find Jiao.

43
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,040
Don't you know

44
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,080
that Xiong might find Daizi
because of this?

45
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,200
I've said

46
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,620
if you hurt her,

47
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,790
I won't let you off.

48
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,410
Don't get me wrong.

49
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,330
We're just trying to help you.

50
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,000
After all, only if Jiao dies,

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Yan Yingxin's wish

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
is half done,

53
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,750
so her power will increase.

54
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,290
As for Zhou Daizi,

55
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,700
we will protect her.

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,950
Well, how

57
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,870
will you protect her?

58
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,580
You know

59
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,330
we just want to get the Gate back.

60
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,080
As long as we get it back,

61
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,950
we can help Zhou Daizi.

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,790
How is it?

63
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm fine.

64
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,660
Go upstairs.

65
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,580
You're back.

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,450
And things are about to start.

67
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,500
(Yu Pengliang learned
that Zhou Daizi is in danger,)

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,410
(so immediately rushed to the villa.)

69
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,120
(In order to find
a quick break in the case,)

70
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,330
(on behalf of the police,)

71
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,540
(Yu Pengliang feigned cooperation
with Clan Chief Lu)

72
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,080
(to become an informant
for the Lu clan.)

73
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,000
(The purpose is to get deeper in it)

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,040
(and catch Xiong and Clan Chief Lu
in one fell swoop.)

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,540
(But he didn't expect
that Xiong had set a trap there.)

76
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,290
It's you.

77
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,700
Do you really think you're clever?

78
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,790
To hide in the villa.

79
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,040
It is now nine PM.

80
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,160
You probably only have three hours

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,620
to persuade me to enter the Gate.

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,370
Why?

83
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,910
Because we've done some research,

84
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,000
and it's about these days

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,660
when you make a deal with the Gate.

86
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,040
But you haven't.

87
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,790
Are you really anxious now?

88
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,580
Then how do you know

89
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,910
that I only have three hours?

90
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,950
I have to thank you for this.

91
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,160
I got to come into contact
with the Gate,

92
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,790
and only then could I feel Yan Yingxin.

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,250
The Gate is indeed unfair.

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,830
But none of that matters anymore.

95
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Perhaps.

96
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,370
However,

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,580
after three hours,

98
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,750
you will be very weak.
