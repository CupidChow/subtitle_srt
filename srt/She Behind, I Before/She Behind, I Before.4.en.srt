00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,912
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,480
(Younger Sister, Zhou Dailing)

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,500
It's not your fault.

5
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,330
Daizi.

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,250
You don't know it.

7
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,500
She died right in front of me

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,950
and she looked so desperate.

9
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,620
Ling.

10
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,200
(Elder Sister, Zhou Daizi)

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
I know

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,700
you are stronger

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
and braver than me.

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,290
I shouldn't have let you alone

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,370
face all this.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,450
But I know

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,870
you can definitely do it.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,790
I'll wait for you in the Gate.

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,700
Gate?

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,950
There isn't much time left.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,160
The Gate has granted my wish

22
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,410
and has given me a grace

23
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,450
to let me see you.

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,830
Maybe you are on your own

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,910
on the road ahead.

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,370
I'm waiting for you.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,200
Where are you going?

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,700
What is the Gate?

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,120
Daizi.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,580
What is...?

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,160
Daizi.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,080
Daizi.

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,040
(Zhou Dailing,
who was once a detective,)

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,410
(in order to gain the trust
of Yu Pengliang,)

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,790
(decided to tell him)

36
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,830
(who she is.)

37
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,080
Yu Pengliang.

38
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,410
If I say I've traveled through time,

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,790
do you believe it?

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,750
I am not Zhou Daizi,

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,830
but Zhou Dailing.

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,830
Zhou Dailing?

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,540
You and Daizi are best friends.

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,580
I can only trust you.

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,000
That's why I came to you.

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,870
Well...

47
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,870
Are you

48
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,620
out of your mind?

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,500
What if I say

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,540
I believe you,

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,080
do you believe it?

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,450
Do you know
how you traveled through time?

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,200
I don't know.

54
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,370
Half a year ago,

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,450
she suddenly became very strange,

56
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,620
not like her now,

57
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,120
but more like you now.

58
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,410
Was that you?

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,700
That was not me.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Did something happen

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,160
to her back then?

62
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,700
When we parted ways once,

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,450
she said something very strange to me.

64
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,700
What did she say?

65
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,870
She said,

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,290
"Goodbye."

67
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,540
What's so strange about that?

68
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,000
Her tone, her expression,

69
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,910
none were like saying goodbye,

70
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,790
more like a farewell.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,330
Farewell?

72
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,620
Chief Editor. Are you looking for me?

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,750
I've heard

74
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,910
you've been investigating
the private club, right?

75
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,580
Stop it.

76
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,330
Stop it?

77
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,410
But that's...

78
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,370
Enough.

79
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not here to discuss with you.

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,540
What about my topic?

81
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,540
Do you think we

82
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,040
would bankrupt without this topic?

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,410
Just go out and look for stories.

84
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,950
Besides, you're very good at writing...

85
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,080
Look,

86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,540
the story about Furong Village

87
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,790
was well-written.

88
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,160
The click rate was so high.

89
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,450
Right?

90
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,500
Fine.

91
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,370
Got it.

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,870
I'm leaving, Chief Editor.

93
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,620
Go ahead.

94
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,750
Come in.

95
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,950
They told me to stop.

96
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,000
Me too. Get in the car first.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
That police named Yu Pengliang is out.

98
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,120
Right.

99
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,620
There's a girl with him.

100
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,410
You said

101
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,200
Daizi sometimes acted very strangely.

102
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,620
Since when?

103
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,790
Furong Village.

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,660
Since she visited Furong Village.

105
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,950
Furong Village?

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,330
What have you been busy with?

107
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,540
Interviewing Furong Village.

108
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,040
It's a very bizarre place.

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,370
Hello.

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,040
Okay, got it.

111
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,450
I have to go back to the police station.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,830
Well,

113
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,290
you go there first?

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Then come soon.

115
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,290
See you there.

116
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Miss,

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,290
why do you go to Furong Village?

118
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,660
It is not a tourist attraction.

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,500
There is an old villa in Furong Village.

120
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,660
That's not a tourist attraction.

121
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,700
Did you get fooled by some travel guide?

122
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,660
What do you mean?

123
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,450
(Everyone there is surnamed Lu.)

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,330
(Their ancestors)

125
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,750
(moved here from another place.)

126
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,200
(They don't like
to interact with outsiders.)

127
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
(But later on,)

128
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,500
(a foreigner came.)

129
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,910
(That villa)

130
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,080
(was built by him.)

131
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,000
(But what's strange is,)

132
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,620
(a tsunami happened years ago,)

133
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,410
(and the village was wiped out.)

134
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,370
(But that villa still
stands there intact.)
