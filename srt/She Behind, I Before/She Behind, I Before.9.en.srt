00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:38,816
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,330
Sir, hello.

4
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,830
Here.

5
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,870
Sir, hello.

6
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,910
Drink anything?

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,870
Latte?

8
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,160
I'll have a latte, thank you.

9
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,250
Okay.

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,620
I seldom visit places like this.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,540
What's so great about places like this?

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,040
They're just for taking a break.

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,370
It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,000
But places with more people are safer.

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,450
Yingxin used to say things like that.

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,290
If

17
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,410
she were still alive,

18
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,000
she would get along well with you.

19
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,750
I have organized

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,450
the clues we three have at hand.

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,200
You can take a look.

22
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:45,950
(A Woman From M Country Died Strangely)
These are cases

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,870
of female suicides

24
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,040
rather suspicious

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,370
within our search range.

26
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,120
I've categorized them
into two scenarios.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,700
(A Woman From M Country Died At Home)
One is those we can find out

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,870
that before their death,

29
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,790
they must have gone through

30
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,040
great suffering

31
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,950
and committed suicide with hatred.

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,540
(A Woman From M Country Left A Suicide Note)
Like this one.

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,000
She left a suicide note,

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,370
saying to exchange her life

35
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,039
for a chance to revenge.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,080
Another kind
is girls from humble families

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,790
with pretty faces

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,080
and above-average academic performance.

39
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,790
Yet they committed suicide somehow.

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,120
What's even stranger is

41
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,500
that their families

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,000
seem unwilling to investigate

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,080
what exactly happened.

44
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,120
If we observe it carefully,

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,200
we can see

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,000
that the intervals between their deaths

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,450
follow a pattern.

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,000
What pattern?

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,790
If we consider a person's achievements,

50
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,750
fortune,

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,870
appearance,

52
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,790
and the extent of her emotions

53
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,370
as a person's value,

54
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,040
then after the death
of a person with a higher value,

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
the time until the next death occurs

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,290
will be longer.

57
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,500
They are like

58
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,870
a type of fuel
for sustaining the operation

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,580
of a machine.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,250
Those low-valued girls

61
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,870
will be burned out quickly,

62
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,200
so their deaths will be more frequent.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,904
(A Woman In M Country Lost Control
And Jumped Off A Bridge)

64
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,660
This isn't everything.

65
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,200
So what to do now?

66
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,750
You said Yingxin told you

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,120
last time,

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,080
Xiong pulled you into the illusion,

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,910
wanting you to enter the Gate.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,830
Maybe they have already
set their sights on you.

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,080
Why don't you hide then?

72
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,160
Their abilities

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,040
are already beyond

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,290
our control.

75
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,660
Unpredictable.

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,330
In the illusion,

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,200
I was chosen by the Gate.

78
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,410
So unless I die,

79
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,950
the Gate needs me.

80
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,790
Exactly.

81
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,080
So you should hide.

82
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,910
But the Gate won't choose
that many people,

83
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,450
yet so many have died.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,790
So,

85
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,950
if I were to hide,

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,080
where could I possibly go?

87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,950
How many more innocent girls

88
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,950
will die in vain?

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,200
I can't hide.

90
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,500
With money,

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
your mom can survive.

92
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,080
Sorry, Chief Editor.

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
I...

94
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,330
What's wrong?

95
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,000
Chief Editor.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
I'd like to take a leave.

97
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,330
Take a leave?

98
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,540
I didn't mishear, did I?

99
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,080
Everyone is so busy right now.

100
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,200
You want a leave?

101
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,160
Achieving something

102
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
doesn't mean

103
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,450
you can do anything.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
Listen to me, Chief Editor.

105
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,000
I've been working hard these years.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,950
I've saved up all the leave
I should take there.

107
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,790
This time I think...

108
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,080
Don't think about it.

109
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,410
These years...

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,250
These years...

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,750
You've been working really hard

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,580
these years.

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,830
Just taking a leave.

114
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,200
I approve it.

115
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,790
Go.

116
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,950
Take a few more days off.

117
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,660
Thank you.

118
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,830
Go ahead.

119
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,250
Close the door for me on your way out.

120
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,370
Thank you.

121
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,580
Have fun.
