=Episode 18=

3
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:09,080
(Younger Sister, Zhou Dailing)

4
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,250
Zhou Daizi.

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,080
Zhou Daizi.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,950
Zhou Daizi.

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,040
Zhou Daizi, where are you?

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,660
(What wish do you want to make?)

9
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,410
Zhou Daizi.

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,620
(What wish do you want to make?)

11
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,910
Shut up.

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Zhou Daizi, where are you?

13
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
(Dailing.)

14
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,200
(Dailing.)

15
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,330
Daizi.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,450
(Dailing.)

17
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,410
Daizi.

18
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,410
(It's me.)

19
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,040
Zhou Daizi, are you in there?

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,540
Daizi.

21
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,660
Dai...

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,750
(Dailing.)

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,370
Zhou Daizi, are you in there?

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,160
I can't open it.

25
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,200
(I can finally feel you, Dailing.)

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,750
Daizi.

27
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,830
Don't cry.

28
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,160
(Dailing.)

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,290
(Do you think it's like
we are in Mom's womb?)

30
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,450
(We can't see each other,)

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,830
(but I can feel you,)

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,910
(and you can feel me too.)

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,200
Well,

34
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,200
it really is.

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,290
At least now,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,450
we're finally together.

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,040
She has already entered the Gate.

38
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,540
In a while,

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,200
the Gate will take her away,

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,500
then the ritual will be complete.

41
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,370
Anyway, we can deduce

42
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,450
that the former me

43
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,910
must have made a wish

44
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,120
like going back to the past,

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,950
so we entered the cycle.

46
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,120
This can be verified

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,370
by Yu Pengliang's memory.

48
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,700
He has met me
in at least two different times.

49
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,870
From what I know about us,

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,290
we would definitely think

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,660
if we could do it again,

52
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,370
we would do it better than now.

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,580
This really is our style.

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,250
We have already done very well.

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,330
This time,

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
let's try a different choice.

57
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,290
A different choice?

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,950
A girl told me

59
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,000
not to make a wish.

60
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,870
Hurry.

61
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,120
Call the doctor.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,450
If Zhou Daizi dies,

63
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,660
the Gate will vanish.

64
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,580
Go now.

65
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Don't make a wish?

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,950
I think we can give it a try.

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,790
We split from one

68
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,120
into two.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,450
That's why the Gate chose both of us.

70
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,870
Then I made a wish

71
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,870
to let you enter the Gate
to find out the truth.

72
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,330
Perhaps,

73
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,580
after so many wishes and attempts,

74
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,079
we finally got some useful information.

75
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,500
I feel
what the Lu clan hopes the most is

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,790
that I enter the Gate

77
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,790
and make a wish.

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,620
Why do I feel

79
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,370
you seem to be smarter?

80
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,410
I've always been very smart, okay?

81
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,410
Do you think our choice

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,870
is correct?

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,620
I don't know.

84
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,200
Perhaps,

85
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,080
no one will ever be saved

86
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,910
because of the Gate.

87
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,830
And no one else will die
because of the Gate.

88
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,330
We really are of one mind.

89
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,870
Never mind.

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,290
Since we've made the choice,

91
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,080
then don't regret it.

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
What a pity.

93
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,750
I know

94
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,790
you are right by my side,

95
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,950
but I can't see you,

96
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,250
nor can I touch you.

97
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,120
Otherwise,

98
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,000
I would surely give you

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
a super big hug.

100
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,370
Then I have to thank this place.

101
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,040
What?

102
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,370
(The doctor is here.)

103
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,660
(Hurry.)

104
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,000
What sound is that?

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,080
What's wrong with you?

106
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,410
Hurry.

107
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,500
You can do it.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,540
Wake up.

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,160
I feel

110
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,410
I am slowly coming to life.

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,500
My connection to the outside world

112
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,120
is also getting stronger.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,790
Are they trying to wake you up?

114
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,870
If I haven't entered the Gate

115
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,410
and made a wish,

116
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,160
the Gate will keep waiting for me.

117
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,000
This shows

118
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,790
that what we thought was right.

119
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,080
As long as you enter the Gate,

120
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,500
you must make a wish.

121
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,750
Otherwise,

122
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,790
the Gate will lose its power.

123
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,250
We don't have much time.

124
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Let's go.

125
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,200
Let's go.

126
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,950
Go on.

127
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,540
Make her wake up.

128
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,870
Wake up, Zhou Daizi.

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,910
It's over.

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,040
It's all over.

131
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,160
Zhou Daizi.

132
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,620
Zhou Daizi.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,950
I'm here too.

134
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,120
Are you okay?

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,120
I'm fine.

136
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,290
Is this the room at the edge
that you mentioned?

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,290
Yes.

138
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,370
I think I've been here before.

139
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,120
Will we succeed?

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,950
I don't know.

141
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,660
It's okay.

142
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,660
As long as you are with me.

143
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,080
We came into this world

144
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,040
together.

145
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,450
Of course

146
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,330
we'll leave this world together.

147
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,080
Right.

148
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,330
This way,

149
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,950
I think everything will come to an end.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,620
You're awake. After this treatment,

151
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,250
your entire course of therapy
will be completed.

152
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,410
Don't let this dream get to you.

153
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,160
Xiong and Clan Chief Lu
have both been brought to justice.

154
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,040
It's all over now.

155
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,580
These are all lies.

156
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,910
They used hallucinogens

157
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,620
and strong psychological suggestions,

158
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,700
causing the victims to have illusions.

159
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,500
In fact, there is no Gate at all.

160
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,790
Fortunately, you exposed them

161
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,950
letting more ignorant people
know the truth

162
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,539
and stay away from harm.

163
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,830
I can understand all these.

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,700
Live well.
Your family is waiting for you.

165
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,450
My family?

166
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,080
(Since the K Group
and Clan Chief Lu were caught,)

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,620
(the crime rate in our city
has plummeted.)

168
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,870
Oh my!

169
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,500
Another person is scamming online.

170
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,290
How can so many people believe him?

171
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,750
So, what do you want to do?

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,450
I like challenging tasks.

173
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,750
I'm going to expose him.
