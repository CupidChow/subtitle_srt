00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,912
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,910
Anyway, I already know

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,290
Zhou Daizi's disappearance

5
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,160
is related to Xiong.

6
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,290
I understand.

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,410
Do you want me to stop you?

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,750
Don't.

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,410
Alright.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,120
Let's just leave it.

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,830
We use our own methods.

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,410
Let's part ways.

13
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,410
Why are you here?

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,450
Isn't it all over?

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,450
Feel free to sit.

16
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,910
Ever since you took the child away,

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,410
Mom didn't pray

18
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,580
every day like before.

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,120
But,

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,620
she always says

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,200
she can still
hear Yingxin talking to her.

22
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,370
So,

23
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,410
she refuses to move back.

24
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,500
She says Yingxin told her

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,200
that things are not over yet

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,410
and it's dangerous over there.

27
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,949
Perhaps,

28
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,250
it will take some time

29
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,000
for her to overcome the illusion.

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,330
Maybe this isn't the illusion.

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,830
What do you mean?

32
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,910
(Go save Yu. He's gone to find Xiong.)

33
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,330
Who are you?

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,700
(Help me.)

35
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,830
Help me.

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
It's Yingxin.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,870
(Tell my mom and brother)

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
(not to worry about me.)

39
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,700
Yingxin?

40
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,790
(It's Xiong.)

41
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,870
Yingxin.

42
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,580
Is that you, Yingxin?

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,160
Be careful with him.

44
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,750
Don't enter the Gate.

45
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,540
What exactly is the Gate?

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,290
I am not sure.

47
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,080
But the Gate accepted my wish.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,290
I don't know how to explain it to you.

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,290
But after I had a dream...

50
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,250
No.

51
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,410
That wasn't a dream.

52
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,160
Anyway,

53
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,910
after I touched
the Gate in the illusion,

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,120
I found out

55
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,250
that I could sense Yingxin.

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,660
Wait.

57
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
What?

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,790
What are

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,450
the illusion and the Gate?

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
What did Yingxin tell you?

61
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,330
She said

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,250
you must move on

63
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,500
and live well with Yingtian.

64
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,290
Live well.

65
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,830
Live well.

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,250
Xiong.

67
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,290
Can you hear me?

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,540
Xiong.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,700
Why does the Gate
give more and more power

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,829
to Yan Yingxin?

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,330
While making me weaker and weaker?

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
I have sent so many into the Gate,

73
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,950
but this is how it repays me?

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,950
Just

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,200
give it the person it chose,

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,410
and there would be no problem?

77
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,000
That's easier said than done.

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,950
The person chosen

79
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,500
has to enter the Gate willingly.

80
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,200
Or, why would I put so much effort

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,370
to weave the illusion?

82
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,950
Maybe

83
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,870
the emotions in the illusion
are not strong enough.

84
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,830
Let's continue to cooperate.

86
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,870
I can help you.

87
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,830
Don't you just want

88
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,450
to act according to your own plan?

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,830
Why come to me?

90
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,660
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,910
I won't act impulsively anymore.

92
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,660
I'm not Zhou Daizi.

93
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,910
We have nothing between us.

94
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,160
Besides,

95
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,830
it's me who used you.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,450
You don't need to say sorry.

97
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,120
I just want

98
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,750
to find out why Daizi is missing.

99
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,450
Well,

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,040
if you have any plan,

101
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll stick to it.

102
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,080
Come on.

103
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,910
I have found

104
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,750
a lot of useful information.

105
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,700
Yan Yingtian helped me too.

106
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,620
You collaborated with him?

107
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,080
Any problem?

108
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,790
No.

109
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,830
Not at all.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,330
I'm just curious

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,660
why he helps you.

112
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,290
Because he wants to help his sister.

113
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,450
To seek revenge?

114
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,370
Yan Yingxin's death is related to Xiong.

115
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,910
What do you want to know?

116
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,040
I just want to help you.

117
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,450
I have already done as you said

118
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,080
to return to Zhou Dailing.

119
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,250
I can tell you all the information,

120
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,750
but I will not do anything

121
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,910
that hurts her.

122
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,500
If you hurt her,

123
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,870
our cooperation ends.
