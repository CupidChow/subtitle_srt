00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,816
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,700
Hello.

4
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,750
What?

5
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,580
After your police station lost Nuo Ha,

6
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,910
the efficiency is this high?

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,620
Stop talking nonsenses.

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,250
You don't know

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,080
how troublesome is the one
we're dealing with.

10
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,540
The person in my dream

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,540
is real?

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,370
Okay, I'll send you the information.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,200
You take a look.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,660
I'll go to you after I get off work.

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,540
Okay.

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,370
Hey, wait.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,950
I got home yesterday
and found the red dot

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,910
on my forehead like that

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,080
of a kindergarten kid.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,620
Did you make it?

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,620
I walked around all day
with that red dot.

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,790
It's so embarrassing.

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,000
It's to save you.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,580
You police believe in
this sort of thing?

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,620
Right.

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,410
You are the police from M Country.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,410
In the end, you woke up.

28
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,450
Alright, I have to go.

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,250
I'm busy here.

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,160
See you later.

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,620
See you later.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Based on your description,

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,660
this is the sketched portrait

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,750
of the one in your dream.

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,200
It's K Group's CEO,

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,450
Xiong.

37
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,500
K Group?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,870
K Group

39
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,580
operates legally and illegally,
with huge assets

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,660
and great power.

41
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,120
Compared with Nuo Ha and Feng Sa Wan?

42
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,580
He's tougher to deal with
than these two together.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,449
How many people in M Country

44
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,160
could manipulate Nuo Ha and Feng Sa Wan?

45
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,290
Few.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,870
But,

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,200
this K Group,

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,160
to be exact,

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,540
this Xiong

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,910
absolutely counts as one.

51
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,500
Are you sure you saw him in your dream?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,790
It's him.

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,620
Take a break.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160
I have work to do.

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,500
Be careful on the road.

56
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:45,312
(Gate)

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,120
(Go save Yu. He's gone to find Xiong.)

58
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,160
Yu Pengliang.

59
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,910
What're you doing?

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,410
Do you know what you're doing?

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,080
I know.

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,160
You know?

63
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,580
Do you think you can kill him like this?

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,200
Why are you doing this?

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,370
You asked if I believe
you traveled through time.

66
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,660
I really do.

67
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,040
After taking this picture with her,

68
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,160
I wanted to confess my love to her,

69
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,000
but I couldn't say it,

70
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,910
yet she said goodbye.

71
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,370
She told me

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,830
that it might be the last time we meet.

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,040
I thought
she had understood my intentions,

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,410
and wanted to reject me.

75
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,540
But after a few days,

76
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,370
I saw her again.

77
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,330
No.

78
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,790
It was you.

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,540
You acted
as if you didn't know me at all.

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,290
I just want to know

81
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,660
if the deceased is Bu Na.

82
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,410
Sorry.

83
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,160
We can't reveal anything.

84
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,700
- I am a journalist.
- Liang.

85
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,120
I'll handle it.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,160
You are Yu Pengliang?

87
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,410
What am I saying?
Of course, you are Yu Pengliang.

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,200
Anyway, I already know

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
Zhou Daizi's disappearance

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,450
is related to Xiong.
