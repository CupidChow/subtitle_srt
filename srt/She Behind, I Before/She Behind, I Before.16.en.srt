3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,500
I once tried

4
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,370
to explore the edge of that world,

5
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,950
but I couldn't reach it.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,950
I

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,620
even reached a small town,

8
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,040
the people there

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,330
looked exactly the same as us,

10
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,790
all living humans.

11
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,790
But I was so scared

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,660
and ran back.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,290
Perhaps,

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,870
what the Lu clan said is all true.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,290
Perhaps the Gate will not harm anyone,

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,040
instead, it might help more people.

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,160
And then?

18
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,250
What wish would you make?

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,500
I don't know.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,910
But we owe it to Yu Pengliang.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,620
He got involved

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,160
seeking revenge for me.

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,790
I owe him this.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,370
Is that so?

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,870
Didn't he?

26
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,120
Is that so?

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,830
Then what wish would you make?

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,830
Let me think about it.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,450
Give me some time.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,580
Did the Sacred Woman enter the Gate?

31
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,250
This time, she just fell asleep.

32
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,540
Will she be willing to help us?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,370
Of course.

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,250
After all, it is only us

35
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,000
who will use the Gate for good.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,790
Right?

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,830
Right.

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,080
(Promise me.)

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,870
(Go look for me.)

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,950
(No matter when,)

41
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,830
(I will be waiting for you.)

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
Zhou Daizi.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,620
You finally look decent.

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,040
Where's your glasses and plain shirt

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,660
a journalist would wear?

46
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,040
You come down here

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,870
wearing this?

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,620
Can't believe it.

49
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,000
Change into something else now.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,620
I'm comfortable dressed like this.

51
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,000
Hurry up.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm waiting here.

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,450
This is the place

54
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,830
you want to come.

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,040
Experience the nature.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,200
Is it good?

57
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,040
Nature?

58
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,370
Didn't you hate bugs the most?

59
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,370
This place

60
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,450
seems to be full of bugs.

61
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,620
Stop talking and come with me.

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,950
Don't drag me.

63
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,750
What?

64
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,750
Stop biting your lip.

65
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,250
I told you last time

66
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,370
that this is a bad habit.

67
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,910
I thought you had changed it.

68
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,540
When?

69
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,000
Last time.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
You suddenly came to me

71
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,000
to teach me how to solve cases.

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,660
The second time.

73
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,040
What second time?

74
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,620
What?

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,000
This is the third time
I've come to see you.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,580
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,700
Secret.

78
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,790
Why have you been
so temperamental lately?

79
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,580
Changing all the time.

80
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,290
But I think this is quite good.

81
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,579
I wanted to say so last time.

82
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,370
But you changed back later.

83
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,830
I thought it's an illusion.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,410
Perhaps,

85
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,410
I am schizophrenic.

86
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,910
Actually, what I mean is...

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,580
I just want to tell you...

88
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,830
I think...

89
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,040
Well...

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,830
I know.

91
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,160
What do you know? You don't know.

92
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,330
I know.

93
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
It's almost dark.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,580
Let's take a photo.

95
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,410
Okay.

96
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,830
Over here.

97
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,040
In front of that tree.

98
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,830
Let me see.

99
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,790
It's quite well.

100
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,910
Need to beautify it a bit.

101
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,580
What is this?

102
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,500
It's getting late.

103
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,910
I should leave now.

104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
Now?

105
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,830
Perhaps,

106
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,830
this is the last time we meet.

107
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,120
What do you mean?

108
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,540
You'll know it later.

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,830
Goodbye.

110
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,620
She is awake.

111
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,200
How did she wake up?

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,330
It shouldn't be.

113
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,330
It's troublesome.

114
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,330
How could this happen?

115
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,830
You're awake.

116
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you think?

117
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,790
It's not scary there,

118
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,750
right?

119
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,950
Have you thought it through?

120
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,160
No rush.

121
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,370
I want to see Yu Pengliang once more.

122
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,290
I didn't send them to the funeral home.

123
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,540
If your wish
brings them all back to life,

124
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,790
it would scare others.

125
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,450
That's very thoughtful of you.

126
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,250
Actually, besides them,

127
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,290
you could save even more people.

128
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
Is that so?

129
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,120
You can make a wish

130
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,910
to restore the memories of my clan

131
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,080
back to one year ago.

132
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,200
That way,

133
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,500
those of the Lu clan who were killed

134
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,500
by K Group during the investigation
can come back.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,410
And I swear,

136
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,870
before the two of them get involved,

137
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,500
to take down Xiong.

138
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,660
And my sister and me?

139
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,540
You two

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
might have to sacrifice yourselves.

141
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,540
However,

142
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,450
by then you can make

143
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,700
a different wish.

144
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,660
You just want to save your clan, right?

145
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,870
Yes.

146
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,330
Moreover,

147
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,370
the Gate can only

148
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,410
do good deeds

149
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,330
and save more people

150
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,750
when it's in our hands.

151
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,580
Save more people?

152
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,200
By sacrificing one person each time?

153
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,450
But they are doing it voluntarily.

154
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,540
Are you sure?

155
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,500
Of course.

156
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,080
They are noble,

157
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,540
so we

158
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,910
honor them as Sacred Women,

159
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,870
and worship them

160
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,660
generation after generation.

161
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,330
How ridiculous.

162
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,910
You are just glorifying their sacrifice

163
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,500
and ignoring their suffering.

164
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,540
Is this selflessness?

165
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,580
This is a group selfishness.

166
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,660
What did you say?
