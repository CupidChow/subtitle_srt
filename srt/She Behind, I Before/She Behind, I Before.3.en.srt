=She Behind, I Before=

2
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:38,848
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,830
That is our mom.

4
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,660
She...

5
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,410
She's fine.

6
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,660
Don't worry.

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
This is

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,040
the child that Yingxin aborted.

9
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,440
(Police Station, Nuo Ha's office)
Let's split up for evidence.

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,944
You go to Yan Yingxin's place.

11
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:28,032
I'll go to Nuo Ha's office.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,750
I'll bring Bu Na to you?

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,790
Within a short period,

14
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,540
don't let me ruin her.

15
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,830
She has other guests awaiting.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,950
This woman is really stupid.

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,410
Did you hear a woman's cry?

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,250
No.

19
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,384
(Appraisal results: Based on
the available data and DNA analysis,)

20
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,200
(Nuo Ha is the biological father
of Yan Yingxin's child.)

21
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
Yan Yingxin's child is really Nuo Ha's?

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,660
With this

23
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,500
and Jila's testimony,

24
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,160
I think we can catch them.

25
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,910
Then I'll go organize the materials.

26
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,000
We have to catch them

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
as soon as possible.

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,620
Can't give them time to fight back.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,620
Okay.

30
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,830
Then I'll go collect the evidence.

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,040
Hello.

32
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,580
Got it.

33
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,040
What happened?

34
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,120
Feng Sa Wan is dead.

35
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Dead?

36
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,750
How?

37
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,620
In the private club,

38
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
he died of poisoning.

39
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,580
What about Nuo Ha?

40
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,790
Nuo Ha is fine.

41
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,250
Recently,

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,870
the case of Qiansheng Entertainment

43
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,700
artist Yan Yingxin has been solved.

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,200
(Former CEO Feng Sa Wan)

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,330
(of Qiansheng Entertainment)

46
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,000
(recruited many young girls
in the name of the company,)

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,580
(and asked them
to engage in power deals)

48
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,870
(in exchange for resources,
or threated them)

49
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,000
(with high liquidated damages.)

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,290
(And during this process,)

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,660
(he kept naked photos
and videos of female artists)

52
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,870
(as a threat.)

53
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,700
(According to the testimony)

54
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,660
(of former artist Ms. Jila
of Qiansheng Entertainment)

55
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,660
(and relevant investigation
and evidence,)

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,950
(the former chief of police Nuo Ha)

57
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,950
(played as a guard)

58
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,580
(in these power deals.)

59
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,910
(Thus, the girls facing threats)

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,330
(didn't dare to call the police.)

61
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,290
Hello, this way.

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,410
Nuo Ha will not be sentenced to death.

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,080
Why?

64
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,200
Indeed.

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,700
The world is just so unfair.

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,080
What a pity.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,410
You are so beautiful.

68
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,120
This is probably your last movie.

69
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,330
Impossible.

70
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,160
You still don't know yet.

71
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,120
Someone online

72
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,450
has leaked the list of victims.

73
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,120
Now everyone is saying

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,370
that you deserve it.

75
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,700
Who told you so?

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,120
This is impossible.

77
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,580
Why?

78
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,120
As I see,

79
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,950
although you sold yourself out,

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,290
who did you really hurt?

81
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,410
Why can't everyone

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,660
offer you a way out?

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,410
It's all over.

84
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,870
Indeed.

85
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,950
It's all over.

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,950
Yu Pengliang,
do you know where Bu Na is?

87
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,910
I'm afraid she'd do something stupid.

88
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,290
She's here in the police station,

89
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,790
might be in the interrogation room.

90
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,950
Then hurry up and find her.

91
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,870
Go comfort her.

92
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,750
Okay.

93
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,450
Bu Na is missing.

94
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,450
I'll go check her address.

95
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,910
Someone's jumped off the building.

96
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,750
This is that actress Bu Na.

97
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,370
What happened to her?

98
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,290
What happened?

99
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't know.

100
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,290
Someone's jumped off.

101
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,620
Call an ambulance.

102
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,290
I did.

103
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,750
(Xiong, CEO of K Group)
Has Bu Na committed suicide?

104
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,750
She jumped off the building

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,910
in a moment of great despair

107
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,080
with a strong hatred and curse.

108
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,120
Did the Gate respond to her?

109
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,750
A little bit.

110
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,160
Feng Sa Wan has been
poisoned to death by us.

111
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,540
And Nuo Ha is
also seriously ill in prison.

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,160
It seems that the Gate
is not satisfied with her.

113
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,370
The Gate should have found
the one it wanted.

114
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,750
(The evil forces led by the K Group,)

115
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
(using Nuo Ha and Feng Sa Wan,)

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,250
(created scams.)

117
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,040
(Through the Gate,)

118
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,500
(in the name of sacrifice,)

119
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,620
(they deceived those ignorant girls)

120
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,370
(to satisfy their hidden desires.)
