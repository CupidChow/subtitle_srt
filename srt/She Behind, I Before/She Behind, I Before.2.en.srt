=Episode 2=

3
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,500
I did everything the company

4
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,660
asked me to.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,750
Why still promote that newcomer?

6
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,620
Why?

7
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,250
Get out.

8
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,540
I've given up even my dignity.

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,540
I've done everything. What can I get?

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,200
Get out.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,580
Aren't you afraid

12
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,500
I'll spill everything

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,700
I know?

14
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,410
Do you know who you're talking to?

15
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,700
Before that,

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,000
you would already be dead.

17
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,950
You're next, Bu Na.

18
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,370
You know,

19
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,120
once you were a valuable item,

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,500
but every item would devalue one day.

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,410
So,

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,580
just resent.

23
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,950
Just go crazy.

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,000
Before they trample you into the mud,

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,000
perish with them.

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,500
He's Yan Yingxin's elder brother,

27
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Yan Yingtian.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,330
He's been living with their mom.

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,160
They are very close.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,580
They often travel together.

31
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,000
Even paparazzi knew it.

32
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,250
The three of them are very close?

33
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,120
Stop biting your lip.

34
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,410
It might bleed.

35
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,200
When did you pick up this bad habit?

36
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Didn't you say
that your sister has this habit?

37
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,910
So do you?

38
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,160
(I forgot that I am Daizi.)

39
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,370
It's obvious

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,450
there are others looking for them.

41
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,040
This place is so messed up.

42
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,950
They must be looking for something.

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,540
Yan Yingtian might be caught.

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,830
I am not sure.

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,370
This

46
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,330
might be more complicated
than we imagined.

47
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,870
I have an idea.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,160
To alert the enemy.

49
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,200
(I've got Yan Yingxin's diary.)

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,330
Where did this person come from?

51
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,620
With so many people under you,

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,040
can't you even find a diary?

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,830
Nuo Ha.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,450
We're now in the same boat.

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,700
If we can't find the person who sent it,

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,250
we're both doomed.

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,370
Where?

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,830
Right near you.

59
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,870
Yan Yingtian.

60
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,700
Where's the diary?

61
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,750
You wouldn't want that diary

62
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,870
to be made public.

63
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,790
No one would wish

64
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,000
for their sister
to go through such things.

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,700
Yingxin is so nice and kind.

66
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,540
She has never

67
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,910
complained her worries.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,450
No wonder there is no diary.

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,250
The one in 2020 isn't here.

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,200
Take them.

71
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,500
No wonder there is no diary.

72
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,200
Everyone thinks

73
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,540
if there are diaries in 2016,

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,250
2017, 2018 and 2019,

75
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,290
there must be a diary in 2020.

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,700
Because some want it to exist,

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,540
while others fear it.

78
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,620
But Yan Yingxin is not one

79
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,120
who records her worries.

80
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,660
The last diary entry in 2019

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,700
stops at October.

82
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,370
She said,

83
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,870
"Text is like memory.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,370
If it's not written down,

85
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,250
can it be forgotten?"

86
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,870
October?

87
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,620
October.

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,540
So it was not just once.

89
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,410
Not just once.

90
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,950
It's been a whole half year.

91
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,540
Until now,

92
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,000
you are still protecting

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,660
me, such a loser.

94
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,000
You know,

95
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,870
this is not just ruining her reputation.

96
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,830
It's not only her

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,080
who went through this.

98
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,830
And them,

99
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,160
so many innocent girls.

100
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,950
Even though they haven't spoken

101
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,000
their pain out loud,

102
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,370
they must live in pain,

103
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,330
like in the hell.

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,870
Okay.

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,370
I can help you.
