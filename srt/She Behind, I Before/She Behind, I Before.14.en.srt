=Episode 14=

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,830
Daizi didn't get a chance to react,

4
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,870
and he just died.

5
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,870
Drag him over there.

6
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,410
No, no!

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,660
I'm begging you.

8
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,830
Don't.

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,080
If I cut him,

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,910
he'll die slowly.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,120
Don't.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,700
Please.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,660
I'll give you some time.

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,080
Please.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,290
Zhou Daizi.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,660
Do you want me to die with them?

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,750
Just enter the Gate.

18
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,370
Yu Pengliang.

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,000
Yu Pengliang.

20
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,040
Daizi.

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,040
Promise me.

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,370
Go look for me.

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,370
No, no!

24
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,000
If I hadn't gone to you,

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,160
you wouldn't get involved in this.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,080
But I've fallen in love with you.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,000
- Stop talking.
- No matter when,

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,830
I will be waiting for you.

29
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,370
Stop talking.

30
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,000
You must survive.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,870
You survive,

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,750
then I could meet you

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,450
and fall for you.

34
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,500
Don't die.

35
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,370
Promise me.

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,789
Okay?

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,330
No.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
Yu Pengliang.

39
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,870
Ready?

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,330
Ready.

41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,370
I guess I bet on

42
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,660
a mutually destructive end.

43
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,330
Miss, come with me.

44
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,540
Mom, is she the Sacred Woman?

45
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,120
Sorry, the child knows nothing.

46
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,500
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

47
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,790
Miss, you go in.

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
You're not going in?

49
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,580
These years...

50
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,450
Just taking a leave.

51
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,540
I approve it.

52
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,250
It's you.

53
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,790
I am the current Clan Chief Lu.

54
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,080
Thanks for helping us with the Gate.

55
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,830
What about Pengliang and Yingtian?

56
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,040
They are dead.

57
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,000
You are the one Yu Pengliang
has been in contact with

58
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,910
and helping us secretly?

59
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,750
It seems

60
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,410
Yu Pengliang told you everything.

61
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,200
You know what the Gate is, right?

62
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,790
Tell me.

63
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,700
The Sacred Women who
voluntarily entered the Gate,

64
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,830
for the sake of their loved ones,

65
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,330
for the sake of their clan,

66
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,200
chose to sacrifice themselves.

67
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,000
I guess

68
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,500
so did your sister.

69
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,910
Perhaps someone told her,

70
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,200
sacrificing herself

71
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,910
could save her own sister.

72
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,410
- You know I'm not...
- You've figured it out, right?

73
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,200
Yu Pengliang became our informant.

74
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,370
We sensed on you

75
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,080
the power of the Gate.

76
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,410
So, we contacted the people around you.

77
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
And he

78
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,330
needed the truth.

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't want money.

80
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,540
What do you want then?

81
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,950
Have you ever thought

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,700
she

83
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,000
might not the one you want?

84
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,950
No.

85
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,870
She is.

86
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,660
But she is not the friend

87
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,790
I am familiar with.

88
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,000
Yu Pengliang wanted to know

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,790
where the former Zhou Daizi went.

90
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,870
Where did she go?

91
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,080
Someone who possesses the Gate

92
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,040
lured her into the Gate.

93
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,450
Thanks to you,

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,450
we know

95
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,250
that this person is Xiong.

96
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,330
After Yu Pengliang failed
to assassinate Xiong,

97
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,950
he came to us,

98
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,830
wanting us to take action.

99
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,370
But Xiong's power

100
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,500
is far greater than we imagined.

101
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,580
We could only let Yu Pengliang

102
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,000
return to you

103
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,250
and help you.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I didn't expect

105
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,160
he would risk his life.
