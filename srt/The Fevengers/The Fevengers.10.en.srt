=Episode 10=

3
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,150
Wen Ruoyun,

4
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,790
I've been searching everywhere for you.

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,150
And here you are.

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,298
Do you think I have to hide from you?

7
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,229
The CEO of Wen Group

8
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,909
forged

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,578
a legal notice.

10
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,750
If this gets out,

11
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,698
who do you think will look bad,
you or me?

12
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,710
Before I call you out,

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,509
you've already come to me.

14
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,698
I'm generous enough to you

15
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:08,579
to say nothing

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,498
about Gu Yancheng's affair with you.

17
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,830
Generous?

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,990
To me?

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,469
Why didn't you do anything
to Gu Yancheng?

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,029
Why did you come at me instead?

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,498
To keep

22
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,749
your marriage intact,

23
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,150
you even hired someone to beat me.

24
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:31,150
You're a disgusting hypocrite.

25
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:32,990
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,270
Who gave you the courage

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,070
to slander me to my face?

28
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,350
Yan Fei.

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,550
Who are you to do that to me?

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,509
You're insane.

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,589
Both you and Gu Yancheng are insane!

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,469
You pretend to be kind and gentle

33
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,230
but act otherwise behind my back.

34
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,029
Homewrecker?

35
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,069
Homewrecker.

36
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:17,629
I've had enough of hearing this!

37
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,589
You know what?

38
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,259
I met Gu Yancheng first.

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,029
You're the one who got between us.

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,990
What are you on about?

41
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,869
I've had enough of all this!

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,498
The design concept of this quarter

43
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,459
is diamonds,

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,110
inspired by the love story

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,538
of the latest award winner,

46
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,938
Xia Ruoyan.

47
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,299
Despite the ups and downs

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,739
and trust issues in her relationship,

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,338
it eventually came to fruition.

50
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:47,498
I believe this series of jewelry

51
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,979
perfectly portrays

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,859
the difficulties of their love.

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,869
Thank you, everyone.

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,618
We used to be

55
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:59,550
very close friends.

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,579
However, after you become the CEO

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,189
and my superior,

58
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,778
I feel

59
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,510
we're growing apart.

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,789
Chance favors the prepared.

61
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,189
No matter how hard I try,

62
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,950
I'm always inferior to you.

63
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,299
At that time,

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,150
I just got out of a relationship.

65
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,979
I knew I was lost.

66
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,749
but I couldn't control myself.

67
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:23,938
I was worn out

68
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,778
and need someone to listen to me.

69
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,098
And so, I met Gu Yancheng.

70
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,029
Miss,

71
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,510
are you okay?

72
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,990
When you're not happy,

73
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,670
you can touch

74
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,789
some soft fur.

75
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,309
I fell for him at first sight.

76
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,459
I shared every little thing in my life

77
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,950
with him.

78
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,309
We were genuinely happy

79
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,710
during that time.

80
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,830
Why are you not happy again?

81
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,778
My boss wants me to find Vermeer's

82
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,110
"A Match Made in Heaven."

83
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,459
I have no idea at all

84
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,098
which collection institution has it.

85
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,710
How am I supposed to get it for her?

86
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,990
What a coincidence.

87
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,378
A friend of mine

88
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,110
just got the authorization
for Vermeer's exhibition.

89
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,098
One of the pieces that will be displayed

90
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,909
is "The Man Who Kisses A Rose".

91
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,669
Really?

92
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:18,939
You're wonderful, Yancheng.

93
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,630
You've done me a great favor.

94
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,469
Unexpectedly,

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,298
I arrived late

96
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,469
at the exhibition that day

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,229
due to work.

98
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,858
By the time I arrived,

99
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,669
I saw the two of you

100
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,349
staring at each other so affectionately.

101
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,909
If I had known you would
end up together,

102
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,909
I wouldn't have let you go
to the exhibition.

103
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,510
Do you know how furious I was

104
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,429
when I saw you two together?

105
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,029
I didn't know you met Gu Yancheng
before me.

106
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:59,019
I also didn't know
your feelings for him.

107
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,619
You never told me.

108
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,229
Because I'm self-conscious, Wen Ruoyun!

109
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,349
You're better than me in every day.

110
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,579
You're prettier

111
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,229
and richer than I am.

112
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,589
I have nothing.

113
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,699
I thought I could have

114
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,819
the most perfect love in this world.

115
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,950
But you took it away from me.

116
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,178
Why?

117
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:22,939
Why do you have so much

118
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,549
and yet you still take mine away?

119
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,070
I didn't.

120
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,310
So

121
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,630
you abandoned our friendship,

122
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,658
which lasted for ten years,

123
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,109
because of a man?

124
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,029
I know nothing about it at all.

125
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,950
You never considered me a friend.

126
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,630
You...

127
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,538
You're like Gu Yancheng.

128
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,310
You're like everyone else.

129
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,710
You all only see the value
for your own benefit.

130
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,549
Wen Ruoyun,

131
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,059
you still have so many reasons,

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,619
even at a time like this.

133
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,349
Are you always in the right?

134
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,029
I hate you, Wen Ruoyun!

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:28,130
(Business closed. To let)

136
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,178
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:36,218
I can't recall the Vermeer exhibition

138
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,418
you mentioned.

139
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:38,298
We have some records

140
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,538
of previous exhibitions

141
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:39,978
held here.

142
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,019
You can take a look at it.

143
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,658
Thank you.

144
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,549
You're welcome.

145
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,950
So

146
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,139
Vermeer's exhibition

147
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,510
is held by Gu Yancheng.

148
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,178
There were some exhibitions

149
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,830
held for private reasons.

150
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,989
(There's no such thing
as a match made in heaven,)

151
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,229
(romantic encounters,)

152
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,379
(or unexpected reunions.)

153
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,669
(They are all fake.)

154
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,710
(Gu Yancheng,)

155
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,070
(you've been lying to me
from the beginning, haven't you?)

156
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,098
Ruoyun,

157
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,178
I've sent you the address

158
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,589
of Su Xun's home.

159
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,870
Su Xun.

160
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:34,830
Su Xun.

161
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,989
Su Xun,

162
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,549
I didn't come here to blame you.

163
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,899
I just want to talk to you.

164
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,939
There's nothing we can talk about.

165
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,858
You don't have to avoid me.

166
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,349
I know everything now.

167
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,669
Ms. Wen,

168
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,109
I honestly have nothing to do with her.

169
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,349
If you think there is,

170
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,978
she offered me money

171
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,789
for a deal.

172
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,538
If you agree to let me use your identity

173
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,298
to work in Wen Ruoyun's house
as a butler,

174
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,379
the money

175
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,429
will be yours.

176
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,978
Aside from this,

177
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,538
I'll also give you the salary

178
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,070
while I work as the butler.

179
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,109
I know

180
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,469
your husband is sick,

181
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,630
and you need money.

182
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,229
Well.

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,909
Since you disagree,

184
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,549
I won't force you.

185
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,190
Hold on.

186
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:28,978
You won't use my identity

187
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,390
to do anything bad, will you?

188
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,429
Don't worry.

189
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,549
I just want to meet

190
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,709
my old friend.

191
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,778
Did she do something bad

192
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,189
with my identity?

193
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,619
I shouldn't have agreed

194
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,669
for that money.

195
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,750
If my cousin finds out,

196
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,549
she'll definitely scold me.

197
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,110
Don't tell Ms. Wang.

198
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:50,859
She's already old.

199
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,309
I don't want her to worry.

200
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,990
So

201
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,069
you only met that woman once.

202
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,590
Did she give you anything else?

203
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,270
She did.

204
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,818
She slipped a photo

205
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,029
in the money she gave me.

206
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,390
I think she might come back to me,

207
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,990
so I've been keeping it.

208
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,110
She told me

209
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,150
her name was Lin Jiayi.

210
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,549
Lin Jiayi.

211
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,630
I know where I can find you.

212
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:25,418
What's going on?

213
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:26,139
Lin Jiayi.

214
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,029
Lin Jiayi.

215
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,150
Come.

216
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,189
What has happened to you?

217
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,230
Stop pretending.

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,750
If you hadn't locked me up here,

219
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,470
that scum wouldn't have had a chance
to harass me.

220
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:45,669
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,619
I didn't know

222
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,418
He would do that to you

223
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,510
behind my back.

224
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,110
You should leave now.

225
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,139
If He

226
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,990
tells someone that you're still alive,

227
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,538
not even I

228
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,590
can help you.

229
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:02,750
You should consider this carefully.

230
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,658
Take the money

231
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,230
and go somewhere else.

232
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,909
I'll wait for your answer.

233
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,429
Gu Yancheng.

234
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,429
I'm talking to you, Gu Yancheng.

235
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,829
Do you know what Wen Ruoyun
has done to me?

236
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,778
She insults me for plagiarism
in front of everyone.

237
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,390
She called me out and embarrassed me.

238
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,949
Don't try to fit into a world
you don't belong to.

239
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,230
It's hard for both others and yourself.

240
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,029
It's not worth it.

241
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,470
You're belittling me, too?

242
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,658
Am I not good enough to you?

243
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,789
Gu Yancheng,
you did not just belittle me.

244
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,590
Where did you get these photos?

245
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:24,750
I don't know.

246
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,390
Someone sent them

247
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:28,949
to my house.

248
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,818
And the earring piece
left in your house.

249
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,309
They were sent to me altogether.

250
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,069
Earring?

251
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,990
(Lin Jiayi,)

252
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,870
(you're so stubborn.)

253
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,909
(I've let you off once.)

254
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,949
Did you confront Wen Ruoyun?

255
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,418
What are you doing?

256
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,019
You're hurting me.

257
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,110
Let go.

258
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,219
What's wrong with me confronting her?

259
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,178
She insulted me.

260
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,709
Why couldn't I confront her?

261
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,818
I've already told her

262
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,189
everything about us.

263
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,590
Do you think what her face looked like
when she found out?

264
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,750
You can't imagine it.

265
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,949
She deserves it.

266
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,230
You stupid.

267
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,510
Gu Yancheng,

268
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,949
you call me that?

269
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,789
You call me stupid?

270
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,099
I've lost a friendship

271
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,178
and have been called a homewrecker

272
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,309
for your sake.

273
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,538
My love for you is almost out,

274
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:36,990
you know!

275
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,590
You promised to take me away.

276
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,870
What now?

277
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,909
What do you want me to do?

278
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,019
Mr. Gu,

279
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,178
Ms. Shen is here.

280
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,429
Should I let her in?

281
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,829
Which Ms. Shen?

282
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,099
Ruoyun's assistant,

283
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,230
Shen Xiaoman.

284
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,899
Take her out

285
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,739
through the back door.

286
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,150
Don't let Shen Xiaoman see her.

287
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,870
Where are you going, Gu Yancheng?

288
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,069
Gu Yancheng!

289
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,110
Fei.

290
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,350
Fei.

291
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:39,418
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,178
I

293
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,029
left your bag inside.

294
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,350
You're so clumsy.

295
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,099
Zero, five, zero,

296
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,350
eight, two, four.

297
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,739
It's unlocked.

298
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,630
Go ahead.

299
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:18,178
Mister,

300
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,590
please send her to Building No. 3
of Lilan Residential Quarter.

301
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,429
Okay.

302
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,789
Thank you.

303
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,630
