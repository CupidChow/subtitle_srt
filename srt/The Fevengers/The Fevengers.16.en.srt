=Episode 16=

3
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,390
Dear,

4
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,509
are you feeling better now?

5
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,869
How do you feel now?

6
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,589
Sit down.

7
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,139
Look.

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,578
You didn't eat enough supplements,

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,070
that's why you are weak

10
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,430
and often have morning sickness.

11
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,058
It's still warm.

12
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,229
Hurry and eat up.

13
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:07,869
Dear,

14
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,229
I have something to tell you.

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,150
No rush.

16
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,778
Let's finish this first.

17
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:14,550
Here.

18
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,350
Dear,

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,309
actually,

20
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:19,498
I've been going

21
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:21,150
to the company lately

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,749
because of the listing.

23
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:25,990
Listing?

24
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:28,589
If everything goes smoothly,

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,338
we'll be listed in Hong Kong

26
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,190
next week.

27
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,019
By then,

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,858
the company will rise
from being worth three billion

29
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,790
to a ten-billion conglomerate.

30
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:41,579
But I've never heard about this plan

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,630
from you before.

32
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,589
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,778
I'd like you

34
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,099
to take over my position

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,430
and run the company as the CEO.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,150
You see, I'm pregnant now.

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,190
I'm worried
that with my current condition,

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,790
I won't be able to
manage the company well.

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,669
I hope you

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,270
can manage this ten-billion conglomerate
on my behalf.

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,979
When

42
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,909
the baby is born,

43
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,299
I can take care of it at home

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,869
without worries.

45
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,629
Dear,

46
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:19,069
I know this is a heavy burden,

47
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,189
but will you accept it?

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,710
(So,)

49
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,710
(are you greedy pair)

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,029
(tempted by my idea?)

51
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,110
Dear,

52
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,510
take your time to consider it.

53
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,430
It's gone cool,

54
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,589
I'll heat it up again.

55
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,589
I'm sorry, Lawyer Shang.

56
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:25,938
We made a mistake.

57
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,658
We didn't check

58
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,309
the patient's mental health evaluation

59
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,899
and sent out the van.

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,270
You made a mistake?

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,179
Is that enough

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,029
to resolve all the problems?

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,218
Well...

64
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,179
You don't have to say anything more.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,349
I'll send you a legal notice.

66
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,430
Ruoyun is all right now.

67
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,909
Really?

68
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,390
Thankfully.

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,290
(Guangtong Bank Co., Ltd. Detailed Account)
(Account holder: Gu Yancheng)

70
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,150
The mortgaged funds
aren't under Gu Yancheng's name.

71
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,390
Dear,

72
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,589
I'll go to the office with you.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,298
I've considered your suggestion

74
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,909
last night,

75
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,379
so I'd like to go to your company

76
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,338
to familiarize myself
with the operations of each department.

77
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,259
I want to know

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,338
if I'm capable of this job

79
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,379
in case

80
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,630
I end up being a nuisance.

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,750
Dear,

82
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,589
no rush.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,619
I haven't announced this

84
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,070
to the shareholders yet.

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,579
After I hand over the CEO position

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,270
at the shareholders meeting,

87
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,150
it'll be time for you to go there.

88
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:53,950
Sure.

89
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,750
You're thoughtful.

90
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,750
I'll head to the company now.

91
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,349
Good luck.

92
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,858
Are you sure

93
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,338
the psychiatric hospital van

94
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,978
left

95
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,338
because they received a complaint?

96
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,619
I'll look into

97
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,229
who complained.

98
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,349
Go and verify

99
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,459
whether what she said

100
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,390
is true.

101
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,469
All right.

102
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:06,778
This is the financial flow status

103
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,789
of Gu Yancheng in recent times.

104
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,418
After applying
for an investigation order,

105
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:11,738
we immediately submitted requests

106
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,459
to the bank

107
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,619
and the tax system.

108
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,538
I found

109
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,738
that Gu Yancheng's current income

110
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,298
from his gallery

111
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,418
wasn't able to sustain
its basic operation.

112
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,589
Simply put,

113
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,229
he's draining you dry.

114
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:24,538
He also

115
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,059
mortgaged those properties

116
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,510
for a three-billion loan
without your permission,

117
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,469
it didn't go under his name.

118
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,338
This is the woman

119
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,109
who helped him with the mortgage loan,

120
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,950
the deputy director of Guangtong Bank.

121
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,939
If we find her,

122
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,750
we'll know where the money went.

123
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,669
She's out.

124
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,229
Ms. Gao.

125
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,989
Ms. Wen,

126
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,349
it's been a long time.

127
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,750
Are you here for some bank business?

128
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,029
Ms. Gao,

129
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,229
I believe you know why I'm here.

130
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,150
Would you like to talk somewhere else

131
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:12,190
or in the bank?

132
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,190
(That perfume.)

133
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,190
(No wonder Gu Yancheng
managed to get the money so smoothly.)

134
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:21,579
(It seems she is also)

135
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,109
(one of Gu Yancheng's victims.)

136
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,669
What do you want to talk about?

137
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,218
I want to know

138
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,310
where Gu Yancheng's
mortgaged funds went.

139
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,109
I'm sorry, Ms. Wen.

140
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,270
Even though Mr. Gu is your husband,

141
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,259
we can't disclose

142
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,549
the client's personal information.

143
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,699
Hi, Ms. Gao.

144
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,909
I'm Ms. Wen's lawyer, Shang Yu.

145
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,059
Mr. Gu has mortgaged shared property

146
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,579
without my client's permission.

147
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,070
According to the Guarantee Law,

148
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,538
the mortgage you issued is invalid.

149
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,499
Now,

150
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,139
under the law,
I request you to provide us

151
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,778
with the cash flow

152
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,109
of Mr. Gu's mortgaged funds.

153
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,669
I hope you'll cooperate with us.

154
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,150
Please don't make me repeat myself.

155
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,699
Sun Juan.

156
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,499
They used this woman's information

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,178
when they applied

158
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,669
for the loan.

159
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,150
Sun Juan.

160
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,789
Who is she?

161
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:32,350
It's the old rich woman
who came with him.

162
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,230
An old rich woman?

163
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,029
Is it this person?

164
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,859
Yes,

165
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,990
it's her.

166
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,979
Like mother like son.

167
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,309
They both used fake names.

168
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,339
I've already told you

169
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,510
everything you wanted to know.

170
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,789
Can I go now?

171
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,230
Ms. Gao,

172
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,418
I already know

173
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,789
what's going on
between you and Gu Yancheng.

174
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,309
You aren't the only woman he's using.

175
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,909
Don't be fooled again.

176
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,549
Thank you for your cooperation.

177
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,139
Dear.

178
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,990
Dear,

179
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,458
the special team
for the company's listing

180
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,029
has been set up.

181
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,339
Next,

182
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,698
I'll hire a professional firm

183
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,298
to complete the auditing

184
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,829
and capital verification.

185
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,669
However, during this time,

186
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,019
I may need

187
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,590
a large amount of capital.

188
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,339
I'm wondering

189
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,429
if I could mortgage
some of my properties.

190
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,029
Dear,

191
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,390
those are your properties.

192
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,069
You have the right to use them.

193
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,309
You don't need to discuss it

194
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,150
with me.

195
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,390
You're so wonderful, dear.

196
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,859
To make this plan

197
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,538
convincing enough

198
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,709
to deceive this mother and son,

199
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:57,818
another key person

200
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,270
must join in.

201
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:02,909
Who?

202
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,429
So,

203
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,949
what brings you here?

204
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,549
Ever since

205
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,470
you talked to me last time,

206
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,669
I've thought about it seriously.

207
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:40,458
I didn't know

208
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,150
about your feelings for Gu Yancheng.

209
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,339
I only cared about my own happiness

210
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,069
and neglected your feelings.

211
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,309
Yan Fei,

212
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,990
I've thought it through.

213
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,219
I don't want a jerk

214
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,590
to ruin our friendship
that has lasted for years.

215
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,538
If Gu Yancheng truly loves you,

216
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:56,339
I'm willing to step out

217
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,870
and let you be together.

218
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,230
I just

219
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,350
want to ask you.

220
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,630
Will you come back

221
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,829
and continue as the director
of the Design Department?

222
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,590
Do you still remember our old days?

223
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,698
Here's what you asked for.

224
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:18,189
Vanilla latte.

225
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,390
Let me try yours.

226
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,230
They're the same.

227
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,990
Just thinking about how we're going
to part ways after graduation

228
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,590
makes me sad.

229
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,818
Don't overthink.

230
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:37,578
We aren't like

231
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,019
those friends

232
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,139
who separate after graduation.

233
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,298
We will be good friends

234
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,949
forever.

235
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,379
I want

236
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,949
to work in design after graduation.

237
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,178
I want to be the best jewelry designer.

238
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,110
That's good.

239
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,339
If so, I'll open a company

240
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,029
and make you the chief designer.

241
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,990
Keep your promise.

242
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,110
Here.

243
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,019
Cheers.

244
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,829
Cheers.

245
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,390
What do you mean?

246
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,949
Cheers.

247
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,139
Let's welcome the return

248
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,178
of the director
of the Design Department,

249
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,470
Yan Fei.

250
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,458
Aside from that,

251
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:44,298
I have an important announcement

252
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,990
to make.

253
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,019
Due to personal reasons,

254
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,538
I'll be

255
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,139
stepping back

256
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,429
from my responsibilities

257
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,990
and preparing for the handover
of the CEO position.

258
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,219
The best choice

259
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,739
for this position

260
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,899
is my husband,

261
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,110
Gu Yancheng.

262
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,259
How could it be Gu Yancheng?

263
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,938
Yeah, why?

264
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,658
There's no objection on this matter.

265
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,429
I'm the largest shareholder
in the company.

266
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,630
I care more
about the company's interests

267
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,270
than anyone else here.

268
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,219
The CEO handover

269
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,949
will be next month.

270
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,630
To avoid her

271
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,990
finding out
about the mortgage on the properties,

272
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,058
we need to redeem the properties

273
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,949
with the money we cashed out.

274
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,178
We should play the long game

275
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,350
for a huge gain.

276
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,418
Have you verified

277
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,379
the news

278
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,350
of Wen Jewelry's listing?

279
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,938
I've confirmed it with Yan Fei.

280
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,899
Wen Ruoyun announced this

281
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,429
at the shareholders' meeting.

282
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,549
It seems

283
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:54,019
the news of Wen Jewelry's going public

284
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,630
is true.

285
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:57,739
We just have to wait

286
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,818
to embrace

287
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,829
great fortune.

288
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,538
Ms. Wen,

289
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,379
Xiaoman handed in her notice yesterday.

290
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,418
It's said

291
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,859
that she went missing this morning.

292
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,990
Missing?

293
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,619
I realized

294
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,499
her condition hadn't been good

295
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,870
for some time.

296
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,698
Her family said

297
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:17,219
she met a guy

298
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,578
and got scammed out of her money.

299
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,309
Could she have tried to commit suicide?

300
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,789
Don't talk nonsense.

301
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,219
Apply for a fund from finance

302
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,778
and visit Xiaoman's family

303
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,470
in the name of the company.

304
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,470
All right.

305
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,390
(It's a love scam again.)

306
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,099
(I must give you scum)

307
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,470
(a hard time.)

308
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,938
Five million.

309
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,029
Interest.

310
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:50,990
Li,

311
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,019
that's

312
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,590
a big ask.

313
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,630
Three million.

314
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,350
No more haggling.

315
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,510
Five million.

316
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,709
In that case, I'm leaving.

317
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:11,259
Yan Cheng,

318
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,619
get the property deeds ready for me.

319
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,309
I'm coming home to fetch them.

320
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,069
All right.

321
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,818
I'll leave my ID card here.

322
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,418
Let's go with five million.

323
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:27,698
You'll receive the money in a day.

324
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:28,789
Give me the property deeds.

325
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,298
Mr. Gu,

326
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,949
I need to confirm with you once again.

327
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,019
The prepayment

328
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,189
requires a one percent penalty.

329
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,698
Deduct the money from the account.

330
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,150
Hurry and give me the property deeds.

331
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,429
Take them.

332
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,189
Stop contacting me again.

333
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,619
I need

334
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,709
to head home.
