If the child dies.

5
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,480
If the child dies.

6
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,360
Yan Fei,

7
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:04,919
what are you trying to do?

8
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,319
Ruoyun.

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,279
Calm down.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,440
If the child dies...

11
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:10,741
Calm down.

12
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:14,340
I can be with Gu Yancheng.

13
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:15,780
Calm down.

14
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,101
Calm down.

15
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,500
Calm down.

16
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,119
The child is dead.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,119
Yan Fei.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,839
Yan Fei.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,559
Let go.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,741
Yan Fei.

21
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,741
Let go.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,821
Calm down.

23
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,060
Yan Fei.

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,919
What should we do now?

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,039
She can't calm down.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,060
The child is dead.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,060
The child is dead.

28
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,319
The child...

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,021
What did you give her?

30
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,620
It's a sedative that
relieves hallucinations.

31
00:01:58,221 --> 00:01:59,500
She's calmed down.

32
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,700
Ruoyun?

33
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,261
Why am I here?

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,740
Gu Yancheng

35
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,719
gave you a drug
that causes hallucinations,

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,501
hinting you to kill me.

37
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:31,101
This is impossible.

38
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,980
You're lying.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,200
Impossible.

40
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,381
Yan Fei,

41
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,101
wake up.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
You were trying
to attack her and her child

43
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,360
with a bat.

44
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,999
If you really hurt them,

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,580
you'll be imprisoned.

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,941
The child?

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,661
The child.

48
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,140
You'll understand after hearing this.

49
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,480
I've already

50
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:55,520
made it clear to her

51
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:58,061
that we're impossible,

52
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,621
but she still pesters me.

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
she's willing to take out
all her money

54
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,101
and leave with me.

55
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:06,839
Over the years,

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,119
she's been embezzling

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,119
the company's funds

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,580
by secretly taking kickbacks.

59
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,980
I thought it was you.

60
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,381
Gu Yancheng wouldn't do that to me.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,261
This is impossible.

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,661
Never.

63
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,119
I'm going to ask him.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,679
He wouldn't do that to me!

65
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,101
You can go now,

66
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,559
but you'll never get a chance

67
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,341
to see his true color.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,300
What true color?

69
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,200
What true color?

70
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,300
You said Gu Yancheng loved you,
didn't you?

71
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:40,501
Do you have the guts
to put on a show with us

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,541
to prove how deep his love for you is?

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,580
Are you down?

74
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,040
It's fine.

75
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,760
You can come again to try it

76
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:58,980
when the latest products arrive.

77
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,360
Mr. Gu,

78
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,020
here's your supper.

00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,159

Gu Yancheng,

122
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,061
no.

123
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,301

I don't care what your name is.

127

You have no way out.

128
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,340
Wen Xin used the surveillance camera
you installed

129
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:04,981
to record the show you staged.

130
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,061
You'd better turn yourself in

131
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:09,120
and confess the organization
behind you

132
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,861
to plead for clemency.

133
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,261
You still don't repent.

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,700
Repent?

135
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,421
What did I do wrong?

136
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,159
What exactly did I do wrong?

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,741
The ones who did wrong are this world,

138
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:31,039
the friend who lured me
to the casino abroad,

139
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,200
the casino owner

140
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,381
who forced me to take out
high-interest loans,

141
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,960
the scam gang

142
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,580
that drove my mom into dementia,

143
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,000
and women like you

144
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,320
who can't live without love.

145
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,381
You are shameless.

146
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,479
You're blaming everyone else.

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,479
Do I deserve to be deceived

148
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,580
just because I'm stupid?

149
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,821
I'm telling you,

150
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:01,839
in this world,

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,279
countless people

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,640
trample on family, partners, or friends

153
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,359
to climb higher for money.

154
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,220
They're no different from me.

155
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,039
You were born with everything,

156
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,061
but I had nothing.

157
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,941
I once imagined

158
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:17,919
I could work harder

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,399
to change my life,

160
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,501
but in the end,

161
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,039
I'm still controlled

162
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,140
and exploited.

163
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Scum!

164
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:25,580
Jiayi.

165
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:33,140
Hothouse flowers like you all

166
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,540
know nothing about life's hardships.

167
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:37,239
And you,

168
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,340
Wen Ruoyun,

169
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,700
your family makes a fortune

170
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,181
selling diamonds.

171
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,719
You have no idea

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,599
how hard those workers toil

173
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,220
to mine diamonds

174
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,239
with their blood

175
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,399
while you sit

176
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,239
in a luxurious house

177
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,359
to imagine hardships.

178
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,821
You women are miserable

179
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,399
merely because of love.

180
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,421
That's simply hilarious.

181
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,460
Mock me?

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,181
Gu Yancheng,

183
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:09,760
it's a shame

184
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,981
you're not a public speaker.

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,279
You said your friend was wrong
for luring you abroad.

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,700
But let me ask you,

187
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,520
if you weren't addicted to gambling,

188
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,501
would you even have been deceived?

189
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,780
You say this world is unfair.

190
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,320
Look at yourself.

191
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,039
How do you deceive people?

192
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,821
With your good-looking face.

193
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,719
You conned women who sincerely love you

194
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,560
into a pig-butchering scam.

195
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,461
Did I have a choice?

196
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,920
Did I even have a choice?

197
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,280
Did this world give me a chance?

198
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,140
You had a chance.

199
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,461
Why do you want me to invest
another two hundred thousand?

200
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,839
Listen to me.

201
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,221
The investment market
is very promising now.

202
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,261
I know you've worked very hard
for money,

203
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:54,239
that's why I suggested

204
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,140
you invest in crypto with me.

205
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,461
But...

206
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,621
But I don't have that much.

207
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,560
The eight hundred thousand I gave you

208
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,501
is all my savings.

209
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,981
Try to get another
two hundred thousand.

210
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:06,999
If you can't find any money,

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,221
you can take out an online loan.

212
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,999
You had countless choices.

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,519
You could've stopped

214
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,180
after taking all my sister's savings,

215
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,461
but to hit your target,

216
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,261
you had no bottom line.

217
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,861
You told my sister
to take on massive debt.

218
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:30,940
And finally,

219
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,981
you pushed her to her death.

220
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,341
Gu Yancheng,

221
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,879
you've long lost the basics

222
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,180
of being human.

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,180
You have no way out now.

224
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,341
What did you do

225
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,221
to Shang Yu?

226
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,080
Shang Yu? I don't know.

227
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,381
Tell me.

228
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,780
What did you do to Shang Yu?

229
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,420
If you care so much for him,

230
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,501
I'll take you to him.

231
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:04,820
Ruoyun.

232
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:05,639
What are you doing?

233
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,820
Let go of her.

234
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,940
You made me.

235
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,780
Ruoyun.

236
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,741
Are you all right, Ruoyun?

237
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:22,820
Shang Yu.

238
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,479
Don't let him escape.

239
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,461
I can't let him get away this time!

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,101
Be careful.

241
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,461
He won't get away.

242
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,060
Mom.

243
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,981
Mom.

244
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:09,440
Caregiver!

245
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,701
Where is my mom?

246
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,300
Mom.

247
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:15,639
Mom.

248
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,581
Mom.

249
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:39,101
Don't hurt my mom.

250
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:41,341
I'll come to you right now.

251
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:08,981
Where did you hide my mom?

252
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
I didn't know

253
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:14,101
you were such a good son.

254
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,920
Bring her here.

255
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,300
Let him see her.

256
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:19,900
Mom.

257
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,981
Mom.

258
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,101
Mom.

259
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:24,999
Wen.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,680
Mom.

261
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:27,101
Wen.

262
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,839
Ms. Yi,

263
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,101
please let my mom go.

264
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,300
Wen.

265
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,999
Stop pretending

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,660
like you care about her.

267
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,900
She had become like this

268
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,900
because of you.

269
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:49,341
Useless fool.

270
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,680
I shouldn't have

271
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:53,440
let you handle this scam
in the first place.

272
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,119
I didn't know Wen Ruoyun
could be so cautious.

273
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,300
It's He's fault.

274
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,501
He didn't completely get rid
of Lin Jiayi,

275
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,341
hence today's mess.

276
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,180
Ms. Yi,

277
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:03,940
please release me and my mom.

278
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,660
Let's talk this out.

279
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,040
It's no use

280
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,519
blaming anyone now.

281
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,221
Since the scam has failed,

282
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:18,701
I need to give people over there
an explanation.

283
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,900
What a shame to waste
that pretty face of yours.

284
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,540
How do you think

285
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,701
I should deal with you?

286
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,701
Ms. Yi,

287
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:32,820
I've risked my life for you
for so long,

288
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,479
you shouldn't ignore my credit.

289
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,820
I've earned you so much money.

290
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,999
Please let my mom go,

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
all right?

292
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:39,999
I beg of you.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,221
Please.

294
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:43,981
You beg of me?

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,420
If I let you go,

296
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,741
who's going to let me off?

297
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,741
Don't kill my son.

298
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,599
Don't kill my son.

299
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,420
Mom.

300
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,381
Mom.

301
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,359
Don't kill my son.

302
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,420
I'm begging you.

303
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,639
Ms. Yi,

304
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,599
I have another fifty million.

305
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll give that

306
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:01,359
to you.

307
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,261
Okay?

308
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,999
As long as you release me and my mom,

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
I'll disappear without a trace.

310
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,341
I won't breathe a word of this.

311
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,861
Fifty million

312
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,900
is only enough to buy her life.

313
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,101
As for you,

314
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,501
you know too much.

315
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,701
You must die.

316
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,239
Wen.

317
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,820
Don't be afraid.

318
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,140
Wen.

319
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:01,261
Mom!

320
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,701
Mom.

Mom.

322
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,900
Mom.

323
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,900
