=The Fevengers=

2
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,340
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,790
You're fired.

4
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,658
Pack your things

5
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,390
and leave this place

6
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,509
immediately.

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,350
Now.

8
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:55,938
I'll be a good person for once.

9
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,549
Here's a reminder.

10
00:00:58,699 --> 00:00:59,819
Do you really think

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,869
your husband is only cheating on you?

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,829
What do you mean?

13
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,029
What does she mean?

14
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,710
Where are you going, pretty?

15
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,109
Need a ride?

16
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,579
Don't get too carried away.

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,869
This won't be our last meeting.

18
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,669
I'll be back.

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,910
Sure.

20
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,430
I'll be waiting for you,

21
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,749
little maid.

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,710
What has gotten in you lately?

23
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:08,710
If you still can't hit your target,

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,469
go to hell.

25
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,270
There's no need

26
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,589
to keep worthless people.

27
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,150
I'll hand over the amount
for this month.

28
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,510
It's you.

29
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,150
Your cover is blown.

30
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,859
Gu Yancheng is such a pain.

31
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,979
I couldn't find anything useful

32
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,869
in his house.

33
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,899
Now, the problem is

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,259
Wen Ruoyun still doesn't believe us.

35
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,510
We need to figure out what to do next.

36
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,469
I've found something.

37
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,338
We stopped Gu Yancheng

38
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:09,419
from transferring

39
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,869
all of Wen Ruoyun's money,

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,179
so he's now

41
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,550
selling off jewelry to cash out.

42
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,230
If Wen Ruoyun still won't wake up,

43
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,110
what should we do?

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,019
Women are hopeless romantic

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,270
once they fall in love.

46
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,710
We'll give her one more chance.

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,430
If she still won't wake up,

48
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,749
she'll be on her own.

49
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,629
The seed of doubt has been sown,

50
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,830
let's turn up the heat.

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,029
Who's that?

52
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,270
A crank call.

53
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,909
Later on,

54
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,909
I'll focus on this man.

55
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:52,189
Are you trying to brush me off,

56
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:53,618
or you've fallen for her

57
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:54,830
and can't bring yourself to hurt her?

58
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,139
The target I gave you

59
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,469
is more than this.

60
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,658
Ms. Yi,

61
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,029
please give me some more time.

62
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,230
Okay.

63
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:05,629
Three days.

64
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,778
Yes,

65
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,738
dear.

66
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:20,989
I need to go on

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,070
a business trip now.

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,029
How many days will it be, dear?

69
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:25,909
Three days.

70
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,909
Dear,

71
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,750
I've warmed the tonic for you.

72
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,070
Have it before you sleep.

73
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:41,830
Come.

74
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,390
I have something to tell you.

75
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,830
I fired Su Xun.

76
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,510
You're not asking anything?

77
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,109
You're the lady of this house.

78
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,310
You decide.

79
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,750
Besides,

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,750
it's good to have her gone.

81
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,549
We can live our lives

82
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,070
without interruption.

83
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,150
Here.

84
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,909
You're right.

85
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,070
What's wrong?

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,669
Dear,

87
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:44,669
no.

88
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,390
You're pregnant.

89
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:48,939
Have you lost

90
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,630
your interest in me?

91
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:52,218
I'll become fat and ugly

92
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,538
later on.

93
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,909
Are you going to cheat on...

94
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:56,789
Dear,

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,750
I already promised Mom

96
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,549
that I'd never do anything
to upset you again.

97
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:03,070
Besides,

98
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,750
no matter how you change,

99
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,429
you're the one I love most.

100
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,310
You won't lie to me again?

101
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:10,669
Well,

102
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,950
I think you're having pregnancy anxiety.

103
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,298
So

104
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,349
let's finish it

105
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,229
and get rest.

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,310
Here.

107
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,510
Eat it.

108
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,190
Eat more.

109
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,429
Gu Yancheng.

110
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,310
Why didn't you pick up my call,
Gu Yancheng?

111
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,619
I'm miserable now,

112
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,270
you know?

113
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,669
Talk to me when you're sober.

114
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,070
I don't care.

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,499
If you don't show up now,

116
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,950
I'm leaving with someone else.

117
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:02,338
Fine.

118
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,349
Wait there.

119
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,710
Yancheng.

120
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,219
Hello?

121
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,990
You finally decided to pick up.

122
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,909
Who are you?

123
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,938
Are you satisfied

124
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,390
with my recent reminder?

125
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,949
You're the person who sent the photo.

126
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,630
Not just the photo,

127
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,339
but also the shirt your husband
threw away.

128
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,189
I picked it back for you.

129
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,309
What do you want?

130
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,470
Money?

131
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,590
Wen Ruoyun,

132
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,750
how sad that all you have left
to offer is money.

133
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,029
My purpose is simple.

134
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,909
I want to help you.

135
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,429
Help me?

136
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,949
I'll send you a location.

137
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,379
Whether you come or not

138
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,150
is up to you.

139
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,510
Why did you drink so much?

140
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,578
Gu Yancheng,

141
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,230
I know you won't leave me alone.

142
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:53,538
Let's go back.

143
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,230
I want to drink more.

144
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,429
You stole my friend's man, did you?

145
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,150
Your friend's man?

146
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,470
Did you see him?

147
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,029
This is my man.

148
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,309
Is your friend's man as hot as he is?

149
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,270
You got the wrong person.

150
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,499
You're indeed desperate

151
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,739
for men

152
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,750
I can't believe
you're dating this old guy.

153
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,510
Little girl,

154
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,949
did you just call him old?

155
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,499
Are you insane?

156
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,909
Yes, I did.

157
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,470
Come here.

158
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,110
This is your girlfriend?

159
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,979
How dare you touch my woman!

160
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,350
Are you out of your mind?

161
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,510
Who are you?

162
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,019
Shut up.

163
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,470
You're nuts.

164
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,990
You stole someone else's boyfriend.

165
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,669
Thief!

166
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,150
Are you all right?

167
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,590
(Yan Fei.)

168
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,069
(Yancheng.)

169
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,099
Dear,

170
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,178
thank you for the gift.

171
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,189
I like it very much.

172
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,510
You're welcome.

173
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,578
I should thank you

174
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:25,630
for last time.

175
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,069
Man,

176
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,630
you look happy today.

177
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,069
Lawyer Shang.

178
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:44,619
A new handbag?

179
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,510
Who gave it to you?

180
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,789
My boyfriend.

181
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,019
Haven't you heard about it,
Lawyer Shang?

182
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,669
A handbag can lift
a woman's worries and more.

183
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,270
You're enjoying it, Man.

184
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,029
All right.

185
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,829
It's almost time. You can get off work.

186
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,630
Where did you go?

187
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,029
I didn't see you when I woke up.

188
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,709
I went to the gallery.

189
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,230
I didn't have time to tell you.

190
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,150
Is everything settled?

191
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:32,870
(Gu Yancheng,)

192
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,150
(why are you still lying to me?)

193
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,739
(You went to meet Yan Fei.)

194
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,309
(You two...)

195
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,750
(Why are you two)

196
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,029
(doing this to me?)

197
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,990
Ruoyun,

198
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,470
I barely slept these three days.

199
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,669
Aside from the business
in the gallery,

200
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,750
I was working on a draft.

201
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,669
It's called "Two of a Kind".

202
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,429
Just like us.

203
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:21,549
Look at this.

204
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,110
Forgive me for my one-sided feelings.

205
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:32,789
I'm really exhausted.

206
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,990
(Is this)

207
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,470
(a lie, too?)

208
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,549
Boss,

209
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,339
you're not working today

210
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,029
and sitting here to enjoy the sun.

211
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,538
I'm down,

212
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,110
so I came here to get some fresh air.

213
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,429
Yesterday, my mom said

214
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,099
you asked for Su Xun's photo.

215
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,829
Is there any problem?

216
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:10,870
Something personal.

217
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,219
I came across a quote

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,309
the other day.

219
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,418
It says,

220
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,750
"Even if you enter marriage,

221
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,538
it doesn't guarantee happiness.

222
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,538
Because no one in this world

223
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:21,458
is perfect,

224
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,990
so there's no perfect marriage."

225
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,698
Of course,

226
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:24,870
except for me, Shang Yu.

227
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,669
If that's the case,

228
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,150
even if I meet a perfect partner,

229
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,549
it doesn't mean I'd be happy?

230
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:37,829
True, though.

231
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,739
When love is intense,

232
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,949
one can't wait to give their whole heart
to their loved one,

233
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,309
but when they're betrayed or deceived,

234
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,510
they want to kill them so badly.

235
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,979
But when they really die,

236
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,058
I would wonder

237
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,150
how I would be when left alone.

238
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,029
I think

239
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,429
this is the true side of marriage life,

240
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,270
resenting your partner,

241
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,709
yet feeling unable to leave them.

242
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,309
I'm not sure if that's the true side
of marriage life,

243
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,110
but it's definitely yours.
