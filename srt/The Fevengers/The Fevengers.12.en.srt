=Episode 12=

3
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:43,790
Ruoyun,

4
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,790
how about we go to Thailand

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,949
for our honeymoon?

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,990
Sure.

7
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:49,139
Or maybe Bali?

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,018
Where is Wen Ruoyun?

9
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:50,539
Over there.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,110
Bali?

11
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,869
If not, we can go to Miami.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's go to Thailand.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,499
Sure.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,390
Ruoyun.

15
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,710
Shang Yu, you're here.

16
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:02,269
Who is he?

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,909
Let me introduce you.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,338
This is my childhood friend,

19
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,430
Shang Yu.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,589
This is Gu Yancheng.

21
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:10,990
We are

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,749
getting married.

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,190
Hi.

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,669
Hi.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,939
By the way,

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,459
you must come to my wedding.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,229
I really want your blessing.

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,509
Sure,

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,630
I'll be there.

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,509
Well,

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,029
congratulations.

32
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:35,138
All right.

33
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,350
You guys talk.

34
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:37,299
I have something to attend to.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,070
Bye.

36
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,618
Bye-bye.

37
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,430
Bye-bye.

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,699
(I promised)

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,069
(I would stay by your side.)

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,218
(Ruoyun,)

41
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,670
(you must be safe.)

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,218
Why did you come here?

43
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,869
You didn't pick up my calls.

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,830
I was worried sick.

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,869
I wasn't feeling well,

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,629
so I came here for some air.

47
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,189
Dear,

48
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,670
I know a lot has happened recently,

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,110
and you've had a tough time.

50
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,390
I've been reflecting on myself,

51
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,579
thinking about

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,309
what to do for your sake.

53
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:41,909
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,950
I've kept something from you.

55
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,990
Are you finally going
to tell me the truth?

56
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,098
What do you want to know?

57
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,390
I'll tell you everything.

58
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,338
Start with Lin Jiayi

59
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,110
using Su Xun's identity.

60
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,990
We used to be together,

61
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,498
but then I realized

62
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,390
she was a madwoman.

63
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,029
She was too obsessed

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,069
with stock trading.

65
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,938
She not only spent

66
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:08,658
all her savings

67
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:09,749
and lost her beauty salon

68
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,469
but also borrowed money from me.

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,349
She was so hopeless

70
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,830
that I wanted to break up with her.

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,459
However,

72
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,110
she threatened me with her own life.

73
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,069
Later,

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,058
she had a car accident

75
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,459
on her way to meet me,

76
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,390
and her face was ruined.

77
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,150
I felt guilty.

78
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:26,749
When I went to see her,

79
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,390
I found she had disappeared.

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,869
And then

81
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,670
she became the Lin Jiayi you know now.

82
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,390
This is totally different

83
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,710
from what she told me.

84
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,419
I don't know what she told you,

85
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,259
but I know

86
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,538
she was deep in debt
from her plastic surgery

87
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,710
and has been on the run.

88
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:44,538
She came back now

89
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,950
to ask me for more money.

90
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,029
Do you know that?

91
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,349
Dear,

92
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,218
I didn't tell you

93
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,029
because I didn't want you to worry.

94
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,110
If you don't believe me, listen to this.

95
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:01,469
Do you think I'd be satisfied
with merely 30 million?

96
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,150
What I want

97
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:05,309
is everything you have.

98
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,510
Dear,

99
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,789
you're pregnant now.

100
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,789
Let's go home first, all right?

101
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,310
But Yan Fei said

102
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,139
our meeting at the exhibition hall

103
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,059
was actually your plot.

104
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,589
Is this a lie, too?

105
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,909
She was talking nonsense.

106
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,738
Yes, I met her first,

107
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,950
but I never dated her.

108
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,510
She's the one who bugged me.

109
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,699
When I met you,

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,139
I realized

111
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,669
you're the one I love.

112
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:45,789
Dear,

113
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,338
can't love...

114
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,310
You cheated on me!

115
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,989
You slept with her!

116
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,429
I didn't.

117
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,098
How could I betray you

118
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,978
when I knew

119
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,270
you and Yan Fei were friends?

120
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:03,190
Dear,

121
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,259
what you've seen

122
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,939
or heard

123
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,710
isn't necessarily true.

124
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,429
Gu Yancheng,

125
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,499
you're trying to deny it.

126
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,909
I'm not.

127
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,029
Everything that has happened to us

128
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,390
is because they're jealous

129
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,538
of us being together.

130
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,750
They want to destroy our happiness.

131
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,870
Think about this.

132
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,098
Didn't everything go into a mess

133
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,469
until Lin Jiayi appeared?

134
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,658
I don't want him back.

135
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,029
I want to destroy him!

136
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,098
I'm really confused

137
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:38,750
about who is telling the truth.

138
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,150
Leave me alone.

139
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,589
I need time to think about it.

140
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,710
Time will prove everything.

141
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,178
Dear.

142
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,029
Dear,

143
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,830
you're awake.

144
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,538
Dear.

145
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,059
Dear.

146
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,418
I...

147
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:44,738
It's all right.

148
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,789
I saw a pig head chasing me.

149
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,379
There's no pig head.

150
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,029
No one is chasing you.

151
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,750
That's an illusion.

152
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,710
Dear,

153
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:56,579
that doesn't exist.

154
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,229
No one is chasing you.

155
00:06:58,539 --> 00:06:59,699
You probably

156
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,819
caught a cold

157
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,310
from the beach breeze yesterday.

158
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,029
Luckily, your fever has gone down.

159
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,710
Well,

160
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,270
you really scared me.

161
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,338
When I finished showering and came out,

162
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:13,298
I saw you lying beside the wardrobe.

163
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,549
I couldn't wake you up.

164
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,589
It's all right now.

165
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,669
Dear,

166
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,589
this is Dr. Zhou
from the psychiatric department.

167
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,310
She'll ask you a few questions.

168
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,819
Ms. Wen,

169
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,950
don't be nervous.

170
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,989
This is a pregnancy checkup.

171
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,349
Shall we start?

172
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,349
Ms. Wen,

173
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,109
could you tell me

174
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:44,538
if you have felt dizzy or fainted

175
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,710
recently?

176
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,310
All right.

177
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,469
Do you often have nightmares

178
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,549
and get emotional?

179
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,349
Have you had any negative thoughts

180
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,950
or

181
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,619
find it hard

182
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,109
to trust people around you?

183
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,950
I see.

184
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,549
One last question.

185
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,978
Do you

186
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,229
often feel deceived

187
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,858
or even feel

188
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,469
that someone is after you?

189
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,429
Okay.

190
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,150
Ms. Yi,

191
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,950
here's the medical report.

192
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,210
(Diagnostic Report - Diagnosis or Impression:
Moderate Antenatal Anxiety)

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,630
With this mental health evaluation,

194
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:44,619
we are halfway there

195
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,309
with our plan.

196
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,829
Here are two flight tickets

197
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,390
to Phuket Island, Thailand.

198
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,789
Once you arrive,

199
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,309
find a way to make her ill.

200
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,499
Any accidents that happen in that place

201
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,230
won't raise any suspicion.

202
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,069
Afterward,

203
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,829
come back here,

204
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,189
tie up loose ends,

205
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:09,870
and collect the money.

206
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,499
Central.

207
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,510
We found a woman.

208
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:32,499
Central.

209
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,510
We found a woman.

210
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,219
Dear!

211
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,899
Dear!

212
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,150
Are you all right, dear?

213
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,150
Dear.

214
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,538
Dear, don't scare me.

215
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,630
Dear!

216
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,470
Don't scare me.

217
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:51,829
Mr. Gu,

218
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,658
Ms. Gao is here.

219
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,110
Should I let her in?

220
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,789
Bring her in.

221
00:09:58,779 --> 00:09:59,630
By the way,

222
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,339
if there's nothing else,

223
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,339
you can get off work earlier.

224
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,538
Tomorrow, Ruoyun and I

225
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,578
are going on a trip abroad.

226
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:05,949
I'm giving you the week off.

227
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:07,870
All right.

228
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,510
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

229
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,270
You're here, Deputy Director Gao.

230
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,189
Have a seat.

231
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,899
How's the thing

232
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,270
I asked of you?

233
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,709
It's almost done.

234
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:36,789
All that's left is
your signature and fingerprint.

235
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,019
With all the properties combined,

236
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,658
how much can I get in loans?

237
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:43,298
I can only get you

238
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,150
70 percent,

239
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,230
but you'll need to find your own way

240
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,110
to get the rest.

241
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:53,669
Thank you so much.

242
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,058
They are

243
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,949
utterly insane.

244
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,309
Meng Yu,

245
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,870
even if I have to take you down with me,

246
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,510
I won't let you have your way.

247
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:40,549
Have a seat.

248
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,870
Will my anxiety

249
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,590
affect the fetus?

250
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,470
Dear,

251
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,949
let's get enough rest,

252
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,549
and everything will be all right.

253
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,750
Oh, right, dear,

254
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:00,979
you mentioned

255
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,990
I didn't confide in you.

256
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:05,590
I'd like to take this opportunity

257
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,899
to bring you to my hometown

258
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,739
for a little break.

259
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,029
I've already bought the flight tickets.

260
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,870
We'll set off tomorrow.

261
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,750
Tomorrow?

262
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,350
But I have

263
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,350
so much work to do.

264
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,429
Don't worry about that.

265
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,909
Let's rest.

266
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,619
As for the company,

267
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,499
we have Xiaoman

268
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,309
and Shang Yu.

269
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,429
Dear,

270
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,429
I want to use this time

271
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,150
to start afresh.

272
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,189
Please give me one more chance, okay?

273
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,429
I will go for a little break,

274
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,270
but that doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

275
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,350
You will.

276
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,270
Dear,

277
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,630
wait for me here.

278
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,990
I'll go get the car.

279
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,270
Yancheng!

280
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,259
Wen Ruoyun.

281
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,979
Are you insane?

282
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,949
Did you try to get yourself killed?

283
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,750
Are you all right?

284
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,990
Great that you're fine.

285
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:45,870
Ruoyun.

286
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,150
I don't deserve you

287
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,350
risking your life.

288
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,298
Dear,

289
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,778
I'm not feeling well.

290
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,150
I don't want to go.

291
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,859
All right.

292
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,019
We're not going anywhere.

293
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,029
Let's go home,

294
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,069
all right?

295
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,778
How could you be so impulsive?

296
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:09,859
Do you realize the consequences

297
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,270
of what you did?

298
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:13,870
If Gu Yancheng gets away this time,

299
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,139
he'll clear all the evidence

300
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,298
like last time,

301
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,219
and we'll lose our chance
to get revenge.

302
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,979
Not to mention

303
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,390
what they will do to Wen Ruoyun...

304
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,538
I thought she'd help us
expose Gu Yancheng

305
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,390
after learning the truth.

306
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,909
Unexpectedly, she's been
completely brainwashed.

307
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,789
Fortunately, we've stalled them.

308
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,870
Let's go back
and figure out our next steps.

309
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,189
Wen,

310
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,069
you've got some gall.

311
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,870
How dare you change the plan!

312
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:51,499
She said she wasn't feeling well

313
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,499
and didn't want to go.

314
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,470
Do you expect me to force her
and make myself look suspicious?

315
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,150
The company spent a lot of money
to groom you,

316
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,750
not for you to sympathize with her.

317
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,949
Ms. Yi,

318
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,818
it's not necessary to kill her.

319
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:08,219
Once her condition acts up

320
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,019
and she becomes unconscious,

321
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,029
I'll still get her money.

322
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,069
