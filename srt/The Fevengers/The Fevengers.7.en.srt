(No.)

(Gu Yancheng,)

6
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,350
(this is a surprise for you.)

7
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:23,869
Dear.

8
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:27,270
Dear.

9
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:32,550
Su Xun?

10
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,550
Meng Yu.

11
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,230
Meng Yu.

12
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,270
Not me.

13
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,469
Not me.

14
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,618
Not me.

15
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:12,869
I didn't want to kill her.

16
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,670
Not me.

17
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,550
Who did you kill?

18
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,029
Why did you do this to me?

19
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,189
Why did you do this to me?

20
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,710
Tell me.

21
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,550
Not me.

22
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,979
It was them.

23
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,390
They forced me.

24
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,110
Who are they?

25
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:55,899
Where are they?

26
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,618
What are their names?

27
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,179
I don't know.

28
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,349
Tell me!

29
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:59,270
They killed...

30
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,029
Who are you, really?

31
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,070
Mr. Gu,

32
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,710
I'm Su Xun.

33
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,750
Su Xun?

34
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,630
Are you just Su Xun?

35
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,270
You know me too well.

36
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,469
Let go of me.

37
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:40,870
Let go.

38
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,109
Su Xun.

39
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,510
You are...

40
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,750
Meng Yu,

41
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,830
you broke up with me on purpose.

42
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,390
All of this

43
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,989
is part of your plan.

44
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:24,750
You are...

45
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,270
You are Lin Jiayi.

46
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,549
You are Lin Jiayi.

47
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:34,950
Aren't you already dead?

48
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,549
I'd like to see

49
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,658
how Ms. Wen thinks about you

50
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,989
when she sees us

51
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,750
hugging.

52
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,469
Mr. Gu.

53
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:53,429
Mr. Gu!

54
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:54,830
Yancheng!

55
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,658
What's wrong with him?

56
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,738
What has happened?

57
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,109
I have no idea, Ms. Wen.

58
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,229
I saw Mr. Gu lying here
when I just got back.

59
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:02,978
Come.

60
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,218
Let's get him inside.

61
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:04,909
All right.

62
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,750
Come on.

63
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,029
What happened in the kitchen?

64
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:12,579
I'm sorry, Ms. Wen.

65
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,669
I forgot to turn off the tap
before I left.

66
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,139
Perhaps the water overflowed

67
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,469
and caused a short circuit.

68
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,669
I'll go check it out.

69
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,349
Go ahead.

70
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,510
You look terrible.

71
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:32,549
Your lips...

72
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,710
Dear,

73
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,750
are you still mad at me?

74
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,469
Dear,

75
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,270
even though we've been married
for a long time,

76
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,270
and I know

77
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,109
you're sensitive

78
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:48,658
to flickering lights

79
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,029
and the sound of dripping water,

80
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,338
you've never told me

81
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,150
the real reason.

82
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,070
I'm just realizing

83
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,150
that I don't really know you.

84
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,150
Perhaps our marriage had issues

85
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,909
from the start.

86
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,510
I was the one

87
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,789
who lost in the effect of hormones

88
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,549
and overlooked many details.

89
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,669
Dear,

90
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,109
when I was little,

91
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,270
every time I made a mistake,

92
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,579
my dad would

93
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,870
lock me up

94
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,669
in a

95
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,870
dark

96
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,589
and cramped room.

97
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,150
The ceiling light

98
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,950
kept flickering,

99
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,109
and there was a constant sound
of dripping water.

100
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,310
I cried and shouted,

101
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,390
but no one came to save me.

102
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,989
Dear,

103
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,909
it's not that I didn't want
to tell you this,

104
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,150
but whenever I think about it,

105
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,070
it feels like the past haunts me,

106
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:50,229
and I'm stuck in
that water dungeon forever.

107
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,150
It's all right.

108
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,178
Let's not talk about it anymore.

109
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:55,989
Dear,

110
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,750
do you know

111
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,349
that since being with you

112
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,750
and having our family,

113
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,870
those nightmares seemed to leave?

114
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,109
However,

115
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,950
they've come back to me

116
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,229
lately.

117
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,190
Dear,

118
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:17,429
it's my fault.

119
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,178
You've been ignoring me these days.

120
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,830
I'm afraid that I might lose you.

121
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,510
Please give me one more chance.

122
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,710
I won't upset you again.

123
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,789
It's all right.

124
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,390
It's all in the past.

125
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,029
Ladies,

126
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,538
men's promises are no different
from a dog's bark.

127
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,099
They cry like women

128
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,499
and beg you pitifully.

129
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,619
Don't be soft-hearted.

130
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,139
Don't believe them.

131
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,150
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,590
I forgot to turn off the volume.

133
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,189
Please continue.

134
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:57,789
I'll get you an ice pad.

135
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,909
Don't worry.

136
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,350
You're in my way.

137
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:32,590
I'll drive you out of this place.

138
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:46,750
Ruoyun,

139
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,538
the interview article with VOGUE is out.

140
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,429
Please have a look.

141
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:52,150
Leave it there.

142
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,739
Man,

143
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,189
do you have anything else?

144
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,110
Ruoyun,

145
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,938
may I

146
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,110
get an advance on a three-month salary?

147
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,069
An advance?

148
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,219
My boyfriend's company

149
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,139
is having some cash flow issues.

150
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,390
I want to help him.

151
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,390
I can give you an advance,

152
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,139
but perhaps you can ask him

153
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,058
what caused

154
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,669
his financial problem.

155
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,709
He said

156
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,778
the recent project lost some money

157
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,069
and caused a financial pinch.

158
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,139
But don't worry.

159
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,178
Once we overcome this,

160
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,470
we'll get married.

161
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:29,709
Get married?

162
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:32,549
Man,

163
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,899
there's something I'd like to share

164
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,139
based on my past experience.

165
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,750
You should consider

166
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,709
marriage carefully.

167
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,938
At least you need to know

168
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,309
who the man you're being with.

169
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,230
I'll approve the money for you,

170
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,899
but don't mistrust the wrong person.

171
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,230
Thank you, Ruoyun.

172
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,429
Man,

173
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:51,418
you see, some people

174
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,789
are trying to advise others

175
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,698
while she herself married a man

176
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,029
she just met.

177
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,630
I'm leaving.

178
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,829
Do you have so much free time?

179
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,630
You always eavesdrop.

180
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,270
Here.

181
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,870
My mother brought you some dried fruit.

182
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,429
So many.

183
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,339
Ms. Wang is so considerate.

184
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,658
I wanted to visit her

185
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,069
when I had time.

186
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,029
My mom knows you love to eat.

187
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,750
Ms. Wang,

188
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,429
Shang Yu and I were just
talking about you.

189
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,259
Gu told me

190
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,499
you're pregnant.

191
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,538
What a pleasant surprise.

192
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,418
You're going to become a mother

193
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:31,899
in the blink of an eye.

194
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,709
Did Gu Yancheng call you?

195
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,019
How's she doing?

196
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,789
Has she been performing well?

197
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:39,630
Pretty good.

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,818
She has difficulty

199
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:42,669
walking.

200
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,778
Even so,

201
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:44,778
she's honest.

202
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,870
She has done her job well, right?

203
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,870
Ms. Wang,

204
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:48,458
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,698
Did you just say

206
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:51,709
Su Xun has difficulty walking?

207
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,069
Due to this reason,

208
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,990
she has been mistreated
by many of her employers.

209
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,270
(She's not Su Xun.)

210
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,630
(Who is she?)

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,539
(Ruoyun, there's somewhere I need to be.
I made some of your favorite dishes.)

212
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,890
(Don't skip meals. Take care of yourself.)

213
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,058
It's minor.

214
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,150
It's a connection issue.

215
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,178
This light

216
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,458
is imported.

217
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,139
If anything happens,

218
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,750
you need to get professional help.

219
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,750
We didn't fix it before.

220
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,938
That's impossible.

221
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:29,739
Obviously, someone

222
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,938
fixed it.

223
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,189
The port is loose.

224
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,630
What did my mom tell you? You look pale.

225
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,339
Where are you going?

226
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,870
I can't explain it to you now.

227
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,189
Why are you in a hurry?

228
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,859
There's nothing about Gu Yancheng
in the safe.

229
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,390
He hides things very deep.

230
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,069
By the way,

231
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,630
you need to hurry.

232
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:22,110
He's already found out my real identity.

233
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,829
Why are you doing this?

234
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:38,458
I think

235
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,390
this is the correct way to put them.

236
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,669
What do you mean?

237
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,099
"A Match Made in Heaven"
is a love confession

238
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,630
Vermeer gave to his wife
when they got married.

239
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,150
But do you know,

240
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,069
soon after they married,

241
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,590
he had an affair with a bar attendant.

242
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:55,270
From then on, the couple became enemies.

243
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,630
His wife switched these two paintings

244
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:59,069
to show her stance

245
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,350
that she would never see him again.

246
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:05,270
The so-called romantic love story

247
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,538
is merely a fig leaf

248
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,619
fabricated by those famous painted

249
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,390
for their marriage.

250
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,390
You're so knowledgeable.

251
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,949
Since you know so much about art,

252
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,990
I don't get

253
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:21,029
why you're pretending
to be a butler here.

254
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,829
Isn't that a waste of talent?

255
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,309
Come clean.

256
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,019
What's your purpose in approaching us?

257
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,909
Are you really that clueless,

258
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,029
or are you just naive?

259
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,630
After all this time,

260
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,870
haven't you realized

261
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,669
that my goal

262
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,309
has always been your husband?

263
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,818
I don't give a darn

264
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,789
who you are to Gu Yancheng,

265
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,619
or what you are after,

266
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,189
but I won't give you the opportunity.

267
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,870
Are you really that confident
in your marriage,

268
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,549
or are you just reluctant to let go?

269
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,470
This is my family matter.
You're in no place to meddle.

270
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,019
Ms. Wen, you've never
slapped someone, have you?

271
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,019
Do you want me

272
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,549
to teach you?

273
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,789
I warn you, don't go too far.

274
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,899
Before I hold you accountable

275
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,590
for impersonating the butler,

276
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,110
you'd better get out of my sight.

277
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,309
I'm telling you,

278
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,789
I don't want to hear

279
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,458
any gossip about us coming from you

280
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,590
outside.

281
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,510
Otherwise, I won't let you off.

282
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,019
A woman as successful

283
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,219
and beautiful as you,

284
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,470
yet so pathetic when facing
a man who betrays you.

285
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,350
You'd rather keep a false marriage

286
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,669
than let us see your embarrassment.

287
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,909
Are you done?

288
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,309
You're fired.

289
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,219
Pack your things

290
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,990
and leave this place

291
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,870
immediately.

292
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,829
Now.

293
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:58,418
I'll be a good person for once.

294
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,990
Here's a reminder.

295
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,379
Do you really think

296
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,270
your husband is only cheating on you?

297
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,669
