3
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,298
It's not necessary to kill her.

4
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,618
Once her condition acts up

5
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,258
and becomes unconscious,

6
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,338
I'll still get her money.

7
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,229
Are you telling me what to do now?

8
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,018
Ms. Yi.

9
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:52,499
Ms. Yi.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,779
Forgive me.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,058
It's...

12
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:54,859
It's him.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,459
It's him.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,150
I'm begging...

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,629
How dare you guys not report

16
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,229
that Lin Jiayi is still alive!

17
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,899
No wonder this piggy

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,389
isn't cooperative this time.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,579
Refresh his memory

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,029
and make him remember who he is.

21
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,830
Wrap a towel around him
before you beat him.

22
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,910
Don't leave ugly scars

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,150
on our model.

24
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,070
Brat.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,739
I met Gu Yancheng first.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,418
You're the one who got between us!

27
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:47,978
Yes, I met her first,

28
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,990
but I never dated her.

29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,019
The pain creeps into you

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,869
like it did to me before.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,509
She was too obsessed

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,509
with stock trading.

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,418
She not only spent

34
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,058
all her savings

35
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,350
and lost her beauty salon

36
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,338
but also borrowed money from me.

37
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,858
I thought I could have

38
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,019
the most perfect love in this world,

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,978
But you took it away from me.

40
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:07,979
I don't want him back.

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,098
I want to destroy him!

42
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,459
Everything that has happened to us

43
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,749
is because they're jealous

44
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,938
of us being together.

45
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:14,618
They want to destroy

46
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,950
our happiness.

47
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:18,869
Baby,

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,349
you must stay strong.

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,390
I won't be defeated so easily.

50
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,538
The divorce settlement agreement

51
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,699
between you and Gu Yancheng

52
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,990
has been drafted.

53
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:46,899
Take a look at it later.

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,710
Sign it immediately
if everything's fine.

55
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,019
You disappeared for a while earlier,
you know.

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,390
It's chilly outside.

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,739
Listen,

58
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,749
Wen Ruoyun.

59
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,378
I already know everything

60
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,589
between you and Gu Yancheng.

61
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,259
Why? You want to back out?

62
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,789
No.

63
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,058
But I don't want to

64
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:08,670
divorce him yet.

65
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:11,739
I can't allow them

66
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,029
to fool me so easily.

67
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,299
Also, there's one thing

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,990
I need your help with.

69
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,938
Look into

70
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,098
Gu Yancheng's identity
as a Chinese artist from overseas.

71
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,510
Are you doubting his identity?

72
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,869
I'm not completely sure yet,

73
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:31,430
but I need to get to the bottom of it.

74
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,218
Okay.

75
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,309
Leave this to me.

76
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,069
I'm leaving, then.

77
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,390
It has been years since you've drawn.

78
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,789
Why did you suddenly draw

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,430
a pig head?

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,629
I'm drawing you.

81
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,069
That's rude.

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,459
Hurry and tell me.

83
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,139
Why

84
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,899
did you draw a pig head?

85
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,150
Craving for meat?

86
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,950
I don't know.

87
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,110
I've been having nightmares lately.

88
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,299
I keep dreaming

89
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,139
of a man with a pig head mask

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,749
chasing me.

91
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,270
Pig head?

92
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,950
Mask?

93
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,390
Man?

94
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,310
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,909
I came to check on Ruoyun.

96
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,098
It seems I need to upgrade

97
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,699
the security system

98
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,778
to prevent some uninvited guests

99
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,109
from sneaking in.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,029
Uninvited guests?

101
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,310
Are you referring to me?

102
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,098
If you take it personally,

103
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,349
that's your choice.

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,909
Mr. Gu,

105
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,778
Ruoyun and I

106
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,390
have known each other for years.

107
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,218
I've come here

108
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,070
countless times.

109
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,029
Speaking of uninvited guests,

110
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,298
I wonder

111
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,989
which one of us it is.

112
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,589
Lawyer Shang,

113
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,909
ever since I married Ruoyun,

114
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,469
you've never been nice to me.

115
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,619
I'm wondering

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,738
if you hold a grudge against me

117
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,669
because I took her away from you.

118
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,750
Can't you

119
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,630
speak nicely?

120
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,830
Gu Yancheng,

121
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm warning you,

122
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,029
you'd better be nice to Ruoyun.

123
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,989
If you try to hurt her,

124
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,429
I won't let you off easily.

125
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,218
Show a better attitude

126
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,178
as a loser.

127
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,178
Keep your dirty thoughts

128
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:36,429
to yourself.

129
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:52,190
It feels awful

130
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,989
when someone touches a raw nerve
in you, huh?

131
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,669
Lawyer Shang, listen.

132
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,190
I won't divorce my wife.

133
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,070
Please see yourself out.

134
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,549
Mr. Gu,

135
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,190
it's not up to you to decide that.

136
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,098
I forgot to tell you,

137
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,029
my new side hustle

138
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,429
is a divorce lawyer,

139
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,390
specializing in dealing with cases

140
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,819
where the wife wants a divorce,

141
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,699
but the husband doesn't.

142
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,699
If you need my service,

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,139
please come to me.

144
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,750
I'll be waiting for you.

145
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,989
Someone's following me.

146
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,630
My place isn't safe now.

147
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,259
You should move out right now.

148
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,658
Okay.

149
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,750
Got it.

150
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,658
By the way,

151
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,059
the deputy director of Guangtong Bank

152
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,978
is helping Gu Yancheng and his gang

153
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,738
with mortgage loans.

154
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,619
I tried to call Wen Ruoyun,

155
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,819
but I couldn't reach her.

156
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,059
I need you to go to her place

157
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,899
and check on her.

158
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,139
Didn't you say you wouldn't care
about her anymore?

159
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,229
You're indeed more bark than bite.

160
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,630
(It's Yancheng.)

161
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,699
Wen Xin.

162
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,499
Ruoyun,

163
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,379
Mr. Gu said

164
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,218
you haven't been feeling well lately.

165
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:04,259
Since you're at home,

166
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,499
I thought I'd come to visit you.

167
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,499
Did you

168
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,150
not go on a trip abroad?

169
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,738
No, we didn't.

170
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,029
Come on in.

171
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,190
Thank you.

172
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,310
Thanks for the gift.

173
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,270
Have a seat.

174
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,549
Have some water.

175
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,989
Thank you.

176
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,750
Ruoyun,

177
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,019
every time I see you,

178
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,938
I can't help but praise your necklace.

179
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,099
The diamond is crystal clear

180
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,499
and flawless.

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,818
Even a layperson like me

182
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:38,658
can tell

183
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,069
it's very precious.

184
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,298
As someone in the jewelry business,

185
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,619
hearing your compliments
about my necklace

186
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,510
makes me happier
than compliments about myself.

187
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,698
Ruoyun,

188
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,309
why are there scratches

189
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,270
on your diamond?

190
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:00,698
Aren't diamonds

191
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,789
supposed to be very hard

192
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,350
and not scratch easily?

193
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,350
I'm going to the bathroom.

194
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,870
Please wait here.

195
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,789
All right.

196
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,189
It's fake.

197
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,709
They are all fake.

198
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,870
Why did you lie to me?

199
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,230
Gu Yancheng,

200
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,150
why did you lie to me?

201
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,630
How's everything on your end?

202
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,938
I'm packing my things.

203
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,270
I'm leaving tonight.

204
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:44,549
Very well.

205
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,178
I can't expose myself yet.

206
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,429
You need to be careful.

207
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,309
Hello.

208
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,750
Who's there?

209
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,350
We're from Anxin Moving Service.

210
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,110
It's you.

211
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,259
Lin Jiayi,

212
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,069
I've finally found you.

213
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,458
Leave this woman to me.

214
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,709
Go and dig around the place.

215
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,590
Let go!

216
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,350
(That pig head is Yancheng.)

217
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,510
(Lin Jiayi was right.)

218
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,899
(Lin Jiayi.)

219
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,630
(Lin Jiayi)
Lin Jia...

220
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,150
It's blocked?

221
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,930
(Lin Jiayi)
(Add to Blocked List)

222
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,050
(Remove from Blocked List)

223
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,739
Why aren't you picking up?

224
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,949
Jiayi.

225
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,189
She knows a lot about us.

226
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,750
She started investigating us
much earlier than we ever imagined.

227
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,870
Clear all this out.

228
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:02,750
Okay.

229
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,658

230
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,259
but you won't this time.

231
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,778
