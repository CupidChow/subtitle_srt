00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,340
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,160
Ruoyun, you're so pretty.

4
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:48,171
You look good in anything.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,690
Gorgeous.

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,570
(Who is that woman?)

7
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:17,810
Su Xun?

8
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:20,331
Ms. Wen.

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,131
Who is she?

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,051
She's Su Xun,

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,491
the personal butler
recommended by Ms. Wang.

12
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,650
A butler?

13
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,810
Why is a butler dress so revealingly?

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,771
People might assume

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,170
that she's the lady of this house.

16
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,290
Why didn't you

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,331
hire an honest butler instead?

18
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,051
I bet she's dressing like this

19
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:48,771
to attract men.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,640
I thought dressing appropriately

21
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:52,839
for the occasion

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,730
was the basic form of respect
for the host.

23
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,611
So I guess I'm wrong about that.

24
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,331
Care to tell me

25
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,440
who you're trying to seduce

26
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,530
with this attention-seeking piece?

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,119
My body is perfect.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,691
Why shouldn't I wear it?

29
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:09,331
I'm not trying to seduce any men.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,970
Guilty conscience?

31
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:12,399
Before Ms. Wen even said anything,

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,011
you jumped in.

33
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,930
Do you think
you're the lady of this house?

34
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:16,571
You!

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,891
Yan Fei.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,291
How dare you slap me?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,810
Yan Fei.

38
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,130
Go upstairs.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,360
All right?

40
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,240
She's being a bully here.

41
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:26,839
Calm down.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,690
Go upstairs first.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,810
Go on.

44
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:29,891
Go.

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,331
Go.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,530
Su Xun,

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,611
I'm so sorry.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,211
I...

49
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,690
I'm really grateful to you
for dressing up for my birthday party.

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,839
Yan Fei

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,640
is a bit impulsive.

52
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:40,520
Please don't mind her.

53
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,930
I won't, Ms. Wen.

54
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,410
You're the woman of the hour tonight.

55
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,240
I hope I didn't spoil your mood.

56
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,491
Not at all.

57
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:48,679
Everyone,

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,810
please calm down.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Thank you so much

60
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:51,879
for attending

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,611
my and my wife's birthday.

62
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,360
I'd like

63
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,480
to have all your witnesses and blessings

64
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,891
when I give a precious present

65
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,211
to my wife.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,571
Dear.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,771
Come.

68
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,891
Let's unveil this together.

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,850
Come on.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,611
Do you remember this painting?

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,171
It was because of this painting,

72
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,999
we met, got to know each other,

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,930
and fell in love.

74
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,999
You were so disappointed

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,279
when you saw

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,051
only "The Man Who Kisses a Rose"
at the exhibition.

77
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,240
You said

78
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,331
if someone can find "The Ruby Woman" ,

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,399
the heavenly match Vermee believes in

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,090
would exist.

81
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,279
When I found out the painting

82
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,930
was going up for auction,

83
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,970
I bought it

84
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,571
as a birthday gift for you.

85
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,891
I don't want you to have any regrets.

86
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,130
Dear,

87
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,571
happy birthday.

88
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:55,760
Ruoyun, you're so blessed.

89
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,119
I also wish there were a man

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,331
who would do everything
to make my dreams come true.

91
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,491
You're indeed a match made in heaven.

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,839
Mr. Gu's gift is impressive.

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,719
I believe Ms. Wen's gift

94
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,370
will certainly surprise us more.

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,491
Dear.

96
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,011
I hereby announce

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,610
that I'll be changing
my property agreement.

98
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,451
I'll share Wen Jewerly's assets,
valued at one billion,

99
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:26,131
with Gu Yancheng.

100
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,050
- One billion?
- Dear,

101
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,371
thank you for trusting me.

102
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,011
I love you.

103
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:37,251
(Gu Yancheng,)

104
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,571
(are you really the man worth my gift?)

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,410
(Who is that woman?)

106
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,320
- You're still sober, right?
- Bye-bye.

107
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:46,760
Bye-bye.

108
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:47,479
All right. Bye-bye.

109
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,490
Ruoyan,

110
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,410
happy birthday.

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,891
Thank you.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,170
Ruoyun,

113
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,799
I'm truly sorry about just now.

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
How about

115
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,560
I send your dress

116
00:04:58,561 --> 00:04:59,970
to the laundry service?

117
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,331
It's just a dress.

118
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,451
It's all right.

119
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,451
Don't worry.

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,970
(The same perfume.)

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,839
(Are you seeing each other)

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,131
(at work?)

123
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,000
Ruoyan,

124
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,811
if there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

125
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,120
Dear,

126
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,251
I'll see them off.

127
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:40,850
(Wen Xin,)

128
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,490
(why is it you?)

129
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,159
After all this time,

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,530
we've finally got it.

131
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,919
Thanks to you
for always being around her.

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,650
Our plan went smoothly.

133
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,290
I'll find the right time

134
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,479
to transfer

135
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,050
all her money.

136
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,811
What about me?

137
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,850
When the day comes,

138
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,880
we can be together

139
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,530
without hiding.

140
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,011
What were you thinking

141
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,050
when you cheated on me?

142
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,850
You think

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,850
I have no reason to cheat on you.

144
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,410
What have I done wrong?

145
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,050
Yes.

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,011
I'm not good enough.

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,891
Maybe I've done something wrong.

148
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,760
But that doesn't mean

149
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,970
everything you do is right.

150
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,011
Just trust me.

151
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,371
How do you expect me to trust you?

152
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,331
You say one thing to my face,

153
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,331
then do otherwise behind my back.

154
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:06,320
You tell me.

155
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,451
How am I supposed to trust you?

156
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,131
If you hadn't discovered all this,

157
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,970
we wouldn't be in this mess.

158
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,239
Why couldn't you just trust me more?

159
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,650
In the end, I'm wrong?

160
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,451
Tell me.

161
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,211
How can I trust you?

162
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,571
I'll break up with her.

163
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,331
Give me some time.

164
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,050
I'll end it completely.

165
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,170
And then?

166
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,050
Tell me, what comes after that?

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,850
Then?

168
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:43,970
Then?

169
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,371
(Wen Ruoyun,)

170
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,131
(if you still love him,)

171
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,650
(don't blame him first.)

172
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,811
(Blaming is a poison)

173
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:28,090
(that kills all hope)

174
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,211
(and ruins a happy marriage.)

175
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,291
(You need to figure out
who that woman is.)

176
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,211
What are you doing?

177
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:18,280
Mr. Gu,

178
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,451
you're so early

179
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,931
today.

180
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:22,451
What's that in your hand?

181
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,691
Isn't that the perfume
Ms. Gao wore that day?

182
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:31,370
Why?

183
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,610
You like the scent

184
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,890
and use it?

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,999
No, Mr. Gu.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,090
You misunderstand me.

187
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,370
It's not what you think.

188
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,130
Then what should I think?

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,770
I...

190
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,730
I was just

191
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,691
trying the password

192
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,211
to put this perfume

193
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,970
into the room.

194
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,211
Wen Xin,

195
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,400
don't you think this reason

196
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,651
sounds absurd?

197
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,451
Ruoyun.

198
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,291
Dear,

199
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,331
what brings you here?

200
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,370
I'm here for Wen Xin.

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
I think I should give her a chance

202
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,211
to make up for her mistake,

203
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,331
right?

204
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,560
Yes, Ruoyun.

205
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:18,531
I'll transfer
the dry cleaning fee to you.

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,811
Dear,

207
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:20,879
you guys talk.

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,850
I'll get back to my work.

209
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,451
Let's talk.

210
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,291
What's this about the perfume?

211
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:44,759
Why did my husband

212
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,211
smell like your perfume?

213
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Ruoyan, this is a misunderstanding.

214
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:48,999
Yesterday,

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,890
Ms. Gao came by to look at the sofas

216
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,451
and left this behind.

217
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,239
I accidentally

218
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,490
broke it.

219
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,211
I was worried she might return for it,

220
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:59,451
so I replaced it.

221
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,451
I was

222
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,639
explaining this to Mr. Gu

223
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,811
just now.

224
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,331
Which Ms. Gao?

225
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,370
The vice director of Guangtong Bank.

226
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,931
She was wearing this perfume

227
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,171
when Mr. Wu was talking to her.

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,211
(Not her?)

229
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,090
(These are all Wen Ruoyun's
company documents.)

230
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,451
(None of these is related
to Gu Yancheng.)

231
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,970
(Seems like I need to give them a push.)

232
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,490
I think my husband

233
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,211
cheats on me.

234
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,010
Did you talk to him about it?

235
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,051
I didn't mean to be harsh,

236
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,639
but maybe you should suspect the woman
in your house

237
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,370
more than those outside.

238
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,040
No one could hire a beautiful butler.

239
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,931
If it were me,
I'd definitely be tempted.

240
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,331
People's hearts are unpredictable.

241
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,451
Su Xun won't do that.

242
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,130
She just came.

243
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,090
Nothing will happen
between Gu Yancheng and her.

244
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:18,051
See?

245
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,651
You don't believe my warning.

246
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,691
But I understand.

247
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,770
Marrying a handsome husband

248
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,370
feels insecure.

249
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,531
Stop teasing me.

250
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,770
Are you still my best friend?

251
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,850
That's all the more reason

252
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,730
I don't want to intervene
in your marriage.

253
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,651
When you reconcile,

254
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,080
you might blame me

255
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,291
for meddling.

256
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,451
What's wrong?

257
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,411
Nothing.

258
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,531
Well,

259
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,130
cheer up.

260
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:17,610
Look.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
It's my new design.

262
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,090
Is it nice?

263
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,200
Let's go shopping

264
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,571
later.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,119
It'll lift your mood.

266
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,130
All right?

267
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:32,680
All right.

268
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,651
Now, now.

269
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,130
