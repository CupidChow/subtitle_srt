=The Fevengers=

2
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,340
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,629
I don't want to do anything immoral.

4
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,909
But Ruoyun,

5
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,298
I had no choice.

6
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,859
I was trapped there.

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,698
If I didn't do what they said,

8
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,710
they would torture me.

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,549
Have you seen that clearly?

10
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,949
Those piggies were deceived
due to their own greed.

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,269
They deserve it.

12
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,018
What we have to do

13
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,390
is to teach them a costly lesson.

14
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,790
Here,

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,138
as long as we work hard,

16
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,138
we'll get great cars

17
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:08,389
and big houses

18
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,669
and realize the dream of our lives.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,029
(At that place,)

20
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,830
(they control everyone.)

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,739
(Our daily job)

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,350
(is to reach out to the target,)

23
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,949
(build a connection,)

24
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,150
(gain their trust,)

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,589
(and develop feelings)

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,910
(until they're willing
to give us anything.)

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,150
By the way,

28
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:27,978
why didn't you

29
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,338
invest in the project

30
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,539
I told you last time?

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,070
I've almost doubled my money.

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,270
Are you interested

33
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,949
in joining me this time?

34
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,589
It's simple.

35
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,270
Just follow my steps,

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,029
and you'll make money.

37
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,350
Profits are guaranteed.

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,379
(Top Achievers Ranking)

39
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,550
Thank you, everyone.

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,099
First of all, I'm very grateful

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,749
to the boss for giving me this chance

42
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,778
and to all of you here

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,350
for sharing your insights with me.

44
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,630
In the first phase,

45
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:56,698
we'll pick

46
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,459
qualified

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,778
and potential piggies

48
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,630
from the pen.

49
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,830
In the second phase,

50
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:05,190
the butcher puts on a disguise.

51
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,949
This is a crucial phase.

52
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,029
We need to feed them

53
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,869
with different treats

54
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,818
according to the potential piggies

55
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,830
we selected from the last phase

56
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,778
and classify them

57
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,189
based on their quality.

58
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,179
Finally,

59
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,058
it's

60
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,589
the butchering phase.

61
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:23,950
In this phase,

62
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,830
the butchers must be very careful.

63
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,150
We set up multiple traps.

64
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,019
(To survive,)

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,349
(I had no choice)

66
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,069
(but to climb higher,)

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,749
(which also meant sinking deeper.)

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,469
(Finally, I made some achievements)

69
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,579
(and earned their trust)

70
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,869
(to leave the place.)

71
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,218
The target has appeared.

72
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,629
Her name is Lin Jiayi.

73
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,538
I'll send the information

74
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,789
to you.

75
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,550
It's their task for me

76
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,789
to approach you and Lin Jiayi.

77
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,658
I had no choice.

78
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,909
I really had no choice.

79
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,629
I'm just a pawn,

80
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,189
a tool to make money for them.

81
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,670
I thought

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,309
to myself

83
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,629
that I would numb myself.

84
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,419
I stopped thinking.

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,338
I just did whatever they asked of me.

86
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,510
But I...

87
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,430
But I realized

88
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,550
that I've fallen in love with you.

89
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,230
Ruoyun,

90
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:04,419
I'm afraid they'll hurt you

91
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,869
like they did to Lin Jiayi.

92
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,259
I've been trying everything

93
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,789
to keep you safe.

94
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,058
I know they will

95
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:13,259
probably kill you

96
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,950
to wrap up the entire scam in the end.

97
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,310
I can't stop them.

98
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,229
I really can't.

99
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,109
I can only...

100
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,390
This is all I can do

101
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,429
to beg for your forgiveness.

102
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,750
Ruoyun.

103
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:33,830
Ruoyun,

104
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,310
forgive me,

105
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,669
please?

106
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,710
All right.

107
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,029
I see.

108
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,029
Ruoyun,

109
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,270
will you

110
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,789
forgive me?

111
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,469
Dear,

112
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,589
let's forget everything

113
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,710
and start anew, okay?

114
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:07,469
Ruoyun.

115
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,429
Gu Yancheng, you're spying on me.

116
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,310
You scoundrel.

117
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,549
If you're so eager to watch me,

118
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,589
fine,

119
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,139
let's see

120
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,070
what other tricks you're up to.

121
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:51,738
What are you doing?

122
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,710
Good morning.

123
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,469
Rise and shine.

124
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,819
Wake up now,

125
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,229
little lazy pig.

126
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,338
Come on.

127
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:00,270
Smile.

128
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,789
What are you doing?

129
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,338
I'm recording this

130
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,630
for our baby.

131
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:08,738
I want to show it

132
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,669
what its father looks like.

133
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,789
After I'm gone,

134
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,218
you must take good care of yourself.

135
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,469
Don't overwork.

136
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,710
Smile.

137
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,109
Come on.

138
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,470
Look.

139
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,429
Yancheng,

140
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,019
let's go shopping later

141
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,738
to buy some things

142
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,830
for our baby, all right?

143
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,870
Sure.

144
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,019
Dear,

145
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,978
I'm going to the restroom.

146
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,190
Hold these for me.

147
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,510
I'll wait for you here.

148
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,510
Everything has proceeded smoothly.

149
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,059
The time is ripe

150
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,909
for butchering.

151
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,538
I've already contacted these ladies.

152
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,899
They're willing to talk about

153
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,178
their experiences in the scam

154
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,739
and provide evidence.

155
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,379
I arranged to meet them at a park.

156
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,429
You'll meet them.

157
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:43,390
Okay.

158
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,549
What about you?

159
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,698
I need to find the rest.

160
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,789
They still don't want to answer my call.

161
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,230
By the way,

162
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,658
I couldn't contact

163
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,178
Lawyer Shang.

164
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:03,938
Should we

165
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,510
inform Ruoyun about this?

166
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:11,499
Hello.

167
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,339
I'm Wen Xin.

168
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,899
Can we start a group chat?

169
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,298
Sure.

170
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:15,669
Okay.

171
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,219
Did you read the message I sent?

172
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,099
Don't trust online scammers.

173
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,899
What makes you say
my boyfriend is a scammer?

174
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,139
Can't an internet relationship
be true love?

175
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,139
Do you think people like us

176
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,178
only deserve scammers

177
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,499
and not real love?

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,058
No, I didn't mean that.

179
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,390
Everyone deserves to have love.

180
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,339
Still, love shouldn't be a reason

181
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,139
to toy with us.

182
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,339
Leave now.

183
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,818
You're more like a scammer.

184
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,029
Leave now, or I'll call the security.

185
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,938
You don't have to trust me,

186
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,510
but I have evidence.

187
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,230
Don't give them money.

188
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,470
Who are you?

189
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,458
If you're not a resident here,

190
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,549
hurry and leave now.

191
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,429
The Fevengers?

192
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,230
They started a group chat.

193
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,219
Wen Xin,

194
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,549
well done.

195
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:29,870
Look at this.

196
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,470
I made it.

197
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:32,949
Isn't it lovely?

198
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,219
As expected of my dear.

199
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,549
You have fine taste.

200
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,510
Do you need my guide?

201
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,099
Sure, Ms. Wen.

202
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,990
Please enlighten me.

203
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:53,949
Where should I install this, dear?

204
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,470
It's the lowest part.

205
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,570
(Yan Fei)

206
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,189
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,810
(Yan Fei)

208
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,029
It's Yan Fei, right?

209
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,630
Dear,

210
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:26,870
I need to go out.

211
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,549
I promise

212
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,859
I'll make a clean break

213
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,750
with her.

214
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,189
Okay?

215
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,069
Why didn't you answer my calls?

216
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,139
I've been busy with my work.

217
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,778
I'm exhausted.

218
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,309
Stop complaining.

219
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,429
Also,

220
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,698
since Wen Ruoyun

221
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,418
found out about us,

222
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,899
she's been causing a scene at home.

223
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,818
She is like a crazy woman

224
00:11:57,819 --> 00:11:59,549
torturing me.

225
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,429
This is killing me.

226
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,069
Didn't she say she would withdraw
and let us be together?

227
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,750
Funny.

228
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,949
You see,

229
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,630
I'm the only one
who truly cares about you.

230
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,259
Of course.

231
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,899
You're the only one

232
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,709
who loves me wholeheartedly.

233
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,219
Do you want to

234
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,739
leave this place

235
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,750
with me?

236
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,630
I dream of it.

237
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,099
Let's leave.

238
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,829
I don't want to stay here anymore.

239
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,139
But if we start a life

240
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,698
in a new place,

241
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:39,189
we need a lot of money.

242
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,470
Do you have that much in your account?

243
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,909
Look at this.

244
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,099
I have this much money

245
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,230
overseas.

246
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,429
Don't tell Wen Ruoyun about it.

247
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,669
I'll keep this secret for you.

248
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:26,899
Ruoyun,

249
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,909
it's me.

250
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,938
I heard through the bug

251
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,418
that Gu Yancheng tricked Yan Fei

252
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:32,270
into revealing her account balance.

253
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,829
He never disappoints me.

254
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,778
This evil scum

255
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,510
should just rot to its core.

256
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,899
I'm really curious about

257
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,549
what tricks he has up his sleeve.

258
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,069
You need to

259
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,219
be very careful.

260
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,470
Don't expose yourself in front of him.

261
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,750
All right.

262
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,630
Gu Yancheng.

263
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,578
Dear,

264
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:10,750
what did she say?

265
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:13,909
It's a long story.

266
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,110
A long story?

267
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,709
How long is it?

268
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,698
You only care about her story,

269
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,230
but what about my jealousy?

270
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,669
Dear,

271
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,069
let's sit down.

272
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,658
I've already made it clear to her

273
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,379
that we're impossible,

274
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,470
but she still pesters me.

275
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,538
She even said something
to try to keep me.

276
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:41,750
What did she say?

277
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,219
Dear, don't get mad

278
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,510
when I tell you.

279
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,099
(I'm curious what spin you'll put on.)

280
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,899
She said

281
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,899
she was willing to take out
all her money

282
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,859
and leave with me.

283
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,298
Over the years,

284
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,499
she's been embezzling

285
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,538
the company's funds

286
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,390
by secretly taking kickbacks.

287
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,029
What?

288
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,189
This is unbelievable.

289
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:03,778
I've never done anything

290
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,510
to hurt her,

291
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,230
but she keeps betraying me.

292
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:11,538
Dear.

293
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,619
Dear,

294
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,949
don't be angry.

295
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,270
It's my fault.

296
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:15,979
I should've noticed

297
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,619
her true color.

298
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,150
I shouldn't have let her fool me.

299
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,379
I can't imagine

300
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,379
she'd go to such lengths

301
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,189
just to be with me.

302
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,069
It's not your fault.

303
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,270
It's mine.

304
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,778
I've known her for many years

305
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,630
but failed to see her true color.

306
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:36,630
Dear,

307
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,270
don't worry.

308
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,909
I'll take care of this.

309
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,709
Dear,

310
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,549
