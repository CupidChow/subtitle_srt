3
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,990
Is a young and beautiful girl like you

4
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,990
really want to be just a butler?

5
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,909
Every girl wants to succeed
in the quickest way.

6
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,430
But it depends on

7
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,309
whether he gives me this chance.

8
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,670
Mr. Gu.

9
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,749
Mr. Gu.

10
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,778
Mr. Gu.

11
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,190
This isn't appropriate.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,229
Now the chance is in your hands,

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,389
don't you want it?

14
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,790
What happened

15
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,070
to the scar on your leg?

16
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:35,029
I'll get the door.

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,589
(Su Xun,)

18
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,790
(what is your secret?)

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,150
(You still have the mood to test me.)

20
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,229
(Looks like your life
has been too comfortable.)

21
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,539
Ms. Wen fell last night
and was hospitalized.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,789
Why are you here instead
of visiting her in the hospital?

23
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,830
You're just a butler.

24
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,469
Mind your own business

25
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,230
and keep your nose out of mine.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,430
You're right.

27
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,818
I must guard this door

28
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,069
for Ms. Wen,

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,299
just in case some nonsense people

30
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,670
barge in.

31
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,069
Move aside.

32
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,629
What are you doing here again?

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,189
Trying to make a scene here?

34
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,378
Don't forget,

35
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,550
without me,

36
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,299
Wen Ruoyun wouldn't have
trusted you so quickly

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,189
and given you all the money.

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,699
I warned you

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,019
to behave.

40
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,378
Why won't you listen?

41
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,899
When are you going

42
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,979
to transfer all her money

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,069
and leave with me?

44
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,899
A billion

45
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,859
isn't a small figure.

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,110
Be patient.

47
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,749
I need some time.

48
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,589
Is this why you came here?

49
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,338
I left one of my earrings

50
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,390
behind.

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,899
I'll look for it.

52
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,909
You go first.

53
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,579
There's an outsider here now.

54
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,618
We can talk about these things

55
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:18,789
over the phone.

56
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,390
(Turning their backs on each other.)

57
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,510
(The show begins.)

58
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,349
Ruoyun,

59
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,549
have you recovered?

60
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,298
I have been

61
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,738
working on the design drafts

62
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,310
with the rest these days.

63
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,870
- I've also prepared...
- Cut the crap. Let's start now.

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,989
Where is everyone else?

65
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,658
All right.

66
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,909
Let's get started.

67
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,019
For the third quarter,
our new design theme

68
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,789
is "A Hornbill Trapped in Love".

69
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,738
The Design Department and I

70
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,538
noticed that the marriage rate
among young people

71
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,418
has been declining.

72
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,019
Besides, they...

73
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,909
Even though love is diverse,

74
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,750
no one should steal
someone else's partner.

75
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,710
This is not an original idea.

76
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,298
The Design Department and I

77
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:03,059
stayed out all night

78
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,978
to create this.

79
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,950
By that logic,

80
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,978
can I simply copy

81
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,190
someone else's jewelry design

82
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,469
and claim it's my original idea?

83
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,259
A good design

84
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,899
should always innovate

85
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,310
on past masterpieces.

86
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:20,029
You taught me this.

87
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,950
I don't remember teaching you

88
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:22,978
to steal

89
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,699
like a thief,

90
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,510
and not just once.

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,070
Me?

92
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,950
I didn't.

93
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,978
As the chief jewelry designer,

94
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,560
you've copied people's
designs habitually.

95
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,549
This is a threat to our company.

96
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,029
We're already working

97
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,469
on solutions internally.

98
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,789
Wen Ruoyun,

99
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:44,899
what do you mean?

100
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,029
You can't claim something
you steal yours.

101
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,298
Your punishment

102
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:50,190
will be announced
to the entire company later.

103
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:51,669
Meeting adjourned.

104
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,510
Ruoyun.

105
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,029
Wen Ruoyun.

106
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,899
Do you have to embarrass me

107
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,150
in front of so many people?

108
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,789
DT Jewelry has already sent us
a legal notice

109
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,950
accusing you of plagiarism.

110
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,270
Do you know the company is facing
a massive settlement

111
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,870
because of you?

112
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,150
A legal notice?

113
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:17,418
Then tell me.

114
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,800
How are you going to deal with this?

115
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,109
Yan Fei,

116
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:22,538
do you remember

117
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,178
you telling me you wanted to become
a great jewelry designer

118
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,229
back in our college days?

119
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,178
Unexpectedly,

120
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,789
after all these years,

121
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,229
many things have changed to a point
that they're barely recognizable.

122
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,510
Am I the only one changed here?

123
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,310
Ruoyun,

124
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,830
we've been together for over ten years.

125
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,469
We know each other deeply.

126
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,630
Have you ever cared for me?

127
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,710
Why did you never ask me

128
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,710
why I'm single?

129
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,338
Because I've fallen in love

130
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,909
with a man I can't be with.

131
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,589
Why not?

132
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,229
Is he married?

133
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,349
He told me

134
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:05,738
he was just pretending to love

135
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,499
his wife.

136
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,819
He's only happy

137
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,669
when he's with me.

138
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:12,270
Ruoyun,

139
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,310
do you think I'm the kind of woman

140
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,549
who would ruin someone else's family?

141
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,150
So you believe in his lies?

142
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,070
I don't get it.

143
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,669
Why do you want to be a home wrecker?

144
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,429
I'm a home wrecker?

145
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,379
Instead, I think

146
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,298
it's the fault of the person
who isn't loved.

147
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,310
Yan Fei,

148
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,510
we've been friends for years.

149
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:35,858
Won't you tell me

150
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:37,429
who that guy is?

151
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,029
Wen Ruoyun,

152
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,589
what's gotten into you today?

153
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,298
You called me out at work

154
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:43,909
and forced me to confess
my relationship.

155
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:46,139
Yes, we're good friends,

156
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,899
but I don't have to

157
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,538
tell you everything.

158
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,349
Do you have to know everything about me?

159
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,390
Ruoyun.

160
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,510
This is the property
supplementary agreement you asked for.

161
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,390
Sign it if there's no problem.

162
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,270
Gu Yancheng is having
an affair with Yan Fei?

163
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,190
It's not what you think.

164
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:23,789
Don't lie to me.

165
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,150
What's really going on?

166
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,950
I've come to a realization

167
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,990
that when women control the money,

168
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,510
men behave.

169
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,789
Wen Ruoyun,

170
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,150
are you out of your mind?

171
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,739
You actually try to use money

172
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,150
to keep a man who cheats on you?

173
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,019
Why not divorce him?

174
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,829
Divorce isn't like breaking up.

175
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,390
It's complicated.

176
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:50,909
Fine.

177
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,990
I won't ask about the rest.

178
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,270
But remember,

179
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:55,990
as your lawyer

180
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,270
and good friend,

181
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,350
I'll always support you.

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,669
All right?

183
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:06,870
I'm leaving.

184
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:21,630
Why?

185
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,750
Wen Ruoyun found out you're cheating

186
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,818
and restricted
your transfer authorization?

187
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:26,859
(Transfer failed: Maximum single
transaction limit is 2,000,000.)

188
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,949
He,

189
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:29,669
know your place.

190
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,870
Keep your histrionics to yourself.

191
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,590
Ms. Yi said you've been
working hard lately.

192
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,979
You look weak now.

193
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,259
Don't waste your effort

194
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,270
more than it is worth.

195
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,669
Don't get exhausted.

196
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,669
Gu Yancheng, what took
you so long to pick up?

197
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,040
Wen Ruoyun is too much!

198
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
She insults me in front of everyone,
saying I copy someone else's designs!

199
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,069
I've never been humiliated like that.

200
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:04,870
Do you think she finds out
about our affair?

201
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:07,789
She did.

202
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,230
Wen,

203
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,739
can you teach me

204
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,350
how to deal with this situation?

205
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,230
It's him.

206
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,429
(After all this effort,)

207
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,029
(one of the gang finally shows up.)

208
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,698
Dear,

209
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,230
isn't that

210
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,909
our mattress?

211
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,150
Dear,

212
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,739
why are you

213
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,990
replacing the mattress?

214
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,750
It's dirty.

215
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:10,750
Change it, then.

216
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,390
Anything you like.

217
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,859
Dear,

218
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,379
I want to give our baby...

219
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,270
Did you transfer the funds today?

220
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,818
New products arrived

221
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,339
at the gallery earlier today,

222
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,350
and I needed to make a payment,

223
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,298
but I didn't have

224
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,709
enough funds,

225
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,630
so I transferred the money
from your card.

226
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,578
I received a notification

227
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,789
about the card transfer limit.

228
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:40,870
Dear.

229
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,270
Didn't we agree

230
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,069
to share everything together?

231
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,750
I know you cheated.

232
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,829
Dear.

233
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,418
Someone bumped into me

234
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,069
when I was waiting in line to buy coffee

235
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,549
near the gallery.

236
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,270
It's not what you think.

237
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,029
Why are you with me?

238
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,178
For money?

239
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,270
Money?

240
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,789
As if I need it.

241
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,909
Ruoyun,

242
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,538
marriage is the only chance

243
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,499
I can choose my family.

244
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,578
I'm so lucky

245
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,578
to have met you.

246
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:42,029
I treasure this chance.

247
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,698
I know I've been busy

248
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,270
and neglected your feelings.

249
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,789
Please trust me.

250
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,058
I've never thought

251
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:56,630
of betraying our marriage.

252
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:00,990
(Yancheng,)

253
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,590
(can I still trust you?)

254
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,979
Stop overthinking,

255
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,029
all right?

256
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,789
(Gu Yancheng,)

257
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,110
(you smooth talker.)

258
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,669
You're really something else.

259
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,390
The pig's awake.

260
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,899
Ms. Yi,

261
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,938
let me do it.

262
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:32,909
Shut up.

263
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,709
Send this to Wen.

264
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,019
He will know

265
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,669
what to do next.

266
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,829
Ms. Yi,

267
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,909
you always favor him.

268
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,189
I know what you're thinking.

269
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:45,339
But Wen

270
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,230
is the person our boss chose.

271
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,870
If you want to take over his place,

272
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,870
you need to be smarter.

273
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,778
But

274
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,259
he hasn't done well lately.

275
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,110
When will you promote me?

276
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,698
Are you piggies

277
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:58,789
ready?

278
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,538
They do anything I say.

279
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,230
They've been fattened up.

280
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,829
Well done.

281
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,029
Hello?

282
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,829
I managed to secure Wen Ruoyun's money
for the time being,

283
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,840
but I'm worried they might
come up with something else.

284
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,019
I need to find a way

285
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,339
to get his fingerprint

286
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,549
to unlock the safe.

287
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,909
You...

288
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,429
Mr. Gu,

289
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,350
I'm Su Xun.

290
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,789
You look tired.

291
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,309
