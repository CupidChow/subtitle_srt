3
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:39,759
Ms. Wen,

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Lawyer Shang hasn't shown up
for the past few days.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,079
Do you know what has happened to him?

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,600
I'll go check on it.

7
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,039
Ms. Wang,

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,679
has Shang Yu come home
to visit you lately?

9
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,240
He didn't come back.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,280
I wanted

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,880
to ask you about him too.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,439
I couldn't reach out to Yu recently.

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,519
Has something happened to him?

14
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,040
Don't worry, Ms. Wang.

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,480
Shang Yu will be all right.

16
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,840
Ms. Wen,

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,799
these are the suppliers

18
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,840
we've been working with.

19
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,000
The rest

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,439
are the project documents

21
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,799
from when Yan Fei joined the company.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,480
The finance department

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
is responsible for verifying

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,920
the expenses of the Design Department
in every project.

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
Before the investigation results
are out,

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,200
please keep this a secret.

27
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:37,840
All right.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,719
Get back to your work.

29
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,879
Ms. Wen,

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,000
the results are out.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,079
It's been found that Yan Fei

32
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,920
has embezzled fifty million

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,840
from the company's funds

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
using her position.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,280
On top of that,

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,159
this money

37
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,120
has likely been transferred
to an overseas account.

38
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,680
Inform the heads of all departments

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,760
that there's an emergency meeting
in five minutes.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,480
Okay.

41
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,959
I gather you all here on short notice

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,039
for an important announcement.

43
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,159
I've always trusted

44
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,599
every member of Wen Jewelry

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,080
all along.

46
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,800
I entrusted the work to you

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,240
without a doubt,

48
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,919
but unexpectedly,

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,240
someone

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,159
has betrayed that trust.

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,439
Yan Fei,

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
please stand up.

53
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,039
What do you have to say

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
about using your position

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,080
to embezzle funds?

56
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,159
Me?

57
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,319
Ms. Wen,

58
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,960
you need to prove your accusation.

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
You can't put words in my mouth

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
because

61
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,319
we have beef.

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,199
Regarding the misconduct
of the director

63
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,360
of the Design Department, Yan Fei,

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,680
I've already sent emails

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,639
to the leaders of each department.

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
Please check your emails.

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Wen Ruoyun,

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,159
I was wondering why you were so kind

69
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,800
to invite me back to the company.

70
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,919
Turns out you've been plotting

71
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,280
against me.

72
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
You accused me of plagiarism
before this

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,919
and now embezzlement.

74
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,199
What other underhanded tricks
do you have?

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,520
Bring it on.

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
If you've done nothing wrong,

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,439
why are you afraid
of being investigated?

78
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,360
You bribed Wang Yong from the legal team

79
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,879
to alter your contract

80
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,840
for personal gain.

81
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,879
Do you know it has caused
a massive loss?

82
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,919
Yan Fei,

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,639
you're fired.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
Wen Ruoyun,

85
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,199
you'll have to pay

86
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,879
for what you did today.

87
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,680
You called out Wen Ruoyun
in front of everyone at the meeting,

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,560
saying that she'd have to pay the price?

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,280
I certainly did.

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,039
Many eyes were on me.

91
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,319
I shouldn't just stand there
and face the music.

92
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,439
Since it's already happened,

93
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,719
don't overthink.

94
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,840
I need to get back to my work.

95
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
We'll talk again later.

96
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,439
This foolish woman

97
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,160
has said something she shouldn't,

98
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,639
as I expected.

99
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
Since she has a convincing motive,

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,279
the next step will be much easier.

101
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,000
All I need to do is lure her

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,720
into hurting Wen Ruoyun,

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,079
and I'll play the heartbroken husband

104
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,160
afterward

105
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,360
and inherit my wife's assets naturally.

106
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,319
No one will suspect me.

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
Well done,

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,439
Gu Yancheng.

109
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,319
Wen Xin,

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,879
I suddenly have a stomach upset.

111
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,879
Please tell the customer

112
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,120
that the gallery will reopen

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
in two hours.

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,839
All right, Mr. Gu.

115
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,000
Please go to the congee shop

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
on Qingnian Road

117
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,720
to buy me a bowl of congee.

118
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,160
They don't do takeout.

119
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,319
Thank you so much.

120
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,839
(She'll take at least two hours
for that.)

121
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,680
(The time is enough for me.)

122
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,480
Are you preparing to run away?

123
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,399
I can't stay here anymore.

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,399
Wen Ruoyun won't let me off.

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,199
I don't want to go to jail.

126
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,279
Why didn't I just apologize to her?

127
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,240
Do you want to leave with me?

128
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
Let's go abroad.

129
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,240
I need to pack my things.

130
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,120
Otherwise,

131
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,439
I won't be able to leave.

132
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,439
Calm down first.

133
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
It's too late to be afraid now.

134
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,720
Sit down

135
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
and think about your next steps.

136
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Think about my next steps?

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,519
Aren't you leaving with me?

138
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,439
Are you leaving or not?

139
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,800
I want to go with you.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But as you know,

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
I have a tie here.

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,240
Wen Ruoyun is pregnant with my child.

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
How could I just leave?

144
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,639
But without this child,

145
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I could go anywhere

146
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,839
with you.

147
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,639
We could leave together.

148
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,519
Without this child,

149
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,000
we could leave together.

150
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,519
Without this child,

151
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,680
you could go anywhere with me.

152
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,240
Without this child,

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,279
nothing can stop us

154
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,800
from being together.

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,279
Right.

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,199
Without this child,

157
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,879
we could leave together.

158
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,000
Child.

159
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,759
Child.

160
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,519
Child.

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Yan Fei.

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Yan Fei.

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
What are you trying to do, Yan Fei?

164
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,959
Calm down.

165
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,920
Calm down.

166
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,439
Everything

167
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,560
is your fault.

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,079
Yan Fei.

169
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,879
Calm down.

170
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,560
Yan Fei.

171
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,560
You're insane, Yan Fei.

172
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,199
Why are you running away?

173
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Yan Fei.

174
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,720
As long as your child is gone,

175
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,199
I can be with Gu Yancheng.

176
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,879
Don't come near me.

177
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,319
No.

178
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,959
We can be together.

179
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,560
Why are you running away?

180
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,199
Don't run.

181
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,519
Yan Fei.

182
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
You're happy, aren't you?

183
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,240
No.

184
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,559
The one beside him

185
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,799
should've been me.

186
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,120
Me.

187
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,720
It should've been me!

188
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,720
Yan Fei,

189
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,879
calm down.

190
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
Wen Ruoyun,

191
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,759
you have everything.

192
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,519
Why did you take Gu Yancheng
away from me?

193
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,200
Yan Fei.

194
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,519
Yan Fei.

195
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Yan Fei.

196
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
What should I do?

197
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,279
Yan Fei.

198
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,240
What should I do?

199
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,320
Surprisingly, Wen Ruoyun

200
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,360
helps me get rid of Yan Fei.

201
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,200
Even luck is on my side.

202
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,279
You can get off work earlier.

203
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,480
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

204
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:34,220
(CEO's Room)

205
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,840
So

206
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,320
he was so excited to leave
because of this.

207
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,919
Dear,

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
what has happened?

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,919
Are you all right?

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,840
Don't scare me.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,759
Wake up.

212
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,759
Wake up.

213
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,799
Wake up.

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Wake...

215
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Wen Ruoyun,

216
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,360
you only have yourself to blame.

217
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,639
Let me tell you this.

218
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,279
Even if it weren't me,

219
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,840
there would be other men

220
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,799
with ill intentions approaching you.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,799
Why couldn't you follow my script

222
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,279
and stay in the psychiatric hospital?

223
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,600
Huh?

224
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,600
It wouldn't have ended up
with two lives lost.

225
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,759
And you,

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,279
you're the most foolish woman
I've ever seen.

227
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,759
With mere sweet lies,

228
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,159
you're so obsessed with me

229
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,960
uncontrollably.

230
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,360
You're more obedient than a dog.

231
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,799
What a moron.

232
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,440
Everything is over now.

233
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,279
Gu Yancheng's script

234
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,240
is difficult as hell.

235
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, the final step.

236
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,519
Hello,

237
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,120
is this 110?

238
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,960
Hello.

239
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,600
Someone...

240
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,240
Yes?

241
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Someone broke into my house
with a weapon.

242
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,720
My wife...

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,639
My wife...

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,159
It's blood all over them.

245
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,960
They're lying together.

246
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,559
They are...

247
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,320
Dead.

248
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,559
Hello?

249
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,120
Hello, sir?

250
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,559
Can you hear me, sir?

251
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,320
Sir?

252
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,799
Sir?

253
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,720
Sir?

254
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,240
What has happened?

255
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
Please tell me the address, sir.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,639
Sir?

257
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,799
My wife and that person have woken up.

258
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,879
They're playing a game with me.

259
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,360
Why don't you continue?

260
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you want me to

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
describe how you set up
your wife for money

262
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,519
to the police?

263
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,759
Gu Yancheng,

264
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,039
you're such a good actor.

265
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm not done yet.

266
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,200
Why did you expose yourself so soon?

267
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,759
So you women

268
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,639
gang up against me.

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,240
Your acting is more convincing
than mine.

270
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,759
Is it fun to fool me?

271
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,919
Yes, it is.

272
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,279
Gu Yancheng.

273
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,000
Didn't you say you loved me

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,720
and wanted to go with me?

275
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,399
And have a stupid child with you

276
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,720
to live a stupid life?

277
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,039
So this is the truth.

278
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,679
You don't love me.

279
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,039
You jerk!

280
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,840
I didn't expect

281
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,120
to be fooled by you women.

282
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Without the child,

283
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,720
you could go anywhere with me.

284
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,679
Ruoyun,

285
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,720
Gu Yancheng is planning to use
Yan Fei against you.

286
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
You must be careful.

287
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,200
If the child dies.

288
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,480
If the child dies.

289
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,039
If the child dies.

290
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:36,720
Yan Fei,

291
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,559
what are you trying to do?

292
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,759
Ruoyun.

293
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,840
Calm down.

294
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,759
As long as the child dies...

295
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,240
Calm down.

296
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,720
I can be with Gu Yancheng.

297
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,360
Calm down.

298
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,720
