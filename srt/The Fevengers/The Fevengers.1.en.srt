1
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,018
Ms. Yi,

2
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:42,909
we've got Lin Jiayi's money.

3
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,390
Get ready

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,670
to butcher the pig.

5
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:48,710
Meng Yu,

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,779
where are you now?

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,058
I want to see you now.

8
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,378
A few ten million investments
have all gone down the drain.

9
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,099
I don't want to drag you into this.

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,139
Abort the baby.

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,629
I don't blame you.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,819
We can figure something out together.

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,819
Don't leave me, please.

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,990
Lin Jiayi,

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,058
stop it.

16
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:05,939
I'm begging you.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,150
Please don't leave me.
You promised you'd marry me.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,459
I've lost everything because of you.

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,710
How am I going to carry on?

20
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:14,978
Meng Yu.

21
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,150
Meng Yu!

22
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:28,630
Save my baby!

23
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:33,858
Hurry.

24
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:35,070
Save the woman.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,550
The patient got into a car accident.
She has multiple fractures.

26
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,618
Thirty percent of severe skin burns.

27
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,910
The three-month fetus has been aborted.

28
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:47,498
Ms. Yi,

29
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,509
the pig has been butchered.

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,210
=Episode 1=

31
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,618
Ruoyun,

32
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,589
I found a good eatery.

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,150
Every time I went there,

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,029
I thought it'd be great
to have you with me.

35
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:11,430
I miss you so much.

36
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,378
Would you like to come
to my art gallery

37
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,618
to see my new designs?

38
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,419
Or maybe

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,218
we can

40
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,629
have tea together.

41
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,869
I named them

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,110
"Embrace".

43
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,670
I can feel that.

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,230
They are beautiful.

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,390
You've never talked about love.

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,830
It's all right.

47
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,909
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,019
Marriage is a form of love

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,390
that exists through a pact.

50
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:47,430
Honestly, to me,

51
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,990
it doesn't matter.

52
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,230
What matters is

53
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,589
the couple deeply loves

54
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:54,749
and supports each other.

55
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,349
That explains why you're still single.

56
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,830
I once met a woman I deeply loved.

57
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,270
(When I decided to propose to her,)

58
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,909
(she had a car accident.)

59
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,550
(The car caught fire.)

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,110
(She was severely injured
and got trapped inside the car.)

61
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,670
(I tried to save her so desperately,)

62
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,378
(but the fire was too intense.)

63
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,110
(I...)

64
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,390
Later,

65
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,749
she was sent to the ER.

66
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,270
Her skin was all burned,

67
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,430
and she was unconscious.

68
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,270
I stayed by the door of her ward

69
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,069
and called out to her,

70
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,710
"Don't fall asleep.

71
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,589
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you."

72
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:42,990
But she...

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,450
(Wen Ruoyun)

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,029
Ms. Yi,

75
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,459
I've done my job.

76
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,270
When can I leave?

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,990
I made fitting keys.

78
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,950
Are you a good fit?

79
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,789
If not, then get lost.

80
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,938
I've spent so much time
grinding the key,

81
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,550
but it turns out futile.

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,710
He,

83
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,710
sharpen that key again.

84
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,870
If you don't marry her,

85
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,429
you won't get all her property.

86
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,310
But if I marry her,

87
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,338
how do I escape later?

88
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,778
Just get what you're asked to.

89
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,390
Do your job.

90
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,218
What if...

91
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,270
No what-ifs.

92
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:34,229
If you can think about the results
and consequences,

93
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,870
you'll be able to escape.

94
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,589
(Ruoyun,)

95
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,909
(meeting you)

96
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,390
(is the best start of the story.)

97
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,630
(It's my greatest happiness
to be with you down the road.)

98
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:42,579
(I will try everything)

99
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,750
(in my power)

100
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,469
(to get you)

101
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,989
(what you want.)

102
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,630
(Yancheng,)

103
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,669
(I have no family.)

104
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,950
(All I've been waiting for)

105
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,750
(is my obsession with you.)

106
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,190
(You're becoming my only family.)

107
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,390
(I don't care about those ceremonies.)

108
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,429
(I only hope)

109
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,549
(the man who grows old with me)

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,390
(is you.)

111
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,549
(Will those who deceive
their partner to death)

112
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,710
(face the consequences?)

113
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:50,589
(No.)

114
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,870
(They won't.)

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,669
(Only the abandoned one)

116
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,070
(will rot in the mire alone.)

117
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,909
(Nevertheless,)

118
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,270
(do not underestimate)

119
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,589
(the determination of a woman
who once died.)

120
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,830
(She will catch you off guard)

121
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,439
(by seeking justice for herself.)

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,330
=The Fevengers=

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,630
You really married that sofa guy?

124
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,019
What sofa guy?

125
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,538
I've told you many times.

126
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:27,778
It's not about money,

127
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,830
it's about feelings.

128
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,589
I feel

129
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,469
that he's different from other men.

130
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,139
He gives me

131
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,229
a brand-new experience I've never had.

132
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,789
He protects me,

133
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,789
loves me,

134
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,150
and cherishes me dearly.

135
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,669
Feelings?

136
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,669
What kind of feelings are those?

137
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,789
How are they different?

138
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,699
It's different.

139
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,579
It's the same?

140
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,059
You said he's different.

141
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,139
I won't tell you.

142
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,549
How is it different?

143
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,070
Miss,

144
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,390
this apartment is pretty good.

145
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,819
It's newly furnished.

146
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,150
Good ventilation.
Excellent natural lighting. Strategic location.

147
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,510
A place with good Fengshui
brings you luck.

148
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,858
When your mood is good,

149
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,699
you can have anything you want.

150
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,229
Is this a great place?

151
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:21,950
Of course.

152
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,710
(Gu Yancheng.)

153
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,029
(Artistic sofa gallery.)

154
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,070
I'll take this.

155
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,259
I only rent my apartment
to tenants who click with me.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,058
If we do, we're friends.

157
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,139
The price for friends

158
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,750
can be a good deal.

159
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,909
What will the price be

160
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,789
if we hit it off?

161
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,470
If we're friends

162
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,418
and get along well,

163
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:51,110
I won't charge any rent.

164
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,110
That's very kind of you.

165
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,979
No, I can do it.

166
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,990
Let me.

167
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,230
Still won't look away?

168
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,549
I'll rent this apartment for a year.

169
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,590
If you dare to bother me,

170
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,739
I won't just step on your hand.

171
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,789
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,949
Take the money and get lost.

173
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:15,870
Lin Jiayi,

174
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,270
I leave these scars
to make you remember.

175
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,110
From now on,

176
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,390
no one can bully you again.

177
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,110
I'm sorry, miss.

178
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,789
We're closed.

179
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,909
- If you need anything, please...
- Could you help me choose a chair?

180
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,270
It's a present

181
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,669
for someone important to me.

182
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,909
Sure.

183
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,698
In this gallery,

184
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,019
every piece

185
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,270
has its soul.

186
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,750
They will choose their owner.

187
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,510
Is that so?

188
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,189
Can you try this chair

189
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,709
for me?

190
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,029
Sure.
