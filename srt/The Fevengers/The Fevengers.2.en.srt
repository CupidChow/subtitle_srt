=Episode 2=

3
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,909
I'll give you a treat.

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,589
Your little game

5
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,350
is kind of brutal.

6
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,269
I'm not

7
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,269
as brutal as you are.

8
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,750
Meng Yu.

9
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:03,269
Who are you?

10
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,150
You give me another reason to kill you.

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,309
You shouldn't have forgotten me
so easily.

12
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,790
I have countless thoughts
about how to kill you.

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,509
In the end,

14
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:19,389
I realized I should give you
a taste of your own medicine and more.

15
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:23,150
Kill me.

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,309
Come on.

17
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,589
Just kill me.

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,949
Come on.

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,270
Kill me.

20
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,749
I said kill me.

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:33,899
Do it.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,949
Kill me!

23
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,138
Lin Jiayi,

24
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,710
are you happy now?

25
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:46,270
You won't die

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,990
an easy death.

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,058
You should at least savor the taste

28
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:52,070
of a torturous life.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,739
Morning, Mr. Gu.

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,309
Ms. Gao will be here soon.

31
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:01,550
All right.

32
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,498
This sofa

33
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:11,950
is called "Embrace".

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,990
When someone holds you,

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,789
your brain releases hormones

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,510
and dopamine

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,869
that create a sense of pleasure.

38
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,670
This sofa is purely handmade.

39
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,670
Its two arms are designed

40
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,618
to make you feel

41
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,510
embraced.

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,909
It will relieve you

43
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:36,150
from the tiredness of life.

44
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,189
After hearing that,

45
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,270
I think this sofa

46
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,150
is very comfy.

47
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:48,950
I want this.

48
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,579
The payment is 59,200 yuan.

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,218
We'll deliver the sofa

50
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,830
shortly.

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,589
All right.

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,749
I'm leaving.

53
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,349
Please come again.

54
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:09,299
Up next is

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,179
Lot 1079.

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,818
It's created
by the great impressionist, Pablo Vermee,

57
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,218
"A Match Made in Heaven" series,

58
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,658
The Ruby Woman

59
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,818
The starting price is

60
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,550
Five hundred thousand.

61
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,629
Six hundred thousand.
We have six hundred thousand here.

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,179
Six hundred thousand.

63
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,139
One million.

64
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,778
We have one million.

65
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:29,749
One million.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,179
Two million.

67
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,899
One million.

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,789
The bid is at one million.

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,098
Two million.

70
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,299
The bid is at two million. Any higher bid?

71
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,058
Two million.

72
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,778
The bid is at two million.

73
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:42,859
Final call! Congratulations, Lisa.

74
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,338
A bid from a phone
with digits 8314.

75
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:45,990
Thank you, Madam.

76
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,230
Two million for a painting.

77
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:07,390
You care for your wife so much.

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,029
Do I not care for you?

79
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,909
You are full of thorns,

80
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,510
but I can't help myself
to hold you tight.

81
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:27,909
I'm foolish, right?

82
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,589
No.

83
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,270
It's a shame.

84
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,229
Shame?

85
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,750
It's a shame
that I can't give it to you.

86
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,589
(Wen Jewelry's Employee Information)
Here's what you asked for.

87
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,059
Why hasn't Yancheng come back

88
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,750
at this hour?

89
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,619
Hello, this is Gu Yancheng
Artistic Sofa Gallery

90
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,669
Is this Wen Xin?

91
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,098
Ruoyun.

92
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,830
Has my husband left work yet?

93
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,469
Mr. Gu has already left.

94
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,310
All right.

95
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,349
Dear.

96
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:09,589
Dear,

97
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,270
happy birthday.

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,229
Why are you so late?

99
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,899
The gallery is busy today,

100
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,390
so I got held up.

101
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,029
Dear,

102
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,218
I'll go upstairs to shower

103
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,109
and change.

104
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:27,950
By the way,

105
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,630
here's your parcel.

106
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,930
(How have you been?)

107
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,190
What's inside it?

108
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,830
It's empty.

109
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,870
I guess it's someone's prank.

110
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,070
Dear,

111
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,390
have you found a personal butler?

112
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,750
I did.

113
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,858
Ms. Wang recommended me.

114
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,259
They also provide nursing services.

115
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,589
They'll arrive in two days.

116
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,989
That's good.

117
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,270
I'm going upstairs.

118
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,510
May I know who you are?

119
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,819
Hello, Ms. Wen.

120
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,390
I'm the personal butler
recommended by Ms. Wang.

121
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,909
My name is Su Xun.

122
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,139
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,909
I didn't know you'd arrive so soon.

124
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,939
Today is a special day,

125
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,070
isn't it?

126
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,538
Ms. Wang told me

127
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:29,218
today is both your and your husband's
birthday.

128
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,178
I've prepared a gift for you both.

129
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,789
I hope you like it.

130
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,669
Thank you.

131
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,630
Well,

132
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,589
please come in.

133
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,210
(How have you been, Meng Yu?)

134
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,349
Check a parcel for me.

135
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,229
I want to know who sent it.

136
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,110
"Meeting you

137
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,669
is a miracle."

138
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,470
You know the meaning
of Diphylleia Grayi?

139
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,099
This is the flower my husband gave me

140
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,309
when he confessed his love.

141
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:13,938
Mr. Gu

142
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,829
knows women very well.

143
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,110
I heard you and your husband got married
not long after you met.

144
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,189
That's precious fate.

145
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,270
Actually,

146
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,150
we almost missed out on each other.

147
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,099
Back then,

148
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,499
he came here

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,909
because of this painting.

150
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,379
Don't you think

151
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,390
this sole piece

152
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,069
is "A Match Made in Heaven"
Vermee's created?

153
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:47,829
Sole piece?

154
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,750
Pablo Vermee's "A Match Made in Heaven"

155
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,590
consists of two paintings.

156
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,698
The piece you're looking at

157
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:57,270
is "The Man Who Kisses a Rose",

158
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,019
while the other one...

159
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,829
"The Ruby Woman".

160
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,709
Only when they are brought together

161
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,938
do they become the heavenly match

162
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,590
Vermee created.

163
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,189
It's a shame

164
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,350
that "The Ruby Woman"

165
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,990
is nowhere to be seen now.

166
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,270
True.

167
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,029
People only remember regrets.

168
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,549
Anyway, beautiful things

169
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,390
are hard to come by.

170
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:25,590
Excuse me.

171
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,829
I'll buy this painting.

172
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:28,909
Sorry.

173
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,619
This gentleman

174
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,630
has already bought it.

175
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,058
If you like it so much,

176
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,309
you have it.

177
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:37,630
No, I can't.

178
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,750
I can't take it from you.

179
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,510
It's rare to meet someone
who understands you.

180
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,150
It's a blessing

181
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,789
for it to find a companion.

182
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,390
My name is Wen Ruoyun.

183
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:48,458
Nice to meet you.

184
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:49,590
Gu Yancheng.

185
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,429
Soon after we met,

186
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,150
we fell deeply in love.

187
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,029
I once thought

188
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,669
I'd never see him again.

189
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,750
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

190
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,029
When I walked into the airport lobby,

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,110
I suddenly realized
that I'd been thinking about you.

192
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,230
I've met many people in my life,

193
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,630
and I thought we shared
the same thoughts.

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,350
But after I met you,

195
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,789
I realize such a chance

196
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,870
is now or never.

197
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:36,990
Wen Ruoyun,

198
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,429
let's get married.

199
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,949
But we just met.

200
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,099
I think

201
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,829
I've known you for ages.

202
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,909
Wen Ruoyun,

203
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,789
will you marry me?

204
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,510
The meaning of Diphylleia Grayi is

205
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,590
"Meeting you

206
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:03,789
is a miracle."

207
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,949
Marry me.

208
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,139
(Hmph, Cat Abandonment Effect.)

209
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,789
(That's brilliant.)

210
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,029
Why are you smiling?

211
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,698
Most of the men you come across

212
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,110
are jerks.

213
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,658
The loyal ones

214
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,259
usually get taken by women

215
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,698
after one or two relationships

216
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,270
without letting go.

217
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,829
But women are different.

218
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,099
They go all out to love.

219
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,339
When they're fooled

220
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,899
or deeply hurt,

221
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,990
they close off their hearts to love again.

222
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:43,590
Ms. Wen,

223
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:45,698
an exceptionally outstanding
and good-looking man

224
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,309
isn't always a good thing.

225
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:48,739
Do hold on tight

226
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,309
to Mr. Gu.

227
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,200
You don't have to hold a man tightly
if he loves you.

228
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,750
But if he doesn't love you,

229
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,350
you can't keep him
however hard you try.

230
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,709
Right?

231
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,750
You'll be staying in the guest room
on the first floor.

232
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,669
Tomorrow is the first day.

233
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,029
One month probation.

234
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,150
Please look out for me.

235
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,410
(Recyclable)

236
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,178
(Recyclable)

237
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:28,990
Dear,

238
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,110
happy birthday.

239
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,350
Happy birthday.

240
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,429
Thank you.

241
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,870
Ruoyun.

242
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,470
Ruoyun.

243
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,390
Be careful.

244
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,870
These new heels are uncomfortable.

245
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,309
I told you not to wear them.

246
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,630
This is my husband's and my
birthday party.

247
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,339
What's with this fancy dress?

248
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,709
Because

249
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,390
I want to seduce your husband.

250
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,390
Please don't say that.

251
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,270
Ruoyan may take it seriously.

252
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:04,339
Not at all.

253
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,270
Ruoyun,

254
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,298
happy birthday.

255
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:07,549
Wen Xin, you've arrived.

256
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,230
Sorry, we're late.

257
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,019
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

258
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,750
Mr. Gu,

259
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:12,418
Ruoyun,

260
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,390
happy birthday.

261
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,058
I'm so sorry, Ruoyun.

262
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,099
It's all right.

263
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,470
I'll go and change it.

264
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:19,339
Dear,

265
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,298
hold these for me.

266
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,510
I'll go change it.

267
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,590
You guys enjoy the party.

268
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,350
Don't worry.

269
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,949
Ruoyun won't mind that.

270
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,350
Ruoyun.

271
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,189
She's pretty.

272
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,390

274
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,339
Ruoyun, you're so pretty.

275
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,189
You look good in anything.

276
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,750
