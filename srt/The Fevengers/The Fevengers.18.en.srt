3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,399
Dear,

4
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm leaving.

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,520
Take care of yourself.

6
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,479
Stay safe.

7
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,439
Be careful.

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,760
Bye-bye.

(Taocheng Nursing Home)

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,359
He,

11
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,439
someone's following me.

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,599
Keep an eye on it for me.

13
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,920
Hello.

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Ruoyun.

15
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,719
How are things going?

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,680
Gu Yancheng came out of the nursing home

17
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,879
with a black bag.

18
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,520
I guess the gold bars are inside it.

19
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,080
It seems something's wrong
with this nursing home.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,919
I'll follow him.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,319
Wait for my news.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,080
Be careful.

23
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,900
(Good night. WAN)

24
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,879
Hello, the number you've dialed
is powered off.

25
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,879
Hello, the number you've dialed
is powered off.

26
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,680
Jiayi,

27
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
I called Shang Yu many times,

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
but he didn't answer.

29
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm worried something happened to him.

30
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,639
I want to go to Taocheng.

31
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll go with you.

32
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,190
(Taocheng Nursing Home)

33
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,159
This is the place

34
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,479
according to Shang Yu's location.

35
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,639
What does his last message

36
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,800
mean?

37
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,160
No idea.

38
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,519
Miss,

39
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,800
excuse me.

40
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,160
Have you seen this man

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
today?

42
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,639
No.

43
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,079
Ask her about Gu Yancheng.

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,120
How about

45
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,199
this person?

46
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,199
Have you seen him?

47
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,040
Isn't this Wen?

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
He's a caring son.

49
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
- Wen?
- He visits his mom every week.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,680
His mom is here?

51
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,040
His mom has dementia.

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
She's in that room.

53
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:50,959
Thank you.

54
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,120
Thank you.

55
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,439
Who are you looking for?

56
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,560
This is the special care area.

57
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,639
You can't simply come in.

58
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm

59
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,800
Gu...

60
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,279
Wen's wife.

61
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,680
We came here to visit my mother-in-law.

62
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,040
Wen comes here every day.

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,000
He even cleans the room himself.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
The other elderly people envy her.

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,519
By the way,

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,199
I'm really grateful to you

67
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,120
for looking after my mother-in-law.

68
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,399
This is a small gift.

69
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,920
I'd like to speak with her privately.

70
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,160
No.

71
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,720
We can't accept this.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,480
How about this?

73
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,399
I'll let you talk.

74
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,240
I'll leave the room.

75
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
Thank you.

76
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,240
Thank you.

77
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,839
I can't believe

78
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,759
Gu Yancheng's birth mom is here.

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,160
I think

80
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,480
she is Zhou Lan.

81
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,839
(It's only this moment that I realize)

82
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,800
(we're never been close)

83
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,199
(to the secret
Gu Yancheng keeps buried deep.)

84
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,399
(Perhaps)

85
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,319
(it's hidden in this old woman.)

86
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,160
Zhou Lan,

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm Gu Yancheng's wife.

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
I'd like to chat with you.

89
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,160
Ma'am,

90
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,079
can you tell us

91
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,160
about your son,

92
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,279
Wen?

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,959
Wen?

94
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes.

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Wen.

96
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,000
Wen, don't be afraid.

97
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't be afraid.

98
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,319
I'll figure something out.

99
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
I have money.

100
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,160
I have money.

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,560
Ma'am.

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:19,920
Don't be afraid.

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,839
Don't be afraid, Wen.

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,399
Wen is all right.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,279
Ma'am,

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,480
don't be nervous.

107
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,839
My...

108
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,959
My son is missing.

109
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,120
My son is missing.

110
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
It's all right, ma'am.

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,319
- It's all right.
- My son is missing.

112
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,759
Ma'am,

113
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,959
Wen is safe now.

114
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,480
He's safe.

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,959
Ma'am.

116
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,600
Wen.

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,959
Wen.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,279
I think

119
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,439
we can't get any information

120
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,839
about Gu Yancheng from her.

121
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,759
But since Shang Yu
has tracked this place,

122
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,759
could he be in danger?

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,519
The people here said
they hadn't seen him.

124
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,720
He probably hasn't been here.

125
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,759
Perhaps he got held up by something.

126
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't scare yourself.

127
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
(Shang Yu: Let's have a meal together?)

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,320
(Are you free tonight?
Something came up. Talk to you later.)

129
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,399
You see.

130
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,000
I told you.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,879
He's fine.

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
Ruoyun,

133
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
since we're here,

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,839
let's look around

135
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,959
and see where Gu Yancheng

136
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,079
hid those gold bars.

137
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,279
Okay.

138
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,079
Ruoyun,

139
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,439
I found a phone.

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,439
It can't be turned on.

141
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,519
Is it broken or out of battery?

142
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,720
I'll borrow a charger.

143
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,839
We'll try it later.

144
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,839
Wen.

145
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,680
Wen.

146
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,759
Ma'am, it's all right.

147
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,720
Wen is all right.

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,240
Wen.

149
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,319
Don't worry.

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,199
Sit down

151
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,040
and rest.

152
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,839
It's all right.

153
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,160
Mister,

154
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,680
do you have

155
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
a charger for this port?

156
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,519
A moment.

157
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,759
Here you go.

158
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,839
Thank you.

159
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,639
I'll return it to you later.

160
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,399
I have money.

161
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,879
I have money.

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,839
I... I have money.

163
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,839
Bring money to get your son back.

164
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
Your son gambled and
got himself into a butt-load of debt.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,959
You won't see him again
if you're late.

166
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,160
Pay them the money!

167
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,600
If not, they'll beat me to a pulp!

168
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,600
Hurry.

169
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,839
Please spare me.

170
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,759
This...

171
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
It doesn't seem like a place in China.

172
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,360
Yeah.

173
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
So

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
this is the secret

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
Gu Yancheng has been hiding.

176
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
I know he has

177
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
some childhood trauma.

178
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,639
I thought

179
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,240
it was because his father punished him.

180
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,039
I didn't expect this

181
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,720
to be the real reason.

182
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,399
I've seen many cases like this.

183
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,159
Overseas scam organizations

184
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,080
film videos like this

185
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,559
to extort money
from the victim's families.

186
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,240
However, once they get the money,

187
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,399
they raise their demands.

188
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,159
I guess

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,679
they didn't let Gu Yancheng go

190
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,159
after receiving the money.

191
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,720
That's why his mom

192
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
ended up like this.

193
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,480
This explains why

194
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,440
those people do anything to get money.

195
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,799
Please let me speak to my son.

196
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,799
I beg you, don't hurt him.

197
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,039
Please.

198
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,840
I'll give you whatever you want.

199
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:39,679
No.

200
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,039
Beat him.

201
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,559
No!

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,200
Beat him to death!

203
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,480
Please.

204
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,840
Stop beating him.

205
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,919
Please.

206
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,639
Wen.

207
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,600
Where are you, Wen?

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,639
Tell me.

209
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,240
Where are you?

210
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,799
Stop.

211
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Get up.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,559
I have money.

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,120
I have money.

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,399
Bring money to get your son back.

215
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,519
Your son gambled and
got himself into a butt-load of debt.

216
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,759
You won't see him again
if you're late.

217
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,600
Mom,

218
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,679
pay them the money!

219
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,639
If not, they'll beat me to a pulp!

220
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
Wen.

221
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,279
Kevin,

222
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
please spare me.

223
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,960
I have money.

224
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,559
I'll go back to get the money.

225
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,440
All right?

226
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,480
I'll give you the money.

227
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,679
I'll give you the money now.

228
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,759
When will you

229
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,360
let my son come back?

230
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,559
I like it when you pay up the debt.

231
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,879
But your son

232
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,279
still owes three million.

233
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,840
We'll send him back

234
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
when he pays it off.

235
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,360
Three million?

236
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,399
She's a poor woman.

237
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,039
All she cares about is her son,

238
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,440
but she ended up like this.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
He hides his gold here.

240
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,600
No way.

241
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,440
Wen,

242
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,840
after you left,

243
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
two young women came

244
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,200
to visit Mrs. Zhou.

245
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
One of them is called Wen Ruoyun.

246
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,159
She claims to be your wife.

247
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,039
They've been inside for a long time.

248
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:36,879
I'm a bit worried.

249
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,759
I'll be right there.

250
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,279
Excuse me,

251
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,679
is Zhou Lan's fee

252
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,799
settled annually?

253
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,039
I'll pay off

254
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,720
her lifelong expenses here.

255
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,320
By the way,

256
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,279
could you please

257
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,399
get her a better mattress?

258
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,840
Just deduct the cost from the card.

259
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,799
Wen is lucky

260
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,919
to have a good wife like you.

261
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,120
Come visit more often.

262
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,120
What's it?

263
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,440
I called Shang Yu,

264
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
but he didn't answer.

265
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm worried about him.

266
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,720
That guy is smart.

267
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
He'll be all right.

268
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,279
I'm afraid Gu Yancheng
will probably find out soon.

269
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,600
We have to go now.

270
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,120
This is quite a fruitful trip,

271
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,159
but I think we need

272
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,360
to go to that dorm.

273
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,120
Okay.

274
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:54,879
Where's the gold?

275
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,759
Where is my gold?

276
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,960
Mom,

277
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,840
where's my gold?

278
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,679
Don't be afraid, Wen.

279
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,399
Don't be afraid, Wen.

280
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
I have money.

281
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,360
I'll get you out of there.

282
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,240
Lin Jiayi.

283
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,279
Wen Ruoyun.

284
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,200
Why is this phone here?

285
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,519
Where's the SIM card?

286
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,799
Where's it?

287
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,679
Gosh.

288
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm dead.

289
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,679
I'm so dead.

290
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,320
I'll save you, my son.

291
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,600
Didn't you say everything is settled?

292
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
How come they found my mom?

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,759
My cover is blown.

294
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,960
You know?

295
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,360
Even Shang Yu

296
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,879
is involved now.

297
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,120
If so, Wen Ruoyun

298
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,200
must've known

299
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,919
that we had transferred her properties.

300
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
There's no need to wait anymore.

301
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,919
The company's listing

302
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,440
is a lie

303
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
she used to distract us.

304
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,000
What should we do now?

305
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,440
What now?

306
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,320
I've already...

307
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,600
Your mom

308
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,279
has dementia.

309
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,320
She's just enjoyed a few years
of good life, hasn't she?

310
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,399
Don't hurt her!

311
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm sorry, Ms. Yi.

312
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,279
I'm sorry, Ms. Yi.

313
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,679
I beg of you.

314
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,360
Please don't hurt her.

315
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,200
Please.

316
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
Ms. Yu, please don't hurt her, okay?

317
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll try to make it up.

318
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,360
Ms. Yi.

319
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,399
Ms. Yi.

320
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,799
Wen Ruoyun,

321
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,279
it's all your fault.

322
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
If you had followed my script

323
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,960
and stayed in the psychiatric hospital,

324
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,080
maybe I could've kept you safe.

325
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,159
Women who are too clever

326
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,000
only bring themselves to harm.

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,080
You've been listening in all this time.

328
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,279
Lin Jiayi.

329
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,399
Wen Ruoyun.

330
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,679
