=Episode 6=

3
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,430
You...

4
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,909
Mr. Gu,

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,909
I'm Su Xun.

6
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,270
You look tired.

7
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:08,710
Do you need my help?

8
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,990
Can you?

9
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,469
Of course.

10
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:24,190
Easing the employer's worries

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,910
is part of my job.

12
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,869
Lie down.

13
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,150
You're good at this.

14
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,910
By the way,

15
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,469
I heard you came from Yucheng.

16
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,710
Yes, Mr. Gu.

17
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,270
Have you been there before?

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,669
Of course.

19
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:07,019
I had a girlfriend

20
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,859
who owned a beauty salon.

21
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,309
She came from Yucheng as well.

22
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,029
She was

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,270
very gentle

24
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,069
and clever.

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,899
We were deeply in love

26
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,110
with each other.

27
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,309
Then why did you break up?

28
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,954
She passed away.

29
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,950
Save my baby.

30
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,950
I can never forget her name.

31
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,589
It was

32
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,349
Lin Jiayi.

33
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,230
Why did you stop?

34
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,390
You're not her.

35
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,510
Why are you nervous?

36
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,189
Mr. Gu,

37
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:09,110
you're an affectionate man.

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,589
I just wonder

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,309
whether she'd appreciate that

40
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,029
if she were alive.

41
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,309
I wanted to ask you

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,869
about the scar on your leg.

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,110
What happened?

44
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,749
It was about a jerk.

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,510
Not worth mentioning.

46
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,419
People say women

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,058
are like a secret garden.

48
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,098
(What are you doing?)

49
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,950
Beautiful yet not easy to explore.

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,189
I prefer

51
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,069
honest women.

52
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,710
Su Xun.

53
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,029
Dear.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,670
Ms. Wen.

55
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,629
Go upstairs first.

56
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,110
I have something to talk to her.

57
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,069
I'll wait for you in the room.

58
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,830
Su Xun,

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,349
I've treated you like family

60
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,189
because Ms. Wang recommended you.

61
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,150
However,

62
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,229
you've overstepped the boundary.

63
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,029
Are you referring

64
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,349
to those photos I sent you?

65
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:25,619
I was just reporting what I saw

66
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,270
to my employer.

67
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,710
You've done your job well

68
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,830
as a butler.

69
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,019
However,

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,338
whatever you hear

71
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,070
or see in this house,

72
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,349
it's not up to you to decide.

73
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,630
You're interesting.

74
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,510
You're eager to know

75
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,229
what I've seen

76
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,310
but don't dare to ask.

77
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,469
Do your job well.

78
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,429
Strong curiosity won't do you any good.

79
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,070
Also,

80
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,150
I don't like your dress.

81
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,789
Change it.

82
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,630
Mom is coming over later.

83
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:53,750
Mom?

84
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,139
Su Xun,

85
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,589
why are you up there?

86
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,950
Ms. Wen,

87
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,619
the light tube up here is dusty.

88
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,630
I'm cleaning it.

89
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,870
I see.

90
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,109
Be careful.

91
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,070
I will.

92
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,870
Mom,

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,029
you are here.

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,750
(And now, you appeared.)

95
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,510
Mom,

96
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,109
why did you suddenly come over?

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,109
I was so excited

98
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:45,939
when I heard you were pregnant.

99
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,909
I couldn't wait to come here
to take care of you.

100
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,469
You have to be careful.

101
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,019
When I heard

102
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,059
you were pregnant.

103
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,298
I couldn't wait to come here
to take care of you.

104
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,950
You're pregnant now.

105
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,390
Don't always be busy with your work.

106
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,070
You need to rest enough.

107
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,349
Thank you, Mom.

108
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,819
But there's more work

109
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,190
I need to do.

110
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,150
Ruoyun,

111
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,029
if you're too busy,

112
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,469
let Yancheng help out.

113
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,229
You're already married.

114
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,830
You should support each other

115
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,029
for the family.

116
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,029
I wish I could protect this family

117
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,630
with Yancheng.

118
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:27,059
However,

119
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,098
there are more obstacles

120
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,750
than I imagined.

121
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,429
Yancheng,

122
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,738
did you upset Ruoyun?

123
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:35,589
I didn't.

124
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:37,029
Jeez.

125
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,710
Ruoyun

126
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,939
needs extra care now.

127
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,579
No one

128
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,270
should upset her.

129
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:44,978
Mom,

130
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:45,909
all right.

131
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,178
I won't

132
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:49,190
make her angry anymore.

133
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,870
Rest assured.

134
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,259
Having obstacles in marriage life

135
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,390
is inevitable.

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,658
I know

137
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,379
women may have struggles

138
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,630
they can't express in marriage.

139
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,778
For the sake of the baby,

140
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,349
you need to secure this family.

141
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:07,870
To Yancheng,

142
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,778
you're the most important.

143
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,950
Of course.

144
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,109
But Mom,

145
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,630
there's something

146
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,310
I can't pretend it didn't happen.

147
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,750
Both you and Yancheng

148
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:23,229
chose each other to be family.

149
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,338
I always treat you

150
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,310
like my own daughter.

151
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,139
I worry that you keep
those upsetting things

152
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,510
to yourself.

153
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:31,750
You see,

154
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,590
your parents are gone.

155
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,470
I'm really worried about you.

156
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,270
Ms. Wen, you're so blessed.

157
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:45,578
Having an understanding
mother-in-law like you,

158
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:46,829
people might think

159
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,669
you're her birth mother.

160
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,230
Who is she?

161
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,789
She's Su Xun,

162
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,909
the new butler recommended by Ms. Wang.

163
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,150
Mrs. Gu,

164
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,069
it has been a long time.

165
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,069
Did we meet before?

166
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,390
Nice to meet you.

167
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,658
Why did Ms. Wang

168
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,309
introduce a young girl to you?

169
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,339
I'll find you a new one

170
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,230
another day.

171
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,709
There's no need, Mom.

172
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,150
Ms. Wang has watched me grow up.

173
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:24,470
I believe in the person she recommended.

174
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,829
Our family

175
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,938
is like

176
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:31,709
a small boat sailing on the sea.

177
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,990
We're bound to encounter ups and downs.

178
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,178
No matter what,

179
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,949
we're family.

180
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,099
You need to be watchful

181
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,069
if someone has ill intentions.

182
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,709
Mom is right.

183
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,429
Mom,

184
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,429
I know what you mean.

185
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:47,909
Good to hear that.

186
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:49,778
I came here

187
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:50,979
to bring you

188
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,259
these prenatal supplements.

189
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,110
Remember to take them every day.

190
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,510
Yancheng,

191
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,139
take these supplements to the kitchen.

192
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,150
Let me do it.

193
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:02,390
I'll do it.

194
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,139
(I doubt you would be so kind)

195
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,189
(to bring supplements to Wen Ruoyun.)

196
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,418
(I'd like to see)

197
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:22,990
(whether you dare to eat it.)

198
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,189
These are for Ruoyun.

199
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,949
I'm not eating.

200
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:46,750
Ruoyun,

201
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,150
eat it before you head to the office.

202
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,429
Mrs. Gu,

203
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,339
you delivered these supplements
early this morning.

204
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,499
It must be tired for you.

205
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,909
Please eat some.

206
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,859
That's right, Mom.

207
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,990
You should eat more too.

208
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,789
I'm already old.

209
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,669
It's a waste for me to eat it.

210
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,390
Yancheng,

211
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,029
eat it.

212
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,230
Thank you, Mom.

213
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,510
Su Xun,

214
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,709
go buy some groceries later.

215
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,110
All right.

216
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,058
Mom,

217
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,658
I need to leave now.

218
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,110
I might be late.

219
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,789
Finish this first.

220
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,189
Hurry and eat.

221
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,549
All right.

222
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,270
Yancheng, eat.

223
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:57,590
What did you add in there?

224
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,870
You don't need to know.

225
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,859
Your task

226
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,789
is to make sure she eats it every day.

227
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:03,789
After a month,

228
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,590
she'll be insane.

229
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,309
Is this your new plan?

230
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,029
Since she has changed the agreement,

231
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,549
we must make her crazy

232
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,578
and

233
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,270
then find a suitable chance

234
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,990
to butcher the pig.

235
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,390
Must we do this?

236
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,470
If you hadn't exposed yourself,

237
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,309
the pig wouldn't have awakened so soon.

238
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,429
Besides,

239
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,669
the butler must leave.

240
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,549
Find an excuse to fire her.

241
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,789
Don't let irrelevant people

242
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,470
complicate things.

243
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,029
What's wrong with me?

244
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,069
You suddenly fell asleep just now.

245
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,510
I was worried something had happened,

246
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,230
so I came here to check on you.

247
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,979
What's wrong?

248
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,069
Not feeling well?

249
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,150
Do you want to go to the hospital?

250
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,189
I'm good.

251
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,110
Just a bit dizzy

252
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,270
and sleepy.

253
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,789
You're pregnant now.

254
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,549
Your safety comes first.

255
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,669
Tell me if you need anything.

256
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:34,669
I'll take care of it.

257
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,510
