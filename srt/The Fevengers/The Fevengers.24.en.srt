3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,779
Wen,

4
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,190
don't be afraid.

5
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,510
Wen.

6
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,830
Mom!

7
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,030
Mom.

8
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:54,470
Mom.

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,269
Mom.

10
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,349
Mom.

11
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,030
Ma'am.

12
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,230
Ma'am.

13
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,378
Gu Yancheng.

14
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,509
He's here.

15
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,149
He's still breathing.

16
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:00,619
Jiayi.

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,258
Go to hell!

18
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,018
Jiayi.

19
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:02,579
Jiayi.

20
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,419
No, Jiayi.

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,590
You'll kill him.

22
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,110
Gu Yancheng.

23
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,990
Meng Yu,

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,098
I should really send you

25
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,430
and your blood-stained money to hell.

26
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,669
Gu Yancheng,

27
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,550
where is Shang Yu?

28
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,629
Tell me.

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,258
We've already called the police.

30
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,909
Now that you and Li Hui
have ended up like this,

31
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,899
you should tell us Shang Yu's whereabouts

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,829
to plead for clemency.

33
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,698
Fine,

34
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,789
I'll tell you.

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,590
He's buried right under me.

36
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,590
Shang Yu.

37
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,870
Shang Yu!

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,509
Shang Yu!

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,270
You scum.

40
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,990
Shang Yu.

41
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,990
Die!

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,990
Bury me.

43
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,430
Please bury this person

44
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,310
who's so evil and corrupted to the core.

45
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,990
Shang Yu.

46
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,858
Shang Yu, you promised

47
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,190
you would stay with me

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,059
and protect me.

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,870
Ruoyun.

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,229
I've decided

51
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,150
to leave the U.S.

52
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,750
I'll come back to help you.

53
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,899
We're getting married.

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,459
You must come to my wedding.

55
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,229
I really want your blessing.

56
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,270
Sure.

57
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,339
As for now,

58
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,750
all you need to do

59
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,150
is stay home and rest.

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,258
Leave the investigation

61
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,418
to me.

62
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,698
Don't risk your own safety.

63
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,389
It's been years since you've drawn.

64
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,629
Why did you suddenly draw

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,229
a pig head?

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,389
I'm drawing you.

67
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,829
That's so rude.

68
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,179
Remember, Ruoyun,

69
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,349
to me,

70
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,459
you're the only one

71
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,550
I'll never see as a stranger.

72
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,349
Shang Yu!

73
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,870
Gu Yancheng, I hate you!

74
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,190
I was just trying to survive.

75
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,219
Shang Yu.

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,750
It doesn't matter anymore.

77
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,430
Bury me.

78
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,110
Wen.

79
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,619
Wen.

80
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,299
Ma'am.

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,619
Ma'am.

82
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,698
Wen.

83
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,218
Ma'am.

84
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,910
Wen.

85
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,829
Wen.

86
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:31,458
Ruoyun,

87
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:32,829
are you all right?

88
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,469
It's all right now.

89
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,750
Yi,

90
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,949
I've finally avenged you.

91
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,190
Shang Yu.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,389
Ruoyun,

93
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,910
everything is over.

94
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,190
The only thing we can do

95
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,389
is clear our minds

96
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,709
and carry on well.

97
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,790
Shang Yu.

98
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,350
Shang Yu.

99
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,230
Shang Yu

100
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,709
sent me a message.

101
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,810
(Good night. WAN)

102
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,550
WAN.

103
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,709
I don't know what that means.

104
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,790
I thought about it.

105
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,990
Based on our habit with pinyin,

106
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,990
perhaps he was trying to say,

107
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,750
"I love you",
[*As in "Wo Ai Ni"]

108
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,750
but he couldn't finish it.

109
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,310
There, there.

110
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,029
Everything will be fine.

111
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,069
Jiayi,

112
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,149
I'm so grateful to have you.

113
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,069
After everything ends,

114
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,350
what do you plan to do?

115
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,870
I've thought it over.

116
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,939
Wen Xin and I

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,269
will reopen her sister's noodle house.

118
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,458
We've even got it a name.

119
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,629
Jinlan Noodle House.

120
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,230
It means sworn sisters.

121
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,069
Very good.

122
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,299
(After Wen Ruoyun and the rest
called the police,)

123
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,779
(they arrived and arrested
Gu Yancheng, Ms. Yi, and their gang.)

124
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,330
(Following Gu's clues, the fraud organization
was seized within a few days.)

125
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,550
Have you been waiting for long?

126
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,790
No.

127
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,670
Your vanilla latte.

128
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,230
You remember my favorite flavor.

129
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,469
Yan Fei,

130
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,469
to be honest,

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,419
when I first found out

132
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,509
about you and Gu Yancheng,

133
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,190
I really hated you.

134
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,979
But later, when I learned

135
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,430
the whole truth,

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,829
I looked back

137
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,338
on everything

138
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,190
we went through together,

139
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,430
our first loves

140
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,229
and those college days.

141
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,338
You used to be the first person

142
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,790
I shared everything important with.

143
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,949
I know we can't control people

144
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,390
who are trying

145
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,310
to scam us.

146
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:51,949
Life is life.

147
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,510
It's filled with ups and downs.

148
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,270
Ruoyun,

149
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:00,989
I really care about you.

150
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,059
When I saw you and Gu Yancheng

151
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,390
together,

152
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,270
do you know what I was thinking
at that moment?

153
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:12,179
My friendship is gone.

154
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,539
My love is gone.

155
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,390
You all betray me.

156
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,109
I was jealous of you.

157
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,390
I was jealous of everything you had.

158
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,779
I thought they were all supposed

159
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,390
to be mine.

160
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,630
But I'd never thought

161
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:28,899
of hurting you

162
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,709
and your child, really.

163
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,869
I understand.

164
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,310
I know.

165
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,869
I know it's too late

166
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,190
to say this now.

167
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,670
I don't deserve your kindness.

168
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,949
I'll turn myself in.

169
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,030
Yan Fei,

170
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,510
I'll wait for you to come back.

171
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,790
Ruoyun,

172
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,069
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,550
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,270
I'm sorry, Ruoyun.

175
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,469
There, there.

176
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,390
Yi,

177
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,069
I made it.

178
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,338
That guy

179
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,869
and those scammers

180
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,069
have already been arrested.

181
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,109
There won't

182
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,430
be any more girls

183
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,989
falling victim.

184
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,270
You can rest in peace now.

185
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,430
And I need to go.

186
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,579
(Wen Ruoyun's unauthorized installation
of a tracking system was illegal.)

187
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,419
(Lin Jiayi and Wen Xin's unauthorized
installation of listening devices was illegal.)

188
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,299
(Lin Jiayi's fight with He, which caused
the latter to die from falling,)

189
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,934
(was deemed self-defense,
so no legal action will be taken.)

190
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,619
(Yan Fei's theft of employee information
was sentenced to three years.)

191
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,179
(Gu Yancheng and the fraud organization
were sentenced to life,)

192
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,139
(to confiscation of property,
and to be deprived of political rights for life.)

193
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,059
(Wen Ruoyun was misdiagnosed
due to the consumption of hallucinogens.)

194
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,119
(The testing personnel were

(Xiacheng Detention House)

196
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,810
(Three years later)

197
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,218
Hi,

198
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,259
please join us in this romance scam
awareness event.

199
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,069
No, thanks.

200
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,659
Hi.

201
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,390
I've got it.

202
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:14,939
Hi,

203
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,419
please check out
our anti-fraud awareness seminar.

204
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:16,818
Thank you.

205
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,379
Please don't break up with me.

206
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:18,978
Hi,

207
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:19,539
please take a look at this.

208
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,069
I'll get the money.

209
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,978
Are you going to tell her

210
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:34,738
that it's easy to get loans,

211
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,338
that you'll succeed in no time,

212
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,539
or that the investment you recommended

213
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,299
guarantees profits

214
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,829
and that you will marry her soon?

215
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,709
He's a liar.

216
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,069
Have you heard about
the pig-butchering scam?

217
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,550
If not,

218
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,458
welcome to our seminar.

219
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,210
(Anti-Fraud Public Welfare Seminar)

220
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,229
Online social platforms

221
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,630
have become places where love happens.

222
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,379
However, this vast social market

223
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,379
has also bred

224
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,589
numerous romance scams.

225
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,749
Pig-butchering scams

226
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,738
occur when victims

227
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,150
are seeking care.

228
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,338
They provide us

229
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,978
with high emotional support

230
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,190
and companionship.

231
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:22,670
And so,

232
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:24,338
it's easier for them

233
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,630
to control us emotionally.

234
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,698
When victims

235
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:28,738
raise doubts

236
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,539
about investments

237
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,858
or anything involving monetary matters,

238
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,139
those scammers

239
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,818
coerce or entice them

240
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:36,698
into making impulsive decisions

241
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:37,858
like investment.

242
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,390
As a result,

243
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,738
victims lose

244
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,498
both love and money.

245
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,379
So when you encounter
situations like this,

246
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,030
you have to believe

247
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,858
that those who truly care about you

248
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,630
would encourage you to work hard
for your money.

249
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,349
Only scammers

250
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,630
coax you into making money overnight.

251
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,910
We ourselves have experienced
pig-butchering scams.

252
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:58,910
We know too well how painful it is

253
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,589
when the knife falls.

254
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,709
During those dark times,

255
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,989
we endured

256
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,310
all those grievances alone.

257
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,869
Our efforts were ignored,

258
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,349
our endurance misunderstood,

259
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,779
our sincerity despised,

260
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,709
and our contributions wasted.

261
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,749
Even so, we must believe

262
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,419
those dark times

263
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,949
will eventually pass.

264
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,419
No victims

265
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,989
should confine themselves.

266
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,589
We should strive

267
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,709
to cross this dark mire

268
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,310
and rebound from the rock bottom

269
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,150
