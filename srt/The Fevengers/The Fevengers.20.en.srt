=Episode 20=

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,000
If you don't trust me,

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,920
let's stop contacting each other.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,479
I don't want to be someone

6
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,280
who doubts me.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,200
(I didn't want to lose him,)

8
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,880
(so I did what he said)

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,560
(and took out an online loan
for the investment.)

10
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,560
(But after I transferred him the money,)

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,200
(he disappeared.)

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,239
(I couldn't reach out to him.)

13
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,560
(He blocked me)

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,000
(on social media.)

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,599
Don't think you're safe
to hide inside silently.

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,480
Pay up now.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,040
Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

18
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,000
Open the door!

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,159
Open the door!

20
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,640
You owe me two hundred thousand

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
and pretend nothing happened?

22
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,920
I know

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,359
who your sister is.

24
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,280
Believe it or not,

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
I'll sell you to Thailand.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,719
Open the door!

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,359
Open up!

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Now!

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,319
(I borrowed so much money,)

30
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,400
(and the debt collector
came to my house.)

31
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,560
(I'm sorry, Xin.)

32
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,439
(I'm too ashamed to carry on.)

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,319
So

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,800
the man who deceived your sister

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,360
was Gu Yancheng.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,639
At first,

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,639
I didn't know who that guy was.

38
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,919
I tried many ways to investigate,

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
but all I could find

40
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,319
was his IP address in Southeast Asia.

41
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,199
Perhaps

42
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,639
my sister's soul was helping me.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
I accidentally heard his voice

44
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,840
in a video

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,400
about what he said to my sister.

46
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,439
He's hot.

47
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,560
What does he do?

48
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,000
You shouldn't work so hard for money.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,080
It should be

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,960
the other way around.

51
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,919
The investment market
is promising now.

52
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,680
I know you've worked very hard
for money,

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,240
that's why I suggested
you invest in crypto with me.

54
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,599
Yi,

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,199
don't worry.

56
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,280
I will get revenge for you.

57
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm Wen Xin.

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm here to apply
for the assistant position.

59
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,960
Wen Xin?

60
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,719
You may want to

61
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,159
look at this.

62
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,199
When you went to Taocheng,

63
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,879
I visited every woman

64
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,000
on this list.

65
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,719
I discovered

66
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,120
they all shared one thing in common.

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,199
They had bought sofas from Gu Yancheng.

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,879
It's Xiaoman.

69
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,800
(Shen Xiaoman is worth one million.)
Previously,

70
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,439
I found

71
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,879
Wen Jewelry Employee Information

72
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,720
in his office.

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,079
At first, I couldn't figure out
what it was for,

74
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,279
but when I visited Shen Xiaoman's family

75
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,600
and learned

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,399
of her death,

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
everything started falling into place.

78
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,079
It turns out

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,720
(Wen Ruoyun is worth three billion!)
that he's selecting potential piggies

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,680
to send to the overseas gang.

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,680
Overseas?

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,519
To think that what we experienced

83
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,240
isn't merely a marriage scam

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
but a well-planned and massive scam

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,639
from a professional
overseas organization.

86
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,519
To them,

87
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,319
we are piggies to the slaughter.

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
So Xiaoman

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
didn't just disappear.

90
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,839
It was all because of me.

91
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,279
I've indirectly caused their deaths.

92
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,519
It's all because I trusted Gu Yancheng
so easily

93
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,959
and married him,

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,079
giving him the chance

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,319
to leech off of me.

96
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,800
The girls at the company

97
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
and Xiaoman...

98
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,000
It's all my fault.

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
No, Ruoyun.

100
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,079
Gu Yancheng is the one to blame.

101
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,240
It has nothing to do with you.

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,920
Exactly.

103
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,879
Gu Yancheng and his gang
should take the blame.

104
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,240
They used our feelings for them

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,120
to fool us.

106
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,399
Don't worry about me.

107
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm fine.

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,639
But I

109
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,480
realized one thing.

110
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,000
What is it?

111
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
There may be more girls

112
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,519
like Xiaoman

113
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,120
who might be falling victim

114
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,839
to romance scams.

115
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,240
I have to go back

116
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,600
to collect more evidence

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,759
of his crime

118
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,360
and bring them to justice.

119
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,199
No.

120
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,439
We and Gu Yancheng

121
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,759
have already discovered
each other's identities.

122
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,319
It's too dangerous if you go back now.

123
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,959
That's right, Ruoyun.

124
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,519
There must be other ways.

125
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,399
I must find a way

126
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,160
to go back to him.

127
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,000
If not...

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
If not, those girls...

129
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,959
They could've lived a good life.

130
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,639
But...

131
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,680
Jiayi,

132
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,319
Wen Xin.

133
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,560
Stop trying to convince me.

134
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,839
I've made up my mind.

135
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,079
All right.

136
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,759
I'll support you, then.

137
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,000
You must make sure

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
of your own safety.

139
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,439
Ruoyun,

140
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
I installed

141
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,759
an app

142
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,199
to listen in real time.

143
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,639
Test it now.

144
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,360
Gu Yancheng,

145
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,079
just you wait.

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,399
From now on,

147
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,839
both of us will take turns to monitor

148
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,439
and protect you.

149
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,319
If anything happens,

150
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,560
we'll be there immediately.

151
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,879
Contact me

152
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,879
once Shang Yu has returned.

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,000
All right.

154
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,439
He is dead.

155
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,720
Lin Jiayi and Wen Ruoyun

156
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
took my money.

157
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
My identity is exposed.

158
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,920
The entire plan is falling through.

159
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
This is the final one.

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,039
Don't run.

161
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,639
Don't run.

162
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,960
You're not Gu Yancheng's mother.

163
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,440
Now tell me.

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,519
Who are you?

165
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,559
I...

166
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm just an actress

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Gu Yancheng hired.

168
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,360
I didn't do

169
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,639
any of this.

170
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,960
I didn't know

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,279
he would do that.

172
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,240
What did he do?

173
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,519
Tell him.

174
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,360
What did he do?

175
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,399
Gu Yancheng!

176
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,759
Gu Yancheng!

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
You can't die just like this.

178
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,720
It's not fair if you die.

179
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Dear,

180
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,799
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,879
I couldn't stop them

182
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,399
from hurting you.

183
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,720
I know

184
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
I've done so many wrong things.

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,360
Dear.

186
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,919
Dear,

187
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,440
even if you die now,

188
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
it won't help.

189
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,799
Dear,

190
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,360
I don't know...

191
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,320
I don't know what to do to protect you.

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,559
I can only use this way

193
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,600
to escape their control.

194
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,799
Stop saying.

195
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,960
I beg of you.

196
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,000
Stay alive.

197
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,320
Let me...

198
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Let me help you up.

199
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,759
(Hold on.)

200
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
(The cut is shallow.）

201
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,240
(How could it possibly)

202
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,799
(cause so much bleeding in the tub?)

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,639
(Gu Yancheng,)

204
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,600
(it's your trick again.)

205
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,200
Dear,

206
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,120
will you forgive me?

207
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,200
Gu Yancheng,

208
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,919
what actually are you trying to hide?

209
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,799
We're married.

210
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,440
We should bear everything

211
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,759
together.

212
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,279
I'll tell you everything.

213
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,399
Dear,

214
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,639
thank you for not leaving me.

215
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,120
I've made up my mind.

216
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,080
For you

217
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,240
and our child,

218
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,759
I'll turn over a new leaf.

219
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,519
Here's my plan.

220
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,120
Once our child is born,

221
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,600
I'll turn myself in.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,879
Ruoyun,

223
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,919
please give me one more chance.

224
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,360
One last chance.

225
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,240
I don't want to lose you either.

226
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,759
I'll do everything in my power

227
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,519
to help you through this hardship.

228
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
But you have to tell me

229
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,440
the whole truth.

230
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,679
At first, it was just a small loss.

231
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,399
Kevin,

232
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,799
could you lend me a bit more?

233
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,799
If I win,

234
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,080
I'll pay you back with interest.

235
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Sure.

236
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,840
Three percent per month.

237
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,759
How much do you want?

238
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,559
I can lend you the money.

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,919
Never mind,

240
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,960
three percent is too high.

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,919
I should get going.

242
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,799
That won't do.

243
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,639
Kevin.

244
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,360
Kevin.

245
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
Since you've already asked for my help,

246
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,360
I must do you this favor.

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm not taking your money.

248
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,559
Kevin.

249
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,519
Continue.

250
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,840
Later, I realized

251
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,799
the whole thing was a setup.

252
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,720
So,

253
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,799
as planned,

254
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,960
I lost all the money I borrowed.

255
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,840
I couldn't pay it back...

256
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,240
I couldn't pay it back,
so they locked me up

257
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,440
in the water dungeon and tortured me.

258
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,679
They even filmed a video

259
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,159
to blackmail my mom.

260
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,120
Stop beating me.

261
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,840
Beat him.

262
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,519
Stop beating me.

263
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,399
Please.

264
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,480
Please.

265
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,279
Stop beating me.

266
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Stop.

267
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:17,919
Kevin.

268
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,480
I have money.

269
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,360
I have money.

270
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,039
Bring money to get your son back.

271
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,360
He gambled and got himself
into a butt-load of debt.

272
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,440
You won't see him again

273
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
if you're late.

274
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,279
This piggy's family

275
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,320
has no more money.

276
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,639
Sell him to the park.

277
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,240
Yes.

278
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:29,840
Kevin.

279
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,399
Kevin.

280
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,159
I have money.

281
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,440
I... I will pay you the money.

282
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,919
Kevin.

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,039
Kevin, I beg of you.

284
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,919
Kevin.

285
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,039
Kevin.

286
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,559
Hu Chuntao.

287
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,720
19 years old?

288
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,000
You're young.

289
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Can you use a computer?

290
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,240
Yes.

291
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
Take her to the telesales team.

292
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,639
Zhou Wen.

293
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,600
Introduce yourself.

294
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,159
My name is Zhou Wen.

295
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,200
I studied advertising design.

296
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm 19 years old.

297
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,919
My hometown

298
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,200
is Taocheng County.

299
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,960
Good-looking.

300
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,360
Take him to the model team.

301
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,240
Model team?

302
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,919
Wang Qiang.

303
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,840
From now on,

304
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,799
you'll be in charge
of the characters in these manuals.

305
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,600
Memorize everything.

306
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,840
I don't want to do anything

307
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,519
immoral.

308
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,799
But Ruoyun,

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,399
I had no choice.

310
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,080
I was trapped there.

311
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,960
If I didn't do what they said,

312
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,840
they would torture me.

313
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,320
But what you did later

314
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,840
wasn't forced by them.

315
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,120
Yes.

316
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,320
I've done many wrong things,

317
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,039
but I had no choice.

318
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,120
I was trapped there.

319
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:01,159
They brainwashed me

320
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,600
every single day,

321
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
and I finally lost myself.

322
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
It's their task for me

323
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,399
to approach you and Lin Jiayi.

324
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,120
I had no choice.

325
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,000
I really had no choice.

326
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm just a pawn,

327
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,799
a tool to make money for them.

328
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,039
I thought

329
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,000
to myself

330
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,000
that I would numb myself.

331
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,639
I stopped thinking.

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,679
I just did whatever they asked of me.

333
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,840
But I...

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
But I realized

335
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,639
