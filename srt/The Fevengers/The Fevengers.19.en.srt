3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,960
You've been listening in all this time.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,119
Lin Jiayi.

5
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,479
Wen Ruoyun.

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,799
You will pay for this.

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,479
Oh no!

8
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,679
This is bad.

9
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,359
This is the place where he used to stay.

10
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,680
Maybe we can find

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,000
some evidence we need here.

12
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,120
A photo album.

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,799
Jiayi,

14
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,799
I found this.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,280
I thought everything about him was fake,

16
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,760
but our birthdays

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,040
were on the same day.

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,879
How funny.

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,200
How unfortunate.

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,140
(Taocheng High School, Class of 2010
Graduation Group Photo)

21
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,840
Zhou Wen?

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
His real name is Zhou Wen.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,840
He's a local,

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,360
but he always pretends
to be a foreigner.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,319
American Chinese?

26
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,719
Thai Chinese? Hmph.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,439
Advertising design academy.

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,479
No wonder

29
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,280
he always uses

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,960
the identity of artists.

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,319
Turns out

32
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,759
that's someone he wants to be.

33
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,759
Why didn't anyone tell us
this place was locked?

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
Get something to break it open.

35
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,240
It's too late to leave now.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,879
Let's hide.

37
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,960
Here.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,039
Come on.

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,960
If anything happens later,

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
I'll go out first.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
You hide here.

42
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,639
No.

43
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,000
Both of us will be all right.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,039
Shh.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
They're here.

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,039
Why is it you?

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Hurry.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
I can't explain it to you now.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,240
We must leave now.

50
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,879
Okay.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,039
Go after them.

52
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,039
Don't let her get away.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,159
Let's split.

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:12,919
Be careful.

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,479
I will.

56
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,319
Lin Jiayi,

57
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,160
you can't get away.

58
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,959
I got you cornered again.

59
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
You are like a bug

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
that just won't die.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Anyway, that won't happen again.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Today,

63
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,040
you're not going anywhere.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,519
He,

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,120
you are so loyal

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,319
to Gu Yancheng.

67
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,120
Don't you mention his name!

68
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,639
He's nothing but a twerp.

69
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,720
Exactly.

70
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,319
You do all the dirty jobs,

71
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,480
and he gets the benefits.

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
He treats you like a lackey.

73
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,319
I'm telling you,

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,879
I've gotten to where I am today

75
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,279
all on my own.

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,439
I won't let him ruin everything I have

77
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,079
over a dead woman.

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
As for who the lackey is,

79
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,079
too bad you won't get to see it.

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,720
You want money, don't you?

81
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll give you the money.

82
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,680
I can offer you more.

83
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,240
If you had handed over

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,040
your money sooner,

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,360
none of this would've happened.

86
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,839
But it's too late for that now.

87
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,720
Ms. Yi won't let you off.

88
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,160
If you don't die today,

89
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,639
I will.

90
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,000
At least tell me the reason
before I die!

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,600
Tell me the truth before I die.

92
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,600
Who is Ms. Yi?

93
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,360
What is your motive?

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,959
Lin Jiayi,

95
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,240
trying to trick me into telling you

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
when you're about to die?

97
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,160
You think I'm an idiot?

98
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,319
If you're told to die,

99
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,240
just say nothing and do it.

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
Spare me these tricks.

101
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
Scum,

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,959
you'll pay the price.

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Pay the price?

104
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,399
You deserve this.

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
You women

106
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,839
want a handsome and rich boyfriend,

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
but there are no such windfalls

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,360
in life.

109
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,639
You people

110
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,759
should know your place...

111
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,079
Ms. Yi,

112
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,279
He is dead.

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
He is dead.

114
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,000
As the matter stands,

115
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,959
make sure nothing goes wrong
on your end.

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
This is my good friend's place.

117
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,079
We've been discussing things here
all this time.

118
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,360
Have a seat.

119
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,959
Wen Xin,

120
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm curious.

121
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Why did you suddenly
show up in the nursing home?

122
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,240
You'll know after hearing this.

123
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,639
If you had followed my script

124
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,000
and stayed
in the psychiatric hospital,

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
maybe I could've kept you safe.

126
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,639
Women who are too clever

127
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,639
only bring themselves to harm.

128
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,680
Gu Yancheng and you...

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
Don't get the wrong idea, Ruoyun.

130
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,199
I have no relationship

131
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,279
with Gu Yancheng.

132
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,120
In that case,

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,759
when

134
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
did you

135
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,399
install the bug in my house?

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I installed one, too.

137
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,199
You...

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
Why did you...

139
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,959
Actually,

140
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,639
Jiayi and I met

141
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,040
half a year ago.

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
We've been secretly investigating
Gu Yancheng.

143
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
I worked at the gallery

144
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,199
as his assistant

145
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,480
was a plan

146
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
to approach him.

147
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,480
You actually had another trick
up your sleeve.

148
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,679
Of course.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,879
You were so obsessed with him

150
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,000
and wouldn't listen.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,960
If you suddenly switch sides,

152
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,000
my revenge plan

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,399
would go south.

154
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,679
Besides,

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
you should know

156
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,080
he's impossible to resist.

157
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,480
Wen Xin,

158
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,639
could you tell me

159
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,039
why you are doing this?

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,039
Or

161
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
are you also a victim
of Gu Yancheng's marriage scam?

162
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,159
I'm doing it for revenge.

163
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,960
Revenge?

164
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,039
Gu Yancheng

165
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,360
caused my sister's death.

166
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
My sister's name is Wen Yi.

167
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,279
Our parents passed away
when I was a kid.

168
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,039
My sister ran a noodle house

169
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,240
and raised me.

170
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,679
We relied on each other.

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,679
She was only six years older than me,

172
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,080
but she looked after me
as if she was a mother.

173
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,120
She worked her fingers to the bone.

174
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,320
Yi.

175
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,279
Yi.

176
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,200
You know what?

177
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,360
I got first place in
the track and field competition.

178
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,440
Really?

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
I must prepare a big feast for you.

180
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
Yi,

181
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
what has happened?

182
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,799
Why are you so happy?

183
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,720
Let me tell you a secret.

184
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,480
I am

185
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
in love with someone.

186
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,759
What?

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,240
I want to see

188
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
what kind of guy

189
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,159
is good enough for my sister.

190
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,720
When I heard she was seeing someone,

191
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
I was truly happy for her.

192
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,879
But I still had some worries.

193
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,679
What kind of guy was he?

194
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,799
Would he break my sister's heart?

195
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,919
Yi,

196
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,080
what's wrong?

197
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,679
As expected.

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
My worries soon came true.

199
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
I heard that the guy

200
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
wanted to break up with my sister.

201
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
I comforted her.

202
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,360
Breakup is nothing.

203
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,519
She'll meet someone better.

204
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,159
I thought she was just a bit down

205
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
and would move on soon.

206
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,720
Naturally,

207
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
I didn't notice something was wrong
with her.

208
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,600
Yi,

209
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm done eating.

210
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,720
Look at you.

211
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,120
You don't take good care of yourself.

212
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,240
Look at your messy hair.

213
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,759
I made

214
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,320
a lot of your favorite dishes.

215
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,519
They're all in the fridge.

216
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,799
Remember

217
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,559
to eat and sleep on time.

218
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,679
Don't stay up late,

219
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,720
okay?

220
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,360
Yi,

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,000
you're only six years older than me,

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,080
not sixty years.

223
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,639
You're nagging

224
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,120
like an old granny.

225
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,440
You and your eloquent mouth.

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,039
I don't have to worry

227
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,159
about anyone bullying you.

228
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm off to school now.

229
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,720
I later found out

230
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,480
that her state at that time

231
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
was already very bad.

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,080
I hate myself

233
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,360
for not showing her more care.

234
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,320
A long time

235
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
after my sister passed away,

236
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,559
I couldn't bear to throw away
the food in the fridge,

237
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,159
even though it had already spoiled.

238
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,080
Because I knew

239
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,279
it was the last thing

240
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,679
she left behind.

241
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,399
If I threw it away,

242
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,799
I would lose it forever.

243
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,799
Later,

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
when I was sorting out

245
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,840
my sister's belongings,

246
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,120
debt collectors came.

247
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,000
That was when I realized

248
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
my sister wasn't upset
because of that guy.

249
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,360
I found her diary

250
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,960
and

251
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,559
learned the whole story

252
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,759
of her relationship with him.

253
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,600
I found out

254
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,240
what she really went through.

255
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,799
(I met a highly educated)

256
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,399
(and handsome man.)

257
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,000
(We talked a lot,)

258
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,720
(and I found)

259
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,000
(that we were on the same wavelength)

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,919
(as if we were a perfect match.)

261
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,519
(Who are you from?)

262
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,759
(Do you work abroad?)

263
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,120
(The place looks amazing.)

264
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,279
(I can't believe such an excellent man)

265
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,360
(is pursuing me.)

266
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,720
(It makes me feel inferior and scared.)

267
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
(He told me)

268
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,960
(that sometimes)

269
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,320
(fate comes suddenly.)

270
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,360
(It's best not to miss out)

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
(on someone
who's very in sync with you.)

272
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,480
(Hence, I mustered my courage)

273
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,720
(to be with him.)

274
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,000
(He depicted the wonderful life)

275
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,799
(after we get married.)

276
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,320
(I feel)

277
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
(as if I'm enchanted with him.)

278
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,799
Dear,

279
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,000
I need another two hundred thousand

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,480
for the investment.

281
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,360
Why do you want me

282
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,080
to invest more money?

283
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Dear,

284
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,279
listen to me.

285
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,279
The investment market is promising now.

286
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,879
I know you've worked very hard
for money,

287
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,600
that's why I suggested

288
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
you invest in crypto with me.

289
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,039
You shouldn't

290
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,440
work so hard for money.

291
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,480
It should be the other way around.

292
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,639
I mean it.

293
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,960
If you invest in
another two hundred thousand,

294
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,759
you'll get one million in return.

295
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,320
But...

296
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,440
But I don't have that much.

297
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,519
The eight hundred thousand I gave you

298
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,399
is all my savings.

299
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,639
When are you

300
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,799
coming back to meet me?

301
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,759
I'm working on my project.

302
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,720
Once I finish this experimental project,

303
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
I'll come back to meet you.

304
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,159
I'll take you to meet my mom.

305
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's have our wedding at the beach

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,639
like you said.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,759
But right now, you have to listen to me.

308
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,039
Try to get another two hundred thousand.

309
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,080
If you can't find any money,

310
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,240
you can take out an online loan.

311
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,320
Online loan?

312
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
No way.

313
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
If the investment goes wrong,

314
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,159
where am I supposed to find
this two hundred thousand?

315
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,320
I won't let you lose money.

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
If you don't trust me,

317
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,039
let's stop contacting each other.

318
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,759
I don't want to be someone

319
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,559
who doubts me.

320
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,799
So

321
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,360
the man who deceived your sister

322
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
