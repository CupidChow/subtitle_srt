(Piggies List)

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,799
(Wen Jewelry Employees Information?)

5
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,840
They are not

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,480
merely simple romance scammers.

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,439
They are professional
pig-butchering scammers

8
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,879
from an overseas gang.

9
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,040
Dear,

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
I've got all the property deeds ready.

11
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,719
Here you go.

12
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,560
Thank you.

13
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,319
(Gu Yancheng,)

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,959
(this is only the first step.)

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,079
I've got my three hundred million back.

16
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,400
Well done.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,400
This is a wonderful day.

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Should we have a feast

19
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,400
to celebrate it?

20
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,680
I'll prepare it.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,319
Neither of you will prepare it.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
One of you just healed
from the face wounds,

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,319
and the other one

24
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,560
is carrying a baby.

25
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,879
You both just wait here.

26
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,799
I'll go and prepare a meal.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Everything is served. Come on.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,719
Come, Ruoyun.

29
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,280
Take a seat.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,599
Hurry.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,400
Try it

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
and see if it suits your taste.

33
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,319
Thank you.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,080
Come.

35
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,120
Let's have a toast.

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,159
Sure.

37
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,520
To

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,759
pain from the past.

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
To the hard-earned new life.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Then, I'll toast

41
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,560
to our happy future.

42
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Cheers.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,919
It tastes exactly like
Ms. Wang's cooking.

44
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,639
I know, right?

45
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,919
Don't worry.
You can eat everything here.

46
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,520
I didn't add much chili to it.

47
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,960
It's suitable for pregnant women.

48
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,280
So all the dishes here
are Ruoyun's favorite.

49
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,080
Lawyer Shang,

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
that's not fair.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Eat more,

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,199
talk less.

53
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,960
Be good.

54
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,599
By the way,

55
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,360
can I keep those property deeds

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
in your place?

57
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,520
Will it be a trouble for you?

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,439
No,

59
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,560
it isn't.

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,479
Remember, Ruoyun.

61
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,680
You are

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
the only one

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
I won't treat as a stranger.

64
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,879
Thank you.

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
I'll put this away.

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,000
You guys eat first.

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,919
If it weren't for this money,

68
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,719
Gu Yancheng and I

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
wouldn't have been where we are now.

70
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,280
Stop being sentimental.

71
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,199
If you hadn't had this money,

72
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,680
you wouldn't even have met him
in the first place.

73
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,360
Money isn't the problem,

74
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,039
it's his greed.

75
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,520
By that logic,

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
what's the point of marriage?

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,960
It's pointless.

78
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,560
I told you before.

79
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,280
The so-called love

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
or marriage

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,360
is merely a fig leave

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,520
for those to cover up

83
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,759
their dirty stories.

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,080
I disagree.

85
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,680
Generally speaking,

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,120
marriage

87
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,800
creates a constant labor force

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
and a stable social structure

89
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,560
for society.

90
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,719
The Marriage Law never required

91
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,599
people to marry for love.

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
It's just that people themselves think

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
that marriage is
the destination of love.

94
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,839
But, in fact, the nature of marriage

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,759
is resource integration.

96
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,600
Marrying the wrong person
or not marrying anyone

97
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,040
isn't the point.

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
Economic is.

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
Well said.

100
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
Touche.

101
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,000
But... But that's not how I feel.

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
I still think

103
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,040
that if I love someone,

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
I want to marry her.

105
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,800
I believe the two people

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,879
will have to go through

107
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,519
a simple and mundane life

108
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,680
till they grow old.

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
Back to the matter.

110
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,600
Gu Yancheng

111
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,639
still holds

112
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,639
30 million worth of jewelry,

113
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,800
which he cashed out.

114
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
Based on what I know of him,

115
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,879
he loves money.

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,600
He'll probably hide

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
those gold bars

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,439
in a place he thinks is safe.

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,040
Now that you mention it,

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,959
something strikes me.

121
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,199
Once, I went to his gallery,

122
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,759
but he wasn't there.

123
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,920
Ruoyun,

124
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,639
Mr. Gu went to Taocheng
for some business.

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,920
He won't be back until this afternoon.

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,000
Taocheng?

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
There's a regular client

128
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,160
who orders a sofa every week.

129
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,399
Mr. Gu

130
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,959
personally delivers it.

131
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,519
What client is that?

132
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,120
Could I have a look?

133
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,319
He goes to Taocheng

134
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,560
every week

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
to deliver the sofa

136
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,680
to someone called Zhou Lan.

137
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,480
But the day is uncertain.

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,439
Leave it to me.

139
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
You two shouldn't get involved.

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,519
It's not convenient.

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,879
No.

142
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,199
We must find a way

143
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,959
to make Gu Yancheng go
to his secret stash.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,040
I have an idea.

145
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,480
An eye for an eye.

146
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,959
I've talked to Ms. Yi.

147
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,120
From today on,

148
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,399
the piggies under your charge

149
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,639
will be transferred to other teams.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why?

151
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,879
Why am I being punished?

152
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,639
Shen Xiaoman chose to kill herself.

153
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,079
I didn't know she'd really do that.

154
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,199
I warned you earlier.

155
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,279
Shen Xiaoman is
Wen Ruoyun's assistant.

156
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,600
Now that you've caused her death,

157
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,439
if Wen Ruoyun notices anything,

158
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,920
we'll lose everything.

159
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,759
We? As if.

160
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not like your hands are clean.

161
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,959
Many of your piggies died, too.

162
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm telling you,

163
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,240
if I hadn't worked so hard
to hit the target,

164
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,160
they wouldn't have even noticed me.

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
What's the point of doing well?

166
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,360
We are all just pawns.

167
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,040
Don't say such things to me.

168
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,399
Yes,

169
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,759
you're now living
a comfortable life now.

170
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,279
But what about me?

171
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,160
Do you really think

172
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,839
you're that glamorous Gu Yancheng?

173
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,079
Listen,

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,480
I saw what you were like

175
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,839
with your tails between your legs,
like a dog.

176
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,839
But have you ever thought about this?

177
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,399
Whenever we make a slight mistake,

178
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,399
we will be beaten up like a dog.

179
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,399
I don't care.

180
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,680
What do you think
I've endured so much for?

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
I want money.

182
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,680
A lot of money.

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
In today's world,

184
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,279
money

185
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,519
is everything.

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Who are you to ruin my life

187
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
when you've made money?

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,279
Listen, Wen,

189
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,439
ruining one's livelihood
is like killing one's parents.

190
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
He,

191
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,439
you're not just after money,

192
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,240
you've also hurt lives.

193
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
Do you want to put yours at stake, too?

194
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,839
I have to be cruel

195
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,920
to stand on my own feet.

196
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
Those women deserve it.

197
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,639
They are vain

198
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,399
and greedy.

199
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,920
That's why they end up like this.

200
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,639
It was you who taught me

201
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,920
to put on an act, to lie,

202
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
and to toy with women.

203
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,120
Mark my words.

204
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,120
One day,

205
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,519
I will surpass you

206
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,920
and kick you down.

207
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,240
Fine.

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,759
I see now.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm just wasting my breath.

210
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,959
But be warned,

211
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,879
don't make any mistakes again.

212
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,399
Otherwise, I won't let you off.

213
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,040
Fine.

214
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,199
We will see.

215
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,600
How much cash do we have now?

216
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,399
These

217
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,000
are last month's profits.

218
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,399
Mr. Gu, where are you going?

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
I'm going home.

220
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,559
After tonight,

221
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,399
do you think you'll have a home
to go back to?

222
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,360
Mr. Gu,

223
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,960
should I call the police?

224
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,799
What for?

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,279
We are

226
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,279
Mr. Gu's good friends.

227
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,440
Wen Xin,

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
you can get off work now.

229
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,919
Li.

230
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,159
You act like a gentleman
in front of young girls.

231
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,240
You guys should learn from him.

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,080
Mr. Gu

233
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,200
always carries himself like a gentleman.

234
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,360
Li,

235
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,039
it's not even midnight yet.

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,320
You came so early.

237
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,519
That's not the way it should be.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Your account is empty.

239
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,440
How are you going to pay up?

240
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,799
I'll figure something out.

241
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,919
Then, do it now!

242
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
If you can't pay tonight,

243
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,200
we won't mind

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,679
talking to your rich wife

245
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,559
to ask for the money.

246
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,759
We'll tell her that you mortgaged
her properties.

247
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,200
Li,

248
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
you can't tell her.

249
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,799
Tomorrow.

250
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,559
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

251
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:48,960
Tomorrow.

252
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,679
Tomorrow?

253
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,720
Tomorrow. I see.

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Tomorrow.

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,919
Li.

256
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,679
Li.

257
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,679
I'll pay tomorrow.

258
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,320
Li.

259
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,720
The loan sharks came

260
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,840
and beat Gu Yancheng to a pulp.

261
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,759
All right.

262
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,600
Got it.

263
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,840
Gu Yancheng got beaten up.

264
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,399
What a shame.

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
I wish I could see

266
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,799
how he begs on his knees.

267
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,399
Very good,

268
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,200
Wen Ruoyun.

269
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,039
Your kindness has finally grown teeth.

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
Next,

271
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,360
you just have to bite the prey down

272
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,679
and watch them struggle.

273
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,360
I told you to transfer me five million.

274
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,320
Why didn't you?

275
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,559
I reviewed the whole situation today.

276
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,559
This mess was started

277
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,399
because

278
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,039
you couldn't

279
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,279
control your own desires.

280
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,360
You need to fill the gap yourself.

281
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Let me tell you.

282
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,799
If the ship sinks, all of us die.

283
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Only you

284
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,039
will die.

285
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,279
She's frigging ruthless.

286
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,320
I'm going to Taocheng tomorrow.

287
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,919
Dear,

288
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,159
why didn't you turn on the lights?

289
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,639
Don't turn them on.

290
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,120
Dear,

291
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,440
what happened to your face?

292
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,279
I'm good.

293
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,519
A regular client

294
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,080
wasn't satisfied with the sofa,

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
so they sent someone
to make a scene.

296
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm going to Taocheng tomorrow

297
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,000
for this matter.

298
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,360
Dear,

299
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,879
how about this?

300
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,879
You can shut down the gallery.

301
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,279
I'll provide for you.

302
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,320
Dear,

303
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,440
thank you.

304
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,519
Let me get you some ointment.

305
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,840
Does it hurt?

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,120
Never mind.

307
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,559
I'll be gentle.

308
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,720
Dear.

309
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,639
I'll do it gently.

310
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,799
Gently.

311
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,519
(Gu Yancheng,)

312
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,399

a thousand times stronger.)

313
