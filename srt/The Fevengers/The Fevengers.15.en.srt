3
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,240
Luckily, here's the leftover.

4
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,240
Dear.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Dear,

6
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm in the bathroom.

7
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,400
(Is she really hiding something?)

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,359
(I knew she wouldn't
figure anything out.)

9
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,280
(It seems)

10
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,159
(Lin Jiayi was right.)

11
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,680
(They've started destroying evidence.)

12
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,520
(I feel so dizzy.)

13
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,240
Have you found

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,199
the drug?

15
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,159
She didn't hide anything.

16
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,159
Are those from the psychiatric hospital

17
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,240
coming tomorrow?

18
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,759
Everything is set up.

19
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,199
It's been some days

20
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,000
since her mental instability started.

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
That should be enough to send her there.

22
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,240
Even if she discovers

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,199
that her assets
have been transferred later,

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
once she's in the psychiatric hospital,

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
she won't be able
to get out of there alive.

26
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,240
(Gu Yancheng,)

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
(you and your mom)

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,319
(are so ruthless.)

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,919
Dear,

30
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,560
why are you up so early?

31
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Didn't we agree

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,159
to rest for a few more days?

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
Everyone in the company
has been working on a project lately.

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,560
I need to be there.

35
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,919
Dear,

36
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,240
you keep saying
the company has been busy.

37
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,159
But I feel like

38
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,919
you're avoiding me.

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Didn't we make everything clear?

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,240
Is there anything troubling you?

41
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,360
Don't overthink.

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
It's getting late.

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,879
I should get going.

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
Don't strain yourself too much.

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,439
Her reaction yesterday

46
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,680
was a bit odd.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,439
Has she noticed anything?

48
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,079
Don't worry.

49
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,120
Everything is under control.

50
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,759
Your pregnancy is starting to show.

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,519
You need to be careful.

52
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,920
They may use dirty tricks

53
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,000
against your baby.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,839
I won't give them a chance.

55
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,560
You need to stay calm,

56
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,800
especially at a time like this.

57
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,040
Seize the opportunity

58
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,600
and hit the bullseye.

59
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,660
(Changfeng Archery Range)

60
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,560
Jiayi,

61
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm going for a prenatal checkup later.

62
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,959
Please help me

63
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
get this examined.

64
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,839
I want to find out what's inside it.

65
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,600
I guess they're planning

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,959
to send me

67
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,399
to a psychiatric hospital

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
to take over my guardianship

69
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,000
once I lose my legal capacity.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
That way, they could control my assets

71
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,240
for a proper reason.

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,879
I've noticed something's off

73
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,000
from the beginning.

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,040
Jiayi,

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,920
I thought I had no one I could trust.

76
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,319
Thank you.

77
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,279
You're welcome.

78
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,120
After all, we are now

79
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,439
allies.

80
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,480
Are you done practicing?

81
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,920
Why are you here?

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,399
I found some information
about Gu Yancheng.

83
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,360
He's not

84
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,759
a Chinese Taichi artist from overseas
he claimed to be.

85
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,480
Every sofa in his gallery

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
is a rip-off

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,399
of a Chinese artist from overseas,
Andy Leo's work.

88
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,480
Even his identity is fake.

89
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,240
I also

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
found out

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,879
that he's illegally mortgaged
all the properties

92
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,000
under your name,

93
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,560
which are worth three hundred million.

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,680
Gu Yancheng,

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,199
you're capable of anything.

96
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,240
What are you going to do next?

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
I want to reclaim all my assets.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,279
As for the rest,

99
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,160
we'll deal with it after the checkup.

100
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,560
I'll go with you.

101
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
What role do you have to go with her?

102
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,160
She can't go alone.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Someone has to be with her.

104
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,959
Right.

105
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,199
I'm free.

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go with you,

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,720
all right?

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,519
Fine.

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,480
If so,

110
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Wen Ruoyun,

111
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,480
who

112
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,920
will you choose?

113
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,480
Well,

114
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,079
let's go get changed and head out.

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go.

116
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,439
Ruoyun.

117
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,279
I used to stay here

118
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,680
for a long time.

119
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,560
There are some old friends

120
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,759
I would like to catch up with.

121
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,360
Shang Yu will go with you.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I'll contact you later.

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,560
Okay.

124
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,120
Nurse Zhou,

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
it's been a long time.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
Hi, Ms. Wen.

127
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,560
Please come with me.

128
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,160
The baby's father is joining us, right?

129
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,639
He...

130
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,319
He's my friend.

131
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,560
He's not the father.

132
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,040
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,800
Please come this way.

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,839
How was it?

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
The fetus is in good condition.

136
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,600
Great.

137
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,560
My baby is considerate.

138
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,000
It must be hoping

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
that I can focus on what I need  to do
without concerns.

140
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,839
Well,

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
what you need to do now

142
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,319
is rest at home
and take care of yourself.

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,000
Leave the investigation

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,680
to me.

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
Don't risk your safety.

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm struggling with,

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
in my current condition,

148
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,480
whether I should step forward
and resist them.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,039
I feel like

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,840
my baby is giving me strength.

151
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,519
I hope my baby

152
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,320
will be born into a world

153
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,759
without deception

154
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,679
or lies.

155
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,120
I will protect it well.

156
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
You lied.

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
You barely reply to my texts.

158
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,720
We fought more often.

159
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,679
Whenever I call you,

160
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,320
you always ask me for money
to help with your losses.

161
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
Was everything you said

162
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
all fake?

163
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
I have no money now,

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,759
and you want to break up with me.

165
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,960
What am I to you?

166
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,440
Xiaoman,

167
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,440
stop being childish.

168
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,759
There are no such rules

169
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,720
that one can date only one person.

170
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,960
We're not meant for each other.

171
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,440
If we break up early,

172
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,120
we won't end things badly.

173
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,200
Lies!

174
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,039
A pack of lies!

175
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,440
I was so blind

176
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,759
to have trusted you.

177
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,200
I see you as my whole world.

178
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,519
I see you as the only one in my life.

179
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,919
But to you,

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm nothing but prey.

181
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,120
I've treated you wholeheartedly,

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,559
yet I'm just one of the fish
in your pond.

183
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,200
You took my money

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,399
and my body

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,559
and wanted to kick me out

186
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,799
once I served no value.

187
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,399
Finally, I see through you today.

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,919
You're an ungrateful

189
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,200
and heartless jerk!

190
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,480
You are a liar

191
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,519
who plays love games.

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,799
I'm a liar?

193
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,440
You're vain.

194
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Would you have dated me

195
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,519
if I hadn't come from a rich family?

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,039
I made you happy,

197
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,440
and you made me happy as well.

198
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
What more do you want?

199
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,960
Scoundrel!

200
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,679
Do you think it's fun

201
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,960
to watch me heartbroken

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
and devastated?

203
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,240
Listen, He.

204
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,360
You do not trample on my dignity

205
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,799
as you like!

206
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,600
Xiaoman,

207
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
you've talked a lot.

208
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
You must be thirsty.

209
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,039
If you want to die,

210
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,360
go ahead.

211
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,480
Stop barking at me.

212
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,159
The mortgaged funds have come in.

213
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,919
How are you planning to thank me?

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,919
Wasn't the gift from last time enough?

215
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,960
When you come to the gallery,

216
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
let's have some time together.

217
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,159
Sure.

218
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,159
I'll be waiting.

219
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,159
Wen Ruoyun,

220
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,639
don't blame me.

221
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,360
This is the best ending

222
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,759
for you.

223
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,480
Ms. Yi.

224
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,120
She's back.

225
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,679
All right.

226
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,279
(Psychiatric Hospital)

227
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,919
(They're indeed desperate.)

228
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,440
(It seems)

229
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,080
(you're going to hunt me today.)

230
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,600
Dear,

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,919
you're home.

232
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I was about

233
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,360
to head over to pick you up
from the office.

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,919
You don't have to do that.

235
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,120
Oh, right.

236
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,480
I saw a psychiatric hospital van

237
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,480
outside.

238
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,519
Is something going on
in the neighborhood?

239
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,639
I'm not sure either.

240
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,559
Perhaps they came here

241
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,600
to pick up patients.

242
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:01,919
Dear,

243
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,960
you've been working all day.

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Come and get some rest.

245
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
I'll warm up the supplements for you.

246
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
You can have it later.

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,879
Nurse Zhou,

248
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
how did the test go?

249
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,559
This is the test report.

250
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
Take a look.

251
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,820
(Testing results)

252
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,799
It contains

253
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,080
hallucinogens?

254
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,559
Exactly.

255
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,519
The sample you gave me

256
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,080
tested positive for the same substance

257
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
as the hallucinogenic drug.

258
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,440
As expected.

259
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,320
This is a controlled psychoactive drug.

260
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,279
Consuming it in large doses over time

261
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,840
is like taking poison.

262
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,559
All right.

263
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,519
I see.

264
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,360
Thank you.

265
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,879
I need to be somewhere else.

266
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,559
I should get going.

267
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,440
Thank you so much.

268
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,279
Ruoyun,

269
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,240
don't eat the supplement.

270
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,039
It contains hallucinogens.

271
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,600
You'll lose your mind
if you keep eating it.

272
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Get out of the place now.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
(If I'm not wrong,)

274
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,919
(this van)

275
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,000
(is here for me.)

276
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:52,960
(No.)

277
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,159
(I mustn't give them this chance.)

278
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,440
Dear,

279
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,039
you haven't been sleeping well
lately, have you?

280
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,039
Here.

281
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,919
Eat it while it's warm.

282
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,960
Come on.

283
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,559
