3
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,549
(Why aren't you picking up?)

4
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,578
Mister,

5
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,859
take me to the location.

6
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,258
Okay.

7
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,350
Artistic Sofa Gallery on Haibin Road.

8
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:17,604
I can't...

9
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:20,819
I mustn't

10
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,491
be defeated just like this...

11
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,910
Open the door!

12
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,150
Jiayi!

13
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,179
Jiayi!

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,869
The spare key is in the shoe cabinet.

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,899
Jiayi!

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,299
Jiayi.

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,109
Jiayi.

18
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:57,698
Hurry.

19
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,299
Let's get out of here.

20
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,350
Let me help you.

21
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,349
Lin Jiayi,

22
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,670
hang in there.

23
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:15,818
I mustn't let them know

24
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:16,909
I've escaped.

25
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,189
Them?

26
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,909
I didn't expect

27
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,338
Gu Yancheng's accomplices

28
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,629
to come to my house to kill me.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,299
I'll take you to the hospital.

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,270
No.

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,469
It's too dangerous to go anywhere now.

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,550
I know a place we can go.

33
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:37,749
Who's it?

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,349
I need your help.

35
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:41,058
Come in first.

36
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,110
Quick.

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,869
Be careful.

38
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:48,378
Jiayi,

39
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,259
he's Shang Yu.

40
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,259
I trust him very much.

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,179
Please rest assured.

42
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,670
Now isn't the time for this.

43
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,869
What's going on now?

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,510
I can't explain it to you right now.

45
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,019
She's Lin Jiayi.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,778
I need you

47
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,349
to shelter her for a while.

48
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,270
Okay.

49
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:03,110
I'll go get the first-aid kit.

50
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,629
Sorry,

51
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,699
I didn't know Gu Yancheng

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,550
could be so dreadful.

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,749
I'll report them to the police

54
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:16,419
and bring Gu Yancheng

55
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,739
and everyone who's harmed you

56
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,990
to justice.

57
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,098
They destroyed

58
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,189
all the evidence I collected.

59
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,259
If we don't have enough proof,

60
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,909
we'll only alert them.

61
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,830
Does it hurt?

62
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,710
No.

63
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,909
I've endured

64
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,510
worse pain.

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,270
You were right.

66
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,830
My marriage with Gu Yancheng

67
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,299
is nothing

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,589
but his scheme.

69
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,259
The pig head

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,139
I keep dreaming of these days

71
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,498
is actually him,

72
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,830
trying to worsen my condition.

73
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,069
You've discovered this.

74
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,150
You're not so hopeless.

75
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,029
What should I do?

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,139
I suspect

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,110
he's already transferred my assets.

78
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,778
He switched out

79
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:10,270
all my valuable jewelry pieces.

80
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:11,909
I know about that money.

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,139
He cashed out 30 million

82
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,658
from your jewelry

83
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,778
to silence me

84
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,298
and keep me

85
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,070
from investigating further.

86
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:20,830
No wonder he has that recording.

87
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:22,669
If you don't believe me, listen to this.

88
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,259
Do you really think I'd be satisfied
with merely 30 million?

89
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,298
What I want

90
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,989
is everything you have.

91
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,978
He even tampered with my phone.

92
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,469
He blocked your number.

93
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,789
Speaking of recordings,

94
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,029
I have a clip of a conversation
between him and his mother.

95
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,619
You need to hear it.

96
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,029
I want to know everything
about Gu Yancheng

97
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,870
as detailed as possible.

98
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,830
Here are two flight tickets

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,469
to Phuket Island, Thailand.

100
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,819
Once you arrive there,

101
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,190
find a way to make her ill.

102
00:04:58,859 --> 00:04:59,899
Any accidents

103
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,298
that happen in that place

104
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,150
won't raise any suspicion.

105
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,950
Afterward,

106
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,750
come back here,

107
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,109
and tie up loose ends.

108
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,750
So you hit me with a car that day

109
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,029
to save me?

110
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,349
Don't worry.

111
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,830
I'll gather all the evidence.

112
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,589
How do you need me to help?

113
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,139
Act as usual

114
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,229
in front of Gu Yancheng.

115
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,070
I can't expose myself yet,

116
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,699
so I need someone who can move around

117
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,589
without raising his suspicion.

118
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,338
Uh...

119
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,270
Do you want the egg cooked
or a bit raw?

120
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,589
Stop listening in on us.

121
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,819
When the time is right,

122
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,589
I'll tell you everything.

123
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,190
All right, then.

124
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,298
Just let me know

125
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,549
if you need any help.

126
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,630
I do need your help now.

127
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,029
I need you to check

128
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,390
the status of all the assets
under my name

129
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,379
without letting Gu Yancheng find out
if possible.

130
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,150
Sure.

131
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,059
Leave it to me.

132
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,870
It won't take long.

133
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:11,858
All right.

134
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:12,989
I'll get out of your hair now.

135
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,150
You're still pregnant, you know.

136
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,469
It seems he

137
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,390
likes you.

138
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,699
Don't get us wrong.

139
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,338
Shang Yu and I

140
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,139
have been friends since we were kids.

141
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,989
We trust each other like family.

142
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,469
What's wrong?

143
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:38,909
Let's sit down.

144
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,029
Are you all right?

145
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,710
Feeling better?

146
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:49,619
Have you taken

147
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,789
any mental health medication lately?

148
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,750
Your symptoms seem a bit...

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,650
(Gu Yancheng)

150
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,010
(Gu Yancheng)

151
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,178
Yes?

152
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:06,738
Dear,

153
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:07,579
how are things in the office?

154
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,669
Should I come pick you up?

155
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:09,218
No need.

156
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,070
I...

157
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,150
I'm about to head home.

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,029
All right.

159
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,589
Drive safely.

160
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:19,778
When you get back,

161
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,379
you need to be careful

162
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,190
with the food Gu Yancheng gives you.

163
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,298
Once you notice something's wrong,

164
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,510
contact me immediately.

165
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,059
(Although I need you)

166
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,789
(to collect evidence
of Gu Yancheng's crime,)

167
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,390
(I don't hope anything bad
happens to you.)

168
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,150
(Do you understand?)

169
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:37,789
(Don't worry.)

170
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:38,819
(I will not allow)

171
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,658
(the slightest fear or cowardice)

172
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,909
(overcome me.)

173
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:57,070
Mom?

174
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,070
What brings you here?

175
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,429
Ruoyun,

176
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,899
you're pregnant.

177
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,669
How can you stay up all night to work?

178
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,270
Dear,

179
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,019
Mom worries I can't look after you well,

180
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,390
so she came.

181
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:13,338
Thank you for your concern, Mom.

182
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,909
Oh dear.

183
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,750
We're family.

184
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,630
Don't thank me.

185
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,109
Well,

186
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,338
I'm a bit tired.

187
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,710
I'm going upstairs to rest.

188
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,858
You didn't eat

189
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,589
the supplements I brought regularly,
did you?

190
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,510
Look at your poor complexion.

191
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,379
Come on,

192
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,709
eat this

193
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:33,870
before you go to sleep.

194
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,069
Yancheng.

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,709
But I...

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,818
I...

197
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,259
I'm too tired from work.

198
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,750
I don't want to eat it.

199
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,418
If you don't take care of your health,

200
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,818
how will the baby

201
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:46,949
grow strong?

202
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,429
Dear,

203
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,949
just listen to Mom.

204
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,139
Eat the supplement

205
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,990
before going to sleep.

206
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,510
I'll feed you.

207
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:54,230
Here.

208
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,139
(You and your fake smile.)

209
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,139
(I was so blind)

210
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,630
(to think of you
as a good mother-in-law.)

211
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,818
When you get back,

212
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,458
you need to be careful

213
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,150
with the food Gu Yancheng gives you.

214
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,259
Once you notice something's wrong,

215
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,309
contact me immediately.

216
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,099
(Is something wrong)

217
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,669
(with this?)

218
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,829
Didn't I tell you not to call me
for now?

219
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,709
What's wrong with you?

220
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,230
Why did you give such a childish gift?

221
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,818
Anyway, as long as it's your gift,

222
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,270
I like it.

223
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:49,630
Yan Fei,

224
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:51,150
what are you talking about?

225
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,069
I'm saying,

226
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,859
Love you. Love you. I love you.

227
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,538
Love you forever.

228
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,298
Love you. Love you. I love you.

229
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:00,058
Love you forever.

230
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,189
Love you. Love you. I love you.

231
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,058
Can you get rid of Wen Ruoyun

232
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,870
and marry me as soon as possible?

233
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,069
You're at it again.

234
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,669
You're at it again.

235
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,669
Why are you eating
instant noodles again?

236
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,990
You never take good care of yourself.

237
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,178
You're nagging

238
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,499
like an old granny.

239
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,578
All right.

240
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:25,990
I'll eat less of it.

241
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,270
Yi,

242
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,150
don't worry.

243
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,990
I'll take good care of myself.

244
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,510
Yi,

245
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:08,150
I'll avenge you very soon.

246
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,230
(Why is there a red ink stain
on my finger?)

247
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,859
(I've totally lost my consciousness.)

248
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,418
(It has to be something)

249
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,309
(in the supplement.)

250
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,909
Ruoyun.

251
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:19,019
Mom.

252
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,470
What are you doing?

253
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:23,578
Well...

254
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:24,058
Do...

255
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:24,818
Don't you think

256
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:25,778
the trash bin

257
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,150
smells bad?

258
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,069
Maybe we should take the rubbish out.

259
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,339
Don't worry

260
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,909
about such trivial chores.

261
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,739
You're carrying a baby now.

262
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,789
Stop coming

263
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,309
into the kitchen from now on.

264
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:38,698
All right.

265
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:39,949
Thank you, Mom.

266
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,390
Luckily, here's the leftover.

267
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,390
Dear.

268
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,379
Dear,

269
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,829
