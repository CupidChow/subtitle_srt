3
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:40,219
Xiaoman,

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,058
you want to see me?

5
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,179
Mr. Gu,

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,790
is it possible

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,869
to return the sofa
I bought here earlier?

8
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:47,629
Is there a problem

9
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,139
with the sofa?

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,030
No, it's not that.

11
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,258
I'm facing some problems,

12
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,269
and I need money.

13
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:53,938
Don't worry.

14
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,219
I've taken good care of the sofa.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,509
It's still in good condition.

16
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,470
Supposedly, I shouldn't agree to this,

17
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,189
but Ruoyun trusts you,

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,710
I'll make an exception for you.

19
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:04,739
Really?

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,978
Thank you so much.

21
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:06,579
I'll get someone

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,939
to pack it up and return it.

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,589
You can examine the sofa
before issuing the refund.

24
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:12,229
Thank you so much.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,790
You're welcome.

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,309
He,

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,019
don't push Shen Xiaoman too hard.

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,469
She's Wen Ruoyun's assistant.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,459
Don't you mess up my plan.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,309
I mess up your plan?

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,070
It's been quite some time
since you made any progress.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,299
Are you still holding onto it?

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,830
Is your plan going south soon?

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,379
You're not as amazing
as they said.

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,229
Let me tell you this,

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,299
I took only a month

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,669
to win over that assistant.

38
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,698
The mission Ms. Yi assigned you
is merely elementary.

39
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:47,179
Challenge me

40
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,430
when you're on my level.

41
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,589
Don't get fresh with me.

42
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,389
Let's talk about

43
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,299
Lin Jiayi's death

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,550
you hid from Ms. Yi.

45
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,910
Wen,

46
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,229
you're getting bolder now.

47
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,790
I'll settle the score with you

48
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,309
regarding Lin Jiayi.

49
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,830
You don't get it, do you?

50
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,469
You took 30 million to pay off
her debt.

51
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,859
What do you think Ms. Yi will do

52
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,230
when she finds out?

53
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,990
What do you want?

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,550
That 30 million in your hand.

55
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,469
Fine, I'll give you the 30 million.

56
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,589
Give me the contact of the loan shark
Lin Jiayi borrowed from.

57
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,789
Sure.

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,589
You finally came.

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,029
I've been waiting for you.

60
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,749
Come on in.

61
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,110
Don't be afraid.

62
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,110
None of these can hurt you.

63
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,430
You approached me,

64
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,019
lured me to this place,

65
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,338
resorted to all means and ways

66
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,139
to provoke

67
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,309
and challenge me.

68
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,098
Are you really that desperate

69
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,670
to ruin my marriage?

70
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,869
Calm down.

71
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,270
Lin Jiayi,

72
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,550
how long have you been
watching us?

73
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,230
Why don't you ask me

74
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,830
when I met Gu Yancheng?

75
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,629
A year ago,

76
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,909
I didn't look like this,

77
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,270
and he wasn't Gu Yancheng.

78
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,230
He was Meng Yu,

79
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,349
an investor in cosmetic equipment.

80
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,789
It wasn't until later that I found that

81
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,789
everything about him

82
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,110
was tailored just for me.

83
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,469
We first met online,

84
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,909
and soon after we met in real life,
we fell in love.

85
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,498
He really knew women well.

86
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:06,938
He's funny, rich,

87
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,230
and attractive.

88
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,390
He made me believe

89
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,469
we were the destined pair.

90
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,990
A match made in heaven.

91
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,549
A destined pair.

92
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,750
Later,

93
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,390
I got pregnant.

94
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,190
He promised to marry me

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,510
and asked me to invest 30 million

96
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,109
into his startup.

97
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,349
I did what he said.

98
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,019
I mortgaged my beauty salon

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,510
and gave him all the money I had
to support him.

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,259
Hello,

101
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,710
the number you've dialed
is out of service.

102
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,658
When the court froze

103
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,830
all my assets,

104
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,589
I realized I'd been scammed.

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,750
So

106
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,459
you're doing all this

107
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,510
to get revenge on Gu Yancheng?

108
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,710
What actually do you want?

109
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,059
If you're after money,

110
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,390
I'll compensate you.

111
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,630
Do you think

112
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,429
he took only my money?

113
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,858
I got these scars

114
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,270
thanks to him.

115
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,510
Do you still think

116
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,190
you're able to compensate me?

117
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,510
But your appearance was a lie
in the first place,

118
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,538
and now you're telling me

119
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,310
Gu Yancheng made everything up,

120
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,270
how am I supposed to believe you?

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,469
I know.

122
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,338
I know you won't believe in a stranger

123
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,549
pointing out
that your marriage is a scam.

124
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,710
That's why I let you experience it.

125
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,070
When the truth slowly uncovers,

126
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,059
you'll finally wake up

127
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,909
from the sweet lies

128
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,499
as the pain creeps into you

129
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,909
like it did to me before.

130
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,589
What you've said

131
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,989
is only your side of the story.

132
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,699
How do I know

133
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,909
you're not doing this

134
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,418
to get Gu Yancheng back...

135
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,789
I'll say it once more.

136
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,059
I don't want him back.

137
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,270
I want to destroy him!

138
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,589
Wen Ruoyun,

139
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:19,858
do you think the baby in your belly

140
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,190
is an accident?

141
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,899
No.

142
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,549
It's all part of his scheme.

143
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,819
He's using this way

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,819
to keep you under control,

145
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,899
so you listen to him.

146
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,390
Because we are the same.

147
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,218
We are alone,

148
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,059
without parents,

149
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,418
and have the fortunes they covet.

150
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,510
We're easy targets.

151
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,270
I don't believe you. This is impossible!

152
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,349
Even if what you just said is true,

153
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,589
but I won't believe this part.

154
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,778
Gu Yancheng

155
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,510
won't be so ruthless.

156
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,549
You don't believe me?

157
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:54,549
Take a guess.

158
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,738
When will he do to you

159
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,630
when he has drained you

160
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:02,630
of every last bit of value?

161
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,310
When I realized I'd been scammed,

162
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,190
I tried to find him.

163
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,218
Yet, his accomplice

164
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,338
created a car accident.

165
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,270
I almost died in the fire.

166
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,070
Mercifully,

167
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,830
I survived.

168
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,789
So,

169
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,830
was all of this

170
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,029
just a lie?

171
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:41,229
Does he have no feelings for me?

172
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,669
What's amazing about Gu Yancheng is

173
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,150
his convincing acting.

174
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,019
Once he sets a goal,

175
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,098
he will give his piggy love treats,

176
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,950
making them get lost
in the maze of love.

177
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,909
Wen Ruoyun,

178
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,390
even his love for you is fake.

179
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,270
What's left around you is real?

180
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,379
If you still don't believe me,

181
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,019
you can find out for yourself.

182
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,750
Mind you, my present

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,630
will be your future.

184
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,310
Open the door!

185
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,298
Open the door now!

186
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,510
Who's out there?

187
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:16,989
Open the door!

188
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,109
Why are they coming after you?

189
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,349
I borrowed some money.

190
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,178
Lin Jiayi,

191
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,710
it's no easy task to find you.

192
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,230
Li,

193
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,019
I have a guest here.

194
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,110
Can we talk about this

195
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,510
tomorrow?

196
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,818
Perfect timing.

197
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:38,669
I don't mind.

198
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,270
If you can't repay
the eight hundred thousand debt,

199
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,750
no one is leaving.

200
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,458
This is my business.

201
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:44,750
It has nothing to do with her.

202
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,870
I'll find a way

203
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,510
to pay you back.

204
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:48,829
Ruoyun,

205
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,789
leave now.

206
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,669
Eight hundred thousand, right?

207
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,110
Give me your account number.

208
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,270
I'll transfer the money to you.

209
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:10,870
Have you received the money?

210
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,390
Yes.

211
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:14,938
Lin Jiayi,

212
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:15,818
if you need money again,

213
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:17,069
come to me.

214
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,859
I'll give you a discount.

215
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,470
Let's go.

216
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,189
I'll pay you

217
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,189
the money back.

218
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:31,390
No need.

219
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,099
What you've told me today

220
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,189
is too bizarre.

221
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,219
Whatever grudges you had

222
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,669
with Gu Yancheng,

223
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,778
do not use me

224
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,470
as a pawn against him.

225
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,270
Besides,

226
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,270
I've decided to divorce him.

227
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,870
Stop bugging me.

228
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,990
(I once fearlessly run toward)

229
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,990
(the true love.)

230
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,259
(But now I feel)

231
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,510
(that the courage I had)

232
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,069
(seems rather silly.)

233
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,549
(Lin Jiayi was right.)

234
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,019
(I don't even have anyone)

235
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,189
(to talk to.)

236
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,029
(I used to think the love was real,)

237
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,510
(but now)

238
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,658
(the only real thing I have)

239
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,350
(is the pain I'm enduring)

240
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,870
(and lies.)

241
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,309
(Everything else)

242
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,510
(is all fake.)

243
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,709
What did you tell Wen Ruoyun?

244
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,789
What else could I say?

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,058
I told her everything

246
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,750
you did to me.

247
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,029
Why?

248
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:55,750
Afraid?

249
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,230
Lin Jiayi,

250
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,189
I have let you off so many times.

251
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,058
You didn't cherish them.

252
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,470
Since you want to go against me,

253
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,270
I won't hold back anymore.

254
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,150
Do you think I have any way out?

255
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:09,630
I'm telling you,

256
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,549
even if I die,

257
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,870
I'll take you down with me.

258
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,818
Listen,

259
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,379
Wen Ruoyun is missing now.

260
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,418
If anything happens to her,

261
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,510
you're one of the murderers.

262
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,990
You're the one who pushed her this far.

263
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,590
If anything happens to her,

264
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,309
you will die with her.

265
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,549
You're insane.

266
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,510
Gu Yancheng went out.

267
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,909
Should I go into his room now?

268
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,750
Do it now.

269
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,189
Wen Jewelry's employee's information?

270
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,309
Why did Gu Yancheng need this?

271
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,549
Hello,

272
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,029
the number you've dialed
is powered off.

273
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,470
What happened?

274
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,630
Gu Yancheng,

275
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,698
what has happened to Ruoyun?

276
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:43,829
Her phone is off.

277
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,390
Is she with you?

278
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,859
Stop calling my wife

279
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,470
as if you're very close to her.

280
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,150
Let her take the call.

281
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,470
She's not here.

282
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:52,870
I don't know where she is.

283
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,110
Ruoyun disappears?

284
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,429
Gu Yancheng,

285
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,230
what's with you?

286
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,429
Shang Yu,

287
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,909
stay out of my family business.

288
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,029
Gu Yancheng, you better be prepared.

289
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,270
You'd better pray for Ruoyun's safety.

290
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,549
Otherwise, I won't let you off easily.

291
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,230
Ruoyun.

292
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,909
Shang Yu,

293
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,150
aren't you already in the U.S.?

294
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,429
I heard

295
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,909
about your dad.

296
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,350
Cry if you need to.

297
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,150
It's fine to cry out loud.

298
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,029
I'm back.

299
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,390
This company

300
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,909
is my dad's life work.

301
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,909
I won't collapse so easily.

302
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,750
I have faith in you.

303
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,789
I've decided

304
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,590
to leave the U.S.

305
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,309
I'm coming back to help you.

306
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:13,549
But

307
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,379
you have better opportunities

308
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,470
and prospects there.

309
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:18,870
Don't stay here

310
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,818
for me.

311
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:20,630
Ms. Wen,

312
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,470
I've already got my resume ready.

313
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,110
You won't turn me away, will you?

314
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,510
Don't worry.

315
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,949
I'm back.

316
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,150
From now on, you'll have someone
to back you up.

317
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,669
I will protect you.

318
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,750
Thank you.

319
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,549
Ruoyun,

320
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,029
