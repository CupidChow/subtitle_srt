=Episode 4=

3
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,400
When did you get a new hairstyle?

4
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,400
This one?

5
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,359
I did it for your birthday.

6
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,840
Does it look good?

7
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,040
How about

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,040
we dye our hair together?

9
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,579
I've found out

10
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,120
the woman my husband is seeing.

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,120
Who?

12
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,680
Surprise and betrayal

13
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,120
always appear together.

14
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,919
It turns out that woman
has been around me.

15
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,519
Su Xun?

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,799
I knew she was up to no good.

17
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,498
You didn't believe me.

18
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,400
So,

19
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:33,799
how are you going to deal with her?

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,639
I haven't decided yet.

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,459
Tonight,

22
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,400
I need to go to a store in Yucheng.

23
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,659
I'm worried

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,120
about leaving them alone together.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,079
Don't worry.

26
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,680
I'll keep an eye on them.

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,778
I won't give that vixen

28
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,159
a chance.

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,600
By the way,

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,200
can I have your earphones?

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,799
I can use them when I drive.

32
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,439
Sure thing. A moment.

33
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:04,719
Come.

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,799
Here you go.

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,120
Thank you.

36
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,378
This is my husband's and my
birthday party.

37
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,058
What's with this fancy dress?

38
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,699
Because

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,079
I want to seduce your husband.

40
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,079
Dear,

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,239
why are you suddenly leaving
for a business trip?

42
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,240
Can't you get someone
to go in your place?

43
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,480
My dad taught me

44
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,419
to treat everyone

45
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,600
and everything

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,600
sincerely.

47
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,579
If I get someone to replace me,
then maybe one day

48
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,019
I should just find someone

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,200
to be your wife instead.

50
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,098
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,799
I'm worried about you.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,799
Oh, right.

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,818
How long

54
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,799
will you be away this time?

55
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,239
Tomorrow, if nothing goes wrong.

56
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,320
Call me if anything happens.

57
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,760
Drive safely.

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,919
All right.

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,399
(Yan Fei,)

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,399
(it's you.)

61
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,179
You left your lipstick stain
on my shirt.

62
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,359
What are you trying to do?

63
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,320
I just

64
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,519
want to leave my mark

65
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,440
on you.

66
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:07,919
Don't use petty tricks like this again.

67
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,280
It's not yet the time to show up.

68
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,079
You're so heartless.

69
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,119
If I tell Wen Ruoyun

70
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,519
about our affairs,

71
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,719
will you kill me?

72
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,599
You like excitement, don't you?

73
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,880
Isn't it exciting enough

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,479
to meet here?

75
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,519
Dear,

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,218
you...

77
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,760
Didn't you go on a business trip?

78
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:02,839
Why didn't you tell me

79
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,120
that you were coming back?

80
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,760
Get lost.

81
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,240
Ruoyun...

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,298
Why?

83
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,019
We have been friends for years.

84
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,839
You're my best friend.

85
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,499
Why did it have to be Gu Yancheng

86
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,760
of all men?

87
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,519
As long as you die,

88
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,658
I can be with Gu Yancheng.

89
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,479
You should die.

90
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,440
(Why?)

91
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:45,978
(Why)

92
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,418
(can't I even muster the courage)

93
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,320
(to confront them?)

94
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,399
(One is the man I love most.)

95
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,880
(The other one is
the friend I trusted most.)

96
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,440
(Why did you two)

97
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,159
(betray me?)

98
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,418
Without my permission,

99
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,200
do not come here.

100
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,279
Go back now.

101
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,800
Dear,

102
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,079
you...

103
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,839
Didn't you go on a business trip?

104
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,139
Why didn't you tell me

105
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,599
that you were coming back?

106
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,920
Dear,

107
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,479
are you all right?

108
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,218
(Gosh, I'm dead.)

109
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,560
(What now?)

110
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,639
Ruoyun!

111
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:58,039
Ruoyun.

112
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,719
Ruoyun.

113
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:00,560
Ruoyun.

114
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,959
She's breathing.

115
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,459
She...

116
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,639
Why is she back?

117
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,619
I don't know.

118
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,978
Let's help her up first.

119
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,719
What if she wakes up and sees us?

120
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:11,059
We should just do her in now.

121
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,978
What are you doing?

122
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,800
Finish her off now,
and there won't be any trouble.

123
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:15,440
You're insane.

124
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,778
If anything happens to her now,

125
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,519
I'll be the prime suspect.

126
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:21,240
Leave now.

127
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:22,800
I'll handle this.

128
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,039
Go.

129
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,479
Come on.

130
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,218
Dear.

131
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:39,939
Ruoyun.

132
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,738
Ruoyun.

133
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:41,760
Ruoyun, are you all right?

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,978
Don't scare me.

135
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,098
I'll send you to the hospital.

136
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:44,658
Dear.

137
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,680
What has happened?

138
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:46,619
Ms. Wen.

139
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,379
Ruoyan fainted.

140
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,778
Ms. Wen.

141
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,819
- I'm sending her to the hospital.
- All right.

142
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,039
Don't scare me, dear.

143
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,298
Doctor,

144
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:58,680
how's my wife's condition?

145
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,658
Ms. Wu's condition isn't serious.

146
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,459
But her HCG results

147
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,298
show that she's been pregnant
for five weeks.

148
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,519
Pregnant?

149
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,519
Yes.

150
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,200
However, the progesterone level is low.

151
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,218
You need to be

152
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,680
extra cautious.

153
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:14,959
All right.

154
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,778
Thank you, doctor.

155
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:16,699
Don't worry.

156
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,839
(Baby,)

157
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,819
(you shouldn't have come.)

158
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,178
(How should I choose?)

159
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,499
(After being betrayed
by my husband and best friend,)

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,699
(how am I going to pretend)

161
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,059
(nothing happened?)

162
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,000
Dear,

163
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:28,240
you're awake.

164
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,159
We're expecting a baby.

165
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:33,800
Dear,

166
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,219
didn't you go on a business trip
last night?

167
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,160
Why didn't you come back so suddenly?

168
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:40,959
I...

169
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,640
I wasn't feeling well last night,

170
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,879
so I went home.

171
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,619
When I opened the door,

172
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,339
I saw...

173
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,560
What did you see?

174
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,698
Did Yan Fei come

175
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,578
last night?

176
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:55,479
She was there.

177
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,280
She came to tell me
you were going on a business trip,

178
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,440
but she didn't know you already told me.

179
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,440
And?

180
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,280
And?

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,239
If you ask me,

182
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,079
she's really your good friend.

183
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,139
She was worried

184
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,079
something might go on

185
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,298
between me and the butler

186
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,219
while you were away,

187
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,879
so she came to keep an eye on me.

188
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,239
Did I

189
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,879
overthink?

190
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,640
Dear,

191
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,400
please have faith in me.

192
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,640
If you're not happy about this,

193
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,359
I'll keep my distance from her.

194
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,879
I know

195
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,959
I'm not a perfect man,

196
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,999
but I've always

197
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,578
wanted to be the one

198
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:51,560
who reaches deep into your heart

199
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,959
and truly loves you.

200
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,560
I want to protect you,

201
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,280
to stay with you forever,

202
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,759
and keep you out of harm's way.

203
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,119
Although

204
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,800
I can't say how much I love you,

205
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,440
I will prove it with my actions.

206
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,800
Stop overthinking.

207
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,359
(Was I really)

208
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,160
(overthinking?)

209
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,479
You're going to be a mother.

210
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,538
I'll protect it

211
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,680
and you well.

212
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,320
Sure.

213
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,839
Ruoyun,

214
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,160
how do you feel now?

215
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,800
Why did you come here?

216
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,778
Man said you were in the hospital,

217
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,280
so I came here.

218
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,119
I wasn't feeling well.

219
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,619
Please take care of things

220
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,640
in the company.

221
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,538
Don't worry about that.

222
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:56,379
I'll take care of it.

223
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,560
Rest well.

224
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,058
Someone can't look after you well.

225
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,719
You need to look after yourself.

226
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:03,959
All right?

227
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,578
Call me if you need anything.

228
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,599
Okay.

229
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,739
I still have work to do. I'm heading back.

230
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,640
Go ahead.

231
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,479
Lawyer Shang,

232
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,999
I know you and Ruoyun
are childhood friends,

233
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,800
but please keep your distance from her.

234
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,458
Ruoyun is pregnant now.

235
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,058
We're expecting a baby soon.

236
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:28,818
The three of us

237
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,200
will live happily together.

238
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,879
I give you my blessing.

239
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,879
But you'd better be nice to Ruoyun.

240
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,058
Otherwise,

241
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:37,818
Otherwise what?

242
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,200
You'll take care of her?

243
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,160
Lawyer Shang,

244
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,099
I advise you

245
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,879
not to disgrace yourself.

246
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:51,800
Fine.

247
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,680
What's wrong with you?

248
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,839
Everything is in control.

249
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,999
I'll handle it well.

250
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,640
I've found the thing
you asked for last time.

251
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,879
He will send it to you.

252
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,839
Got it.

253
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,800
(When did she start suspecting me?)

254
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,640
(I threw this away.)

255
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,920
(Why is it in Wen Ruojun's wardrobe?)

256
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,440
(No wonder she suddenly came back
last night.)

257
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,239
(This person)

258
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,800
(seems familiar though.)

259
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:29,920
She's clean.

260
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,759
Mr. Gu,

261
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,578
I've prepared some congee for Ms. Wen.

262
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,920
Please bring it to her
when you go to the hospital.

263
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,599
Sure.

264
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:03,640
By the way,

265
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,040
many things have been going on lately.

266
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,719
I didn't have a chance
to get to know you.

267
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,200
Ruoyun said

268
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,320
you're the niece Ms. Wang recommended.

269
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,280
Ms. Wang is my cousin.

270
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,739
My mother was quite old

271
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,200
when she had me.

272
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,359
Maybe I got it wrong.

273
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,680
But you look young.

274
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,959
Why did you choose to become a butler?

275
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,200
I studied nursing,

276
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,160
thinking I could take better care
of my parents

277
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,359
when they were old.

278
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:38,739
Well,

279
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,239
you're so thoughtful.

280
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,079
Is a young and beautiful girl like you

281
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:47,239
really want to be just a butler?

282
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,999
Every girl wants to succeed
in the quickest way.

283
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,560
But it depends on

284
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,359
whether he gives me this chance.

285
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,920
Mr. Gu.

286
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,920
