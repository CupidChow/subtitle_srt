3
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,990
This is the true side of married life,

4
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,949
resenting your partner

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,269
yet feeling unable to leave them.

6
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm not sure if that's the true side
of married life,

7
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,869
but it's definitely yours.

8
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:54,899
Think about this.

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,070
According to
traditional Chinese medicine,

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,909
poor wealth

11
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,030
makes one to be emotionally attached.

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,459
You see,

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,978
if you

14
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,459
always lose yourself

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,350
in a relationship,

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,219
it's basically

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,589
because your liver is weak.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,270
Prone to sacrifice for others

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,498
and seek self-gratification

20
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:08,338
comes from the mutual influence

21
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,229
between the liver and lungs.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,099
Indulging in fantasies

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,939
and

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,179
self-blame

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,338
is due to poor blood circulation.

26
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,778
Overall,

27
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:16,659
you're being a hopeless romantic

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,379
because

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,309
you are sick.

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,229
I'm sick?

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,430
I thought I was just pathetic.

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,630
Don't sell yourself short.

33
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:33,749
How are things going
with Gu Yancheng?

34
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:34,739
Getting a divorce?

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,899
If you do,

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,899
I can also become

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,630
a divorce lawyer.

38
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,389
I don't know.

39
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,539
I only want to

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,469
get my thoughts straight.

41
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,949
Very well.

42
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,229
Let's work on that together.

43
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,258
Who's the boss here?

44
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,229
I pay your salary.
Aren't you supposed to be working?

45
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,190
Ouch.

46
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,190
Capitalism at its worst.

47
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,058
You can't even cut me some slack.

48
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,190
This drink is on you.

49
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,139
Take this to the water room.
[*A money-laundering department]

50
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,589
Don't let Ms. Yi know about this.

51
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,349
Wen,

52
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,419
have you forgotten who you are

53
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,150
after playing along with the show
for too long?

54
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,189
After all these years,

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,469
everyone is only after one thing,

56
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,309
that's money.

57
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,830
If you help me,

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,629
I'll give you this figure.

59
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:33,869
You're always doing dirty jobs,

60
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:37,029
this offer is a lot more
than the figure Ms. Yi paid.

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,150
You should plan for yourself.

62
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,550
It must be some dirty business.

63
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:08,749
Have you all received that?

64
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,419
Yes.

65
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,098
Yes.

66
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,909
Let's go.

67
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,550
Yes.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,410
(Jinyun Gold)

69
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:46,778
He,

70
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:47,629
it's all taken care of.

71
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,270
All have been exchanged for gold
at an equivalent price.

72
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,670
All right.

73
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,778
(It seems they're buying gold)

74
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,739
(to launder the money
from those jewelry)

75
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,029
(through multiple accounts.)

76
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,899
The butler who used to work
at your house was following me.

77
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,349
She's now in my hands.

78
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,310
Bring her over.

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,390
I'll handle it.

80
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,469
Good job.

81
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,429
How will you deal with her?

82
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,459
I have my plans.

83
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,349
You may go.

84
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,469
Don't tell Ms. Yi

85
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,789
about this.

86
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,178
I must say

87
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,429
your new face

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,070
is quite lovely,

89
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,469
Lin Jiayi.

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,390
Meng Yu?

91
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,669
I know you're investigating me.

92
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:07,379
I also know those people
from last night

93
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,870
were your order.

94
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,830
Let's cut right to the chase.

96
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,178
What do you want to

97
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,510
wreck my marriage?

98
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,989
You want payback?

99
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,229
Payback?

100
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,510
You know I did.

101
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,789
Lin Jiayi,

102
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,549
I know

103
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,830
I owe you for what I did before.

104
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,459
Take this 30 million.

105
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,978
It's compensation...

106
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,510
Take your money elsewhere.

107
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,750
Do you think money

108
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,549
can write off my hatred?

109
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,789
What you owe me

110
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,229
is a life.

111
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,669
The life of my unborn child!

112
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,669
Lin Jiayi,

113
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,229
calm down.

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,549
You're still alive, aren't you?

115
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,939
At least you're still alive.

116
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,298
You should cherish

117
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,150
this second chance.
It's not easy to come by.

118
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,390
What exactly do you want?

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,819
If you want a child,

120
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,229
I can give you that.

121
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,469
If you want love,

122
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,019
we can get back together.

123
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,469
I'll treat you even better.

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,070
You disgust me.

125
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,418
I sincerely advise you

126
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,909
not to pursue this matter.

127
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,270
Mark my words,

128
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,310
I will

129
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,459
put you and your accomplices in jail.

130
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,989
I will make you suffer.

131
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,109
If that's your attitude,

132
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,950
you're not leaving here today.

133
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:50,789
I will let you go

134
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,950
once everything is settled.

135
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,549
I'm doing this for your own good.

136
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,870
It was you.

137
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,699
Who are you to him?

138
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,630
He actually gave you 30 million.

139
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,939
How about this?

140
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,469
Tell me his secret,

141
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,989
and I'll release you.

142
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,139
Don't get me involved
in your dirty fight.

143
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,830
I won't say a word.

144
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,390
You won't?

145
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,830
I can make your talk.

146
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:57,830
What's this?

147
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:05,950
What are you trying to do?

148
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,270
Trying to burn me again?

149
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,909
I know you hit me.

150
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,750
I will kill you

151
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,150
to avenge my child.

152
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,029
Oh, it was you.

153
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,949
You didn't die.

154
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,829
Lin Jiayi.

155
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,350
Let go.

156
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,549
Very well.

157
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,549
You survived last time.

158
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,379
Let's see

159
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,069
if luck is on your side this time.

160
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,990
If you can leave this room by yourself,

161
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,230
I will let you go.

162
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,150
Walk on.

163
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,270
Don't go just yet.

164
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,350
No wonder he gave you the money.

165
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,189
Your face

166
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,870
is growing on me.

167
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,870
So tempting.

168
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,990
Lucky you.

169
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,990
I'll deal with you when I get back.

170
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,390
What took you so long?

171
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,350
The traffic was terrible.

172
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,019
What's wrong?

173
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,949
You're so eager to see me?

174
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,990
What's wrong with your neck?

175
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,658
Were you meeting

176
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,110
some woman just now?

177
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,938
No.

178
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,870
I'm having a skin problem.

179
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,619
Why are you doubting me?

180
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,189
Shouldn't you care about me?

181
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,750
I didn't mean that.

182
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,150
I'm just afraid

183
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,110
of losing you.

184
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,709
Silly.

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,829
By the way,

186
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:44,669
this is the surprise

187
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,429
I've prepared for you.

188
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:48,979
Take a look at it.

189
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,990
Do you like it?

190
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,990
I do.

191
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,350
But

192
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,429
will this be too expensive?

193
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,630
Not at all.

194
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,979
You helped me to make up the gap
of 300,000 yuan

195
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,139
so that I could earn five million.

196
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,739
You deserve

197
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,029
this gift.

198
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,429
I'll want to post it on Moment.

199
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,270
You know the rules.

200
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,709
I know you want to stay low.

201
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,549
I won't show your face.

202
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,110
This is unbelievable.

203
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,829
What a terrible thing to happen to me.

204
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,429
Isn't this...

205
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,750
Hello,

206
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,110
Zhang.

207
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,709
Can I ask you something?

208
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,298
DT Jewelry

209
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,909
accused us of plagiarism.

210
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,029
Have you received the legal notice?

211
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,549
No?

212
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,829
I see.

213
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,150
All right.

214
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,578
DT Jewelry has already sent out

215
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:55,938
a legal notice

216
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,390
accusing you of plagiarism.

217
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,230
Do you know the company
is facing a massive settlement

218
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,829
because of you?

219
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,189
Legal notice?

220
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,270
Well done, Wen Ruoyun.

221
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,110
You're messing with me.

222
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,037
Ms. Wang told me

223
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,582
today's your and Mr. Gu's birthday.

224
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,746
I've prepared a gift for you both.

225
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,255
Ms. Wen.

226
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,029
(Come to think of it,)

227
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,458
(it seems)

228
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,270
(that since she appeared as Su Xun,)

229
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,829
(my marriage with Gu Yancheng)

230
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,390
(has been slowly falling apart.)

231
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,139
I'll be a good person for once.

232
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,709
Here's a reminder.

233
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,019
Do you think

234
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,990
your husband is only cheating on you?

235
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,029
(Is she the one)

236
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,709
(who called me anonymously?)

237
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,949
(What's her relationship
with Gu Yancheng?)

238
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:20,870
Ms. Wang,

239
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,259
I'd like to ask

240
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,189
for Su Xun's address.

241
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,418
She took sick leave.

242
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:27,949
I want to visit her.

243
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,630
I'll wait for your message.

244
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,270
Thank you.

245
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,390
Wen Ruoyun,

And here you are.

248
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,789
