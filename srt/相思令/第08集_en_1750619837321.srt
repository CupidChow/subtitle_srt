rickson

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,800
Long time no see

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,040
Don't know if you are alone

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
or around

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,800
I am here

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,040
Shut up

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,600
Let's go

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,060
Have you even Kimiiander traveling with me?

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,840
Long time has passed

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,660
I still left with no return

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:51,560
stranger's netherworld lounging with me

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,280
Is this loneliness Laun wa sec species

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,900
One occasionally gotta marry

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,340
Nothing can drag me away from you

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,380
How about you?

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,420
I don't need you

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,820
flowers

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,300
Fill the same bill

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,580
to face the stone

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,860
Section 2

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,300
Dare you?

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
I like it

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,000
My burning heart, please

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,760
Don't regret the lonely Samurai

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,780
Episode 07

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Four are only three.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,260
Yaut!

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Sir.

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
Sir.

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
This way is almost the same.

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Let's go over there and have a look.

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Okay.

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,900
There's a soup bowl behind the mine.

34
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
The water temperature is high.

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Maybe you're looking for it.

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
Brother!

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
You said that Brother is working here.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
He's like a dragon.

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Young Master, you're here just in time.

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
You should check with us.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
General,

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
I can't participate in your formalities.

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Can I walk around?

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,900
Be careful.

45
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Young Master.

46
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
You guys go back to work.

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Yes.

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Young Master, when did you come here?

49
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
I said that we arrived early.

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
I've been on the side for half a day.

51
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
You don't care about me.

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
How's the test result?

53
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,900
Young Master,

54
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
this is the sample of the mine.

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900
After the test,

56
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
the mine has been closed.

57
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
Now we only need to check

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
if there's any report.

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,900
If not,

60
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
we can open the mine in the east.

61
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
The iron is solid.

62
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
It's hard to tell.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Why did Young Master bring a lady here?

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
It seems that

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
he's quite interested in the mine.

66
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
The one who's looking for it is you.

67
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Who's looking for it?

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
I don't know.

69
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I've found it.

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
What did you find?

71
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,900
Aren't you here to find Tang Quan?

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm here to find Tang Quan.

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,700
Maybe it's more valuable than the incense stone.

74
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,740
I didn't expect to come out with you

75
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,220
and have such a big income.

76
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Although the stone of Xuan Iron is rare,

77
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,980
it's not as fragrant as it is.

78
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,820
If it's sold in full,

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,620
it might not be as fragrant as the stone.

80
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,860
You're right.

81
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,820
Why don't you bring the stone back

82
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,700
and take a look at it carefully?

83
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,900
If it's not as fragrant as the stone,

84
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,220
I'll return it to you.

85
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,820
If it's more valuable than the stone,

86
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,140
it might not be as fragrant as the stone.

87
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,420
Then our contract will be changed.

88
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,060
Would you like to?

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,740
Of course.

90
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,980
But you reminded me in Liangzhou

91
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,740
that such a hard stone

92
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,860
is much more useful.

93
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,180
Luo Qi.

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,900
Chief.

95
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
Come and try this stone.

96
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,060
It's much harder.

97
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,620
Yes.

98
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,900
The stone is even harder than my knife.

99
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,900
You even cut my beloved knife.

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,500
It's really hard to cut a stone.

101
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,700
Miss Qi Luo,

102
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,700
I heard that

103
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,860
my family is a jewelry business

104
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,580
and of course, they are very interested in jewelry.

105
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,900
I heard that

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,100
the mine in the north is very expensive.

107
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,660
So I told you, Miss Qi Luo,

108
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,740
the book of the Poisonous Manor

109
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,900
is not our way of doing things.

110
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,980
You should have come to our north to get it.

111
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
You're right.

112
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,420
Chief,

113
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,980
the emperor just sent a message

114
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,980
and ordered you to come in.

115
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,620
Brother He,

116
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,180
why are you so thin?

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,380
Miss Qi Luo,

118
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,780
have we seen each other before?

119
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,820
When we met each other,

120
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,060
I was still a man.

121
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,140
I was that man.

122
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,940
Mr. Qi,

123
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,140
do you still remember me?

124
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,580
Miss Jun, you've mistaken me.

125
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,020
He's not He Xi Yao.

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,780
He's the brother of his twin brother,

127
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,620
He Wo Shan.

128
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,180
The emperor of the north.

129
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,980
He's a lowly man.

130
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,260
I see.

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,940
Please forgive me.

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,620
No need.

134
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,420
Miss, don't bother me.

135
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,740
I'm going to the palace.

136
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,020
When you find the water source,

137
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,260
I'll take you back.

138
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,460
Then,

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,620
this is the right time.

140
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,500
I won.

141
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,700
Thank you.

142
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,140
He is a girl.

143
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,100
He is a man.

144
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,700
In the heart of the brothers,

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,660
Miss Jun is so mean.

146
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,140
Interesting.

147
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,260
Interesting.

148
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,220
Miss,

149
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,420
if you had told me to go back toato school,

150
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,060
I would have

151
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,660
smack my head.

152
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,140
If you had shown me

153
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,860
your tricks,

154
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,300
you would not have

155
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,980
laid your掌 Maker's hands on myself for your rest of your life.

156
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,020
Guan Yoro has our trust in you.

157
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Little takebook.

158
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
Big diagram.

159
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,820
Your play 16 million,

160
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,780
What are you looking at?

161
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,340
Miss,

162
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,700
you've been looking at this for so long.

163
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,380
What are you looking at?

164
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,620
Brother Wang.

165
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,940
Don't bother.

166
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,900
Sit.

167
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,300
General Lie,

168
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,740
how are you?

169
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,540
Lord Xi,

170
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,260
long time no see.

171
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,940
I asked Lord Xi to come to the capital in advance

172
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,020
to save the loss of the iron and iron ore.

173
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,100
To do business.

174
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,380
Iron and iron ore is a good mining.

175
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,060
If we use it,

176
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,260
it will last for hundreds of years.

177
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,100
And Lord Xi is very confident.

178
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,900
He believes that he can use it.

179
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,980
Kuang Mai has been loyal to you.

180
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,700
Lie,

181
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,660
you should cooperate with Lord Xi.

182
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,300
As for the people,

183
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,700
I believe that General

184
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,780
will help you.

185
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,540
Brother Wang,

186
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,420
according to the observation of He Wushan,

187
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,620
there are many treasures in Kuang Mai.

188
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,580
I think

189
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,460
it's dangerous to break the stone.

190
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,700
Why don't you

191
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,940
let He Wushan take the danger first?

192
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,220
Lord Xi will accept it.

193
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,740
Yes.

194
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,940
You are right.

195
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,260
What do you think?

196
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,540
General, you are very thoughtful.

197
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,580
I will send more people

198
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
to fight against the Shang Gang.

199
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,380
But when Lord He is working,

200
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,620
he doesn't want to move with people.

201
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,660
When he is busy with the oil and coal meeting,

202
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,940
I don't know who will

203
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,580
fight against Shang Tao.

204
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,580
You have your own arrangement.

205
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,580
You don't need to use it.

206
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,220
I am too worried.

207
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,780
General is very talented.

208
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,180
Even the Yan men and women around him

209
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,740
are very good at it.

210
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,020
They have reached the Shang Tao of Liang Zhou and Yan Nan.

211
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,260
They are really a hidden treasure.

212
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
This matter has been reported by Lian.

213
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,500
Although the woman is from the Yan people,

214
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
she is a commoner.

215
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,620
She is really helping the people in Liang Zhou.

216
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,260
I believe that

217
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,900
she has her own arrangement.

218
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,900
Your Majesty.

219
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,900
All right.

220
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,820
The Empress Dowager will welcome Lord Xi today.

221
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,820
Lord Xi,

222
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,500
you can go to prepare first.

223
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,260
Father.

225
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,860
Father.

226
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,380
I saw that

227
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,860
Xuan Lie went to the imperial kitchen.

228
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,500
What is the matter with His Majesty?

229
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,660
His Majesty gave Xuan Tie's gold stone and mine

230
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,980
to Lord Xi.

231
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
That's great, Father.

232
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
With this mine,

233
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,980
Lord Xi can have a bigger deal of money.

234
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,380
Is this important?

235
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,220
Father, you are right.

236
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,580
The most important thing right now

237
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,860
is how to prevent Xuan Lie from joining the oil and coal meeting.

238
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
The mine is now in the explosion stage.

239
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,980
You can take him to check it tomorrow.

240
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,740
Remember, you can't take the medicine.

241
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
You can't take the medicine.

242
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
Father, don't worry.

243
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,020
I know what to do.

244
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,060
I told you to be quick.

245
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,580
I want to keep any of them.

246
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,420
Yes.

247
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,620
That woman from Yan Nan

248
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,460
asked Liang Zhou and Yan Nan to go to the funeral.

249
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,020
How could she not see you?

250
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,860
Brother.

251
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,820
This is to help

252
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,660
the people who left the village.

253
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,140
If you mention it on purpose,

254
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,420
there will be a risk of the demon attack.

255
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,860
And the business team hasn't returned yet.

256
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Is the business team going well?

257
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,300
I don't dare to report it to you.

258
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,340
You have always been a good man.

259
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,860
But today,

260
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,660
I can give you a copy of the mine.

261
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,140
You can also take the other parts

262
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,580
to make the copy.

263
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,140
I don't want you to be in danger

264
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,860
because of Yan Nan.

265
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,660
Yes.

266
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,820
The mine is in the west.

267
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,540
You are a little bit dangerous.

268
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,580
But you have other ideas.

269
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,900
I don't dare to.

270
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,420
But my brother

271
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,940
went to the mine today.

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,380
He took the iron and gold stone.

273
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,740
He is not a commoner.

274
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,460
For the people of Xuanbu,

275
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,180
it is a precious treasure.

276
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,620
But I promised him

277
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,260
that I wouldn't take back my life.

278
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,660
But you are in the middle of the world.

279
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,940
You have no place to live.

280
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
I believe that

281
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,100
you will have more mines in the future.

282
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,660
You are the leader of the Yizu Clan.

283
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
You should take the big role.

284
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes.

285
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
I have two comments.

286
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,540
Yes.

287
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,620
Childhood problem is an fishermen fishing.

288
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,780
A fishing,

289
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,980
catching fish,

290
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,420
fishing,

291
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,500
pointer fishing.

292
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,340
The mission is very important.

293
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,300
I agree.

294
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,060
We still need an end to your greed,

295
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,600
not to a young legend.

296
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,260
The love in childhood

297
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,740
can grow big without includes your lyric by start point.

298
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,700
Yes.

299
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,340
You will need to take a rest in the dark.

300
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,060
And love can come too.

301
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,980
Come on.

302
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,460
Miss,

303
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,180
is this the time

304
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,180
when you can'd begin to

305
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,740
turn the chopper faster?

306
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,620
I'm not sure.

307
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,060
You are good at dancing and you are good at dancing.

308
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,460
Why do you treat me like a slave?

309
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
He Ji Yao.

310
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Greetings, Your Highness.

311
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,060
Why are you alone? Where is the other one?

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,460
The Young Master has gone back to the palace.

313
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,860
He sent me to find her.

314
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Her Highness knew that you were in a hurry.

315
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,860
You should go back with me.

316
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,860
Brother Lie didn't come to me personally.

317
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,460
But how did you find me?

318
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,060
I heard from the people on the way

319
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,660
that I saw you at the border town.

320
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
So I came here.

321
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,660
Let's go.

322
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,060
He Ji Yao is Brother Lie's father.

323
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,660
Brother Lie should be waiting for us in the capital.

324
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,460
Your Highness.

325
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,860
This is...

326
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
He is my slave.

327
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
I will take him back to the capital.

328
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
I'm afraid that's not right.

329
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,860
This person is not clear.

330
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,460
If he is not good at the princess,

331
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,260
I will take him back.

332
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,860
Let's go.

333
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,260
I will take you to my palace.

334
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,660
Your Highness.

335
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,660
Water.

336
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,260
Your Highness.

337
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,460
Your Highness.

338
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,260
Your Highness.

339
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,860
Your Highness.

340
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,060
Who are you?

341
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,260
What are you doing?

342
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,260
A few days ago,

343
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,260
in our capital,

344
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
we took our silver.

345
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,460
Now you forget us so soon.

346
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,460
Who is more bold than you?

347
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,660
How dare you kidnap the princess?

348
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Don't talk nonsense.

349
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,860
The guy who is good at martial arts is not here.

350
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Give me the money.

351
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,460
Otherwise,

352
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,460
today is your death anniversary.

353
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,260
Give me the money.

354
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,660
Give me the money.

355
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,060
Give me the money.

356
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:34,860
Come on.

357
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,060
Give me the money.

358
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,860
Give me the money.

359
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,460
Give me the money.

360
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,860
Give me the money.

361
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,860
Give me the money.

362
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,460
Give me the money.

363
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,260
Give me the money.

364
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,660
Give me the money.

365
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,460
Give me the money.

366
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,060
Give me the money.

367
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,060
Give me the money.

368
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,260
Where is the money?

369
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,460
With the paper.

370
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,260
Take it out.

371
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,660
No more money.

372
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Don't be afraid. I'll take you away.

373
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,660
So, the one who can save me, I only have Li Yuge.

374
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I'm late. Is Princess hurt?

375
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,060
No.

376
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,660
Who took her away?

377
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,060
The three of us.

378
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,860
I had a fight with them.

379
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,660
Princess.

380
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
The forest is in the capital.

381
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,460
The people are safe.

382
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,060
It's dangerous.

383
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,660
I'm afraid we can't take her to the capital.

384
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
She's my savior.

385
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,460
Of course I'll be with her.

386
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,460
Princess.

387
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,060
But it's hard to be robbed by others

388
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,060
with such a good slave.

389
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,060
I have to let everyone know who is your master.

390
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
After the forest is out,

391
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,660
let's find a place to fall.

392
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,260
Young Master.

393
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Why do you insist on taking the Xuan Iron Gold Stone?

394
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,660
You've been in the White Moon since the beginning of the year.

395
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,660
You said that

396
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,260
in He Ji Yao and He Woshan,

397
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,460
Miss Jun is a man and a woman.

398
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,260
Since we've never seen Jun Feifan,

399
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,460
she's a man and a woman.

400
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,460
I have no idea.

401
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,860
Young Master.

402
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,660
Do you suspect that Jun Feifan is a woman?

403
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,660
When we were in the Three Kingdoms,

404
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,060
when we were taking Jun Feifan,

405
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,660
she was in the south.

406
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,060
The guard next to her was called Young Master.

407
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,260
Young Master.

408
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,460
Didn't Miss Jun say that Jun Feifan was out looking for the stone?

409
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,260
Did she pretend to be a man?

410
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,860
Miss Jun's family is in the capital to recuperate.

411
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,460
Look at her.

412
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
She doesn't seem to be sick.

413
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
She's been recuperating for 20 years.

414
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,860
She's not sick at all.

415
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,860
But she's been in the man for five years.

416
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,460
If she's not born,

417
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,860
she can only be a woman.

418
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,860
So what you mean is

419
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,460
Miss Jun is Jun Feifan.

420
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,260
But Xiaolai is wrong.

421
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,660
Jun Feifan is a great figure.

422
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,460
He's a family member in Yan.

423
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
If he's a woman,

424
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,260
how could he hide the truth?

425
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,460
Anyway,

426
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
we can't let go of any possibility.

427
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,460
But Young Master,

428
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,460
even if Miss Jun is Jun Feifan,

429
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
what does it have to do with the stone?

430
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,860
From Yao City,

431
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,060
even Liang City,

432
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,260
she'll be interested in a dark stone.

433
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,660
I asked the Wushan to investigate.

434
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,660
What's the use of the iron crystal?

435
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,660
If it can make a weapon,

436
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,660
So she came to Beijing

437
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,060
to make the iron crystal?

438
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
That's right.

439
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,660
Miss Jun is more and more eager to make a move.

440
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,860
But maybe the iron crystal

441
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,060
can verify her identity as a hundred-pointer.

442
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
If that's the case,

443
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,460
Young Master will investigate the case.

444
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,460
He'll avenge Madam and Lord Xuan Shu.

445
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,060
We're just guessing.

446
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,060
The appearance of the iron crystal is a coincidence.

447
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,660
She didn't know before.

448
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,660
I've never tried her in the Moon.

449
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,260
Her performance is not bad.

450
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,660
But Young Master,

451
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,660
do you want her to be Jun Feifan

452
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
or Jun Qiluo?

453
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,860
General.

454
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,860
Dong Yan?

455
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
What did you make?

456
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,660
I'm back, Master Luo.

457
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,460
This is the soup made by Miss Jun.

458
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,860
I've just been waiting for her to come back.

459
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
She can eat it warm.

460
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,660
She's gone out?

461
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,460
Where did she go?

462
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Miss Jun didn't tell me.

463
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,660
Go down.

464
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,660
Yes.

465
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,860
Luo Qi.

466
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
Luo Qi,

467
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,860
take her to the court.

468
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,860
Young Master,

469
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,660
Miss Jun may just leave the house.

470
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,260
Why are you...

471
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,860
I suspect she went to the Moon Square.

472
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,260
I'm sure she went to make a move.

473
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,460
Let's go.

474
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,460
Yes.

475
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Miss Jun.

476
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,460
Wait for me.

477
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,860
Young Master.

478
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,060
Young Master.

479
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,260
You've been with me for so long.

480
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,060
I don't know what you're calling.

481
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,060
Shao Qingming.

482
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
You're here in Beijing.

483
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,460
You should have a name in Beijing.

484
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,060
That's it.

485
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,060
Don't move.

486
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,660
If I slip,

487
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I'll hurt you.

488
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,020
Miss Jun,

489
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,260
leave her to me.

490
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:58,400
Keep this and I will

491
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,140
be back

492
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
Do you know how to kill me?

493
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Don't worry.

494
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
I won't hide from you.

495
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Did you hear that?

496
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Qingming said that she won't kill me.

497
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
He Ji Yao, you go out first.

498
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Qingming's martial arts are very strong.

499
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
She can protect me.

500
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Okay.

501
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
I trust you.

502
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
Miss.

503
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
Where are you now?

504
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,860
General, why are you here?

505
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
You can take a step further.

506
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
I just help you get a dress.

507
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
How can you guess my intention?

508
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
If Miss Qingying wants to soak in the soup,

509
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
there will be a place in the mansion.

510
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
Why choose here?

511
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,860
The place in the mansion is not natural.

512
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,860
And I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

513
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

514
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

515
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

516
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

517
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

518
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

519
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

520
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

521
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

522
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

523
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

524
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

525
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

526
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

527
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

528
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
I love the hot spring in front of people.

529
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

530
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
I don't like to soak in the hot spring in front of people.

531
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,540
Dancing english

532
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,120
Li Yushan.

533
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,360
I love you.

534
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,940
Blood from before ordered a 커itary,

535
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,560
илаrette.

536
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,100
You've been sick for many years.

537
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,700
Your body lost"?

538
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,860
Excuse me.

539
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Are you sick from pain?

540
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
I've counterintrial,

541
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
I'm afraid that you'll be afraid.

542
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,540
I'm too arrogant.

543
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,540
I'm afraid that you'll be afraid.

544
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,540
I'm in a bad mood now.

545
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,540
Could you please take me back to my father?

546
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Master.

547
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
I found a circle.

548
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,540
I really didn't find Miss Jun.

549
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Get out.

550
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Okay.

551
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Master.

552
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,540
I'll wait for you outside.

553
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,540
I'll wait for you outside.

554
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
Master.

555
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
General Yuan Lei

556
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,540
was afraid of me.

557
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
He came out to look for me.

558
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Since you're not feeling well,

559
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
don't run away.

560
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
I'll wait for you outside.

561
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,540
Put on your clothes.

562
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
Don't go back.

563
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Young Master.

564
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Why are you alone?

565
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Where's Miss Jun?

566
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
Mo Shan.

567
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,540
How did you find out what you found out?

568
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,540
Young Master, I've checked it.

569
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,540
The secret poison of Xuan Iron is strong,

570
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
but it's not easy to digest.

571
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
It's the perfect ingredient for making weapons.

572
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,540
But Xuan Iron is rare.

573
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
It's hard to open.

574
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
There's no record of Xuan Iron

575
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
on the document.

576
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
It's the power of making weapons.

577
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Is it really me who made a mistake?

578
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
You can go.

579
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
Yes.

580
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
Young Master.

581
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Come on.

582
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Come on.

583
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
Let's go.

584
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
What?

585
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
What's that?

586
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,740
I wanna give Dong Cuzting some skills

587
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,540
break Technique effective in the day,

588
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
but it saves her whole night.

589
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,540
I have kept Dong Cuzting in warm chocolate

590
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
for not long time,

591
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
but I can take care of her with my heart.

592
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,040
She'll take care of you

593
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Ms.,

594
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,480
The soup has been heated many times.

595
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,600
Drink it while it's hot.

596
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,560
General,

597
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,160
you should stay and drink some.

598
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,960
No.

599
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,360
The weather is getting cold.

600
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,120
I'm going back.

601
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,840
Tomorrow is the opening of the ceremony.

602
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,320
Okay.

603
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,280
Can you get some medicine to massage me?

604
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Do you want to go to Yitong?

605
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Of course.

606
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,200
I'm going to complete the contract with you.

607
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,960
General,

608
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
I have something to say.

609
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:33,840
I was carrying on

610
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
some materialsの previous couple of days in the Western Wall

611
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,640
when I saw a person's wrist on this shop.

612
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,840
I feltJon's feeling it didn't said in the victim's eyes.

613
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,040
I suddenly remembered that General had shown me this map when I was in Liangzhou.

614
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,640
I changed it.

615
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Did Wang Chengjie see it?

616
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,040
Do you know where that person went?

617
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,440
I'm different from that person, so I didn't notice.

618
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640
This map is very important to me.

619
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,440
Thank you for taking this matter into your hands.

620
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,440
Rest early. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

621
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:35,820
ك wsp

622
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,340
Your Majesty, I have known your planning since some days ago.

623
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,240
You're so brave. Chun Shiklal usually gures me...

624
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,360
I will be the hero of Miss Lian's family.

625
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay.

626
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,360
I'm just a little kid.

627
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,640
I want to go to the battlefield

628
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,280
and fight for you.

629
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,280
Your Majesty,

630
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,920
you have to stay with me.

631
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
Don't be nervous.

632
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,960
As long as you do as usual.

633
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,480
Come here first.

634
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,640
Your Majesty,

635
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,080
these are the two items of the Qishi Golden Thread.

636
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,680
You can choose any of them.

637
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,480
Okay.

638
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,440
Go ahead.

639
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,540
Hurry up.

640
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,540
Mother, you think

641
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,040
it iscause of 20 years difference,

642
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,980
No, no!

643
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,040
No Taxi is waiting for us.

644
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,120
It's quite dangerous here.

645
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,520
Why must there beiem

646
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,840
Let's Cabinet Singer

647
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
tour around so that this awesome natural scenery

648
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
can meet foreigners Hmm.

649
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,860
Is this lost?

650
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm going to run!

651
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,240
He's running away. Whether he's good, or not.

652
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,340
Yu'er usually don't see people so intentionally and the speed was so fast.

653
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,040
Since it's hopeless,

654
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Yu'er, play such a memorable move this year.

655
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Help!

656
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Help!

657
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
What's going on?

658
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Help!

659
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Help!

660
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Help!

661
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
What's going on?

662
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Help!

663
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Help!

664
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Are you okay?

665
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Help!

666
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Help!

667
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Look!

668
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Where is she?

669
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Take her to the imperial doctor.

670
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Let's go.

671
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Since she's a good girl, how could she be like this?

672
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Mother!

673
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Shizhou, are you okay?

674
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
I'll go check with you.

675
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
You must find out for me.

676
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
What's going on?

677
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

678
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
How was your work yesterday?

679
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Young Master, the soil is already well-dressed.

680
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
The soil is getting out of the mine.

681
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm just not sure.

682
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
The soil is getting out of the mine to catch people.

683
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Why is it getting out of the mine?

684
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,040
And Young Master, you even asked He Wushan to burn the firewood overnight.

685
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
It's really to burn a few pieces.

686
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
A few pieces?

687
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Yesterday, he suddenly told me that the soil is getting out of the mine.

688
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
He wanted to go to the mine without me.

689
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Look at him.

690
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
If he goes out, he'll be in a hurry to report it.

691
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Yes.

692
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Your Majesty!

693
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Your Majesty!

694
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Young Master!

695
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Young Master!

696
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Where's Miss?

697
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
She went to the mine.

698
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
You guys keep an eye on her.

699
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Don't let her get hurt.

700
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

701
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
Go to the mine.

702
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

703
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Follow me.

704
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Why didn't you wait for me?

705
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
I heard that you were going out early in the morning.

706
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
I thought you had something important to do.

707
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
So I came first.

708
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Do you know what this is?

709
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
It's a chicken.

710
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,040
There are many in the jewelry store in the military.

711
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
It seems that the jewelry store is not good.

712
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
It's time to calculate the staff.

713
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
From a business perspective,

714
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
it's not better than the jewelry store.

715
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Why don't we

716
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
do the transaction of the jewelry store?

717
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
I'm still a business man.

718
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
I'll help you find the jewelry store.

719
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Actually, it's not hard to find the jewelry store.

720
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,040
The jewelry store and the chicken are like the vending machine and the silk.

721
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
It's not good to use the weaving machine.

722
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
How can you be so cruel?

723
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
You use this kind of metal to make this shape.

724
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Then you use it to make the transformation.

725
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
How did you think

726
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
you can make the transformation with the iron metal?

727
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Take me in and have a look.

728
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
I'll tell you.

729
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Say it.

730
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Yesterday, I brought back the iron metal.

731
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
During the process of the model,

732
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I found that it would be more difficult to melt

733
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
the shiny materials.

734
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
General, I told you before.

735
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,040
The weaving machine in the south of Yan is better than the one in the north.

736
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
That's because the weaving machine in the south of Yan

737
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
is more delicate.

738
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
But how do you know

739
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
that the iron metal can make the transformation?

740
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Or do you always know?

741
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Yesterday, I learned a little bit of the weaving

742
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
and we both had some problems.

743
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Once I took it,

744
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
I dropped the iron metal into the pot.

745
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
So you know it?

746
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
I just thought that

747
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
the method given by the general

748
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
is to be tied in any way.

749
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I put a bowl of cold water in it.

750
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
When I took it out,

751
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
it was already half melted.

752
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
I didn't expect that the iron metal

753
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
would be so smooth and firm

754
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
after it melted.

755
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
I thought that it would be a good material

756
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
for the transformation.

757
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
So I brought it here.

758
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I didn't expect that the iron metal

759
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
would be this good after it melted.

760
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
I heard that

761
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
it can be made as a armor.

762
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
But I didn't know what to do.

763
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
I thought that it would be a good material

764
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
after it melted.

765
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
But I didn't know what to do.

766
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I heard that it would be a good material

767
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
after it melted.

768
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
It's a armor?

769
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
It's a little difficult.

770
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
It's been 10 years since the long time

771
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
for the short and long time.

772
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
General,

773
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
why don't you go to Yannan with the military

774
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
first

775
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
and then take the iron metal to Yannan?

776
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
After you get the equipment,

777
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
we'll think of other ways.

778
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Miss Qin is still a good man.

779
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Yesterday, I heard that

780
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I thought that we were

781
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
good at things

782
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
and we were good at things.

783
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

784
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
So you're not only

785
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
the military commander

786
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
of the military,

787
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
but also the one

788
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
that I've been looking for.

789
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
You're not a good man.

790
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Go.

791
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

792
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

793
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

794
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

795
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

796
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

797
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

798
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

799
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

800
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

801
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

802
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

803
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

804
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

805
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

806
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

807
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

808
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

809
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

810
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

811
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

812
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

813
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

814
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

815
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

816
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

817
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

818
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

819
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm the one who made the iron metal.

820
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Give me back the iron metal.

821
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Assume I have made a lot of mistakes.

822
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,140
Never know how many mistakes

823
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,400
you only have to put in a hundred times.

824
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,240
Give me back the iron metal.

825
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,840
And so far as I didn't know a thing.

826
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,800
That's...

827
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,500
épées Tay touristsquent.

828
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,600
That's...

829
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,980
That's mans wildlife

830
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,980
I can't help it

831
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,980
The stars and the stars are falling down

832
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,980
I don't want to be in the spring and spring

833
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,980
Let you love me again

834
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,980
My heart is broken

835
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,980
Let you love me again

836
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,980
My heart is broken
