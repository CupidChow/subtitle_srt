I still have no hope

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,660
It's been a long time

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,660
I still can't stop my head

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,660
The universe is dark

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,660
I still have no hope

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,660
Or how to give up

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,660
A piece of lies, I don't see the universe

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,660
Time is silent

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,660
The universe is dark

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,660
Who can write your tenderness

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,660
Who can always say

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,660
Finally, I can't stop

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,660
But I can't stop

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,660
I'm waiting for you

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,660
To become a star

23
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,660
I still have no hope

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
I'm willing to be with you

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,660
I'm waiting for you to become a star

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,660
I still have no hope

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,660
Episode 1

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Uncle, I heard that Brother Tang has disappeared

29
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,660
Can this news be true?

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,660
Yes, brother

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,660
We are not ordinary people, we are the family's elders

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
He is not here

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Who is the owner of this shop?

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Yes, yes

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Everyone, it's true that Feifan is missing

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
Feifan is missing?

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
Yes, Feifan is missing

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,660
What should we do?

39
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,660
Okay, everyone

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,660
But it doesn't mean that Feifan is in a bad situation

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,660
Everyone, please rest assured

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
I have sent someone to look for him

43
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,660
I believe that there will be news soon

44
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,660
It's time to settle accounts

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,660
The family's elders are not here

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,660
How can this be good?

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
How can this be good?

48
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
Everyone, everyone

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,660
In my opinion

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,660
Why don't we choose a temporary manager first

51
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
To take advantage of the business

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
What do you think?

53
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
Second brother

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,660
You just heard the news of Feifan missing

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Don't care about your son's safety

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,660
But hurry up and find someone to replace him

57
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,660
Brother, you are mistaken

58
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Our family can't only have this benefit

59
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,660
You have to be responsible for all the East families

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
Moreover

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,660
I am afraid that our military family

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Will be destroyed in a few decades

63
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
My dad is right

64
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,660
Uncle

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,660
You see

66
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,660
You know that brother Tang is missing

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Why are you hiding it from us?

68
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,660
Everyone, the elders

70
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Not long-term

71
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,660
There is a reason to cover up the price

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,660
But now

73
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,660
There is no news of Feifan missing

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,660
The Prime Minister sent people to help him find him

75
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,660
I believe that Feifan will return safely

76
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Good

77
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,660
Tang Hu

78
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Come back to our house

79
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
Okay, all back

80
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Thank you for your hard work

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,660
Go back to your house

82
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Thank you

83
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Thank you

84
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,660
I thought I could get the power

85
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
But your uncle

86
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Is here to help us

87
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
I am so ashamed

88
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,660
It seems that Feifan is missing

89
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Uncle can't stay in the capital

90
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
He was in charge of the war

91
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Feifan went to the capital to check the accounts

92
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
Now he is not here

93
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Uncle will help him personally

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
He is leaving

95
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
The whole army

96
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Isn't it a bit of a fight?

97
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,660
Son, in this situation

98
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,660
How can your uncle leave the capital without worry?

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
I think he will send a tent

100
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
To check the accounts in the capital

101
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
Dad, don't worry

102
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,660
I have a way to let him go personally

103
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
General

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Did you take the medicine?

105
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,660
I took the medicine

106
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,660
But I can't guarantee that he won't stay

107
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,660
My wound

108
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Is to save General

109
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
To make him go back to the capital

110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
General

111
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Should you give me some compensation?

112
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,660
What do you want?

113
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,660
I want General to escort me to the west

114
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,660
My young master is not in the west

115
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,660
But I am going to go to the west for him

116
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Who knows what will happen in the capital

117
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
If so

118
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Why don't you go directly to Yannan?

119
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,660
My young master has been looking for the incense in Yannan

120
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
I am going to the west this time

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Except for the business

122
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
I want to buy it for you

123
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Beixuan is more expensive than the west

124
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Why don't you go to Beixuan?

125
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
I have heard from my mother

126
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Beixuan also has a gold box and a mine

127
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,660
But the military family is not in the same business with Beixuan

128
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
I am not familiar with the terrain of Beixuan

129
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
I am sorry

130
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
What if I go there?

131
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
What's the point of going there?

132
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,660
My young master will be so ashamed

133
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
So the new incense you have

134
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
Is from this incense

135
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
What's good about the military family?

136
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
You are so concerned about it

137
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Let me see

138
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Where are you going?

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
How did you promise me?

140
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
You went to the west

141
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,660
You went to the dragon pond to study

142
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
You were so careless

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,660
How could you go there?

144
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,660
But you are so shameless

145
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
How can I do that?

146
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
My master has sent people to the temple

147
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
I have already sent the message

148
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,660
You should be at home and get the news

149
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Father

150
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
There is not much time left

151
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
You saw the morning stars

152
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,660
I heard that you were not available from the sky

153
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
If you really can't come back

154
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
It's not cheap

155
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Besides

156
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
You are a man

157
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
Why can't I go there?

158
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
You have been here for a long time

159
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
He has a rich experience

160
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
You have never been out

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
How can you compare with him?

162
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
General

163
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
I have saved your life

164
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,660
Can't you agree to this small request?

165
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Since you already know

166
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
The gold and silver are sold in Beixuan

167
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Why don't I take you to Beixuan?

168
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,660
The military and the west are close

169
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
So you can buy the lowest price in the gold and silver market

170
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Beixuan

171
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
I heard from my mother

172
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
The gold and silver are sold in Beixuan

173
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
But it is still a big deal

174
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
I am afraid that the price of the purchase

175
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Is not as good as the price of the gold and silver market

176
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Young master is the master

177
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
You are not worth it

178
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
I promise you

179
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Let you and the west go to the fire

180
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
The same price is added to the price

181
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Then I will thank general's beauty

182
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,660
But you enter Beixuan

183
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Not difficult

184
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
But

185
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
I have no family around me

186
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,660
OK

187
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Say it

188
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
What's the condition?

189
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Isn't this the owner of the house?

190
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
The military family is famous

191
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
You have been with the military and the women for so long

192
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,660
The imitation technology should not be too bad

193
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,660
I learned it from young master

194
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Of course

195
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,660
This imitation technology is also the second of the leader

196
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
If general does not mind

197
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
I will eat the imitation technology of the second of the leader

198
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
How about the imitation technology of the second of the leader

199
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
How about it

200
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
What are you doing

201
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
So it's a blind date

202
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Give it to me

203
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Miss is not going to Beixuan

204
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
The execution order cannot be in his hands

205
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
This is the全部 treasure my father left for me

206
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
The whole of Xiangzheng's group

207
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Give it back to me

208
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
You said you wanted to make a contract

209
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
It's a contract with the rule

210
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
The execution order is also the final letter left by young master

211
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Give it back to me

212
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Give it back to me

213
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Give it back to me

214
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,660
Are you going to give it back

215
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Are you going to give it back

216
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Good

217
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Don't throw it away

218
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
Don't throw it away

219
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Don't throw it away

220
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Don't throw it away

221
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
You and my brother have been friends for years

222
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Only you

223
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Never lost because of my identity

224
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Even remember his days

225
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,660
I thought I was the first son of Zhengfang

226
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Maybe my father

227
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,660
To make me the leader of his group

228
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Give me a chance to be the emperor

229
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
And my mother

230
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
As a woman in the west

231
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Can't enter the capital forever

232
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Every year I can only pretend to be a famous woman

233
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Come here to see her

234
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Yao Chengchu, the chairman of the west

235
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
And Beixuan

236
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
The chairman of the west

237
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
I buried your mother here

238
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,660
It's also her wish to return to the old home

239
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
This time

240
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
My mother can meet you to come to the prime

241
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
It's her fortune

242
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
It should be my fortune

243
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
Your mother is in heaven

244
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
If not for you to come to the prime every year

245
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,660
I'm afraid I'm going to die

246
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
You and I are too close

247
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
It's too close

248
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Mrs. Zhang

249
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
General, you're here

250
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Have a taste of this west-flavored dessert

251
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Just help me persuade my little master

252
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
To talk about our woman's wish

253
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,660
The girl who brought you to wear a man's dress

254
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
I think it's good

255
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
It's good to be with my master at a young age

256
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Don't be too young

257
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
My little master

258
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
This aspect is always not good

259
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Please help me persuade

260
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Aunt

261
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
You should prepare dinner

262
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Today we will eat some horse milk and garlic

263
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,660
Look, you're so anxious when you say this

264
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
The old man is not a small person

265
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
It should have been a marriage long ago

266
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
You say yes, General

267
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
What Mrs. Zhang said

268
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
You have already passed the age of the meat can

269
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
In a sense, it should have been a marriage long ago

270
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
Yes

271
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
Look at what the general said

272
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Okay, you talk about it

273
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
I'll go cook dinner

274
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,660
It seems that you still can't let go of that woman

275
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
You said

276
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,660
That woman has already married someone else

277
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
You should let go

278
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
The person who can make you forget

279
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,660
I believe it must be the woman of the seven

280
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:53,840
그

281
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:54,860
그

282
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,580
Li Fenyin

283
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,660
Datsang

284
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,660
You must be the one from the Shame League

285
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,820
He...

286
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,620
is different from others.

287
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,420
After five days,

288
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,620
it's Mrs. Sunba's birthday.

289
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,540
This time,

290
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,460
I only saw the leader of the Western desert,

291
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,700
I think Xicheng Kun

292
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,380
is on the way to the Western desert.

293
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,380
The Sun tribe has been keeping the balance.

294
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,740
The Sun tribe's army of Danyang is not strong enough.

295
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,380
If Xichang Kun is destroyed,

296
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,980
it must be a big trouble.

297
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
The Western desert has always been

298
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,540
the enemy of the whole tribe.

299
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,820
Sunba

300
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,820
will know what to do.

301
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,140
Have you forgotten that

302
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,060
Mrs. Sunba's son-in-law, Yuli,

303
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,620
is Xicheng Kun's cousin?

304
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,300
But if we can get close to the Sun tribe,

305
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,820
we should be more than half of the family.

306
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,500
We should be more than that cousin.

307
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,820
Young Master,

308
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,940
I heard that

309
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,340
Princess Liangzhou's son-in-law,

310
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,220
Sun Zhao Min,

311
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,140
is not married yet.

312
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,420
Young Master is in a state of shock.

313
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,380
He's not married yet.

314
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,700
What matters is

315
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,660
that he dares to live in the half of the world.

316
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,540
I'll take you to the mountain of the desert to dig the mine.

317
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,900
All right.

318
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,020
Get ready.

319
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,780
Get up and go to Liangzhou tomorrow.

320
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,780
My Lord,

321
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,140
the Prince of the city sent a secret letter.

322
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,860
What's wrong?

323
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,900
The Princess of Qingkou is leaving the letter.

324
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,300
His Majesty and Empress Dowager

325
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,820
are looking for the Princess as soon as possible.

326
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,060
Time is running out.

327
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,260
We must go to

328
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,100
the Sun tribe tomorrow.

329
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,300
How can we find the Princess?

330
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,340
Go to the Qingkou first.

331
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,380
But the security of the Qingkou is more important than anything.

332
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,140
How about this?

333
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,580
He Jiao,

334
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
lead the troops to the Sun tribe to find the Princess.

335
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,380
I'll go to Liangzhou with A'Li.

336
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,700
All right.

337
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,020
I'm here to save you.

338
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
This medicine is for treatment.

339
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,100
Take him.

340
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,900
Brother Lie fought the upload photos.

341
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,980
I should choose leave it to him.

342
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,900
Your imperial Rs make it good.

343
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
What a pity.

344
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
It's not good.

345
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,940
I should use the Kesi to make one.

346
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,740
You know Kesi too?

347
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,660
The Kesi's army never treat me as a sister.

348
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,460
I just know everything.

349
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,060
You're theć forty.

350
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,340
What's so funny?

351
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
I just know that

352
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,940
Wu Yubai was

353
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,980
Missishuo.

354
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,700
What?

355
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,940
Nothing.

356
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,420
I just heard about it.

357
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,140
You look like a person

358
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,180
who doesn't care about the world.

359
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,940
Why are you here?

360
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,660
I didn't expect

361
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,540
you're a smart slave.

362
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
But I heard

363
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,900
that if you're too smart,

364
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,420
you'll kill the master.

365
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,500
What about you?

366
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,220
Will you kill me?

367
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,060
Sir,

368
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,100
here's the hot water you want.

369
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,220
I'll do it.

370
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,380
I don't know why

371
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,940
Brother Lie and a man from the Yan State

372
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
disappeared.

373
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,300
I don't know when

374
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,220
I'll find him.

375
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,500
You said your brother

376
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,340
and a man from the Yan State

377
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,180
disappeared.

378
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Are you here to

379
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,940
ask your brother?

380
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,100
My brother

381
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,500
is a hero from the North.

382
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,620
In the past,

383
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,020
the three-legged thief

384
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,460
and the murder case

385
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,620
were all about Brother Lie.

386
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,420
He's the master.

387
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,380
Of course.

388
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,100
He's the God of War in the North.

389
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,740
It seems that you're in danger.

390
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,300
So you're the daughter of the North.

391
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm the enemy princess of the North.

392
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,500
Brother and sister of the King

393
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,100
are the most precious daughters.

394
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,500
If he's not a man from the Yan State,

395
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,700
I might

396
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,540
treat him as a man

397
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
and exchange him for a young man.

398
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,380
Do you have a way

399
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,340
to find your brother?

400
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,220
I don't even know where he is.

401
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
I'm not with him.

402
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,180
He won't take care of himself.

403
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,780
He lost himself.

404
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,900
I don't know where to start.

405
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,180
Maybe your brother

406
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,660
has returned to the camp.

407
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,380
Why don't we go to the camp and have a look?

408
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,500
Yes, you're right.

409
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,740
I've been out for so long.

410
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,500
Maybe Luo Qi and He Ji Yao

411
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
have already found him.

412
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,300
I've been with He Ji Yao since morning.

413
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,420
It's all his fault.

414
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
He won't let me follow him.

415
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,020
Even if I didn't find Brother Lie,

416
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,660
it would be good

417
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,220
if I found them.

418
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,620
Are you sure you want to get her?

419
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,580
I don't know when she'll get back to normal.

420
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,420
She will have to struggle lures.

421
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,900
If she can work with

422
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,220
all theterminal bullies and shopkeepers

423
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,240
in one occasion,

424
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,140
the Uhhard Army Project

425
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,400
will raise the case.

426
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,640
Did Lady off- Iím worried about she?

427
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
General,

428
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,860
when did you come here?

429
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,380
Why are you so surprised?

430
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,220
You're too obsessed with it.

431
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,180
What are you thinking about?

432
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Zizi's rumors are already very dangerous.

433
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,180
I'm afraid it won't be easy

434
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,420
to go to Liangzhou.

435
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,820
You're worried about my safety.

436
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,220
I thought you were thinking about Jun Feifan.

437
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,660
Young Master is a wise man.

438
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,100
Why do I have to agree with him?

439
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,540
General,

440
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
there are many enemies

441
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
who want to kill you.

442
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,620
They're like the enemy.

443
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,340
I'd better think about

444
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,580
how to protect my life.

445
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,460
What?

446
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,260
You regret to be with me?

447
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,980
The situation is more serious.

448
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I believe you have a solution.

449
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,180
It's a matter of time.

450
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,540
The evil spirits in the West

451
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,940
don't need to be in the heart.

452
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,740
They can be in the way.

453
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,060
Don't think about it, General.

454
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,940
It's not what you think.

455
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,940
You're just trying to make a move.

456
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,340
When I went to find Lord Luo Zhizhou,

457
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,780
he was already seriously ill.

458
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,180
He would save me or Wu Wu.

459
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,820
He would save me.

460
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,500
But you're suspicious of me.

461
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,180
You're just trying to be my father.

462
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,900
You're late for a short time.

463
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,060
You must be thinking too much.

464
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,980
Miss Qiluo can't be as sincere as you are.

465
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,020
But I'm still there.

466
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,980
I know you're kind.

467
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,260
When will we get out of the city?

468
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
Why are you in such a hurry?

469
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,500
You can't miss the chance.

470
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
If we can find the golden incense jade stone,

471
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,220
you'll be very happy.

472
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,260
Of course I'm in a hurry.

473
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,260
If that's the case,

474
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,260
we'll get out of the city tomorrow morning.

475
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,740
You've been thinking about getting out of the city long ago.

476
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,620
Why do you say it's because of me?

477
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,980
We don't need to know each other so well.

478
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,860
We should figure it out.

479
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,220
Only then can we get out of the city.

480
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,100
It's late.

481
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,740
You should rest early.

482
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,780
I'm not going to see you off.

483
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,380
The blood is still in the heart.

484
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
The fairy was stolen by the horse.

485
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,220
The maid said she couldn't hide it for too long.

486
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,380
She has to prepare the target in advance.

487
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,140
OK.

488
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,500
Let's go.

489
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,340
Thanks.

490
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,380
Slowly.

491
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,580
OK.

492
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,740
Go.

493
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,060
Enjoy!

494
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,860
They are Investing all.

495
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,820
Stay as many as you can.

496
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Let's clink our ه

497
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,420
Everyone has one!

498
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,300
We've just introduced to you.

499
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,020
Keep playing.

500
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,820
Come on.

501
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,620
Come on.

502
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,620
That's right. Everyone has it.

503
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,620
Everyone has it.

504
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
Please.

505
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,620
Then you're done.

506
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,620
Why are you trying to save me?

507
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,220
What?

508
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,420
Don't fight.

509
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,420
Stop fighting.

510
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Stop fighting.

511
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,620
Don't talk.

512
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,620
Stop.

513
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,420
Stop.

514
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Stop fighting.

515
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Stop fighting.

516
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Stop fighting.

517
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
Let's go.

518
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
Thank you for helping me.

519
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,220
You look so handsome.

520
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
How do you call me?

521
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,620
Call me Qi Luo Bianke.

522
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Mr. Qi.

523
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,220
Miss, can you wake up?

524
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,020
Sorry.

525
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,020
Zhang Min, are you okay?

526
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,820
I'm fine.

527
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,020
Thank you.

528
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,820
Mr. Sun.

529
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,020
General.

530
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,220
Thank you for saving my daughter.

531
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,820
I don't know why you're here.

532
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Please forgive me.

533
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,020
You're welcome.

534
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,420
We came here

535
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,220
to congratulate Mrs. Sun.

536
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,820
I'm afraid you don't know

537
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,420
that the birthday banquet

538
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,820
of my cousin this year has been canceled.

539
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,020
The Liang State is in a big mess.

540
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,220
Now there's a plan.

541
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
The people are helpless.

542
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,620
Now the whole Liang State is in a mess.

543
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,820
Mrs. Wu and I

544
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,620
really don't have the heart

545
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
to hold a birthday banquet.

546
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,220
Mr. Sun, you're so kind.

547
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,620
I'd like to share the wedding with you.

548
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,020
Mr. Sun is my cousin.

549
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,420
The Liang State is my business.

550
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,820
I'm not old enough to care about you.

551
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,220
How about this?

552
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
The birthday banquet is canceled.

553
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,020
Please forgive me.

554
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,420
I'll be here for a few days.

555
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
I'll be grateful

556
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,820
for your help.

557
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,620
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

558
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,420
I've been a murderer for many years.

559
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,820
I've been missing water for many years.

560
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,620
General Lie sent me this token.

561
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,820
It's the blessing of the people of Liang State.

562
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,820
Come on.

563
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
I'll toast to you.

564
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,820
It's my honor to share the burden with you.

565
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,220
I don't need to prove myself.

566
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
But now, Wang Shengruo

567
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,820
is working with us.

568
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,420
Since Mr. Wu and Lie are here,

569
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,620
I'll help Mr. Sun

570
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,220
to solve the problem of Liang State.

571
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,420
I'm glad to hear that.

572
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,820
It's not a matter of solving the problem.

573
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,220
What's the matter, Mr. Xi?

574
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,420
This is the state affairs of the North.

575
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,420
It's not convenient to talk about it in front of outsiders.

576
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,820
This gentleman is not like the noble of the North.

577
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,820
I wonder what's the relationship

578
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,220
with the general.

579
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,820
Mr. Qi is my benefactor.

580
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,820
You don't need to be angry.

581
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,620
I see you're lucky.

582
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,620
I'm glad to see you're here.

583
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,820
Let me toast to you.

584
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,420
Thank you for your help.

585
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
You're welcome.

586
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,620
It's the first time I've come to Liang State.

587
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,020
They're so boring.

588
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,020
Why don't I take you out for a walk?

589
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,420
Mr. Qi, what do you think of my competition?

590
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,820
I'm not good at it.

591
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
This gun is good.

592
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,420
It's heavy.

593
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Of course.

594
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
I specially made it for the general.

595
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,020
Liang State is heavier than the second one.

596
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,420
What's the point, Your Highness?

597
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
My parents gave birth to me.

598
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,220
There was a saying in my childhood.

599
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
Women can't even get a gun.

600
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,820
They can't protect the people of Liang State.

601
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,620
I'm so worried.

602
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,220
I always think of choosing a husband for me in the army.

603
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,020
So I've been getting the most guns since I was a kid.

604
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
I want to prove that I'm not a man.

605
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,420
I don't need to be a doctor.

606
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,020
I can protect the people of Liang State.

607
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,620
Brother, you only have three daughters.

608
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,020
You still need to have the military property of the army.

609
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
How about this?

610
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,020
You can learn from me now.

611
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,020
It's good to help you to share the burden in the future.

612
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,420
Brother.

613
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,620
Father, I can also share the burden for you.

614
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Good.

615
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
Don't make trouble.

616
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,420
A girl should learn from her husband.

617
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,820
She should be a woman.

618
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,020
People always have prejudice against women.

619
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,420
Both of you are good women.

620
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
Don't talk about others.

621
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Just give up.

622
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Go out and act like a man.

623
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,620
Don't mind the princess.

624
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,820
Actually, I know you're a woman in the city.

625
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,020
You're a woman.

626
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Protecting the people of Liang State is not a matter of consciousness.

627
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,620
Are you ready?

628
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,620
Of course.

629
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,420
As long as I can protect the people of Liang State,

630
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
I'll do anything.

631
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,820
Being a tribe leader,

632
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,420
not only can you fight against the enemy,

633
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,820
but also lead the people to live a rich life.

634
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,020
If you have the ability to see this,

635
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,020
I can make a promise to you.

636
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,020
Let the princess be the leader of the Sun tribe

637
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,620
as the young master.

638
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Really?

639
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,820
General, don't you think I'm a woman?

640
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,220
I can't be the leader.

641
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,820
It's hard to be a good leader.

642
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,820
As long as you can be a good leader,

643
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,420
you don't have to think about others.

644
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,020
Thank you for your words.

645
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,420
What are you doing?

646
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,820
You're in the army of the Sun tribe,

647
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,420
and you're still here to fight against the enemy.

648
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,420
Father,

649
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,620
it's all because of the woman by the side of the enemy.

650
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,620
It's a big deal.

651
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,820
It's a good thing for us.

652
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,820
Woman?

653
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,820
The man by the enemy

654
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,620
is the woman who saved me in the city.

655
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,420
I wanted to wear her in front of me.

656
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
You fool.

657
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,420
If you wear her in front of you,

658
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,820
won't you be exposed to the enemy?

659
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
You're not capable enough to

660
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,820
push the responsibility to a weak woman?

661
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,820
Forget it.

662
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,420
Since the enemy is here,

663
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,020
we'll try our best to get the support of the Sun tribe.

664
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,820
Luckily, we got the line.

665
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,020
You still have to be more careful about Sun Zhao Min.

666
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,020
She's Sun Ba's favorite daughter.

667
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,620
If she comes to you,

668
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,820
we'll take the advantage of her.

669
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
I understand.

670
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
At the banquet,

671
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,620
Sun Ba didn't want to talk about Liang Zhou's affairs with us.

672
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,220
I'm afraid he's determined to support Xi Chang Kun.

673
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,220
Maybe.

674
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,220
Sun Ba is always loyal.

675
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,020
He doesn't want to participate in the wolf master's battle.

676
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,620
Now he's in a hurry.

677
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,020
He's in the decision between me and Xi Chang Kun.

678
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,020
Otherwise,

679
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,620
he won't leave us.

680
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,820
You used to walk with Sun Ba.

681
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,020
And Xi Chang Kun is his cousin.

682
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,620
He's afraid he won't survive.

683
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,220
But you have my support.

684
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
I can fight with them.

685
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,020
I have to get Sun Ba's support

686
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
in Liang Zhou's case.

687
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,620
My parents helped the late emperor to get the power.

688
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,220
They sent a weapon to the people.

689
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,020
If it has nothing to do with the north and the north,

690
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,020
I'm sure I won't believe it.

691
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
A'Li,

692
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
it's been 12 years.

693
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Even the late emperor didn't find any evidence.

694
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,420
The late emperor and the empress dowager

695
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,620
didn't cooperate to protect Wu Hu.

696
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,220
It's an accident.

697
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,220
Don't investigate it.

698
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,420
Now the brotherhood is over.

699
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,620
If Yan Ming can take the position of the wolf master,

700
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,820
I'll take the risk.

701
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,620
So I can only succeed in the wolf master's battle.

702
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,020
I can't fail.

703
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,020
Xi Chang Kun has brought Liang's family to solve the problem.

704
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,620
He's taken the advantage of it.

705
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,420
And Sun Ba is against us.

706
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,620
He's afraid he won't believe it

707
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,820
because he's afraid it's not easy.

708
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,820
The only way to solve the problem is to solve the problem.

709
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,220
You have a way.

710
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
You said that

711
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,020
you took a banana from Yan Nan

712
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,820
to the princess.

713
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,820
Yes.

714
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,620
I forgot to give it to the princess.

715
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,420
I'll take it to her.

716
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
No hurry. I have a way.

717
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,620
Let's go together tomorrow.

718
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,820
Go.

719
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,420
Sister Zhao Min.

720
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,620
I've been looking for you for a long time.

721
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,820
So you're practicing martial arts here.

722
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,420
I know you like to eat weapons.

723
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,020
I especially found a good weapon for you.

724
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:26,820
Look.

725
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,420
No need.

726
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,220
I've been looking for you for a long time.

727
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,220
I've been looking for you for a long time.

728
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,420
Sister Zhao Min.

729
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,020
We're family.

730
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,220
Take it.

731
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,420
Who said you're family?

732
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Lord Sun and Madam Sun

733
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,620
want to be your son-in-law.

734
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,820
Sister Zhao Min is a good girl.

735
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
Fang Yan, Beixuan, Wubu.

736
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,220
Except me,

737
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,820
who else can be your match?

738
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,820
I choose Fu Xu.

739
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,220
You must be on my side.

740
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,220
If you win,

741
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
I'll think about it.

742
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,820
Choose the weapon you like.

743
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,780
Gu Yan.

744
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,820
Duke Jiu, are you still here?

745
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
I heard Father-in-law say

746
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:53,900
Jun Fei was

747
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,820
The rest of the people have been sent to the Sanbukuan to know the situation.

748
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,300
My lord has sent some high-ranking men to find Feifan.

749
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,620
Any news?

750
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,180
Not yet.

751
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,860
It's strange to say that

752
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,940
we didn't find Jun Feifan and the guard's corpse at the scene.

753
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,460
Do you know why?

754
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,300
Your majesty,

755
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,100
the Sanbukuan was a criminal.

756
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,140
It's common to kill people.

757
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,060
Feifan was lucky to meet a thief.

758
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,740
He must be in a dilemma.

759
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,060
He wanted to know the truth.

760
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,620
He escaped to find the body of Xuan Iron.

761
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,780
His majesty...

762
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,260
His majesty was so smart.

763
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,340
Then did he go the wrong way when he was looking for the body?

764
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,100
Your majesty,

765
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,860
Feifan is a common person.

766
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,420
What path should he take?

767
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,900
He knows the most.

768
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,300
Er 냉 !

769
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,280
Yu'er, i...

770
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,320
You always go for the lead.

771
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,420
I was right about the last thing we did.

772
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,380
Your majesty,

773
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,260
you can feel at ease.

774
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,300
I've already made some decisions

775
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,700
They alone reject you and only give us the funds.

776
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,780
400 lire.

777
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Upon those talks,

778
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Father, don't look at me.

779
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,880
If you have the support of the Prime Minister,

780
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,480
will we be able to get the military power?

781
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
What do you mean?

782
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,680
Didn't we bring all the great masters to find the great uncle last time?

783
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,080
He took the Prime Minister to suppress us.

784
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,480
Now they're not here.

785
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,080
Why don't we focus on the relationship between the Prime Minister and him?

786
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,680
But the Prime Minister and them have been closer these years.

787
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,680
If we go to find the Prime Minister,

788
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
do you think it's good?

789
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,880
Father, you're wrong.

790
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,480
The Prime Minister can see that

791
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,880
it's our military power's signature.

792
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
It's not his military power's fault.

793
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,680
Moreover, the military power's fault is not over yet.

794
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
The uncle is already old.

795
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,680
The Prime Minister knows better than me.

796
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,080
Choosing the new chief of the military power is a disaster.

797
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,280
Choosing the new chief of the military power is a disaster.

798
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,080
In my heart, I became a shadow

799
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Embracing the song of my hurt and tears

800
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Full of the past, the red sunset

801
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,480
Just a little bit, a little bit of love

802
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,080
Falling into my heart, becoming a heart

803
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Embracing the song of my hurt and tears

804
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Full of the past, the red sunset

805
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Just a little bit, a little bit of love

806
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Falling into my heart, becoming a heart

807
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Embracing the song of my hurt and tears

808
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Full of the past, the red sunset

809
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Just a little bit, a little bit of love

810
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Falling into my heart, becoming a heart

811
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,080
Embracing the song of my hurt and tears

812
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Let you fall in love with me again

813
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Let you fall in love with me again

814
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Let you fall in love with me again
