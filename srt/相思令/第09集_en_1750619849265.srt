1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm fine.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Come.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Are you hurt?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm fine.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Come.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Are you hurt?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm dead.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We can only find the others.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Come.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's wrong?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Did you hurt yourself?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm fine. I can't leave.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Come on. I'll carry you.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're injured.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can leave by myself.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Go to the military base.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You should change your military uniform.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't let me say it again.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Come on.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Chief.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Chief.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Chief.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Come on.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Take away the stone.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Take away the stone.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Take away the stone.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
First, take the bomb out of the room

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and report it to Brother Wang.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Then lock it here.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And report it to the police.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Remember.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You don't need to be involved.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Chief.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But on the west side...

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Brother Wang is in charge.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I won't say anything

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
about the Xichengkun.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Chief.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I heard the bomb exploded.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you all right?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm fine.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's this?

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Chief.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is the report from the Ye Nantan.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the portrait of the military.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When I opened it,

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I felt like a girl.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But it wasn't.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Chief.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The portrait is a horrible quality.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And the detective said

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the military was in Ye Nantan's family.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
After the Xichengkun,

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
they went straight to the capital.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But the military looks good.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They are brothers.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
General, are you here to ask me

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
if it's the military's rebellion?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you?

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I also hope so.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This way, I can get freedom.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I'm not a child.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm a child.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not a child.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I can only take the patient to a good place

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to take the rebellion

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to the capital.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
General,

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've been out for so long.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I haven't been to the capital.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If the rebellion is gone,

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it won't be like this.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been to the capital with Feifan.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How can the military suspect me

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to be Feifan?

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Just ask.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go back.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Here.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you, General.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Empress Dowager is here.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Majesty.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's going on?

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mother.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yu'er, how is Yu'er?

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yu'er.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mother,

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the doctor said that Yu'er was too frightened.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
She needs to rest.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your Majesty,

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
what's the reason for you to find out?

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Luo Zhizhou went to check it out.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was because there were many people in the horse market

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that the horse was frightened.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So he went to the market and frightened Yu'er.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now I've already

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
handled the rider of the horse.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
After a few days,

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I thought of letting the Empress and Yu'er

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
go with me.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now it seems that

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yu'er is afraid that

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
she has a plan against me.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm afraid.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Your Majesty,

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yu'er is always brave.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She won't be afraid

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
because of the surprise.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She's afraid to be angry.

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
These days,

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
she has been arguing

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and wants to go to the amusement park.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There are chances for her to go to the amusement park.

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now the Empress

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
should accompany Yu'er to take care of her body.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's the most important thing.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When the body is well-being,

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
she can ride the horse.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's time for her to go.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mother.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Just listen to Your Majesty.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Stay in the palace

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and take care of Yu'er.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I respect your words.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll get you some medicine.

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You should take good care of your wound.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
From the south to the north.

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The road is dangerous.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's dangerous to die several times.

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It seems that I still have to

136
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
complete the appointment with General

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and go back to the military base.

138
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Brother Liu.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Third Sister.

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother Liu.

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Qingming.

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Qingming, you're still alive.

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I thought you...

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How did you get into this?

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm still alive.

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll be with you in the future.

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Stop it.

152
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've told you several times.

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Didn't I say I wanted to see you?

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's her.

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Who are you?

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Stay away from my slave.

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Slave?

158
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Qingkong, I have no choice.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Brother Liu.

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I didn't find you in her.

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But I got a slave

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
from a foreign slave.

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Look at her.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How is this slave?

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She's right.

166
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You hurt her.

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She's too good.

168
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
She almost got killed

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and sold her to be a flower shop.

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not hurting her

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
to save her, right?

172
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Brother Liu.

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Look at my side.

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How about you show me now?

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Qingkong.

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't fool around.

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not fooling around.

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Qingming.

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why did I talk to you?

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't make me cold because of Brother Liu.

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Qingkong.

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Miss Jun is not a slave.

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She's my guest.

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your Highness.

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm from the businessmen in Ye Nan.

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm Jun Qiluo.

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Brother Liu.

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you with her?

189
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Otherwise,

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
how can a businesswoman

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
be your guest?

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Miss Jun saved my life.

193
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Of course, she's my guest.

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you saved Brother Liu's life.

195
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then you're my guest.

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your Highness.

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have a favor to ask you.

199
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Please take it.

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Take a look.

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll thank you for saving my life.

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're right.

203
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She's our guard,

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Shao Qiming.

205
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She's not a slave

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but a slave.

207
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Please let her go.

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I just said that

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Qingming is my slave.

210
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Even if you're Brother Liu's guest,

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you can't be a slave.

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you going to

213
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
challenge me?

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How can you be a slave?

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Li Shanlie is the most slave.

216
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How about Li Lianlang?

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If you win,

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
she's yours.

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay.

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Qingkong, don't make a fool of yourself.

221
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Brother Liu.

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is a game

223
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that Miss Jun didn't make.

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't interfere.

225
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Miss Jun is injured.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think you don't want to be promoted.

227
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You'd better rest.

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can play tomorrow.

229
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll never admit that I'm a slave.

231
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll never admit that I'm a slave.

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If that's the case,

233
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we'll go to Li Shanlie's place tomorrow.

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We'll be there at the top of the list.

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay.

236
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't go back to rest

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
when you're tired.

238
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't worry about the king.

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's go.

240
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll take you to the old house.

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why did you stop me?

242
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The competition will be more painful

243
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
if you push and push.

244
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're a female,

245
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but you're smarter than her.

246
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Qingkong is on the horseback.

247
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can beat her.

248
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How can you know

249
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that I can't beat her?

250
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Anyway,

251
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I must win

252
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
no matter what.

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll do my best

254
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to win.

255
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll do my best

256
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
no matter what.

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll do my best

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
no matter what.

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll do my best

260
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
no matter what.

261
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll do my best

262
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
no matter what.

263
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll do my best

264
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
no matter what.

265
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll do my best

266
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
no matter what.

267
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I must save Qi Ming as soon as possible.

268
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Miss,

269
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
you're so nice to your servant.

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Qi Ming is not a servant.

271
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He grew up in my house

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
since he was young.

273
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's my family.

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I brought him out

275
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but he didn't protect him.

276
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He was so naive.

277
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was so naive.

278
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Miss,

279
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
if you win the competition tomorrow,

280
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
he can come back to you.

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The situation is that

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
even if I win,

283
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
he might not

284
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
protect her.

285
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why do you still have a general?

286
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He will definitely help you.

287
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
General,

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
he only helps the princess.

289
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How can he help me?

290
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Miss, you're too much.

291
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Look,

292
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the general knows

293
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can't eat

294
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the food in Beijing.

295
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So Luo Qi asked a few

296
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yanan chefs to cook for you.

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He also asked the He's team

298
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
to go to the Sanbuguan

299
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to buy some

300
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yanan seasoning for you.

301
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The general was born in the business.

302
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He never cared about the ceremony.

303
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But he didn't dare to

304
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
take Miss Man's ceremony.

305
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's already

306
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
aware of the general's concern.

307
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The general also knows

308
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yanan's food

309
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
is all small and delicate.

310
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And Beijing

311
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
uses a large plate of heavy-duty food.

312
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So he specially

313
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
chose many delicate dishes.

314
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He made

315
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a big dish of Su Lao.

316
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
These days,

317
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the general's concern for Miss

318
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is all in his eyes.

319
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
These concerns

320
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
are probably not for the general.

321
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Miss

322
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
knows his feelings for you.

323
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The princess is the only one

324
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in the world.

325
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No one

326
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
dares to offend her in the whole of Beijing.

327
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But the general

328
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
will listen to you.

329
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you're worried,

330
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
tell the general about it.

331
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No matter how the princess

332
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
makes a move,

333
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
she won't leave.

334
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now I know

335
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
why she's

336
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
going back to the capital with the princess

337
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and wants to take her back.

338
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Miss Qiluo.

339
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No one can take

340
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
my permission.

341
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Young Master,

342
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
in order to let Miss Jun

343
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
play the role of a military pilot,

344
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
we have to

345
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
work hard.

346
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What do you think

347
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
is their relationship?

348
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What relationship?

349
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Of course it's Miss

350
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and the guards.

351
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They just called her Miss.

352
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you hear that?

353
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

354
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Young Master,

355
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
are you new to the army?

356
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I mean

357
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
she's in the 3rd division

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and called her Qiluo Young Master.

359
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Young Master is still thinking about it.

360
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Miss Jun

361
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
pretended to be a military pilot

362
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and was injured.

363
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
She would help me.

364
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Besides, she's a personal guard.

365
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And look,

366
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the military pilots

367
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
are all in the same boat.

368
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What's the point of suspecting her?

369
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Miss Jun

370
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
is the eldest lady of the military.

371
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Send a message to the military pilots.

372
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If she sees the security of the eldest sister

373
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and comes to the 3rd division

374
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and breaks the bones,

375
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the military pilots

376
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
will be in danger.

377
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm afraid

378
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
she won't risk her life

379
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
for Qiluo.

380
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Make sure

381
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the military pilots

382
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
are not afraid of her.

383
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I didn't come to ask you.

384
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
When did

385
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
you become

386
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
a Qiluo Young Master?

387
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But you don't know

388
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that Miss Jun

389
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is a man.

390
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
She's actually

391
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the eldest lady of the military.

392
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
She's a soldier.

393
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What?

394
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Slow down.

395
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Gu Fei,

396
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the horse is running too slow.

397
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There's no time to ride.

398
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's so fast.

399
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Majesty,

400
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the young master is so arrogant.

401
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll go talk to him.

402
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

403
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Young Master.

404
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Calm down.

405
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yier.

406
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your Highness,

407
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the young master is scared

408
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and scared of the horse.

409
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He's still scared.

410
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The young master is so arrogant.

411
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He's afraid of hitting the horse.

412
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

413
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

414
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Your Majesty,

415
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yier doesn't

416
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
hit the horse on purpose.

417
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He just

418
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
was so happy

419
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
a few days ago.

420
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I thought about

421
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
this every day.

422
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't blame me, Your Majesty.

423
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yier asked me

424
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to play with you.

425
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Since that's the case,

426
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll let Yier

427
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
meet you

428
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
at the amusement park.

429
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

430
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yier.

431
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's the meaning of this?

432
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I taught you

433
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the kungfu of the Qing State.

434
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
At least you got

435
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
a good lesson from me.

436
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You can't even hide

437
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the most outstanding moves.

438
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
How can you win it tomorrow?

439
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You should try it.

440
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll help you

441
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
with this.

442
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're asking for me for the first time?

443
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're doing this

444
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
for a man?

445
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He's always

446
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
by my side.

447
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He never

448
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
made me feel wronged.

449
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now,

450
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because I'm so affectionate,

451
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I have to

452
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
throw him out

453
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
no matter what.

454
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's a man of the imperial family.

455
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're sick in the capital.

456
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why do you

457
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
live like this?

458
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He's a completely different person.

459
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But my father

460
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
wants to marry him.

461
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
General,

462
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
as long as you can

463
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
save the Qing Army,

464
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can agree to

465
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
whatever the conditions are.

466
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What about you?

467
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What do you think?

468
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Your father

469
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
wants to marry him.

470
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So you agree?

471
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
General,

472
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
what do you mean?

473
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't know.

474
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I just want to

475
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
marry him.

476
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If you're willing,

477
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll do it.

478
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll let you know

479
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
how to get married.

480
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But I don't know

481
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
what you're thinking.

482
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You said

483
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to save Shao Qiming,

484
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
you can agree to whatever the conditions are.

485
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I heard that

486
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,800
the Ma Zui will be

487
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
a team in the third division.

488
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I wanted to

489
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
save the Ma Zui

490
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but I'm too late.

491
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I have to save the team

492
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and get the gold and silver.

493
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I know you have

494
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
a father.

495
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But I never mention it.

496
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Now,

497
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Shao Qiming is fighting with you again.

498
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll let you go again.

499
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you're not happy,

500
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you can kill me.

501
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I won't be embarrassed.

502
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you serious?

503
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Qin Hu.

504
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Are you okay?

505
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Big Wan you...

506
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Group.

507
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't want you and me to be together.

508
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Even if I kill you now,

509
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the dead won't come back.

510
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If you really want to make up for it,

511
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
let the three departments stop the incident of the armed assault and the murder.

512
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay.

513
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The incident of the armed assault and the murder

514
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
will never happen again.

515
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I will guard the side of the department

516
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and protect the safety of the wound.

517
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why is Miss so close to Xuan Lian?

518
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So you're here to fight with me for that Ye Nan's girl.

519
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But Brother Lie is the warrior of the north.

520
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The future wolf master.

521
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No one can fight with her.

522
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're poisoned.

523
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're a martial arts master, but you don't escape.

524
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I knew you had a purpose.

525
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So I added a little bit of softness in that incense.

526
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What are you doing?

527
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I want you to listen to me.

528
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Jing Ming,

529
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you used me to make her a criminal.

530
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're my person.

531
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you want to come, you can come and go.

532
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If you dare to let that young girl

533
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
protect me,

534
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I will make sure she won't die in the north.

535
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What's wrong?

536
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're in a bad mood.

537
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I heard you're in a bad mood.

538
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So I came to drink with you.

539
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's not good.

540
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I heard from Qing Kuo

541
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that she will compete with Miss Jun tomorrow.

542
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Are you helping Qing Kuo to make a plan?

543
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Or helping Miss Jun?

544
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you can't search the road,

545
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
you must go to the phone number.

546
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Then search the stop.

547
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Watch out for this sentence.

548
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Be careful not to make a mistake.

549
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Otherwise you can't search.

550
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Then turn around and click on the complete list.

551
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can get in after searching every time.

552
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
After getting in,

553
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
it's the hot house and the movie theater.

554
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you can't find it,

555
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you can search the right corner.

556
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The first time I asked for it,

557
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I was just gonna win.

558
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
She wanted that guard to come back to her side.

559
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can make a deal

560
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
with the other team.

561
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Isn't it nice?

562
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why are you unhappy?

563
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm afraid that guard will take her away.

564
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I still need to rely on her

565
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to find Jun Feifan.

566
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Is this your real idea?

567
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Or is it the trap you found yourself?

568
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
A'Li,

569
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
your concubine

570
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
can't be a woman of the same kind.

571
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Don't believe in too much.

572
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How about this?

573
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll go to the theater with you tomorrow.

574
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll keep an eye on you.

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Qin Mi.

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Xiaoxian.

577
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What happened to you lately?

578
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How could you be...

579
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, I'm fine.

580
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm fine.

581
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We should leave now.

582
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll escort you back to your home.

583
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No.

584
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I haven't got the key yet.

585
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I found the Prince of the King's name.

586
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
If we leave now,

587
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
all the deaths of our journey will be wasted.

588
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No.

589
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I won't let you and me separate.

590
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's leave here first.

591
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We'll figure it out.

592
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I've found the key.

593
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll go to the theater with you.

594
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll go to the theater with you.

595
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll go to the theater with you.

596
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll go to the theater with you.

597
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll figure it out.

598
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I've found the Prince of the King's name.

599
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But in the Beixuan Palace,

600
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
only Xuanli can help me get the key.

601
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Xiaoxian, don't you forget what happened to Qian Shan?

602
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Xuanli is a real man.

603
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
She's not a real man.

604
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You can't be with her.

605
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The Shang team is not his intention.

606
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The man of the Xins is a man.

607
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Besides, he promised to save you for me.

608
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The Shang team is a deal.

609
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
A deal?

610
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He's already said something

611
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
in the middle of the night.

612
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What happened in the real world?

613
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What happened?

614
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You find a place to hide.

615
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If the princess finds out you're not here,

616
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
she'll come to find you.

617
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Think of something.

618
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Please come to me.

619
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Be safe.

620
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Xingkou, Miss Xu Yan is a guest.

621
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You found her on the horseback.

622
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't lose your gift.

623
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Brother Lie,

624
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the competition is the competition.

625
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Even if she's a guest,

626
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I won't let her down.

627
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can't go in.

628
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
As long as you're safe,

629
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll win.

630
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I know.

631
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Brother Lie is so weak.

632
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The princess is a master of chess.

633
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll teach her a lesson today.

634
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Be careful.

635
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Be careful.

636
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't worry.

637
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you think they're good at chess?

638
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
After all, Miss Qi Luo is a hard-working girl.

639
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The princess has grown up on the horseback.

640
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
She must have a better reputation.

641
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's not certain.

642
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Miss Qi Luo,

643
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
no matter it's a strategy or a plan,

644
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
she's always thinking about her men.

645
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If Miss Xu Yan really wins,

646
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
will she leave with Shao Qi?

647
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You watch them.

648
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you get in,

649
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
you'll be punished immediately.

650
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes.

651
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Why did you come to Bi Xuan?

652
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
To kill you.

653
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I told Miss Qi and Shang Du.

654
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I didn't come back in person.

655
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You should leave now.

656
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Leave Bi Xuan.

657
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let go of Miss Qi Luo.

658
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We'll leave immediately.

659
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
She's staying by my side.

660
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can't take her away.

661
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't make a fool of me.

662
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're a traitor.

663
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
How can you keep her away?

664
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't worry about her.

665
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Go.

666
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's boring to fight in this place.

667
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why don't you go and kill the tiger?

668
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You can't kill the tiger.

669
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you succeed,

670
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll leave you alone.

671
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
She's been staying by my side for so long.

672
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I haven't raised you up.

673
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Are you too arrogant?

674
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

675
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Since you're so confident,

676
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
let's hide in the desert.

677
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's hide.

678
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Miss Qi Luo is your important person.

679
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm more important.

680
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Chief,

681
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the princess is leaving with Miss Luo.

682
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's go.

683
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is the entrance.

684
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We can take the tiger back later.

685
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Your Highness,

686
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the painting is good.

687
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Let's go.

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Go.

689
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Brother Liu,

690
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
let's go.

691
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I won.

692
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm happy to leave.

693
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Your Highness, I won the game.

694
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Please promise me.

695
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Who said you won?

696
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What's the meaning of this?

697
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm the princess of Beixuan.

698
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I can do anything.

699
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's none of your business.

700
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm the one who's been watching.

701
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't want to hide anything.

702
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Please.

703
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's share it.

704
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Brother Liu,

705
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
you're doing this for her.

706
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You're ruining our game.

707
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I won't.

708
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We're from Beixuan.

709
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Your beauty is so sweet.

710
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's good to let it go.

711
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You're not the one who's done this.

712
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Why did you only say me?

713
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You're right.

714
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's the princess I promised.

715
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Don't blame her.

716
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Come here.

717
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What are you doing?

718
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The evil spirit and the evil spirit.

719
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Send the Shaoqingmen back.

720
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yes.

721
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Qin Kou.

722
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A'Li.

723
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'll send her back.

724
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Please.

725
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm not leaving.

726
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She's my slave.

727
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I must take her away.

728
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
For a Shaoqingmen,

729
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
do you want to fight with your brother?

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I...

731
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What?

732
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He's the only one who's with me.

733
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I won't let her go.

734
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Don't make things worse.

735
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Otherwise, Your Majesty...

736
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What will you do to me?

737
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What about the Empress Dowager?

738
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If she knows about this,

739
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
she'll kill Shaoqingmen.

740
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Go back with me.

741
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Lian.

742
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Our chance has come.

743
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What?

744
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Someone wrote a letter to Jun Feifan.

745
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They said that

746
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
the military chief's sister Jun Qiluo

747
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
was in their hands.

748
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yes.

749
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But she was tortured.

750
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
She also asked Jun Feifan

751
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
to go to the Ministry of the Third Ministry

752
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in a limited time.

753
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Or else,

754
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Jun Qiluo would be killed.

755
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But Jun Qiluo is in the capital.

756
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Why would he show up in the Ministry of the Third Ministry?

757
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's a good idea.

758
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll send him back.

759
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Why would he show up in the Ministry of the Third Ministry?

760
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Jun Qiluo is cunning.

761
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He'll leave.

762
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The important thing is,

763
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you change the letter

764
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and send it to Uncle.

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're a bad boy.

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You can't be so anxious.

767
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
No, he still loves the woman.

768
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Jun Qiluo is Jun Feifan's sister.

769
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
By then,

770
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
aren't you afraid of him?

771
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't know

772
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
where Jun Feifan is at the most.

773
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't make things worse.

774
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm going to be a good cook this time.

775
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I asked him to escape once.

776
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I can't let him escape for the second time.

777
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Xiaoh Chiang,

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
is she Yang resting?

779
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,800
She IKEA assigned me

780
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
on thewentater meeting with Sixth Prince.

781
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Awesome.

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Boneless.

783
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Miss.

784
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Have you seen Qin Ming?

785
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He is still here

786
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
when I arrived early in the morning?

787
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I can't translation

788
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
the Lord to tell me

789
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
hisdling to the north conspiratorily.

790
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Miss.

791
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
the Fifth Ministry of escorted Unknown Order

792
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
will be in time.

793
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
His Majesty has called for me.

794
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,600
Xi Changkun will not let us in easily.

795
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
There's always a way.

796
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Young Master.

797
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,800
We have a secret team with a man with a stomachache.

798
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
A secret team?

799
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,680
The location is full of information and information.

800
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,800
There are two departments in the house.

801
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
The location is very complicated.

802
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Almost no place to enter.

803
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,080
If the evidence is really in the secret team,

804
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,320
we have to think of a safe plan.

805
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
Young Master, the palace is open.

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
Your Highness, you are in the palace right now.

807
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,280
What's the matter?

808
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,960
We just know that the West Department is fighting against the security forces.

809
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
I heard that it's a very serious matter.

810
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,360
It seems that someone can't do it.

811
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
General Lie.

812
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
General Lie.

813
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,280
Miss is eating the East.

814
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
What?

815
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,480
With the Shao Qi people.

816
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
What happened is not true.

817
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,000
Young Master,

818
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,880
it's not the time for Xi Changkun to be in the palace.

819
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,720
He Qun, you go to the palace to serve the order.

820
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,520
He Ji wants to follow me.

821
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Yes.

822
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,440
Your Excellency, according to your arrangement,

823
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,840
Shao Qi people have already gone to the secret team according to the information.

824
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,400
After the news of the girl in Yan Nan's business,

825
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,720
she immediately followed.

826
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Where is Li?

827
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
As you expected,

828
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,560
after General Lie and Miss De Zhi's leaving,

829
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
she also followed.

830
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Lian.

831
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,560
As long as you don't show up now,

832
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,240
I don't need to face you.

833
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
My Lord.

834
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,640
Do you dare to ask if this plan

835
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,240
is to attack Princess Qinghou?

836
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,560
Why are you asking like this?

837
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,120
When I just returned to the palace,

838
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,040
I saw Princess also going to the secret team.

839
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,560
Princess Qinghou left the palace without any reason.

840
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,040
She will definitely attract the attention of the Queen Mother.

841
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,640
If the Queen Mother orders to follow her,

842
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,440
it will be troublesome for her.

843
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Don't waste your time.

844
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,160
Before the black sky,

845
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,760
you must make the choice and avoid the forest.

846
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Yes.

847
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,760
My Lord, the secret team is ahead.

848
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
If we go in,

849
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
we will be caught in the trap.

850
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,960
We will also break your plan.

851
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,760
Sister, the oil will be in the oil.

852
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,960
The sky can only find people.

853
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Brother Li.

854
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
What are you doing here?

855
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,160
Someone saw my slave going to the forest.

856
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,760
He Ji Yao, take Princess back to the palace.

857
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Yes.

858
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,360
Find her. No one wants to take me away.

859
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,760
Princess, Qinghou.

860
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,160
My Lord, I will go after her.

861
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Wait a minute.

862
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
Don't go back to the secret team.

863
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,760
Take her to the mountain range.

864
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
I will go there.

865
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Yes.

866
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Qingming.

867
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
My Lady.

868
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
What are you doing here?

869
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,560
I saw the letter in your room.

870
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I said I wanted to find some gold and stone to come to the secret team.

871
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
It seems that the slave knows that you want to go to the secret team.

872
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,360
It's not a trap.

873
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
It's just a dream.

874
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,960
It's good that he wants to kill me.

875
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I also have a plan to report.

876
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
It's not him.

877
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
He doesn't have to do that.

878
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Besides, he doesn't know

879
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,560
that I want to find the key to the secret team.

880
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
My Lady.

881
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,160
You are in the dark now.

882
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
It's him.

883
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,960
But I know something about the days we spent together.

884
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,560
I don't have to do that.

885
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,960
But I have never seen anyone else

886
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
who went to the secret team.

887
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Except him.

888
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Who can send my letter to the secret team?

889
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,160
There is a miracle at this time.

890
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Let's leave here first.

891
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Let's leave here first.
