1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
A night wind Bush I have dance

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,600
frost

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,040
I koal past my eyebrows

4
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:24,720
Let's Todo time bear dedicated to

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,520
By the fool's side

6
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm willing to stay by your side

7
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,300
Waiting to Sweet Lily

8
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,960
Will not wander alone

9
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
General, from the pulse,

10
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
he should be a woman.

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
You just need to see the patient.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
No need to ask.

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
The land and the water are different.

14
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
It's as if the wound has not healed yet.

15
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
It's a hot poison.

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
No matter how badly the wound is treated,

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
it will be a disaster.

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
It's a dangerous life.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
There are no women in the army.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
You're the only one who can help.

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
There are no women in the army.

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
You're the only one who can help.

23
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I thought you were a real man.

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I didn't expect you to be the one who is sincere.

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Do you think I need to be sincere?

26
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Since you're awake,

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
you can take the medicine yourself.

28
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I'll take you to the valley tonight.

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Take care of the people in the army.

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Yes, Young Master.

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
And,

32
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
we'll go to the west tomorrow.

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
We haven't found the mastermind of the army.

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
We'll take the five people to the valley tonight.

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Yes.

36
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Yes.

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Yes.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Yes.

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Yes.

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Yes.

41
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Yes.

42
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Yes.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
We'll take the five people to the valley tonight.

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
We'll take the five people to the valley tonight.

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Yes.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Young Master.

47
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
We're going to choose the mastermind.

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
We should hurry back to Liangzhou and Wangcheng.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
We should hurry back to Liangzhou and Wangcheng.

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
We should hurry back to Liangzhou and Wangcheng.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
What are we going to do?

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
He said that Jun Feifan is in the west.

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
He can take us to him.

54
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Young Master.

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Didn't you say

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
that he can't believe what he said?

57
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
We should find Jun Feifan to take care of

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
the case of my parents.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
No matter what happens,

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
we have to take the risk.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,720
We don't have to worry about Mingjue.

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Young Master,

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
all the twins are going to leave.

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
You can go at any time.

65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Aye.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,880
You've been away for too long.

67
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm just afraid of being alone.

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,280
You have many generals.

69
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm afraid I'll run away.

70
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,080
No one can escape from me.

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
Except death.

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,000
Luo Qi.

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,680
Young Master.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Prepare a carriage.

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,560
Yes.

76
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,960
I'll go now.

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,160
My beloved child.

78
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
The way he escaped

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
is probably the best.

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,020
If you keep doing this do you still want to氣 me because you guys don't want that what you really want to do?

81
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,320
Now, what about you?

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,020
I wanted to give you a little bit of advice.

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm always so bothered.

84
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,320
Too good toっ just sleep alone isn't so good to you.

85
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,520
It may be so yummy, but I have to give this back.

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,720
Lu creatures are silly...

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Don't go down there.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,680
Pass on the

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,400
corn,

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,520
and.

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Look,

92
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,860
my🎶

93
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,020
What is wrong?

94
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,020
Go straight.

95
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,820
in front of the prison exit.

96
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,980
Stand still.

97
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,020
You...

98
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,220
This place is vast and quiet.

99
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,020
If General can bury you here,

100
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
it's a perfect place.

101
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,820
Father.

102
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,220
It's a perfect place to bury you.

103
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,020
It's a fire.

104
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Go by yourself.

105
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,420
You idiot!

106
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,020
Why hasn't Young Master come back yet?

107
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,220
General.

108
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,020
Young Master and that man

109
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,420
have been in the woods for a long time.

110
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,820
Why don't you send someone to find them?

111
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,820
They're going to kill the dead.

112
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,620
What?

113
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,820
Kill the dead?

114
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,220
You can come out by yourself.

115
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
You have to drag me out.

116
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,620
It's not as common as your snake blood.

117
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,820
Go.

118
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
What are you doing?

119
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,620
Don't bring it to me.

120
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,220
Prince Consort.

121
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,380
How could you spill your faith to Sartre?

122
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,580
This way, please.

123
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,600
So you're saying that Daoist Everyoneon was an anti- wasteland?

124
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,000
Why did it suddenly change now?

125
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you've been lying to me.

126
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Jun Feifan is not in Xixiang.

127
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Since it's late now,

128
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't need to lie to you anymore.

129
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know where Young Master is.

130
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
When Young Master left,

131
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
he said he wanted to meet me

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and gave me the letter of the execution.

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He wanted me to take this path

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
as his way.

135
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's all my fault.

136
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I met you.

137
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Where is he?

138
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How do I know?

139
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Which one of Miss Qiluo's words is true?

140
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Which one is false?

141
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What do you think?

142
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's okay.

143
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When we get out of here,

144
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
we'll have a good deal with each other.

145
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay.

146
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Take a rest.

147
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,700
Who'll they meet after leaving?

148
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,520
Who'll they meet after leaving?

149
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,120
Down there,

150
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,480
there will definitely wake an uppercut F cook tonight.

151
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,400
Who'll find us as best looking?

152
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Miss Li,

153
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,240
Mu Xiaotong has been dead

154
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,360
The man who was killed by the man in the night

155
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,120
disappeared from the dead.

156
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,240
The political leader was in a hurry.

157
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,160
Luo Qi was worried that the situation would change.

158
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
So he asked me to report to the internet.

159
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,600
He would lead the 12th Qing Qi

160
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,560
to search the Young Master's whereabouts secretly.

161
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,880
What did you say?

162
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,520
Brother Lie is missing?

163
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,760
Princess.

164
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,840
Brother Wang,

165
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,480
Brother Lie is the best warrior in the North Plains.

166
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,120
How could he be missing?

167
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,280
The leader was in a hurry.

168
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,440
Lie is missing.

169
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
The other parts of the tribe

170
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,640
are hard to avoid.

171
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,600
You lead some Qing soldiers

172
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
to help Luo Qi to find the person secretly.

173
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,280
Remember,

174
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,920
don't be too agitated.

175
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,880
Yes.

176
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Pass the order.

177
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,880
Xuan Lie,

178
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,200
lead the aunt to the private room.

179
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,880
You can leave now.

180
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,160
I want to go too.

181
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,400
Nonsense.

182
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
No matter where the three of us are,

183
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,400
if we are not punished,

184
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,880
how could you go to that place

185
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
without your money?

186
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,080
Brother Lie is a life-saving person.

187
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,920
He is missing.

188
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,840
I'll go to find him.

189
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,440
If you follow him,

190
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,040
he will take care of you.

191
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,640
How could you go to find Lie?

192
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,440
No one can stop me

193
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
for what I want to do.

194
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,600
You are the weapon of our private court.

195
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Xuan Lie found you.

196
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
Xida was also arrested.

197
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,160
Don't be angry, father.

198
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,680
Xida's family is in our hands.

199
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
She dares not to betray us.

200
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,280
But Xuan Li

201
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
can only be trusted by a dead person.

202
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,880
Let the matter to go out ourselves

203
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
by your chosen Prince.

204
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,520
Dad,

205
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,480
I heard a informant

206
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,880
that macht reissuesенс

207
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,040
the incident of Luo Qi and confiscates the Siatsu,

208
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
leaving the unseen path by the Diana and landing with his你們.

209
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
Xuan Lie also lives in her dead someone killed in the desert.

210
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,600
Dead?

211
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
As long as Xuanli is dead,

212
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,200
who else can fight with father?

213
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,880
If it's true,

214
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,040
it's good.

215
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Father,

216
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll send someone to guard the three departments

217
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
to the Liang State.

218
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,440
Even if Xuanli can get out of the desert,

219
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,760
I won't let him leave the three departments alive.

220
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,840
Good idea.

221
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,840
Although Xuanli is missing,

222
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,720
Qi Da still has to get out.

223
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
I'll go to Liang State first.

224
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,120
Wait for your good news.

225
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,520
Don't worry, father.

226
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Miss Qi Luo, you're awake.

227
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,680
Why are you still unconscious?

228
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,240
If I had picked you up in time,

229
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,040
you would have been killed by the wild wolf

230
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
and killed by the wolf.

231
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,040
What?

232
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
You didn't even say thank you?

233
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,200
You saved me

234
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,760
to thank me, didn't you?

235
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Why?

236
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,240
Because you have a wound on your leg.

237
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,560
You want to work with me

238
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,920
to get out of the desert.

239
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,520
Even if I lose both legs,

240
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,440
I can get out of the desert.

241
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,960
Yes.

242
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,560
I know you're good at it.

243
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,640
You're a good person.

244
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
But the wolf master of the five departments is in a hurry.

245
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,320
If you miss too much,

246
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
you might be disobeyed.

247
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
I'll kill you first.

248
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,560
I won't eat you again.

249
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm fine until I die.

250
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
I'm afraid that General Lian Lei will bury me.

251
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,360
If you don't deal with the wound on your leg,

252
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,680
you'll have a bad taste.

253
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,120
Don't say that I can't even get out of your leg.

254
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,240
I'm afraid that I can't even get out of it tonight.

255
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
Can you send me a hat?

256
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,400
I'll never let you

257
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
bury you in the desert again.

258
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

259
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm afraid you only treat Jun Feifan well.

260
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,640
I'm in the life of Young Master Jun Feifan.

261
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,000
If I run away in the desert,

262
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,120
Jun Feifan will die in the desert.

263
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,680
I'll never get the heart of Young Master.

264
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,400
It seems that this time I ran away.

265
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,080
Miss Qi Luo finally got to know the reality.

266
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,840
A weak woman is weak and weak.

267
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,200
If she wants to run away,

268
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,040
she'll have to wait for the desert.

269
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,280
Your wound on your leg is deep.

270
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,440
We still have to get out of the desert as soon as possible.

271
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,080
It's just a small wound.

272
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,600
Don't be too much.

273
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,680
Don't drink too much.

274
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Only this much water.

275
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
I saw the grass today.

276
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
There should be a water source nearby.

277
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
I'll look for it tomorrow.

278
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,000
I've never seen a girl like you.

279
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,320
The first reaction of the jade world

280
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,640
is how to deal with it.

281
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
It's not to be reported.

282
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,680
Have you ever thought about

283
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,040
the smart talent of a independent householder?

284
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,000
If you work hard,

285
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
you'll be saved on Jun Feifan.

286
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm a woman.

287
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,960
Young Master is a generation of jade.

288
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,600
He's a good businessman.

289
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,720
How could I be better than him?

290
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,800
No matter.

291
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
You're not confident with yourself.

292
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,120
You're not like your character.

293
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,760
We've known each other for days.

294
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,960
It seems like you know me well.

295
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,040
Although we've known each other for days,

296
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,920
I know Miss Qi Luo

297
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,720
is not a bad person.

298
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,280
Yan Nan is traditional.

299
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,680
A woman can't be called a man.

300
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,760
A man can't be called a woman.

301
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,600
Then you come to our Beixuan.

302
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,280
I'll announce it.

303
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,600
As long as I can be the person,

304
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,880
I'll be the man.

305
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
You treat me as a kid.

306
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,160
Yan Nan is as good as a fire.

307
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,120
If I really go to your Beixuan,

308
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,240
I'll be even more powerless.

309
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,000
When Yan Nan returns to our Beixuan,

310
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,360
I'll make sure everyone

311
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,840
can have a good time.

312
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,160
Father,

313
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,120
I heard from Uncle Lin

314
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,840
that the brother and the team

315
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
are going to the three departments to get news.

316
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,680
Impossible.

317
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,840
The brother is very smart.

318
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,640
And Brother Qi Ming is with them.

319
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
He won't be in trouble.

320
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,640
I'll take him to the three departments to find him.

321
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,800
Stop.

322
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,400
My hand is broken.

323
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,560
You just stay.

324
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,400
It's very urgent.

325
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
You are a girl!

326
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Yufan.

327
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,480
I was right.

328
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
If you are a woman,

329
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
you can't simply go and risk your life.

330
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
Is that it?

331
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,800
That's not what a landman should be.

332
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,040
Moreover,

333
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,720
if our council has someone to employ,

334
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,400
Why take the stands?

335
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,080
We can only take the results

336
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,040
if we're not in managed安 minimalism.

337
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,200
We'regi l at a fight now.

338
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
If we're not, aren't we ways out?

339
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,800
You're thinking too simple, aren't you?

340
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,000
But in force,

341
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,240
we are the ones who are qualified.

342
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,320
B stuff is a person you've never thought of.

343
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,020
The performance, your skill, your example

344
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,100
will not glide beyond reality.

345
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,260
Only you hard of being eaten up

346
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,540
andご moments of lost

347
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,660
can be shaped by such extreme letters.

348
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,240
Hard of being eaten up

349
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,380
andご moments of lost?

350
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,580
So you are only watching me this way.

351
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
funding.

352
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,220
Neither of you

353
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,180
is qualified as a man.

354
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,440
dedicated to the tiger family.

355
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,720
What do you think?

356
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,520
That's the best way

357
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,760
to defend He Hmmm

358
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,980
to witness the loss.

359
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,180
Beixuan's role

360
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
What happened to you?

361
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
Including the murder.

362
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
No one likes to kill me.

363
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,280
If you have no strength,

364
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,120
no matter how you want to take it,

365
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,360
even if you know it,

366
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,200
no one will listen to you.

367
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,400
If you have absolute strength,

368
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,440
no matter how you plan,

369
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,720
you will never be able to get out of the trap in front of the powerful.

370
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,960
Youth.

371
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,360
What are you waiting for?

372
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,120
Unless we're...

373
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Nice.

374
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,920
Halfway by,

375
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,440
let's go to the caves.

376
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,800
Go in first.

377
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
Jiang Jun will do you a favor

378
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,040
in bed.

379
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
What kind of person is he?

380
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Why does he want to find Jun Fei Fan?

381
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Many people might stopuneating

382
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
My throat hurts

383
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
My wound seems terribly painful

384
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,560
I lost her.

385
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,760
Leave here.

386
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,400
Song you'd better surrenderитель

387
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,480
for yourself.

388
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
You simply let Zui'er die all by yourself.

389
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,560
Although you have ten thousand life expectancy.

390
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,140
You had Si XingZu

391
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,400
in neighboring country,

392
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
I'll go.

393
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,040
You've tried it.

394
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,800
You can't get out.

395
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,000
Didn't you say

396
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,560
you'd go out of the desert together?

397
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,240
It wasn't delicious.

398
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,240
It doesn't taste good.

399
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,760
You should eat more.

400
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,280
Alright.

401
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,320
Give me a little bit.

402
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,920
More.

403
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,240
More.

404
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,740
But one thing,

405
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,440
у Belgian dishes couldn't be finished instantly.

406
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,000
But I noticed you ate it neatly for international Fighter diet

407
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,040
during your career.

408
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,560
Can you help me?

409
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,200
with [(a title)]

410
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,840
aaktive system ofад

411
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,160
Arrival程

412
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,200
What's in there?

413
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,640
Nothing.

414
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Run.

415
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,920
Come in.

416
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,700
experieben

417
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,240
Packed tea and supplements.

418
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,480
Someone from last night

419
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,040
saw an aluminium product in surround.

420
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,960
Where?

421
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,280
House at Northline .

422
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,180
Your Majesty.

423
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,320
I'll save Master's life

424
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,900
and resume affairs for the Czyliłšššivalma.

425
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,520
Have you forgotten the most valuable thing that spell Yu can help us Brother Huang?

426
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,720
You must be really thoroughly responsible for Lady Tian's illness

427
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,540
that she even reached out to remember this important case

428
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,100
without any play手 except just you and me.

429
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,480
Water qualities are also much more important than you.

430
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,380
I don't know what happened to Consort exhausting them.

431
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,920
Come on, don't go.

432
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,240
I'll come back later.

433
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
Let's go.

434
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Why are you back?

435
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,240
The woods are complicated.

436
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,200
I've been running far away.

437
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,480
I'd rather stay with you.

438
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
I'm angry now.

439
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,040
Be careful!

440
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
It's Sheriff!

441
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:30,120
Finally got vá

442
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:30,800
he!

443
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:31,920
These nine places

444
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,120
with thirty doctores

445
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,920
are all you and Li Xiangtou.

446
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,160
Who are they?

447
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,480
Am I right?

448
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,440
Yes.

449
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,640
But the letter is ballots.

450
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,480
That's a serious matter.

451
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,160
I am とん rob back,

452
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,460
then I will choose to lose

453
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,860
that nasty promoted person.

454
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,660
I don't know if my son Fei Fan is there.

455
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,700
Is it dangerous?

456
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,140
So...

457
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,340
Please help me find Fei Fan.

458
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,740
What are you doing?

459
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,260
Fei Fan hasn't developed Yan Nan economy.

460
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,860
That's a big deal.

461
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,620
Now that he's missing,

462
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,260
I'll find him as soon as possible.

463
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,460
You...

464
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,660
Aren't you scolding me?

465
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,900
My lord.

466
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,620
This...

467
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,300
Zhiyuan.

468
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,100
My lord.

469
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,780
Send some good men to the Ministry of Revenue.

470
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,900
We must find Jun Fei Fan.

471
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,020
Remember.

472
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Keep it a secret.

473
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,700
I'm just a good seller.

474
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,980
My uncle asked me to pay for it.

475
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,700
My brother,

476
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,420
where's my young master's face?

477
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,220
Your uncle has been in love with him.

478
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,180
If Jun Fei Fan is there...

479
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Jun Fei Fan?

480
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,660
I guess he won't come back in his life.

481
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,540
But my son,

482
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,220
we can't be too serious.

483
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,580
After all, he's just missing.

484
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,740
We don't know what's going on.

485
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,140
No matter what,

486
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,300
he's not going to do anything

487
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,580
if he takes my money.

488
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,420
At that time,

489
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,060
he'll be the head of the army.

490
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,180
My son,

491
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,580
it's a good show.

492
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,180
Let's start.

493
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,060
Yes.

494
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,180
My lord.

495
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,060
I'll get changed for you.

496
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,060
No need.

497
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,020
Put it here.

498
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,720
You were supposed to be in Wangcheng.

499
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,100
Why did you leave outside?

500
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,100
Luo Qi sent someone to Wangcheng.

501
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
When I got the message,

502
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,980
I searched for your master for the moment.

503
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,000
After I found Yao Cheng,

504
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,500
so far, I couldn't find it.

505
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,660
My lord is concerned about all the couriers and

506
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,660
just asked me to Uber to find you.

507
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,300
All the couriers should interest you now.

508
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,200
Especially Qi Chang Gu'an.

509
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,680
He must really know a lot about

510
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,580
your missing yours.

511
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,780
I'm afraid we can't keep

512
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,420
the missing thing from you.

513
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,740
Where's Luo Qi?

514
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,140
He has sent out the message.

515
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,700
Let him lead 12 Qing Qi to come here first.

516
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,860
The Xichang Palace is very secretive.

517
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,540
Without the missing treasure,

518
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,860
we won't be able to escape.

519
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,860
We still have time.

520
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,260
There's only one way to go.

521
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,580
I'm afraid we'll be in danger tonight.

522
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,140
Mr. Qi,

523
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,620
why don't you go with me?

524
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,260
No need.

525
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,860
He's here tonight.

526
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,540
He's saved me.

527
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,660
Don't you dare to take him with you.

528
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,380
Yes.

529
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,260
Okay.

530
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,380
It's the clothes Mmaless helped me change.

531
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,500
It's prompt enough to poison...

532
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,300
his blanc怎樣 Cheque,

533
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,620
Why did you change my clothes?

534
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,420
Don't you know

535
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,340
what other ways a man can be?

536
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,980
You're the real person of the military.

537
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,580
I'm not interested in

538
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,660
the woman I'm in.

539
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,260
I asked the kitchen maid

540
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,300
to change your clothes.

541
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,660
She didn't touch you.

542
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,660
Why did you

543
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,820
react so violently?

544
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,820
I'm a young master.

545
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
I'm going to protect myself

546
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
for you.

547
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
You lied to me

548
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,060
many times for your young master.

549
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,820
Why should I be the one to blame?

550
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
How dare you!

551
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,860
General, why do you need to be angry?

552
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,860
In this world,

553
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
I'm not a person

554
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
who knows you better than me.

555
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,860
I just can't tell you.

556
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
It doesn't mean I can't tell you.

557
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
The longer you take off the clothes,

558
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
the more I suspect

559
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
that you're a man of the military.

560
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Three months later,

561
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
the military's recruitment

562
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
will be held at the Chamber of Commerce.

563
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
It means that you

564
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
will definitely appear in the capital.

565
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
That's when I made my appointment.

566
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
How do you know that?

567
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,860
He will definitely appear

568
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
at the Chamber of Commerce.

569
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
He knows better than anyone else.

570
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
If he doesn't go back,

571
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
the military will definitely be in trouble.

572
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
The Chamber of Commerce

573
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
of the Heban Camp

574
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
and the people

575
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,860
won't support

576
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,860
the young master

577
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
to be the general manager.

578
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,860
The military will be in trouble.

579
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
The country that the young master

580
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,860
fought for

581
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
won't be allowed to be given to others.

582
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,860
So no matter where he is,

583
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
he must go back

584
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,860
to the capital of Yannan that day.

585
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,860
General,

586
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
that's your chance.

587
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
If you don't believe me,

588
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
you can ask someone to

589
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
tell me the truth.

590
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,860
In the desert,

591
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
you've been angry with me

592
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
for the sake of the military.

593
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,860
You've been angry with me for the sake of the military.

594
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Why are you so happy now?

595
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Because I want to understand one thing.

596
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
If you don't let me go,

597
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,860
I can't leave.

598
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,860
And you want to kill me

599
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
as a rebel.

600
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
No matter how serious I am to the young master,

601
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,860
I still can't resist my life.

602
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
You're a real person.

603
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,860
You're a real person.

604
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
The longer I've been with you,

605
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
you're a wonderful person.

606
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
You're a wonderful person.

607
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,860
The Long Ballad

608
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,860
The Long Ballad

609
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,860
The song in my heart

610
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,860
is the song that makes me cry

611
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,860
The song that makes me cry

612
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,860
The song that makes me cry

613
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:25,860
The song that makes me cry

614
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,860
The song that makes me cry

615
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
The road home

616
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,860
The road home

617
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,860
The memory of one piece by one piece

618
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,860
is in my heart

619
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:59,860
This is the past that I have been through

620
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,860
This is the past that I have been through

621
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:10,860
This is the past that I have been through

622
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:16,860
The stars are the stars that are in the past

623
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,860
I don't want to live, but I love to be in the dark

624
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:31,860
Let you be in my heart

625
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:43,860
Let you be in my heart

626
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,860
Let you be in my heart

627
00:44:52,860 --> 00:45:02,860
Let you be in my heart
