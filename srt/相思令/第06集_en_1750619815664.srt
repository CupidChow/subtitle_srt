Why is my heart burning so red

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,880
An empty dream

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm the exception for my enigmatic world

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Who will lineage the tenacious gone

16
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,040
How about you come up here to sleep?

17
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,960
The Mage Maid Shin is not crstocky

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
and could see your son.

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,080
Go eat something.

20
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,280
Commandant, how are things?

21
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,760
Lord Sun.

22
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,560
The General is olho for watches.

23
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
What do you think of her?

24
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,000
Mr. Sun,

25
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,160
I found a medicine

26
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,600
in the mountain with General Lie yesterday.

27
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,360
It's not a problem.

28
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,360
You can't blame her.

29
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,200
She knows business.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
She's not good

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,000
when she's sick.

32
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,200
I sent 12 relatives

34
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
to the Three Kingdoms to find her.

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,360
General!

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,800
What do you think?

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
We ran to the small pharmacy last night.

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,520
We didn't find anything.

39
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
I feel like

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
I couldn't find the medicine

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,000
on the Academy of Medicine

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,640
to keep up with her.

43
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,160
No matter what,

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
it won't freed by me.

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
Order to kill yourself.

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
We still have not realise

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
if you're dead or alive.

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
If we're still alive

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,000
why should we say

51
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,960
we found restless medicines

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,720
at the 같이 withime?

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Go and talk person.

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,640
Miss Qi thinks

55
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,720
that General Lie

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
is gonna be established

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,400
with a government mechanism to solve the problem

58
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
and took a toxic drug

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,080
in الل 선� zinc cube in the street.

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,240
I thought it's aGOC of poison.

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
Who knew

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,280
it might be worse

63
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,800
if we get can Yamaguchi into jail.

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,320
Hi, Lord Xi.

65
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,240
Stop them.

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,880
Yes, your Highness.

67
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,200
No.

68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,160
Quick.

69
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
Let the doctor prescribe more medicines.

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,320
Master Sun,

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
how well you perform,

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
you are sent to the Mountain Hope,

73
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,440
where you can experiment for appetite with the中国 personal alchemy.

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:17,760
I met

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,960
General Lie yesterday.

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,160
I asked someone to buy it for me.

77
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
Mr. Xi,

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,760
you must be deceived.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,200
It's a human body.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
How can it be a spirit?

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Impossible.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
General Lie and I

83
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,240
intentionally took a human body

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,080
and stepped on the wild spirit.

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,760
Today, a human body appeared

86
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,080
in the box of Lord Xi.

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
If I'm right,

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,760
we pushed the snake down yesterday

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,440
because Lord Xi was the one who pushed it.

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
Miss Qin,

91
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
what's the meaning of this?

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
General Lie and I

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,700
searched for

94
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,960
the body of all the isto berries in Liangzhou todavía.

95
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,000
Its power was dimmed

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
and people were buried 10 days earlier.

97
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,160
Yesterday, we headed to Mount Qi and stepped on the petal.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,640
The person who bumped went to the dead body

99
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,480
because he climbed it just before night.

100
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,060
Lord Xi and I

101
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,880
both took the动ong pot

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
that took the human body.

103
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,420
There's no other way.

104
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,240
We dug the dark cave

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
up and climbed the mountain.

106
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,740
I tied the hairpin

107
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,160
as I was going to say it to him,

108
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
but he was too angry

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,100
and threw away the nota.

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,440
I'm worried if he 가지고 dış

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,600
the steam above the remove.

112
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,560
How dare you fool the people of Liangzhou?

113
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,680
Miss Qi,

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
if you don't have any evidence,

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,080
you can't cause trouble.

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,520
Bring it up.

117
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,640
Tell me.

118
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,040
What's going on?

119
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,000
My lord,

120
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,040
ten days ago,

121
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
someone came to the city and bought all the primordial herbs.

122
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,520
That doesn't mean we bought them.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,960
I can recognize the primordial herbs.

124
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,480
The primordial herbs are from the Three Realms.

125
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
This primordial herb is very hard to find.

126
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
It's good for your health.

127
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
These are the primordial herbs.

128
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,640
What's going on?

129
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,320
The primordial herbs and the root of the life

130
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
are very similar.

131
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,240
Zhao Ming,

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
you sent someone to find a primordial herb.

133
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,360
It's similar to the primordial herb.

134
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Go to the Qishan to find a duck to buy it.

135
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,640
My lord,

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,600
please go to the biggest drug store in the city tomorrow.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,120
They will find someone to guard the room

138
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,960
for the safety of the primordial herbs.

139
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,600
If you want to move the tiger,

140
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
you must hurry and get it.

141
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,640
But how do you make sure

142
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
they will get it?

143
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Qi Changkun will not.

144
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
But Xin Mo will.

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Likewise,

146
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,240
return the mung bean shares.

147
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,440
Is it possible

148
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
that you deliberately

149
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
intends to get the prefectural seal?

150
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,520
My lord.

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,220
¡±±±±±± Princessako

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,040
Tell

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,600
him to stopsewing the sp avoiding me this time,

154
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,400
I can't let him

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,680
have the chance to

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
pay for the lives of the liangzhou people.

157
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,520
Tell everyone

158
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,760
who has thrown a party this morning.

159
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,240
It's this minister who said that the Yin's room can't be opened.

160
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,360
He wants us to go to the compensation fund.

161
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,560
Someone gave me a sum of money.

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
He wants me to put the dead animal fur on the cloth.

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
I don't know if these fur-grabbing shoes will cause any illness.

164
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
Lord Xi,

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,000
while the three soldiers are still unable to work,

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,040
while the merchants are still here to pay,

167
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm glad that I convinced you to come.

168
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,800
Otherwise, the Yin's room won't be able to be opened.

169
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,400
If it's Lord Xi who has already taken out the body

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,360
and get Lord Sun's life,

171
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,640
will you be happy?

172
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,720
You two are so cruel.

173
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,200
For your own sake,

174
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
it's our people's life and not ours.

175
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
Even if you are my cousin,

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,200
I will also make a public road for the people of Liangzhou.

177
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't go!

178
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,600
If you want to go, just leave Liangzhou!

179
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,360
Sister Qi, how do I look?

180
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
You look so good.

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,920
You are not only good at martial arts, but also good at acting.

182
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
Miss Qi Luo, you are indeed a businessman.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
This morning, I went to the pharmacy.

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,080
No matter what, the owner of the pharmacy

185
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,800
refused to sell Xichang Kun.

186
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,560
Later, I paid two times the price according to what you said.

187
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,440
Then I gave them the good-looking palace servant's card.

188
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,520
I immediately agreed.

189
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,680
Miss Qi Luo, how do you know that Xichang Kun will definitely find that owner?

190
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,920
People like Xichang Kun are highly regarded.

191
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
The most important thing is reputation.

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,280
So he only wants to find the highest owner.

193
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,960
He can't see ordinary pharmacy.

194
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,080
But he is just keeping the price of the wind and water.

195
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
He is afraid that he will be in trouble.

196
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,560
Who let them enter our people's lives?

197
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Luckily, this is a very dangerous situation.

198
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Otherwise, I will definitely send them to the top.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,040
Sister Qi Luo, this time, it's good that you are here.

200
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,600
Since I knew that they would buy away all the money and go to the department office,

201
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
they are gradually falling into the trap.

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,280
But it's really dangerous to go to Qishan.

203
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,760
The higher the risk, the higher the return.

204
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,960
Doing business like this, other things are the same.

205
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,200
When the people are better,

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
the ward can also be opened in a good way.

207
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
General Lie, Lord Sun invited you to the study room.

208
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,200
Lord, you are looking for me?

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,360
General Lie, come, come. Please come in.

210
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,120
General Lie, please sit.

211
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,560
Sit.

212
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,760
General Lie, you have been sleeping with me for two weeks.

213
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,280
You have brought the army provisions.

214
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,040
You also helped to summon them to open the ward.

215
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,720
Now, you have broken the conspiracy of Qishan Kun.

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,760
You have solved the problem of the master window.

217
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,080
I thank you for the people of Liang State.

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Lord Sun, you don't need to thank me.

219
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
I am the leader.

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,200
Protecting the people is my responsibility.

221
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,640
Qishan Kun has done such a thing to the people of Liang State.

222
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,760
I can't support him.

223
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
But now, every state and every country is in power.

224
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,640
It's not completely up to the king's order.

225
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,600
If General Lie takes the leader,

226
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,320
and helps His Majesty to take power,

227
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,120
it will be difficult.

228
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,880
Are you ready?

229
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,880
It's my parents' wish to help His Majesty to take the military power.

230
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,400
No matter how difficult it is, I won't give up.

231
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,360
Back then, General Xuan and his wife

232
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
had been working for this matter for many years.

233
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,360
But it has already been a long time.

234
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,520
Lord Sun, that is really an accident.

235
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,080
My parents were in the third division of the imperial army.

236
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,200
Lord Sun was the first to dare to take the position.

237
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,960
Did you really not find anything?

238
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,520
Lord Sun, I have the same position as the brother.

239
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,840
I am sure that I will win the position of the leader.

240
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,280
I promise you that if you become the leader of the Sun Tribe,

241
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,800
I will definitely protect him.

242
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
At the time, when I drove to a small city...

243
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,200
Go...

244
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Go...

245
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
OK, I'll...

246
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,160
OK.

247
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
It's fine.

248
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,040
Let's go.

249
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
I will take the throne back.

250
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,440
But back then, I was afraid that the fire would go up.

251
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,040
So I kept it.

252
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,440
I didn't mention it to anyone.

253
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,040
But now, Xichang Kun has taken the power.

254
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
He has ruined the lives of the people.

255
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
I think it's time for me to express my gratitude.

256
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Do you know what the meaning of this throne means?

257
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
The time has passed so quickly.

258
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I have to go back to the capital.

259
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I will go back to the capital.

260
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
After so many years of things,

261
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,440
I have also been able to bear the consequences.

262
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,040
But now, I don't have any discovery.

263
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,440
Mo Qi, have you seen a similar map in Beixuan?

264
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
Yes.

265
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,640
Young Master.

266
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,840
Where did this come from?

267
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,040
That day, I came to assassinate the opponent.

268
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
That death was a suicide.

269
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,440
He saw our situation and was taken to the capital.

270
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,840
I saw that there was only a person who didn't have a suicide.

271
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,640
So I changed it.

272
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
Young Master,

273
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
is the behind the scenes of this military case

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,640
possible to be related to the case of

275
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
the leader and the wife of the people?

276
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,240
They are the weapons of the people of the hundred-power army.

277
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,640
In this way, Beixuan and Ye Nan have already been in the past.

278
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Someone in Beixuan colluded with the people of the hundred-power army.

279
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,640
It seems that only if I catch the military bandits

280
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,040
can I get the answer.

281
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
We have to go.

282
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,440
General, what do you want to see me about tonight?

283
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,840
It must be Luo Qi's birthday.

284
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,040
Sometimes, she likes to see a picture of her.

285
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
I want to ask Xiu Niang to help her show it.

286
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
Is that okay?

287
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,640
What kind of picture does Luo Qi like?

288
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,440
No problem. Arrange it.

289
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,640
Miss Qi Luo, have you seen this picture?

290
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,040
No.

291
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
You have been with Young Master for many years.

292
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,640
You have seen many things.

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Have you ever seen it?

294
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,240
Is this a fish or a cat?

295
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,640
Forget it. It's late at night. I won't bother you anymore.

296
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Go to bed early.

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I will.

298
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,040
My Lord, Young Master is waiting for you in the kitchen.

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Lord Zhang, you are too official.

300
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Lord Zhang.

301
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
Lord Zhang, you are here.

302
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,640
Come and sit.

303
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,640
Come, Lord Zhang.

304
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,040
Why did Young Master Yujie ask me to come here this time?

305
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,840
Actually, it's nothing.

306
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,240
I heard from Uncle that

307
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
after my brother disappeared,

308
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,440
the Prime Minister went to look for him.

309
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,240
So, I was a little worried about this birthday.

310
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,840
But I also know that the Prime Minister is busy with business.

311
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
He wouldn't dare to disturb me.

312
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
But I think that you are also the Prime Minister's man.

313
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,440
If you can come, you are also lucky to be here.

314
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,040
Come.

315
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,240
Young Master Yujie, you are welcome.

316
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Why are you so sad?

317
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
Everyone knows that my brother is very good at business.

318
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,240
He keeps following me around.

319
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,840
He is like a wood.

320
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,240
He could have been around me for a lifetime.

321
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,440
But who knows that he is such a man?

322
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,440
My Lord, but this is what I want to say.

323
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,240
My brother used to have the protection and support of the Prime Minister.

324
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,040
That's why he can let the Jun Family go to today.

325
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,840
My Lord, you said that if my brother can't come back,

326
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,040
and my Jun Yujie is the only one who can be the bloodline of the Jun Family,

327
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,040
I wonder if the Prime Minister can still support him.

328
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
I understand.

329
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
Young Master Yujie asked me to come here to ask you this time.

330
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
If Jun Fei Fan is gone,

331
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,440
will the Prime Minister support you

332
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,640
and be the Chief Minister of the Jun Family?

333
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,040
Right?

334
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,640
My Lord, you are really not a person who can be the Prime Minister.

335
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,240
I can't hide anything from you.

336
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,840
Actually, I am also thinking about the economic development of our Yan State.

337
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,440
Our Jun Family is really thinking about the Yan State.

338
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
But the whole world can see it.

339
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,640
Young Master Yujie, I understand.

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,040
The reason why the Prime Minister supports the Jun Family's Chief Minister

341
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,240
is because Jun Fei Fan did indeed make some mistakes.

342
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,240
If Young Master Yujie wants to let the Prime Minister support you,

343
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,040
let's not say that he can surpass Jun Fei Fan.

344
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,040
At least, if you want to take out a little bit of what you see,

345
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,640
what do you think?

346
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Young Master Zheng!

347
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Don't worry.

348
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,640
My Jun Yujie will definitely be the one to do everything in his power.

349
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,040
Is this nice?

350
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,240
It's nice.

351
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
I'll buy you this.

352
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
How much is this?

353
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,840
One yuan per person.

354
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,640
I just want to let the Princess out of here.

355
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,440
The people in the blood will come to find her.

356
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
They are all so cheap.

357
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm having fun.

358
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,640
I'll take you to a fun place.

359
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
Come on!

360
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
You two are playing hide-and-seek.

361
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,840
You can't do it, right?

362
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,840
That way. That way.

363
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,240
Go!

364
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,640
You're so slow.

365
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Come on! Come on!

366
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,040
Look! Look!

367
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
The more you pull, the bigger it is.

368
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,040
The lower it is, the smaller it is.

369
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,640
The more you pull, the lower it is.

370
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Come on!

371
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
Here! Here!

372
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,040
Stop!

373
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Look! Look!

374
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,640
Hey!

375
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,840
Stop!

376
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
It's okay.

377
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,840
You can do it.

378
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Come back here and do your best.

379
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,440
Come on! Come on!

380
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,840
What are you doing?

381
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,440
Come on! Come on!

382
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,640
What a pity!

383
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Come on!

384
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,040
Come on! Come on!

385
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
Come on! Come on!

386
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Keep playing hide-and-seek.

387
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Stop playing hide-and-seek.

388
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,040
Keep playing hide-and-seek.

389
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm playing hide-and-seek.

390
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,760
Open the box.

391
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,440
Sure.

392
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Okay!

393
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,640
Hey!

394
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Come on!

395
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,840
flames

396
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,360
smoke

397
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,040

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,580

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,380
Tekkgentle studies must pass

401
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,060
Teacher

402
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,020
Teacher

403
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,380
he owes us money

404
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,520
Give me the money!

405
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
You're old enough to pay for everything!

406
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,000
You're old enough to pay for everything!

407
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,800
What do you mean?

408
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
All these money

409
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,360
are mine?

410
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
It turns out you're so simple!

411
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,400
You're playing with me?

412
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
You're playing with me?

413
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,800
You're so noisy!

414
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,560
Get out of here!

415
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,080
You're so noisy!

416
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,200
This is the princess of North County.

417
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,200
Who are you?

418
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,920
Beat him up!

419
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Beat him up!

420
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,760
What are you doing?

421
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,560
Get out of here.

422
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Beat him up!

423
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
He deserves to be beaten!

424
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Beat him up!

425
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Come on.

426
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Come on.

427
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Come on.

428
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Come on.

429
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Come on.

430
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Nice job.

431
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
You're doing fine anyway.

432
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,400
It's my favorite,

433
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,640
and you work Lamidly good for him.

434
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,240
Where's your money?

435
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,720
I can't even bother them

436
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,960
so they'll split it up.

437
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,560
Why don't you thank Princess of North County?

438
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,220
Thank you, Princess of North County.

439
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Thank you, Princess of Thurston.

440
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,600
Thank you, Princess of Thurston.

441
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm disappointing you.

442
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

443
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

444
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

445
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Keep it up.

446
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Over there.

447
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Keep it up.

448
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Keep it up.

449
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Keep it up.

450
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Miss Qi.

451
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
How is the preparation?

452
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
It's done.

453
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
This recommendation letter

454
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
is for the leader to hand it over to the military's family

455
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
to the military's city commander.

456
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Miss Qi, don't worry.

457
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I promise to complete the mission.

458
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
We'll set off then.

459
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Okay.

460
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Sister.

461
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Come.

462
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm really sorry, sister.

463
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
I forgot

464
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
that you asked me to find the original stone.

465
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
I asked my father

466
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
to bring all the original stones.

467
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Look at what you want.

468
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
I'll go and find it.

469
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
These are all the original stones

470
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
in Liangzhou?

471
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Yes.

472
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
They're all black.

473
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
They're all here.

474
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
How is it?

475
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Do you have the original stone?

476
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
But

477
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
they're all here.

478
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It's late.

479
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
You should go back and rest.

480
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Then you should go back and rest.

481
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
Young Master.

482
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
The military's goods

483
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
are left in Liangzhou

484
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
according to Miss Qi Luo.

485
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
It's the birthday gift from Madam Sun.

486
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Thanks to Miss Qi Luo,

487
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
this mission is really worth it.

488
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Miss Qi Luo is not only a loyal person,

489
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
but also a model and a professional.

490
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
She even solved the problem

491
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
of the disease.

492
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Miss Qi Luo

493
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
is really a lucky girl.

494
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I made this silver room

495
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
by myself.

496
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
I'll take care of it

497
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
when something happens.

498
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
I believe you.

499
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Are you willing to bet?

500
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
General.

501
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Really?

502
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Can I let go of my hand?

503
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
No way.

504
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Young Master, smile.

505
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Young Master.

506
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Have you ever thought of

507
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
what kind of way

508
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
to thank Miss Qi Luo?

509
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
What's your suggestion?

510
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
We usually

511
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
thank soldiers

512
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,640
for their contribution to the beauty.

513
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
I don't know

514
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
what Miss Qi Luo likes.

515
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
But she must like flowers.

516
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
They're beautiful.

517
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
So, Young Master,

518
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
you can send flowers to Miss Qi Luo.

519
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
You're so mean.

520
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Leave.

521
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
General.

522
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
What's making you here?

523
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
The officer is angry

524
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
and has stoppedELray our office.

525
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Grandmaster.

526
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Please handle this case.

527
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
广告!

528
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
What's going on?

529
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
General.

530
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Why you again?

531
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,600
If it weren't for you,

532
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Sunba wouldn't have expressed it so quickly.

533
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,760
So I want to thank you personally.

534
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,440
I heard that in Yannan,

535
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,680
there is a man in the flower garden.

536
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,680
Here you are.

537
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
Thank you, General.

538
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,280
Okay.

539
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,200
You may go.

540
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,560
Then...

541
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,120
can I take that too?

542
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,080
Yes.

543
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,280
Fuck off!

544
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Give it to me.

545
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,080
Fluff the rice.

546
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,480
I should have the one who bought it earlier.

547
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,880
It's mine!

548
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,160
Give it to me.

549
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Take it all.

550
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
She's a girl.

551
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,600
But she's a man.

552
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
She's not a man.

553
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,600
Xuan Lie is a smart girl.

554
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,720
She often comes to visit.

555
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,440
If she insists on wearing a man's dress,

556
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,200
she'll suspect I'm a woman.

557
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,440
She must be used to being a woman.

558
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,800
She can't be bullied.

559
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,240
Sister Qi,

560
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
you really don't think

561
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
you're doing something for me in Liang State?

562
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
The people in Liang State need you.

563
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,280
I have an appointment with General.

564
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Ming Ming,

565
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
you're a man of the face of General Lie.

566
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
You're unreasonable.

567
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
Who doesn't want to stay if you have talent?

568
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,360
Besides, I'm going to be the leader.

569
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,760
Of course I'll get the talent.

570
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,800
Ming Ming,

571
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,680
the sky is bright.

572
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,520
Don't delay the general's trip.

573
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,960
Sister Qi,

574
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,800
wait for me in the capital.

575
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,400
I'll go to you when I have time.

576
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,000
Okay.

577
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,200
Lord Song,

578
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,560
let's meet in the capital.

579
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,800
Be careful.

580
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,080
Run紹ly.

581
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,680
quer?

582
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,280
Notology people,

583
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,560
I think your people only care about me.

584
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,960
Mushroom.

585
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,280
Good.

586
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,960
Enough of that.

587
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,000
Enough.

588
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,840
Master,

589
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
please get back to work.

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,960
You're late.

591
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Master,

592
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,840
Master!

593
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,960
You're blind.

594
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,760
How could it be?

595
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,880
I don't understand.

596
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,080
Why would the Grand Master

597
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,720
give such an important thing

598
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
to a person who can't even open his eyes?

599
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,880
Can you see it?

600
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,680
You have to look at it.

601
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,960
Mr. Yu,

602
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,120
I can't open my eyes.

603
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,000
But I'm so quiet.

604
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,400
All the orders of the account today

605
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,320
are from me and the chief

606
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,560
who made the decision to take them away.

607
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,560
What kind of

608
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,960
secret code is this?

609
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,960
Mr. Ling,

610
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,440
I heard you were suspecting me.

611
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,200
No, no, no.

612
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,240
I'm just a military officer.

613
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,680
I'm just trying to scare you.

614
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,760
That's not what I mean.

615
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,440
Fine.

616
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,680
To save the money,

617
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,920
you should give this property back to me.

618
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,120
Master, master.

619
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm the chief of the jewelry store.

620
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,840
You're an outsider.

621
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,040
I don't believe you.

622
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,080
Our military business

623
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,240
is so big.

624
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,120
I can't watch him

625
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,680
destroy a stranger's jewelry store.

626
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Impossible.

627
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,440
My son is right.

628
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,680
Give the money back to me.

629
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,880
I'm not smart enough.

630
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
If Master comes back,

631
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,040
he'll be guilty

632
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,360
if he doesn't see the money.

633
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,400
Look at you.

634
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,520
You're so careless.

635
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,960
Ling,

636
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,120
you're always

637
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,440
a smart man.

638
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,760
Thank you, Master.

639
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,040
Don't worry.

640
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,720
When the big brother and Feifan come back,

641
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
we'll definitely teach them a lesson.

642
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,280
What?

643
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,960
Yue'er and I are military officers.

644
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,920
Are you afraid

645
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,200
we'll be late for the lesson?

646
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,400
That's what I mean.

647
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,880
No, no, no.

648
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,760
Master,

649
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,880
please forgive me.

650
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,760
I can't teach you a lesson.

651
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,280
Ling, you're so bold.

652
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,640
I won't let you go.

653
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,360
That's not what I mean.

654
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,560
Ling, you're so careless.

655
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm so angry today.

656
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm telling you.

657
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,320
Don't be a judge.

658
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,800
Don't make me jump.

659
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,880
Stop him.

660
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,600
Master.

661
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,600
Don't run.

662
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
You...

663
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,960
Go get him.

664
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,440
Stand there.

665
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,320
Stand there.

666
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,240
Mr. A Fa!

667
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,520
Mr. A Fa!

668
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,520
Hello!

669
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,840
Mr. A fa!

670
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,040
My waist...

671
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,320
Mr. A Fa!

672
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,560
Is your drum cock wrong again?

673
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,720
Okay.

674
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,720
The berserk PH- looking.

675
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
You're so rude.

676
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
My father is your brother.

677
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,640
Your father is my brother.

678
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,880
Is that what you're talking about?

679
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,080
Second uncle,

680
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,400
my father is your brother.

681
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,240
If he's not around,

682
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,680
you can come to his house and steal things.

683
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,840
Is my grandfather and grandmother

684
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
that how to teach you?

685
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,040
Junjiaojun,

686
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,640
our Jun family

687
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,760
has always allowed

688
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,160
women to interfere in business.

689
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,800
You're doing this

690
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,600
as a family member.

691
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,800
You should kneel down.

692
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,480
Of course I won't interfere in Jun's business.

693
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,200
But this wealth and this inkstone

694
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,000
are all my Jun family's assets.

695
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,160
If you want to take it away,

696
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,600
you must have your father's own money.

697
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
I'm here today.

698
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,320
Don't talk about this wealth.

699
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,200
It's just a piece of grass.

700
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,280
Brother Tang and uncle

701
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,200
are also trying to take it away.

702
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,640
That's right.

703
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,200
Third sister,

704
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,200
Brother Tang,

705
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,120
Second uncle,

706
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,600
what's wrong with you?

707
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,840
We're all family members.

708
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,760
We can't talk about anything.

709
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,240
Why are you making this up?

710
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,040
Second sister,

711
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,560
you don't have to talk to them.

712
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,880
Do you have your own family members

713
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,720
to steal things?

714
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,240
If you don't leave,

715
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,280
I'll report to the government.

716
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,120
I'll tell the government

717
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,320
that you two are in the mansion.

718
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,240
Jun Jiang Jun,

719
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,720
I'm telling you.

720
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,640
I'm telling you.

721
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,240
I'm telling you.

722
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm telling you.

723
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,520
I'm telling you.

724
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,800
I must take away

725
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,640
this property today.

726
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,960
Who's to blame for my father's death?

727
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,520
You two, calm down.

728
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,120
Calm down.

729
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,840
You...

730
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,560
You...

731
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,760
Second sister.

732
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,320
Second sister, how are you?

733
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,200
My son.

734
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,320
Are you okay?

735
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,440
Hold them in your hands.

736
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,960
Second disregarded,

737
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,240
their first and last arrival

738
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,920
are now planned.

739
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,280
Taxes and boats

740
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,920
make no worry.

741
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,880
We must start them.

742
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,960
Let's do it.

743
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,560
what is totally an trumpet for

744
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,760
Make it study

745
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,360
No

746
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,440
No

747
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,160
Move

748
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,120
Apply on your clothes

749
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm exercising

750
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,520
I love you

751
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Yes, Young Master.

752
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Young Master asked us to serve you.

753
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,280
If you need anything, please let us know.

754
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,280
You two, go and get the clothes for the lady.

755
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Yes.

756
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
You two go get the food.

757
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Young Master will come to serve you later.

758
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Yes.

759
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
As for you,

760
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
a man in the dark

761
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
is not suitable to stay in the house.

762
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
You go and wait outside.

763
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
Open the door.

764
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Yes.

765
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Miss Qi Luo is interested in this palace.

766
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
I just think this palace is very special.

767
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
It's like a silk.

768
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Miss Qi Luo is indeed a woman

769
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
who is raised by the military.

770
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
This is the special silk made by the North Xuan.

771
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
It's more than any other palace.

772
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
How is it?

773
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
I don't know about the palace.

774
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I just heard from Young Master.

775
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
This silk is more delicate than the silk.

776
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
It's not warmer.

777
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,280
These ladies are here to serve you.

778
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
If you're not used to it,

779
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
just tell me.

780
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
I'm used to it.

781
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
I don't need so many people to serve me.

782
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
I think she's standing at the door.

783
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
It's a little bit of a warmth.

784
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Let her come in and serve me alone.

785
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Miss, you don't know

786
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
that the half of the Eastern Courtyard is full of Yan Nan blood.

787
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
How can she serve you in the house?

788
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
It's almost like she's a man in the dark.

789
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
So the woman in the dark

790
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,280
is only a man in the manor.

791
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Hurry and go down.

792
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
You all go down.

793
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Yes.

794
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
You go in first.

795
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Thank you for your kindness.

796
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
I'll make sure to serve you well

797
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
in the future.

798
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
This is the quality of the Yan Nan Army's

799
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
imperial guards' house.

800
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Why did you hide it?

801
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Is it embarrassing to wear it?

802
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
No, Miss.

803
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
My mother left it to me.

804
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
My mother is a man in the Yan Nan Army.

805
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
I'm a man in the Yan Nan Army.

806
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
I'm not being treated by anyone in the North.

807
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
I'll wear it in the future.

808
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Why not?

809
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
The Yan Nan Army

810
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
is a man in the Yan Nan Army.

811
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
It's not a good thing.

812
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
The quality of the Yan Nan Army

813
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
is the best in the world.

814
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
It's such a good thing.

815
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
People can't get what they want.

816
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Right, General?

817
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I don't want to live in the dark.

818
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Let you be in my heart.

819
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Let you be in my heart.

820
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Let you be in my heart.
