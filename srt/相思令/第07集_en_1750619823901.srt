1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The you

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,860
Don't worry, I surely will return to the table to eat our meal.

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,700
Just let me enjoy it.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,700
I will write a letter to you.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,420
Three, two, one!

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,180
I love you, Li Dingqian.

7
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:45,400
лет

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm from Yan Nan.

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm from Yan Nan,

10
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
from Beixuan,

11
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
and I'm not being treated by others.

12
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,520
I won't wear it anymore.

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Why not?

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,720
The quality of the Yan Nan army

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,040
is so good.

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,440
It's such a good thing.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Other people can't get it.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Right, General?

19
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,280
Don't be afraid.

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm a businessman from Yan Nan.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280
Miss,

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
you're a businessman from the army.

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,680
My mother told me the story of the army before.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,920
The general of the army, Jun Feifan,

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
is a businessman from the army.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,720
He became the first in Yan Nan

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
and was very friendly.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,440
Dongyin, shut up.

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,720
I didn't expect that the name of the young master

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,880
would be so famous.

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,680
Young master Junjia

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
is a good man.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
You've said the legend of Jun Feifan.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,240
I don't think Miss Qiluo is good at it.

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,520
She's not worse than Jun Feifan.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
You're too much.

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
How can I compare with you?

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
I've prepared

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
a special dish for you.

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Try it.

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
Why do you treat me so well?

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm just a little bit too much.

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
Don't be too much.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
What else do you need?

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,640
I'll ask the servants

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
to prepare it for you.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,480
Seeing these dishes from Beijing

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,560
reminds me of the red bean soup in Yan Nan.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,360
In Yan Nan,

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
red bean is similar to tofu.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,800
We usually come to the temple

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,480
to miss theоеarnitale of the Qing people.

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
Red bean and tofu.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
Young master,

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,000
the trainees among the members of rendissue army

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,760
are extremely solid-hearted.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,360
And on top of that

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,720
we have the inclination of Danyang Jun

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
and Qinghang Junjia Jun

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,400
andiling Assades' support for success.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm going to the top.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm going to the top.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Young Master.

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I want to see.

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
What are you looking for?

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm looking for the Black City.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
Where is the Black City?

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,960
Where is the Black City?

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,360
The road ahead is okay.

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Okay.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Everyone.

72
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay.

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,760
General Lie is here.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,360
Take out all the good things.

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Okay.

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Okay.

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Okay.

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Okay.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay.

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Okay.

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay.

82
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Okay.

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Okay.

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Don't move.

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Let go of my hand.

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
You...

88
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
You are you.

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Put it down.

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
What are you laughing at?

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Don't move.

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Don't move.

93
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Don't move.

94
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
General.

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Do you have red beans?

96
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Where are the seeds?

97
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
General.

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
I have these.

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Yan Nan's good things.

100
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
These.

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
This...

102
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Who hung the brand on me?

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
General.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
I have the North County good things.

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
I got it.

106
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Young Master.

107
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Why don't you go out and wait for a while?

108
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I'll ask.

109
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Maybe you left for a while.

110
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
They have red beans.

111
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
You said that.

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
If you didn't have them,

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I'll kill you.

114
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
What are you looking at?

115
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Do you have them?

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Do you have them?

117
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
This is the most precious inkling

118
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
and the perfume made by Yan Nan's red beans.

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
What do you wear?

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
This is the most precious inkling

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
and the perfume made by Yan Nan's red beans.

122
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
What do you wear?

123
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
What do you wear?

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Where did you get these red beans from?

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
There is nothing that I can't find in Zhongzheng.

126
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
What?

127
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
You don't like it?

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
No.

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
It's just that

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,720
maybe this private training

131
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,920
is more like a commercial training.

132
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
Will the things I give

133
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
be worse than what Jun Fei Fan gave?

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Besides,

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
since it's a contract,

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
there's no reason to take it back.

137
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
It's getting late.

138
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Let's take a break.

139
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm looking forward to seeing you back to the city.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,520
I've prepared a special dish for you today.

142
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,520
Come on.

143
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Just like the young man's

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
useless tricks.

145
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,720
We'll not kneel down today.

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

147
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
This time, you've not only solved

148
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
the problem of the disaster,

149
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,320
but also got support from Sun Bu.

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm going to reward you with a lot.

151
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,520
I'll raise you all up,

152
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
and raise you up.

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Otherwise, the people will be in trouble.

154
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,320
You've always been loyal to His Majesty.

155
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
You'll do your best

156
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,320
to help him.

157
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
I know

158
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,920
what you're doing.

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,120
Come on.

160
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Now, I have Sun Bu

161
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,120
and your support for the Ministry of Rites.

162
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm relieved.

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,520
Some time ago, the Empress Dowager

164
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,720
even mentioned your wedding.

165
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,320
You fought outside before,

166
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,120
so it's fine.

167
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Now that you're free,

168
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
you'll be in a hurry.

169
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,720
You have to think about it.

170
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,120
Especially you.

171
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
In a few days,

172
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,720
the other noble women

173
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,720
will enter the city in a hurry.

174
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
You have to make a plan in advance.

175
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Your Majesty,

176
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,520
I suddenly feel that

177
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
there's something wrong outside.

178
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
I'll just go on.

179
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
This is the third ministry of the three departments.

180
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,120
Do you want to get the people to serve you?

181
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,720
Jun Feifan is not in the top position.

182
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,720
But Chen Di got his maid.

183
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,920
He wants to find

184
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,120
Jun Feifan's information.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,320
The maid?

186
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
There are also some days.

187
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,720
What can we find?

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,520
This maid is smart.

189
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,720
She wouldn't tell Jun Feifan's whereabouts.

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Chen Di is still investigating.

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,120
I think you're still cautious.

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
After all, she's a woman.

193
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,520
If she comes here this time,

194
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,920
she'll be worried.

195
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Your Majesty, don't worry.

196
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
Chen Di and she have known each other for many days.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
She still knows him.

198
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,520
Since he has the military service,

199
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,520
and has the ability to

200
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,520
let Sun Bu and the military service

201
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,320
have a common mark,

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
she and Jun Feifan

203
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
will never be able to get out of the job.

204
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
As long as she stays with him,

205
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
Chen Di will find Jun Feifan's whereabouts.

206
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
You have a lot in your heart.

207
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,920
Don't be careless.

208
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,520
Yes.

209
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,320
Take it.

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,320
Take it.

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Take it.

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,720
Yan'er,

213
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,720
Brother Wei will definitely

214
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,920
help you get the liu hua and liu shui.

215
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
Brother, come here.

216
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,720
Get on the horse.

217
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Brother,

218
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,520
it hurts.

219
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,120
A man is a man.

220
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
You can't stand it.

221
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,120
Let's take care of the Crown Prince in the future.

222
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,720
Go.

223
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,320
Okay.

224
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
You beat me.

225
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,920
You beat me first.

226
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm your brother.

227
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,920
I'll beat you if I hit you.

228
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
Who will beat me?

229
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,320
The Crown Prince said

230
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,320
a man can't be scared of pain.

231
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,520
What are you doing?

232
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
The Imperial Physician is in a bad mood.

233
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,320
I'll get hurt if I get a medical doctor.

234
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,520
Are you crazy?

235
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
The Imperial Physician is the Queen.

236
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,920
As long as she is not guilty,

237
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
don't worry about the money.

238
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Stop.

239
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Stop.

240
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Are you okay?

241
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,520
Mother, don't worry.

242
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm fine.

243
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,720
The Queen is here.

244
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,320
Mother.

245
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,520
Come on, get up.

246
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,720
Yu'er.

247
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
My brother, Yuer, is here to beat me.

248
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

249
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

250
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,720
My brother, Yuer, is here to beat me.

251
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,920
I'm your brother.

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,720
No.

253
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm the one who beat you first.

254
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,320
Stop.

255
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,920
Mother, I didn't lie.

256
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
You mean

257
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,720
to apologize to Yu?

258
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,520
No.

259
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,920
It's Yuer who didn't understand

260
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
and hit the Imperial Physician.

261
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,720
The one who should apologize is Yuer.

262
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Yuer, apologize to my brother.

263
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,320
Mother, I really didn't lie.

264
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
I told you to apologize to the Imperial Physician.

265
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,120
Hurry.

266
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Don't cry.

267
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
Don't cry.

268
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Your Highness,

269
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
Yuer is still young and ignorant.

270
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
She hit the Imperial Physician.

271
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,920
Please don't blame her.

272
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay.

273
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
I'll be your brother.

274
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
I won't fight with my brother.

275
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
That's all.

276
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Yuer, come back with me.

277
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
Yuer,

278
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,520
don't blame me.

279
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,920
I know it's not your fault.

280
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,920
Your Highness and Prince Yu are too much.

281
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
How many times has this happened?

282
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
They make our Prince suffer every time.

283
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,720
Xin'er,

284
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,720
you go back with Yuer first.

285
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes.

286
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

287
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

288
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
I've been waiting for you.

289
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,920
It's just a small kid.

290
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,720
This is the favorite milk cream

291
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,520
that the Crown Prince loves.

292
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Please keep it for him.

293
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,520
Your Highness, don't worry.

294
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
It's late.

295
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
I'll go to the toilet.

296
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll go to the toilet.

297
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,120
You heard the sword.

298
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
There are a few guards here.

299
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,320
They are the first to fight.

300
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,120
Since you've chased after me,

301
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,720
I'll let you

302
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
go to my father to listen to me.

303
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,720
I've prepared the gift.

304
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
I'll wait for your words.

305
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
Thank you, Your Excellency.

306
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,320
Brother Cheng and Beixuan

307
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
have never been so good to Yuer.

308
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,320
You've been in the palace for years.

309
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
He married you

310
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
and has never treated you well.

311
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
You don't have to be so angry.

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
This is Yuer's life.

319
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Now,

320
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,720
I only hope that day will come.

321
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
The date of the trip will be in a hurry.

322
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,320
Please prepare everything.

323
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,520
I heard that you helped General Lie

324
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,920
to get the support of Lord Sunba.

325
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Don't worry.

326
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,920
He is the best man in the world.

327
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
He has 15 brothers.

328
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
No matter what,

329
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,720
I will protect you

330
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,520
and Yuer.

331
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,520
I trust you

332
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
and all Beixuan.

333
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,920
I trust you.

334
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
I trust you.

335
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,320
Father,

336
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,120
what does His Majesty want us to do

337
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
as soon as we enter the palace?

338
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,320
Is it possible

339
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,120
that Xida is defeated?

340
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,720
You

341
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
can't bear it.

342
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Xida's body is in the third floor.

343
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,120
Luckily, Xuanli

344
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
didn't get any evidence.

345
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
The power of both of Xixuan

346
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
is the strongest.

347
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,520
His Majesty has decided

348
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
to be the leader of Xuanli.

349
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,920
Now, the planner

350
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
has given us a good place

351
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
to get the peace he wants.

352
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,920
Father,

353
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I have something to say.

354
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,520
I don't know whether to say it or not.

355
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
You mean

356
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,120
Xuanli has the support of Lord Luo and Sunba?

357
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
We, Xibo,

358
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,120
have no source.

359
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,720
You are indeed a son of Lord Mo.

360
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,520
It's a trip.

361
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm really worried.

362
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Now that we enter the capital,

363
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,920
we can't move Xuanli.

364
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,720
Father,

365
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
we can't bear the crime of killing the leader.

366
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
But if we can't

367
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,320
let Xuanli join the guerrilla,

368
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,320
no matter how many soldiers

369
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,120
are there in Lord and Sunba,

370
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,320
it will be a battle of the world.

371
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,320
Father,

372
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
don't worry.

373
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,920
Don't worry, Father.

374
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,120
I will be the first general of Beixuan.

375
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Father and Mother will fight together

376
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,720
to protect the people of Beixuan.

377
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Good point.

378
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Father and Mother,

379
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
when the time passes,

380
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,520
you will be the leader of the army.

381
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,320
Please bless the child.

382
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
You will be blessed.

383
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,720
You will have a life-long life.

384
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,120
You will be together.

385
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,920
Protect Beixuan.

386
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Protect Beixuan.

387
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,120
The skill of the hundred-kilometer skill is recorded.

388
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,720
There are still some stones,

389
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,920
some bronze gold,

390
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,120
some fire water,

391
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,520
and some gold stone.

392
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,920
If the stone of the Xuanli Iron Stone

393
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,320
really appears in the world,

394
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,320
it may be found by the skill.

395
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Father.

396
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Father, what are you doing?

397
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Father.

398
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Father.

399
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Father.

400
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Father.

401
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Father.

402
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
The four places are so vast.

403
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
They don't look like the mines.

404
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Father.

405
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Why are you here?

406
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
After hearing that it's your parents' birthday,

407
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,320
did they leave these two wood carvings to you?

408
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Good.

409
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Father, look.

410
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
The wood carving is ready.

411
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Good.

412
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Keep going.

413
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Good.

414
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
The wood carving is ready.

415
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Good.

416
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Keep going.

417
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Father.

418
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Why do you always bring your children here?

419
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
It's so cold here.

420
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
This is the highest point of the whole city.

421
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
The higher the place, the better.

422
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
The higher the place, the better.

423
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
The less people can accompany you to the top.

424
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
When you reach a higher place,

425
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
you will pay the price of the portrait.

426
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
This price may be someone else's life.

427
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
I'm a high-ranking man.

428
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
I can't do anything about it.

429
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,320
I hope that Li'er will never have to feel this way.

430
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Father.

431
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Don't be lonely.

432
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I will always be with you.

433
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Father, what kind of clothes is this?

434
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
It's so different.

435
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
This is a silk armor.

436
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
You can wear it on the battlefield.

437
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
You can wear it with no mercy.

438
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
So powerful.

439
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Li'er likes it.

440
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Since you like it,

441
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
I will give it to you.

442
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
From now on,

443
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
you can wear it on the battlefield.

444
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
It will look like a piece of paper.

445
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
I will give it to you.

446
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
I will give it to you.

447
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
I will give it to you.

448
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
I will give it to you.

449
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
I will give it to you.

450
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
I will give it to you.

451
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
I will give it to you.

452
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Let it be as beautiful as your father.

453
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Father, mother.

454
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
If I have this chance to forgive you...

456
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I almost forgot her appearance.

457
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Only when I look at her, can I remember a little.

458
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
I'm sure.

459
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,320
This is you, General Xuan Shu?

460
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
But he hasn't finished his class yet.

461
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
They were killed by me.

462
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,320
My parents' love for her is never to be forgotten.

464
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,320
So don't blame General Xuan Shu and Madam Xuan Shu for their death.

465
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,320
My mother died when I was very young.

466
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
My father once said,

467
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
when my mother goes to heaven,

468
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,320
she will become the brightest star.

469
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
That's right.

470
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Whenever I miss my mother,

471
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I will talk to her.

472
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I believe she will hear it.

473
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
You can try it too.

474
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
You're so stupid.

476
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
I didn't believe it.

477
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
But once in a while,

478
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,320
when I was saddest and helpless,

479
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I found that there was nothing in the sky.

480
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
But that star was still there.

481
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
I believed it from that moment.

482
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I believed in it.

483
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
My mother was always watching me.

484
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,320
So your father and mother will hear what you say.

485
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Now I've become my father's father.

486
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
That's why I know

487
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
why he wanted to come here.

488
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
He will definitely feel lonely and cold

489
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,320
when he sees the burden of the North Xuan.

490
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
He will do everything for the North Xuan,

491
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
for Xuan Pu.

492
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
Everyone has a responsibility that can't be rejected.

493
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
The people of the North Xuan

494
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,320
will always remember General Xuan Shu.

495
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Drink with me.

496
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
What a stupid military sentence.

497
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
If my father and brother are not here,

498
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
I will make him look good.

499
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Third Sister.

500
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I knew you came to my brother's room again.

501
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Third Sister.

502
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
What are you doing?

503
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,320
What are you doing secretly?

504
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Second Sister.

505
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
You...

506
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Why are you stealing my brother's clothes?

507
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
This military sentence.

508
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
My father and brother are not here.

509
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
I'm going to make him look like my brother.

510
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Don't be ridiculous.

511
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Although you look like your brother,

512
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
they can recognize you.

513
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Second Sister, I have my own opinion.

514
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
I heard from Dr. Ling that

515
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Xi Xiang is about to come to a business team.

516
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
He was going to meet my brother.

517
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
But he is not allowed to.

518
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Jun Yujue is going to meet him personally.

519
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
How can he do that?

520
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Why don't I go and act like my brother

521
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
and go to a business team to work with him?

522
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
I won't let Jun Yujue be as wishful as they wish.

523
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Can...can this work?

524
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Second Sister, don't worry.

525
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
I have my own opinion.

526
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
But you have to keep this matter secret for me.

527
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
I can't tell anyone.

528
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Okay.

529
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Thank you, Second Sister.

530
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
People will be tired.

531
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
When you are tired,

532
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
you come here

533
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,320
and talk to General and Madam.

534
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,320
It's good to be here in the first half of the day.

535
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Look.

536
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
This is the red bean bracelet my mother gave me.

537
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I have always been with you.

538
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
I have never left.

539
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I feel like my mother is by my side.

540
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Whenever I am tired,

541
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I will be happy

542
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
as long as I see her.

543
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I think that I

544
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
will be a wolf master soon.

545
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,320
I will find out the truth

546
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
and kill my parents.

547
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Otherwise,

548
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
I will never see her again.

549
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
I have told you so many beautiful things.

550
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
What about you?

551
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,320
What do you want to tell me?

552
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
I have told you so many beautiful things.

553
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
What about you?

554
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,320
What do you want to tell me?

555
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I want to tell you

556
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
that I am a man

557
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
who doesn't want to confess.

558
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I don't want to confess.

559
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
I have.

560
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
I have.

561
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Actually,

562
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I am not a man or woman.

563
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
I am a man or woman.

564
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
I am a man or woman.

565
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Because of you,

566
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
you are my father,

567
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
the father and father.

568
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Is it something weird?

569
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Or do you already know?

570
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
I've been surrounded,

571
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,280
I'm not dead.

572
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Whether you're a big girl from the Jun family

573
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,880
or a girl from the Jun family,

574
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
in my eyes,

575
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,560
you're just a pawn in my company.

576
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm right.

577
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,320
I want to rest.

578
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
Is she a doll?

579
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,660
Is she a deputy

580
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,220
of Jun Group's

581
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,820
둘 Xia or a woman in the tribe?

582
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,140
The jade King

583
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,540
Prix Chemical.

584
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,220
ciónalinteroque.

585
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,640
When if she's average,

586
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,520
why would she play music and Kucaimora?

587
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,140
What?

588
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,900
Miss.

589
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,740
What is that?

590
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,440
Miss

591
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,780
Over there.

592
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,460
How did you come closer to your cub?

593
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,280
Not at all.

594
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,140
Are you not aware?

595
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,340
Yes, you are.

596
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,340
Seeing you are here here.

597
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm里边的外婆虫吧.

598
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,220
Didn't expect that.

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,980
You also see her

600
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,380
in the business of Taoist.

601
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,740
It's just...

602
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,500
You can kiss yourself.

603
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,500
It's okay.

604
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,860
Let's go.

605
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,060
Miss Jin.

606
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,540
It's cold this morning.

607
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,260
Be careful of the wind.

608
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,340
Thank you.

609
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,380
conscience

610
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,100
Mr.안녕.

611
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,620
Why are you acting like that?

612
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,340
It's nothing.

613
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,940
You asked me to decorate Christmas treequeen.

614
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:38,740
Secretary.

615
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,100
You've met this Lady Qi Lu

616
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,340
twice with her.

617
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,340
How's the investigation going?

618
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Where's Yan Nan?

619
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
She's not doing anything.

620
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
She'll go to the military camp in a few days.

621
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
But I've told you today that

622
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
the Wushan is already in the mine.

623
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
We can go and check it out today.

624
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Wushan doesn't like to be hit.

625
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,340
We'll come back after we finish looking at it.

626
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Let's go.

627
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,380
igung

628
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Stop!

629
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
Miss, you've said it with general.

630
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Two women live on the outside one day.

631
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,380
Miss, do go with general,

632
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,340
I'll go with you.

633
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,500
You're kind to her.

634
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm sure you won't be able to pass.

635
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,500
Dongyin will be a wife.

636
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,540
I'm not on the same path as you.

637
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,220
I have to go on my own.

638
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,540
Don't say that again.

639
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,260
Yes.

640
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,500
I understand.

641
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,020
We've found the main location yesterday.

642
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,060
As long as we find the source of the fire,

643
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,380
we'll know where Xun Tianxing is.

644
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,660
Stop the car.

645
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,500
General.

646
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
I suddenly remembered that I have things to do.

647
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,300
I won't go back with you.

648
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,740
I'll give you a letter of appreciation.

649
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,980
What is it?

650
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,500
I saw some flowers in the yard

651
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,220
on the way to the embroidery room with Dongyin yesterday.

652
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,740
I want to come back to plant the plants.

653
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,260
But the flowers in the yard

654
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,660
like warm water and hot water.

655
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,260
They're called watermelons in the house.

656
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,380
I want to go to the fire park

657
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,500
while it's snowing.

658
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,540
I'm fine today.

659
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,780
I'll go with you.

660
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,900
And I know where the fire park is.

661
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,500
I can save you a lot of time.

662
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,420
Thank you, General.

663
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,700
Here.

664
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,620
General, you're in the position of the whole department.

665
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,340
You're in the same position as me.

666
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,500
You'll be punished.

667
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,380
Why don't I go see a horse?

668
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,620
I'll go to the lady

669
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
after I see her for a while.

670
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,500
Here.

671
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,220
I'm sorry for embarrassing you.

672
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,100
I always按 the key to catch 5 coin.

673
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,380
I don't want the toxic deposit to be delivered soon.

674
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,940
I need to go with the concern over there.

675
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,020
Thank you for coming in front of me.

676
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,780
Young master, you're doing well.

677
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,220
We appreciate your great happiness

678
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,860
when a HDMI tablet matches you.

679
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:13,940
Please.

680
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,260
Please.

681
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,780
Probably...

682
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,380
they're trying to play trump rings.

683
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,620
I'll keep sleeping for a bit.

684
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,900
Good.

685
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,780
Yes.

686
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,980
I'll go back for Independent Team skiing now.

687
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,400
You were saying that you can't contact the Metropolis well.

688
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,420
The dew has grown hard and it'll cause industry conflict.

689
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,500
It's suitable for a하ds to be ran with a steady instactor.

690
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,700
You'd better get going.

691
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,340
See your progress.

692
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,520
I heard that Consort Success is a meet-and-greet~~

693
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,520
It was a good idea!

694
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:09,460
The

695
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,020
school is closed.

696
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,380
Why do the

697
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:23,180
people keep going to

698
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,380
their school to study?

699
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,180
Yes, that's it!

700
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,180
Why is there no movement in the kitchen?

701
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I sent someone to search for the bitter wind.

702
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
They said it was Junfei Fan.

703
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,180
He just entered the house and didn't drink.

704
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,180
He was so anxious that he went to the capital to help the wife investigate.

705
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Now, the shopkeepers of the shop are all aware of this.

706
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
The key is Jinxiu's house.

707
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
I finally decided to give up.

708
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Grandpa Xiang knows that we took the property.

709
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
That's a good thing for me.

710
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,180
He came back at this time.

711
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Isn't it a good thing for me?

712
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
Son, don't worry.

713
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
Come on.

714
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,180
Think about it carefully.

715
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,180
The shopkeepers also heard about it.

716
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,180
They heard about it?

717
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
So,

718
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,180
except for the person in the big room,

719
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
no one has seen Junfei Fan.

720
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
Right?

721
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,180
It's really my godfather.

722
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,180
He is an old man.

723
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Jiang is still old.

724
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Good.

725
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
He is going to the capital, right?

726
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Okay.

727
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
I will go on the road.

728
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180
I will arrange more people for him.

729
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,180
I don't care if he is Junfei Fan.

730
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Don't think about coming back alive.

731
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Empress Dowager, Li Fei is here.

732
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Li Fei is here.

733
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

734
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
Sit down.

735
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
I heard that a few days ago,

736
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,180
Yu'er and Yi'er were playing here.

737
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,180
They were acting a bit too much.

738
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Yi'er is still young. She is not hurt, right?

739
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

740
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
I am fine.

741
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
Good.

742
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,180
When the queen came yesterday,

743
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,180
she kept saying that Yu'er is not hurt.

744
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
I was also a child of Yu'er.

745
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,180
I saw both of them grow up.

746
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
I was hurt.

747
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
I was hurt.

748
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,180
I heard that the two princes were having a meeting.

749
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
They all wanted to learn horse riding.

750
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,180
That's why they were so excited.

751
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
It was a small thing.

752
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,180
I am sorry to trouble you and the queen.

753
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Both of them are young and young.

754
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,180
They all like to learn horse riding.

755
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,180
After the meeting,

756
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,180
it's time to find a teacher to teach them.

757
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,180
I heard that

758
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,180
all the horses are playing in the city.

759
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
Why don't you take this opportunity

760
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
to choose a suitable person?

761
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
To learn horse riding together,

762
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,180
you can also add a little bit of love between the two brothers.

763
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
I will put this on my mind.

764
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,180
These are all Western-style desserts.

765
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Try them.

766
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Okay.

767
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,180
If Empress Dowager really cares about our son,

768
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
why didn't she come to the Ji Yue Hall to see him?

769
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,180
And the queen.

770
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,180
She didn't even say that she is not her son.

771
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,180
The queen and the queen are in the same group.

772
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Today, she said that

773
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,180
she is just asking me to be the queen.

774
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Don't take the burden of revenge.

775
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
It's obviously because our son is a loser.

776
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,180
Empress Dowager only thinks about losing a group.

777
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
That's not fair.

778
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
Why do you still have the suggestion

779
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,180
to let them learn horse riding together?

780
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,180
Aren't you afraid that our son will be hurt?

781
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,180
I thought

782
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,180
as long as Yi'er gets away from the queen mother,

783
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
she won't be bullied again.

784
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Now, she has a lover.

785
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180
She will only let the queen become a family.

786
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,180
Learning horse riding is just a lie.

787
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
I still need to work together.

788
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
How can I use this opportunity?

789
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,180
So, you have already started to plan.

790
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,180
If the queen is not too kind,

791
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,180
who would be willing to live in the third class?

792
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
Tonight,

793
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,180
go to the Imperial Court to deliver the letter to the other family.

794
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,180
Yes.

795
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
But now...

796
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
I can't let you be soさことない.

797
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
Grand teacher!

798
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
Grand Teacher,

799
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
your father already left the royal background meeting.

800
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,180
If you can't remember all the details on this 훨씬 injustice,

801
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,180
we'll send the letter to him and send it to him.

802
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Yan Zhigao has been gone for two hours.

803
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,180
Why can't he find it?

804
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,500
You've found three places to live.

805
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,020
What else can you find?

806
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,100
The water temperature is not enough.

807
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,820
It seems that the flower market is not enough.

808
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,020
How high is the water temperature?

809
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,100
It's about the same as the water temperature in the lake.

810
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,340
There is another place to go.

811
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,860
I'll take you there.

812
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,180
The water temperature is not enough.

813
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,300
Why can't you find it?

814
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,380
The water temperature is not enough.

815
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,580
Why can't you find it?

816
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,780
The water temperature is not enough.

817
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
Why can't you find it?

818
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
The water temperature is not enough.

819
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
Why can't you find it?

820
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,780
The water temperature is not enough.

821
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,780
Why can't you find it?

822
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,780
The water temperature is not enough.

823
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Why can't you find it?

824
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,780
The water temperature is not enough.

825
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Why can't you find it?

826
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,780
The water temperature is not enough.

827
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Why can't you find it?

828
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,780
The water temperature is not enough.

829
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,780
Why can't you find it?

830
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,780
The water temperature is not enough.

831
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,780
Why can't you find it?

832
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,780
The water temperature is not enough.

833
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,780
Why can't you find it?

834
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,780
The water temperature is not enough.

835
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Why can't you find it?

836
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,880
steal it in my heart

837
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,840
의 смерde和你的

838
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,840
As long as it's clean,

839
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,600
I'll stay with you for the summer season of summer.

840
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,820
There is one album

841
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:30,820
In my heart, I have become a shadow

842
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,820
This is the past where I was hurt and tired

843
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:41,820
I have become the sea of ​​air and air

844
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:47,820
I want to be a little bit closer

845
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,820
I feel like I'm in the past

846
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:59,820
I don't want to live, but I love to be in the past

847
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:07,820
Let you love me again, I feel like I'm in the past

848
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:20,820
Let you love me again, I feel like I'm in the past

849
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:31,820
Let you love me again, I feel like I'm in the past
