Let you be the one who is always there for me

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,120
It's been a long time, I still can't stop thinking

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,120
The universe behind me is still with me

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Still, how to let go of the deep old

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
It's no more than a piece of horror

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Time isn't my soul, I beg you

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Who can appreciate you?

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
How can just anyone care

Oh oh oh, 没事怎么过几个很多

He's not a wingman.

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,400
He's still a dog issu.

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
And he mareл

commitment

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,960
in the land

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,160

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,940
What a serial!

34
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,120
So many honorable people are tracks.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
You were all killed to be killed.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
However could you have killed me?

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,900
LOLO

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,880
OHH

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,620
AHHHHHH

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,980
Although thewr bishop has nothing to do with him,

41
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,020
but he could kill someone else.

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,860
I'll go.

43
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,900
What are you doing here?

44
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,580
General Lie,

45
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,580
Lord Luo,

46
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,940
I was thinking

47
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,420
what you said yesterday.

48
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,660
If I want to be

49
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,060
a qualified chief of the Ministry of Rites,

50
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,940
I must bear the responsibility of

51
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,100
the people of Liangzhou

52
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,340
and solve their problems.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,740
But I've been thinking about it for a whole night.

54
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,860
I didn't think of any good way.

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,140
It's better to be known than to be caught by others.

56
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
It's the problem to solve the problem

57
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,940
by providing a profitable job for the people.

58
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,420
But Liangzhou is a poor place.

59
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,860
Most people are

60
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,580
loyal and loyal to each other.

61
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,860
I really don't know

62
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,900
what kind of job they want to provide for them.

63
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,620
This is Uncle Zhang

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,660
who specially brought you

65
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,700
the perfume from the south of Yan.

66
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,140
Thank you, General Lie.

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,140
Uncle Zhang knows I love perfume.

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,460
He always helps me to pay attention.

69
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,980
What's so special about this perfume?

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,100
Why do you like it so much?

71
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,700
General Lie, you know what?

72
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,140
The fragrance of the perfume from the south of Yan

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,580
is not only fragrant and special,

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,860
but also the fragrance of the embroidery in the bag.

75
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,620
We can't buy it in Beijing.

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,460
If we can embroider such a fake one,

77
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,660
what do you think of it

78
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,180
in Beijing?

79
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,580
If the cost is low,

80
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,660
the embroidery in the world will be

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,580
definitely exposed by the people.

82
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,660
Do you know the Yan's army?

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,300
Yes.

84
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,740
The Yan's army is the number one in Yan.

85
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,540
No matter it's the fake or the embroidery,

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,700
they are all the same.

87
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,380
The perfume from the south of Yan

88
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,940
is not only the number one in the Yan's army,

89
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,100
but also the number one in the Yan's army.

90
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,260
The Yan's army is so powerful.

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,660
You are from the Yan's army,

92
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,420
Qi Luo.

93
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,140
You mean

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,620
you know the Yan's embroidery technique?

95
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,940
Thank you, General Lie.

96
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,060
Your Highness.

97
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,260
You are...

98
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,140
I heard that

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,940
it's the first time that Qi Luo came to Beijing.

100
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,100
So the special guest

101
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,020
has prepared the food and wine from Beijing.

102
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,300
Here.

103
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,860
This is the skin of the meat.

104
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,180
The meat is fat and crispy.

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,140
It's very delicious.

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,540
Do you like it?

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,260
It's so delicious.

108
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,380
It's so delicious.

109
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,500
It's so delicious.

110
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
It's so delicious.

111
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
It's so delicious.

112
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
It's so delicious.

113
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
It's so delicious.

114
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
It's so delicious.

115
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,300
It's so delicious.

116
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,220
Don't you like this?

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,820
Then try the wild duck.

118
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,140
It's also very tasty.

119
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,860
I'm sorry, Zhaoming.

120
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,580
I usually have a mild taste.

121
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,620
I can't eat them all.

122
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,140
It's okay.

123
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,020
Then try the special cream porridge here.

124
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,580
It tastes very light.

125
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,460
Here.

126
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,300
Zhaoming.

127
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,540
Are you looking for me?

128
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,020
Of course.

129
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,940
I can't hide anything from you.

130
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
I know

131
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,900
we lack water in Liangzhou.

132
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,940
It's raining all year long this autumn.

133
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,580
It's so sunny and sunny.

134
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,980
There are more and more people.

135
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,660
Lord Xi is here to help us.

136
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,500
It's only a matter of time.

137
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,180
It's better to be caught by others than caught by others.

138
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,780
Yes, that's it.

139
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,020
You are exactly the same as Lord Lie.

140
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,580
What did General Lie say to you?

141
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
He also said

142
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,780
you are from the Yan Nan Army.

143
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,340
You are good at embroidery and embroidery.

144
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,580
And we are good at sewing.

145
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,420
So I have an unkind invitation.

146
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,180
You are such a good man.

147
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,540
I thought you were prepared for tea.

148
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,660
Sit.

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,300
All right, come in.

150
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,380
The General has strongly secretly informed me about Zhang Ming.

151
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,220
He spic for改蔘可惜是那種冠心 acquiescence of translucency.

152
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,620
Firstly, he refuses her.

153
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,660
Secondly, he is memb��幾日盟你和你的《盟約》

154
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,500
The third suit might be the guide for Zhang Ming's tricks.

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,100
So him prepared two things.

156
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,980
Miss Qi Luo, Winter Snow is smart.

157
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,300
You may have whatever you want.

158
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,940
General, don't try to cheat on me.

159
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,160
I don't agree.

160
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,100
My contract with the general only allows me to teach the people

161
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
how to make a living.

162
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,060
Didn't Miss Qi Luo always say that

163
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,980
it's dangerous to hurt people?

164
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,300
Of course.

165
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,900
But I have no interest in this deal.

166
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,420
You teach the people

167
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,100
how to make a living by embroidering and sewing.

168
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,020
You can divide Miss Qi Luo into two groups.

169
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,260
The opening ceremony is for the workers.

170
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,300
It needs to be done at the top of the foundation.

171
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,020
It's more than three cities.

172
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,020
But I learned these techniques from you.

173
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,340
How can I use them on my own?

174
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,700
The house is named after the Yan's military.

175
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,220
It's the name of the military in Beijing.

176
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,460
At that time,

177
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,100
the military will treat you differently.

178
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,780
Maybe you can take the responsibility

179
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,900
to marry the young master.

180
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,100
But Yan and Beijing never got together.

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,780
Even if the name of the military

182
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,100
was opened by the Beixuan family,

183
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,740
it's not practical for the young master to be my master.

184
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,100
Don't mention the price.

185
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,460
Don't mention the price for the young master.

186
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,980
General, don't make me look like a three-year-old child.

187
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,420
But I'm very touched

188
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,780
when I see you think about the people of Liangzhou.

189
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,060
If you're willing to

190
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,940
make the people's cloth and embroidery

191
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,420
into the military,

192
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,700
I'll agree to this deal.

193
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,500
I'll have it dofinally.

194
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,300
Okay.

195
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,220
It's so low in money,

196
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,940
I'll go.

197
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,300
Okay.

198
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,540
It's okay.

199
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,820
I'm not in a hurry.

200
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,420
I just don't know if the people of Liang State

201
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,820
can wait.

202
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,220
Leave it to me.

203
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,140
Can you and the princess

204
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,740
prepare to defend the palace first?

205
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Sister Qu Luo,

206
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,780
I know it's not easy.

207
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,580
But I want to try no matter what.

208
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,260
Okay.

209
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,620
That's great.

210
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,260
The cloth machines we use

211
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,220
are all made of black mineral.

212
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,620
This will make the efficiency higher.

213
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,780
I just don't know if there is

214
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,420
such a black mineral in Liang State.

215
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,940
It's easy.

216
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,900
Liang State is the most productive mineral.

217
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,220
I'll bring all the minerals

218
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,500
to see what you need.

219
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,580
Yes, Sister.

220
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,260
Okay.

221
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,300
I'll find out if the Su go ahead

222
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,220
is still in Liang State.

223
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,540
This will give Hu meinen and stay in headers

224
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,940
to hand out the information.

225
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,380
decreases

226
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,100
My Lord.

227
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,420
There's something wrong with Qiannu.

228
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,900
The barrel belongs to him,

229
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,900
but the rzeczy I need

230
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,940
was held under the house.

231
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,380
You have to

232
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,540
tell the劉 Family's group

233
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,580
as an example.

234
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,140
Otherwise

235
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,740
they drew upon us.

236
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,260
Turn out

237
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,980
I can only go there myself.

238
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,660
Lingbo, go and prepare the stars for me.

239
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,060
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

240
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,380
It's just that

241
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,380
the days have passed

242
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,740
and the shops have been closed.

243
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,620
The second house a few days ago

244
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,580
with the elders coming and going.

245
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm still worried about it.

246
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,540
I'm afraid that the old man is not here.

247
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
They will have to make trouble again.

248
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,060
I have been

249
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
a second brother for the rest of my life.

250
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,300
It's also right

251
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,300
to be the main lead of my parents.

252
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,220
General,

253
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
what do you mean?

254
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,820
I was in the third house before and I was in a hurry.

255
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,340
I was wronged by Miss Qi Luo.

256
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,820
I especially asked Madam Sun

257
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
to prepare a new dress for you.

258
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,020
Thank you for your kindness.

259
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,140
But I think

260
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,700
it's more convenient to go out and dress up in the south.

261
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,260
You and Miss Sun are in the same place all day.

262
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,940
There are many women in the same world.

263
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,940
It's easier for men and women to be apart.

264
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,820
It's also more convenient for women to be in the same place.

265
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,820
You are so thoughtful.

266
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,900
But

267
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,140
Madam Sun and Madam Sun,

268
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,700
including Zhao Min,

269
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,900
all know I'm a girl.

270
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,420
I don't think you need to be so courteous.

271
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,540
Miss, you were right.

272
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
But I'm curious.

273
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,580
Other women like to dress up in the pattern.

274
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
Why do you

275
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,860
not like these?

276
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,900
Miss Qi, I'm ready.

277
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,700
Let's go.

278
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,740
This is the dress for Miss Qi.

279
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,220
Miss,

280
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,140
I've never seen you wear a girl's dress.

281
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,380
Go and change.

282
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,660
I...

283
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,620
Let's go.

284
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Miss Qi, you are so beautiful.

285
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,660
General Lie,

286
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,700
have you seen her?

287
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,340
Let's go.

288
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,740
Let's go.

289
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,420
Let's go.

290
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,100
Let's go.

291
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,700
Let's go.

292
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,340
Let's go.

293
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,900
Let's go.

294
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,300
Let's go.

295
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,780
Let's go.

296
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,340
Let's go.

297
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,980
Let's go.

298
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,500
Me.

299
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,300
She...

300
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,180
Me.

301
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Left a little bit.

302
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,460
Okay.

303
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,220
Stop her.

304
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,100
You go after her.

305
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,900
Leave.

306
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,060
Wait for a while.

307
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,860
Why are you here?

308
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,180
Let go of my hand.

309
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,460
Put your hands.

310
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,100
Come on, stop.

311
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,260
What's wrong?

312
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,580
Everyone, say something.

313
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,740
We can't do anything.

314
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,180
Master Zhao and Master Sun,

315
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,020
I didn't expect you to talk to us more.

316
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,580
You even changed the money to open the room for the princess.

317
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,180
The Western Department is in the city every day.

318
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,300
They are giving us a week.

319
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,860
What is our leader doing?

320
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,500
He is not taking care of our life.

321
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Yes.

322
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,500
Everyone, listen to me.

323
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,580
We are opening the room

324
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,260
for everyone's sake.

325
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,180
The princess's room is for everyone

326
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,420
to have a stable and stable job.

327
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,780
Don't get hungry in the future.

328
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,900
Listen carefully.

329
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,500
The non-purchase products of Liang State

330
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,100
are always bought from outside.

331
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,700
Open the room.

332
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,620
What's the point?

333
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,580
Yes.

334
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,900
Yes.

335
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
With these money,

336
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,140
we can buy food

337
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,340
and share it with everyone.

338
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,380
That's right.

339
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,540
Everyone, listen to me.

340
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,700
We can buy food and share it with everyone.

341
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,060
But even so,

342
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,140
can we eat food for a few days?

343
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,700
Everyone knows that

344
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,500
our Liang State is poor.

345
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,540
We can't provide food to everyone.

346
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,300
Only you can make a living

347
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,420
and have a chance

348
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,100
to make sure that you won't be hungry in the future.

349
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,300
You are right.

350
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,540
I know

351
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,380
you have many doubts.

352
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,340
Liang State has never been in the embroidery room.

353
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,820
But this time,

354
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,060
we have the great support of General Lie.

355
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,500
General Yixing is not famous.

356
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,100
He has sent a letter to His Majesty

357
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,780
to open the way for Liang State and Yan Nan to be in business.

358
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
In the meantime,

359
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,020
we can use Yan Nan

360
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,860
to buy the first price

361
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,980
to buy the fabric and silk.

362
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,140
Then, we can use the price

363
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,540
to sell the cloth and embroidery

364
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,940
we made.

365
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,180
In this way,

366
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,380
we can bring the benefit of the cloth and silk.

367
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,940
That's a good idea.

368
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,740
General, what do you think?

369
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,500
Miss Qiluo is right.

370
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,020
His Majesty has agreed to share the business.

371
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,860
We don't need to worry about the future.

372
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,700
Even so,

373
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
no one knows that you are busy

374
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
with embroidery or embroidery in another city.

375
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,820
I will show you

376
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,060
how you can farm and produce hemispheres.

377
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,100
Let's go.

378
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Here.

379
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Excuse me.

380
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
This way, please.

381
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,340
You call yourself Mr.無義?

382
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,400
Here, this way.

383
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,280
I think you are trouble.

384
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,840
So, like this?

385
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,000
Then, we should come here especially.

386
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,580
There's nothing on it.

387
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
It's not tapped correctly

388
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,020
but it doesn't saga about

389
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
our Shanghu Group now.

390
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,960
Come, come.

391
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,660
Go.

392
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,700
Wait, please.

393
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,820
Take a closer look.

394
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,260
There's also a pattern on the back.

395
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,740
This is a double-sided, one-sided embroidery.

396
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,620
It's embroidered on the same base

397
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,020
with two patterns on both sides.

398
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,540
And the opposite is different colors.

399
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,980
How is it?

400
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,380
Can a dead embroidery

401
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,940
get into more of a different look?

402
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,100
Wonderful!

403
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,660
Wonderful!

404
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,020
I've been doing this for half a lifetime.

405
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,660
Have you ever seen such a wonderful embroidery?

406
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,660
Is the Yin's room made of this kind of embroidery?

407
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,540
Miss,

408
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,100
how do we work together?

409
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,420
Miss,

410
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,140
the embroidery shop in my family

411
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,660
is the largest in Liangzhou.

412
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,300
How about this?

413
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,900
You can buy all your embroidery products for me.

414
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,020
You see?

415
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,740
We are the business partners in the Yin's room.

416
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,780
If you want to join us,

417
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,580
come to my place and register your name.

418
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,260
I'll have a look.

419
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,380
I'll have a look.

420
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,380
I'll have a look.

421
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,900
That woman is from the Yan's family.

422
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,700
I'm not brave enough.

423
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,340
I can't stop them.

424
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,140
How can you stop

425
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,460
your little skill?

426
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,900
If the Yin's room is made of this kind of embroidery,

427
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,900
Sunba must support Xuanli.

428
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,020
Father,

429
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,580
what should we do next?

430
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,180
I won't let them get in the way.

431
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,660
I have my own way.

432
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,620
How is the business partner doing?

433
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,300
The death of the sender

434
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,540
hasn't been reported yet.

435
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,180
Father,

436
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,460
I'll send someone to find out more.

437
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,100
Can you be a little bit smart?

438
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,700
It's been so long.

439
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm afraid there's a lot of trouble.

440
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,660
The business partner has been chosen

441
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,420
for several days.

442
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,300
He hasn't seen His Majesty.

443
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,300
It means

444
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,420
he hasn't found the evidence.

445
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,340
Father said

446
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,700
this is a trap.

447
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,700
Let's let go of this.

448
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,220
You can't use it.

449
00:20:50,100 --> 00:21:06,020
This is Royal Majesty's

450
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,460
Good news!

451
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,620
Yao Chen's mother

452
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,020
has bought several goods.

453
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,900
She will buy the goods from us.

454
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,940
Okay.

455
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,940
We will pay the first batch of goods

456
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,660
in five days.

457
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,900
We will pay the salary of this month.

458
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,700
Okay.

459
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,460
Okay.

460
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,660
What's wrong?

461
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,580
The machine seems to be broken.

462
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,380
Broken?

463
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,300
You go do something else.

464
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,940
I'll take a look.

465
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,100
Mr. Yan,

466
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,980
you should get the first batch of goods from us.

467
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm here to givecs away for a month.

468
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,060
Got it.

469
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,840
I'm here to distribute ready-made goods

470
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,660
and liquee of all order的时候.

471
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:04,820
Have a look.

472
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,460
Waiting.

473
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,940
Um...

474
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,860
Work so fast.

475
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,300
Lady.

476
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,460
Lady.

477
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,860
What are you Espa Layman?

478
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,860
What are you doing?

479
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,540
Lady, you work with me,

480
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,820
I would have sent you a ED form.

481
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,820
Miss.

482
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,060
Please do not be angry.

483
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,260
Please get out.

484
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,820
But if you had sent one message for me,

485
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,020
he would pick one for you.

486
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,860
Miss pardon me.

487
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,740
Miss.

488
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,020
What did you say?

489
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,300
You have looked muddied.

490
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
I remember that you said

491
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
that Third Young Mistress often treats Jun Fei badly.

492
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Why do you still like her so much?

493
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Third Young Mistress indeed treats Young Master in a way.

494
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
But she treats me well.

495
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300
I often advise her not to treat Young Master like this.

496
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
But she doesn't listen to me.

497
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Maybe she has some prejudice against Young Master.

498
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Pestitude?

499
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
General,

500
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
you are very interested in Miss Jun.

501
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
It's good that Third Young Mistress is still in a good mood.

502
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
If you are willing to take me back to Ye Nan,

503
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,300
I can make you two more old friends.

504
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Compared to the three sisters of Jun,

505
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I am more interested in Miss Qiluo.

506
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
You are really good at talking.

507
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,300
You are interested in our Young Master.

508
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Not in me.

509
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Young Mistress.

510
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
I finally see you.

511
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I finally see you.

512
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Young Mistress, I see you are fine.

513
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
I finally can let go of my heart.

514
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
You are not able to secretly arrive at Yao City.

515
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
You have a premonition on the way.

516
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Are you injured?

517
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Young Mistress is really a good person.

518
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
She has been in a bad mood for several times.

519
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
But I am the one who is being scolded by Young Mistress.

520
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
They won't be able to hurt me.

521
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I want you to bring me the things you brought.

522
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Don't worry, Young Mistress.

523
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
I have brought all the military supplies and supplies that were taken.

524
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Young Mistress.

525
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
And this.

526
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I specially asked Ye Nan to bring the information.

527
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
It was for the second time.

528
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
For this letter,

529
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
I specially sent it to the 3rd department of the Ministry of Revenue.

530
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
That's why I delayed some time.

531
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,300
It's really you, Jun Qiluo.

532
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Your Highness, something bad has happened.

533
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Your Highness.

534
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Doctor, what happened?

535
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
It's a stone window.

536
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
It looks like it's not in good condition.

537
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
It's so short.

538
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Why did it suddenly open a stone window?

539
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
We just checked it once.

540
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
We found that these pieces of cloth

541
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
have been damaged by many animals.

542
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,300
It's due to the animals that were starving to death.

543
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
The living environment of these people is normal.

544
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
The animals that died

545
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
didn't come to deal with them.

546
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:20,060
The

547
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
people are sick now.

548
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
They can't use it.

549
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
If we can't deliver the goods,

550
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,300
we'll be in vain for so long.

551
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Right.

552
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Listen to me.

553
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
Our main task now

554
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
is to make the stone window

555
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
better for everyone to recover.

556
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Don't worry.

557
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Even if we can't deliver the goods,

558
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
we won't be able to pay

559
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
your wages.

560
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Miss Qi, you're so nice.

561
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Everyone is sick in the embroidery room.

562
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
How should you take care of it?

563
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
How is it going now?

564
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Your Excellency,

565
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
more than ten embroidery ladies

566
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
have been infected in the room.

567
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
The situation is not good.

568
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Miss Qi has been working on

569
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
the silver embroidery room.

570
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
You chose the embroidery room

571
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
as the embroidery product.

572
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Now that the embroidery is in trouble,

573
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
it's causing the embroidery ladies to get sick.

574
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Miss Qi,

575
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
should you give

576
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
an explanation to everyone?

577
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
What you mean is,

578
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
I deliberately put these hair

579
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
on the embroidery room to harm the embroidery ladies.

580
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I can't say that in vain.

581
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
But I dare to ask you, Miss Qi,

582
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
you know that the Yan-Nan-Beixuan relationship

583
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
has always been very close.

584
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Why did a Yan-Nan man

585
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
come to my Beixuan alone?

586
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Why did he know

587
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
that the Yan-Nan-Beixuan relationship

588
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
is not good?

589
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
But he had to open

590
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
two cities to help.

591
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
He helped so much

592
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
to open this silver embroidery room.

593
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Now that the embroidery room is out of the window,

594
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
the things are getting worse.

595
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
How could it be so serious?

596
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
If you don't have any intention

597
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
to think about Miss Qi,

598
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
who would believe you?

599
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Yes, yes, yes.

600
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Don't be so serious.

601
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Don't be so serious.

602
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Don't be so serious.

603
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Mr. Xi.

604
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Miss Qi Luo is my lover.

605
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
What she did

606
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
is my doing.

607
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Are you suspecting me

608
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
to harm the people of Liangzhou?

609
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
General Lie,

610
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
you are the one who

611
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
is so serious.

612
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
You are young and young.

613
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
It's okay if you can't see people at all.

614
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,300
But I hope you can

615
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,300
not trust this

616
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
woman again

617
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
through this matter.

618
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Miss Qi Luo and A-Lie

619
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
were born for the sake of the people.

620
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
And these embroidered women

621
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
are not good for them.

622
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
But, Mr. Xi,

623
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
you seem to be very sure

624
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
that this is what Miss Qi Luo did.

625
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Could it be that you saw it yourself?

626
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
You are right, Mr. Luo.

627
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Miss Qi is so considerate.

628
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
It's not her fault.

629
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Mr. Sun,

630
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
since the matter has been settled,

631
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
why don't you solve the problem first?

632
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Who is the one who is the one who is wrong?

633
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
You are right.

634
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
I will give

635
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
a solution to the people of Liangzhou.

636
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
But now,

637
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
you two should

638
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
cooperate with the treatment first.

639
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Zhao Min,

640
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
you should ask the people to

641
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
burn down

642
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
the unruly parts of the oil.

643
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Burn it?

644
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Burn it?

645
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
It's so small.

646
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Don't worry, everyone.

647
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
I will buy the parts again.

648
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
All the expenses

649
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
are on our list.

650
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Zhao Min,

651
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
you don't have to take this responsibility.

652
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Miss Qi,

653
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
I am the princess of Sun Bu.

654
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
I won't do anything

655
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
to you and the people of Liangzhou.

656
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Is there any cure for this?

657
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I heard that

658
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
there is a medicine that can cure this disease.

659
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
But it needs a lot of body care.

660
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
I just sent someone to the medicine room to find the medicine.

661
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
But I was told that

662
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
the body care was gone.

663
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
What should we do now?

664
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

665
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I created this camp.

666
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
I will take care of it.

667
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
I will take care of the medicine.

668
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
I will make it clear

669
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
and give it to the people.

670
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Miss Qi,

671
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
I will give you three days.

672
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
If you can't give a satisfactory answer,

673
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
I will give a satisfactory answer

674
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
to the people of Liangzhou.

675
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Don't worry, Mr. Sun.

676
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Within two days,

677
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

678
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,300
It's so short.

679
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Why are those animal hair

680
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
so ugly?

681
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
There is no wind and weather recently.

682
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
No one has moved the animal.

683
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Could it be

684
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
they are the ones

685
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,300
who have run back to the city?

686
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
What do you think, Miss Qi?

687
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
What do you think, Miss Qi?

688
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
As Mr. Luo said,

689
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
it's not a coincidence.

690
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Someone must have framed it on purpose.

691
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
But as the general said,

692
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
it's not the time

693
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,300
to investigate the people behind the scenes.

694
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
It's the time to find a solution

695
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,300
as soon as possible

696
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
to ensure everyone's safety.

697
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
Let's go to the Chengzhou Medicine Room

698
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
to see if there are any more animals.

699
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Let's split up and move.

700
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Boss, do we have any animals?

701
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,300
What a coincidence.

702
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,300
The animals in my shop

703
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
were all killed ten days ago.

704
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,300
They were gone.

705
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,300
They were broken long ago.

706
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
I don't know

707
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
when they could be found.

708
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,300
The animals are gone.

709
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
They were sold out long ago.

710
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
It seems that someone stole the money.

711
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
But they can't buy the medicine.

712
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
What should we do now?

713
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
All the vital organs

714
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
in the same time

715
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
are all dead.

716
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
We can't be a burden.

717
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
The time is precious.

718
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,300
The disease can't be removed.

719
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
There are no flowers in the medicine shop.

720
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Let's go to the mountain.

721
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Princess, Miss Qi.

722
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
We heard that the Yinzhi House is very powerful.

723
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,300
But after three days,

724
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
it's a day of exchange.

725
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Can we still get the goods?

726
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Yes.

727
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,300
What's the matter?

728
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
The Yinzhi House is indeed in a bad situation.

729
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
After three days,

730
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
we can't get the goods.

731
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
We'd like to ask you to pay a few days.

732
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
No way.

733
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
We can't take back

734
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
all the orders.

735
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
We can't get the goods.

736
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
We'll take it as a big deal.

737
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Yes.

738
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Everyone, please rest in peace.

739
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I will definitely give you an explanation.

740
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
What's there to say?

741
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Either we get the goods secretly

742
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,300
or we pay three times the loss.

743
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,300
That's right.

744
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Welcome.

745
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
Welcome.

746
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Don't talk.

747
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Everyone, please give me back the money.

748
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
I'll tell you.

749
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Who gave you the guts?

750
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
General Lie,

751
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
the Yinzhi House has just established history.

752
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
We support it all.

753
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Now that there is a problem,

754
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
we can't let our fault be our fault.

755
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Yes, General Lie.

756
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
I told you in the beginning

757
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
that we should make the Yinzhi House

758
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
the biggest embroidery house in Beijing.

759
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
This is still the only way to go.

760
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
If you want to withdraw the orders,

761
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
we'll give you the money

762
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
if you don't mind.

763
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
If you still have any information

764
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
about us,

765
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
if you still have any information about us,

766
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
the money you invested in the past,

767
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
you can not only get the goods,

768
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
but also become the Xiaodongjia of the Yinzhi House.

769
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
That is to say,

770
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
the money you earn after the Yinzhi House,

771
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,300
you all can earn money together.

772
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Become Xiaodongjia?

773
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,300
That's a good idea.

774
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Yes.

775
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Yes.

776
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
I've been with the first business man

777
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
in the Yannan first business.

778
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
There are also big business stores in the west.

779
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Including some small cities around the area.

780
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
So the sales of the Yinzhi House

781
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
will be less and less.

782
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
As long as you are safe and sound,

783
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
give me more time to spend.

784
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
I promise.

785
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Everyone's money

786
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
will have more than three times the profit.

787
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,300
Okay.

788
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
Let's meet again, Miss Qi.

789
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,300
I hope you won't let us down.

790
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Don't worry.

791
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
We've already said it.

792
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Let's go.

793
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
I'm Xiaodongjia.

794
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
I'll give you three times the profit.

795
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Who is it?

796
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Luo Qi.

797
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Keep an eye on her.

798
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Yes.

799
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Zhao Min.

800
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
I was too anxious just now.

801
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
I didn't discuss it with you.

802
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
So I made my own decision.

803
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
It's okay, Sister Qi.

804
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
I'll support you

805
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
no matter what you decide.

806
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
I heard that the military officers

807
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
are good at business.

808
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I didn't expect Miss Qi Luo to be like this.

809
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
I just learned a few points

810
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
with Young Master.

811
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Miss Qi Luo has signed it.

812
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
It's not just a few points.

813
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
The broken confidence just now

814
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
is like the one

815
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
I saw with the military.

816
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
You've never seen Young Master

817
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,300
and you know what he is.

818
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm just a tiger.

819
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
The body is all buried.

820
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Those merchants

821
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
have a money-making deposit in advance.

822
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Someone must have pushed the owner

823
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
behind them.

824
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
What should we do now?

825
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,300
We'll go to the mountain tomorrow to pick up the body.

826
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
I've sent 12 relatives

827
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
to go to the mountain for the body.

828
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Zhizhou,

829
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
I'll help you.

830
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
I'll send a letter to Grandma

831
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
to help them find the body together.

832
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,300
But Young Master,

833
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
if the mountain and the mountain

834
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
are all buried,

835
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
what should we do?

836
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
There must be a way to find the body.

837
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Zhao Min.

838
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
What's up, Father?

839
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
I heard that General Lie and Miss Qi

840
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
went to the mountain to find the body early in the morning.

841
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,300
It's already three days.

842
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Why haven't they come back yet?

843
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,300
It seems that

844
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
the body is not so easy to find.

845
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Don't worry.

846
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
General Lie and Miss Qi will find it.

847
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,300
They say that the body of the wild animal

848
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
is much better than the body of the plant.

849
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
As long as they find it,

850
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
the mother of the embroidery will be able to recover.

851
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
The house of our Ying's will be open.

852
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
I'll go first.

853
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Go there and take a look.

854
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Let's go.

855
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I'll go down and pick it up.

856
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Go.

857
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Go.

858
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Take it.

859
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Go.

860
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Are you okay?

861
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Miss Qi Luo's position is just right.

862
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
She can't fall.

863
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
The pain is cut off by you.

864
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
If I don't cut off the pain,

865
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
how can they take away the body?

866
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
Miss Qi Luo is

867
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
a very good person.

868
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
Otherwise, how could the old fox

869
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
break out of the tail?

870
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

871
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
met a little fox.

872
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
General.

873
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Can I let go of my hand?

874
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,300
Come on.

875
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
How are we going to go down?

876
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Miss Qi Luo,

877
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
this is not a good idea.

878
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Miss Qi Luo,

879
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
I'm sorry.

880
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,300
It seems that

881
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
we can't go back tonight.

882
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,300
Let's just deal with it here.

883
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
I didn't expect that you're afraid of the old fox.

884
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
It's just the old fox.

885
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,300
What are you afraid of?

886
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,300
The house is old and old.

887
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Some animals are normal.

888
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Yes.

889
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Miss Qi Luo is a girl.

890
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
But she's not good at form.

891
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
She's not good at man.

892
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
It's just that you don't have much experience.

893
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Not all women are afraid of the old fox.

894
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Have a rest.

895
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Why don't you come to sleep?

896
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

897
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

898
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

899
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

900
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

901
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

902
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

903
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

904
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

905
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

906
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

907
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

908
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

909
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

910
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

911
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

912
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

913
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

914
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

915
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

916
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

917
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

918
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

919
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

920
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

921
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

922
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

923
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

924
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

925
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

926
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

927
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

928
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

929
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

930
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

931
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

932
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

933
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

934
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

935
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

936
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

937
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

938
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

939
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

940
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Will be afraid of the old fox.

941
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Will be afraid that the old fox

942
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

943
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
I'm afraid that the old fox

944
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
will be afraid of the old fox.

945
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,300
We elect a higher class

946
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
young generation

947
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
We elect a higher class

948
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,300
young generation

949
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
young generation

950
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
young generation

951
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,300
who do not speak

952
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,820
of the old fox.

953
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,820
The past is full of the past

954
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,820
The past is empty

955
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,820
I want to be a little bit closer

956
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,820
The heart is the old age of past

957
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,820
I don't want to live in the dark

958
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Let you fall in love again

959
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:39,820
Let you fall in love again
