1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
The Love byuck

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,920
Just like the wind blows through myaghetti

3
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,560
After you, I will wait for snow to fall

4
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,800
And I will watch the end of the world

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,960
The world is not set.

6
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,640
All countries are in chaos.

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,760
The north, south, west, and south are divided into three worlds.

8
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,120
The north, south, and south are divided into three worlds.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,040
The five parts of the dark-walled world are divided into two worlds.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,440
The two worlds are divided into two worlds.

11
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
The two worlds are divided into two worlds.

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,560
The two worlds are divided into two worlds.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,880
The business of the south of the world is not strong enough to compete with the north.

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,640
The weapons of the military and the south are the key to the jade Empire.

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,160
Don't worry, father.

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,680
I will be a hundred-point-toe soldier,

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,960
I will guard the south and the military.

18
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
The north, south, and south are divided into three worlds.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,520
The weapons of the hundred-point-toe soldier are divided into three worlds.

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,040
The seven parts of the jade are closely monitored.

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,360
The hundred-point-toe soldier of the country is the son of the military.

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
The military is not full.

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll go.

24
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,720
Father.

25
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,640
Haven't you found Xuan Tian's essence?

26
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
I've already found Yan Nan's whereabouts.

27
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,360
I still don't have any news.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
The business team will go to the Western Xiang.

29
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
I can take this opportunity to go to the Western Xiang.

30
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
I don't allow you to go.

31
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,800
Father.

32
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,040
The three departments of the B-tour must go to the Western Xiang.

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,080
Jin Lin, Beixuan, Ma Zeyheng,

34
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,040
the B-tour Department of the B-tour

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,240
will choose the chief.

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,760
The situation in the border is chaotic.

37
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm worried that if you...

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,840
Father.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,280
The usual pressure on the team is not enough to make you worry.

40
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,000
But Xuan Tian's essence is about the improvement of the Lotus Root.

41
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,680
After choosing the chief,

42
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
the next step will be to attack Yan Nan.

43
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,120
If we can't find Xuan Tian's essence before this,

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
and solve the Lotus Root problem,

45
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,960
I'm afraid His Majesty will blame our military.

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
So don't say it's a Western Xiang.

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
Even if it's Beixuan,

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
I must go to try it.

49
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,360
You...

50
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,880
Father.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,320
Listen to me.

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
Recover your daughter.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,600
Don't take the risk.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,680
Father.

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
Even if I recover my daughter,

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,280
I still have to send a hundred workers to the capital

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,880
to continue to design weapons for His Majesty.

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
The military family is in the process of a woman's death.

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,800
Are you really willing to hand over all the military family's family

60
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
to the second house?

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
I'm sure that in less than a year,

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
the military family will be able to collect the produce

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
that has accumulated for decades.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
And I've decided since I was seven years old

65
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,680
that unless there are better officials in the military family,

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I'll be a military criminal forever.

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
You're being discovered again.

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,760
You're playing the same tricks.

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,920
You should change something next time.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
Do you need anything from me?

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,480
I heard that you're going to get your daughter married to Qi Mingge.

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,440
Did you agree?

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,480
I'm just a soldier.

74
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,360
I told you.

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,600
How could you agree?

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,160
Qi Mingge is kind and he's a good man to you.

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
But I always feel that you're not the same person.

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Am I right, Second Sister?

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Qi Mingge has been the only brother who trusted you

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
for so many years.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,160
I think he's the best

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
to know his identity.

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,360
The brother is the one who developed the military family's business

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,080
to the 80th shop in Yainan

85
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,320
and created the new method of nuclear gold.

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,520
It's a man who can lead the people of Yainan to get married.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,480
He can be a normal man.

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,200
If the brother really wants to get his daughter married,

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,480
he should be a good man.

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't need men.

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,440
My biggest wish in this life is to protect the military family,

92
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,120
protect you two, and protect my father.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm going to the Western Xiaoxing Village tomorrow.

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
Xiu Kun, you're the best in our three palaces.

95
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,320
You should take good care of the gold and gold embroidery.

96
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,680
General, you're so talented.

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,160
When I'm not around, you should be happy.

98
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,840
Help Linbo take care of the shop.

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,560
If there's anything wrong with the jewelry store,

100
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
tell me immediately.

101
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,840
Brother, when will you come back?

102
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,920
I'll come back before the grand meeting.

103
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Father, if anything happens to the two palaces

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
when I'm not around,

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
you must be patient and forgive me.

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,840
I'm here. They can't resist.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,320
You must be careful

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,360
when you're on your way.

109
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,640
Father, don't worry.

110
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
It's not my first time to go to the Western Xiaoxing Village.

111
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Xia Yan, the nuclear team is ready.

112
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
Father, we're leaving now.

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,960
Okay.

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,600
Qi Mian, protect Feifan.

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
I'll go to the Western Xiaoxing Village.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
I'll go to the Western Xiaoxing Village.

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
I'll go to the Western Xiaoxing Village.

118
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't worry, Master.

119
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,920
I'll protect Master with my life.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
Take him back safely.

121
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
Brother.

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
I don't know why I'm always worried about it.

123
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,760
Take this safe box with you.

124
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,200
The box is from Second Sister.

125
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,400
But I learned the box from Li Tuo.

126
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,800
It's a safe place for people to rest.

127
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,840
Where did you find these good things?

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,960
It can be a new product for the jewelry store.

129
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Brother, don't think about the goods all day.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
You should care about your own safety.

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
We're leaving now.

132
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,320
Okay.

133
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,640
Let's go.

134
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,920
Bro.

135
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
Brother.

136
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,480
What's wrong?

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Go twelve o'clock.

138
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,800
After the matter is changed,

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
we must leave as soon as possible.

140
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,020
I Santo Armor will check all problems

141
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,600
with the olfactory materials

142
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,360
to know if the vocalization was correct.

143
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,860
Yes.

144
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,400
Young Master.

145
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,160
Since the war,

146
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Shang San thought they can do nothing.

147
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,160
And they couldn't get to Xiblock.

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,240
If we can't get to Xiblock,

149
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,020
We have to try 3 times on these ugly boxes.

150
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,420
Looking foresehen metal will delay.

151
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,680
First King's 피� monitored and disciplined

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,140
I guess you're strong, quickly

153
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,980
Old man

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Start

155
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,220
First King is Там

156
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,080
First King looks worried

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,080
It's brother

158
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,340
Liu

159
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,640
Brother

160
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,280
Liu

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Then

162
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm afraid

163
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,440
I think it's a good idea

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,320
I heard that when he was born,

165
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,760
Jing Bu was born with the

166
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Xiong Ying Taichi.

167
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
He was the general of Tianxuan.

168
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
He and His Majesty are from the same clan.

169
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
The leader of the Lang Chu is in the Bidong.

170
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Our clan leader is also very good.

171
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Young Master,

173
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Xiong and Yan Zan have been together for a hundred years.

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
They never talk about justice.

175
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
They only kill the one who is in the fire.

176
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Young Master, if you can give them

177
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
a better choice than killing the one who is in the fire,

178
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
they will agree.

179
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
The fire is too risky.

180
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Why don't we wait for the next team?

181
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
When?

182
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Let's go.

183
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Big Brother,

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
I am the leader of the team.

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I went to the west-scented business.

186
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I came here to meet Ma Wen.

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I came here to talk to the noble and precious people.

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Let them come here.

189
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
What's the matter?

190
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
The sword and the horse.

191
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
The face.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
A piece of the kese is used as your horse.

193
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
It's worth a shot.

194
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Kese?

195
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
The kese of the Yan-Nan Army is the world of the temple.

196
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,280
It's a rare piece of the royal family.

197
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Have you ever heard of it?

198
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
I know the kese's name.

199
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Of course I know it.

200
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
But it's obvious that

201
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,280
your kese is real.

202
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
So,

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
you mean it?

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
So,

205
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
the kese is like a building.

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
When the kese is used as a kese,

207
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
the kese is like a building.

208
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
The kese is like a building.

209
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Forget it.

210
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I am a west-scented businesswoman.

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I have been on this road for a long time.

212
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I know there is a small road.

213
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I know there is a small road.

214
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
If you need me,

215
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
I will tell you.

216
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I will tell you.

217
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
These people's bodies are not like the kese.

218
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
And they are all seen by the outside world.

219
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I am afraid they can't see them.

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
We can't wait until the battle.

221
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
We have to get out of the valley before.

222
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Hurry up.

223
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Mother, it's the kese.

224
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
The kese is coming.

225
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Be careful.

226
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Kill them.

227
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
We can't kill them.

228
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,320
Kill them.

229
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Kill them.

230
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Young Master, are you okay?

231
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I am fine.

232
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Young Master,

233
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
don't try to kill the kese.

234
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Go to the top of the mountain.

235
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Find the kese and kill them all.

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Kill them all.

237
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
These people are wearing ancient weapons.

238
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
They are different from the kese.

239
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
It seems they are not a kese.

240
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
They are the kese with the blood.

241
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
They are all seen by the outside world.

242
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Kill them all.

243
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Kill them all.

244
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Kill them all.

245
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Kill them all.

246
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Kill them.

247
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Kill them.

248
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Go.

249
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Young Master.

250
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Young Master.

251
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Young Master.

252
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Young Master.

253
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
You are the leader of the kese.

254
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Go.

255
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Qi Mi, how is it?

256
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Young Master, let's go.

257
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Young Master, we didn't find the kese.

258
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Chase them. They are in front of us.

259
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
You escaped from this trap.

260
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
If you can come back, I will help them.

261
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,320
No, I will let you go with me.

262
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Listen to me.

263
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I will leave them to you.

264
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I will not let anyone hurt you.

265
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Qi Mi.

266
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
I will let them wait for you.

267
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
They need you.

268
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Qi Mi.

269
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Qi Mi.

270
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Qi Mi.

271
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Qi Mi.

272
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Qi Mi.

273
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,320
8

274
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,320
What are you looking at. Go back.

275
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Old Master is going to take you back.

276
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
He needs you.

277
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,440
I will reward you with this.

278
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,140
Never.

279
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,440
I know problems are hard to learn.

280
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,280
I've really been unable to Do it.

281
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:36,800
Pushed on you from theyin

282
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,600
This lunch is so shameless.

283
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Come out.

284
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
You're a woman?

285
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Who are you?

286
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm Jun Fei Fan.

287
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
What's Jun Fei Fan?

288
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I don't know him.

289
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
I'm Jun Fei Fan.

290
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm Jun Fei Fan.

291
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
The one who is in the military team

292
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,120
doesn't know Jun Fei Fan.

293
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Are you trying to kill me?

294
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm not in the military team.

295
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,520
You got the wrong person.

296
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,320
Young Master,

297
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,000
we found a

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,120
very beautiful silk piece

299
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
in the collection.

300
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,440
Your Excellency.

301
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,560
It's the Yan Lan's

302
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,920
Lord I consequence.

303
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,700
Such docile沒

304
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,160
young lady.

305
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,020
If you guessed it right,

306
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,640
then this is the Sipond's

307
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,760
Bite?

308
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
I never knew this was

309
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Did you search the shop from my shop?

310
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Look, I said you caught the wrong person.

311
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
You are not talented enough to rob the shop.

312
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
You took all the gold and silver coins.

313
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Let go of me.

314
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
It seems that I am too much to you.

315
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
I ride.

316
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Do you want to say it now

317
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
or to suffer a little more?

318
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
What do you want me to say?

319
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
I am just an ordinary businessman

320
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
and a common person in the North Shrine.

321
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I heard that he was born.

322
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Please don't save the whole world.

323
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
The world is so beautiful.

324
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
That's the first choice of the whole group.

325
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
So he is Xuan Li.

326
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
There is a way.

327
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
You better understand.

328
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
I have a heart.

329
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Where did you bring the weapon?

330
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
I bought it.

331
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
No matter what, the horse thief is cruel.

332
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
He used it to protect himself.

333
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
This step is useless.

334
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I don't want to buy it.

335
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
That's all.

336
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Take all you want.

337
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
But...

338
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Compared to me,

339
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
you may be more interested in the shop in the North Shrine.

340
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,680
I found that they are very keen on the goods in the middle of the carriage.

341
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
There are a dozen people who don't look like the watchman.

342
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
They are always there.

343
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
I guess

344
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
there must be a lot of rare goods.

345
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
That's why.

346
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
We have nothing to do with the military and the shop.

347
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
It has nothing to do with the shop in the North Shrine.

348
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
This time, it's really a disaster.

349
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
The shop in the North Shrine

350
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
and the shop in the military shop.

351
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
The shop in the military shop.

352
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
How did you know that the shop in the military shop is Wei Shi?

353
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Young Master.

354
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
These are the goods of the military shop.

355
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
These are from another shop.

356
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Be careful.

357
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
It's not moving.

358
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Open it.

359
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Yes.

360
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
This is our weapons of the North Shrine.

361
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Check all the boxes.

362
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Someone used the shop to cover the goods

363
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
and sell the military equipment.

364
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Although the weapons are all evidence,

365
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,680
the military equipment is also a crime.

366
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Which tribe is it?

367
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
How dare you?

368
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Let the wind blow out.

369
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Someone from the North Shrine

370
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
has ordered the military equipment to be sold.

371
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
The shop in the Shrine has been suppressed.

372
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
They are being held in the military camp.

373
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Young Master, you are really smart.

374
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
If the other party knows that

375
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
someone is in our hands,

376
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
they will send someone to kill him.

377
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
By then,

378
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
it will be a suicide.

379
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:45,700
The

380
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,680
Young Master, I heard you call

381
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Jun Feifan in the ball world last night.

382
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Miss.

383
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Yes.

384
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
It's really a woman.

385
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Then we are not catching the wrong person.

386
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
It's not right.

387
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
The Marquis of the Mount Tengwen

388
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
is just passing by the military.

389
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Their intelligence

390
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
should not be wrong.

391
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
The military knows that we are looking for Jun Feifan.

392
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
They deliberately let fake news to confuse us.

393
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
In the Yan Nan's business team,

394
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
they can't find anything

395
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
that can prove the business of the military.

396
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Except this batch of dead bodies,

397
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
they contacted our shop

398
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
to find out how many women

399
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
and the movements of Jun Feifan

400
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
of the military.

401
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Young Master,

402
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
the Yan Nan's etiquette is very strict.

403
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Women will never pass by.

404
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
And it's hard to get into Yan Nan.

405
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
If Yan Nan is well-behaved,

406
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Jun Feifan is easy to find,

407
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
we will go to Yan Nan directly to catch people.

408
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
We still need to stay in the Sanbukuan area.

409
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Yes.

410
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
But this time,

411
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
we didn't catch Jun Feifan.

412
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
We can't find

413
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
the case of Lord Xun Shuo.

414
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
So we must find him.

415
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
General. General.

416
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
That Yan Nan is not allowed to run away.

417
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
General.

418
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
Retreat.

419
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Retreat.

420
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Young Master.

421
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
How can we get out of Yan Nan's etiquette?

422
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
If you want to escape,

423
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
it's useless.

424
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Kill him.

425
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Xuan Li.

426
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
You can't kill me.

427
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
You know Young Master's identity.

428
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
If you know too much,

429
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I can't keep you.

430
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I know Jun Feifan is in trouble.

431
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
I know.

432
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I know Jun Feifan is in trouble.

433
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
You told me about your letter yesterday.

434
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
You have nothing to do with Jun's family.

435
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Now, how are you going to lie to me?

436
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
As long as you can kill me with your hands,

437
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
how can I dare to lie to you?

438
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Go.

439
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Miss Jun.

440
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
You Yan Nan women

441
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
are too arrogant.

442
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
If I were you,

443
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
I would have been a good girl.

444
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Now, you should be a good girl.

445
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
You should be a good girl.

446
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
You should be a good girl.

447
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
How can you be so shameless

448
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
to make General look down on you?

449
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
If you weren't Jun's family,

450
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,680
how would you know Jun Feifan's whereabouts?

451
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
You are right.

452
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
But you guessed it right.

453
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I can only count

454
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
half of Jun's family.

455
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
My lord.

456
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Actually,

457
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm the god-groomed maid of Young Master Feifan.

458
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
My name is Qi Luo.

459
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Why do you look at me like that?

460
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
I think you are lying.

461
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
You are so sincere and self-righteous.

462
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
You are really admirable.

463
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
I've changed the order of Jun's family.

464
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
I've hidden the 100-groomed maid.

465
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Who are you?

466
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm just a maid.

467
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Why did Jun's family

468
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
give me the order of Jun's family?

469
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Why did you

470
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
give me the order of Jun's family?

471
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
I'm just a maid.

472
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Why did you give me the order of Jun's family?

473
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Why did Jun's family give me the order of Jun's family?

474
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
It's because

475
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Young Master and I are in love.

476
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
This is the love letter he gave me.

477
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
You are in love with Jun Feifan?

478
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Where is Jun Feifan now?

479
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
We met a horseman on the way.

480
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
We killed half of the horse.

481
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
We couldn't get to the west.

482
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Young Master sent the west to protect the shop.

483
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
He went to the west to explain to the shop first.

484
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
He told me

485
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
that he would let me go to the west to meet him right away.

486
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Why did you

487
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
dress up as a maid?

488
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Why did the shop team

489
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
call you Young Master?

490
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Young Master is afraid that he won't be in the shop.

491
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
The shop team will lose confidence.

492
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
So he ordered me to use the rough side to fake him.

493
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
That's why I won't be heartless.

494
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Jun Feifan gave the important task to you

495
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
to the shop team.

496
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
It seems

497
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
he is very concerned about you.

498
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
In this business,

499
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
I see that it's more important than my life.

500
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
This is the love letter Young Master gave me.

501
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Please return it to me.

502
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Young Master.

503
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
You look nervous.

504
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Are you afraid that I'll break up?

505
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
This is Young Master's love letter.

506
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I'm nervous.

507
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
You're smart.

508
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
It's a good idea to be a maid.

509
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
You can be a good maid.

510
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
You can be a good maid.

511
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
If I were Jun Feifan,

512
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
I would let you be a maid.

513
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
You will be a maid with a woman?

514
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
The wealth of Dongliang

515
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
is not divided into two.

516
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
It's not hard to be a maid.

517
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Of course I can.

518
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I heard that Feifan

519
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
has also gone to the Western Xiang with the shop team.

520
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Your Majesty,

521
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
I and Feifan

522
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,280
searched for the Xuan Iron

523
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,680
for months in the southern world.

524
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
So Feifan

525
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
went to the Western Xiang for the shop team.

526
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

527
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
I and Feifan

528
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
never forgot the key to this.

529
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
How confident are you this time?

530
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Well...

531
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
I'm not sure.

532
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
I...

533
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
I'm not willing to give up.

534
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,360
The

535
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
next step is

536
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
to attack Yan Nan.

537
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Our defense is serious.

538
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
The change is in Meijie.

539
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,680
But you...

540
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
You told me

541
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
that you wouldn't be able to find the Xuan Iron.

542
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
But you're still so stubborn.

543
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Your Majesty,

544
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Cao Ming and Feifan

545
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
shouldn't have a chance to escape.

546
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
They should try their best

547
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
to solve the problem of the chicken stock.

548
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,680
They should be safe in Yan Nan.

549
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
No.

550
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
You rest for a while.

551
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
We'll talk about the details later.

552
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Pack up a tent

553
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
and clean the clothes.

554
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Give this...

555
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Young Master.

556
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Yes.

557
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Young Master, please.

558
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Young Master.

559
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Young Master.

560
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Young Master.

561
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Young Master.

562
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
How do I feel that

563
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
you two are a little...

564
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Young Master.

565
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
My acting skills are good.

566
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
The woman in Yan Nan

567
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
was scared by me.

568
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
She's so cold-hearted.

569
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
She's going to die in my hands.

570
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
If I hadn't stopped her in time,

571
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
you would have been eliminated.

572
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Young Master.

573
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
You taught me this.

574
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
You need to be a good actor.

575
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
You said that this person is very cunning.

576
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
If we don't force her

577
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
to be a life and death problem,

578
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
how could she say the truth?

579
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
But we are both North Xuan's men.

580
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
We treat her like a woman

581
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
who is a man of the hand.

582
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Isn't that good?

583
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
A man of the hand?

584
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Xuan Li.

585
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
The unrighteous choice of the master of North Xuan.

586
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Why did she

587
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
insist on looking for Jun Fei Fan?

588
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
What's the reason

589
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
for this woman to come here?

590
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Does she really know

591
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
where Jun Fei Fan is?

592
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
She said she is Jun Fei Fan's maid.

593
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
She is more affectionate.

594
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Affectionate?

595
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
She said Jun Fei Fan is not a rich man.

596
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Even a maid in a warm room

597
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
looks so pretty.

598
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Do you believe it?

599
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
If she finds out

600
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
that Jun Fei Fan is a man of the hand,

601
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
she will be very happy.

602
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,680
If she finds out that Jun Fei Fan is a man of the hand,

603
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
she will only hold me back.

604
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
She will make His Majesty

605
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
turn to Jun Fei Fan and be a man of the hand.

606
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,680
With His Majesty's kindness,

607
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
she will definitely train Jun Fei Fan.

608
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
I will definitely hide Jun Fei Fan as a man of the hand.

609
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
I will soon leave.

610
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
You mean

611
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
she is still lying to the head?

612
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
She has a man of the hand.

613
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
It's true that she knows Jun Fei Fan.

614
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Let's check the other ones.

615
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
That's a good idea.

616
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Can I have a seat, Miss Jun?

617
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Who is General?

618
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
I forgot the ceremony.

619
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
Your name is Qi.

620
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
If you don't mind,

621
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
sit down.

622
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Miss Qi Luo,

623
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
you can tell me now

624
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,960
Can you tell me where Jun Feifan is now?

625
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,720
I want to find our Young Master

626
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,000
to be a master of art.

627
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,400
But I still need to talk to General.

628
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,720
Tell me.

629
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,160
What's the condition?

630
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,040
First,

631
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,440
General needs to protect my life.

632
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,160
Don't worry.

633
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
I won't kill you.

634
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,080
Second,

635
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,920
Young Master will hand the wounded to me.

636
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,920
But I let them die.

637
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,520
I know I can't avenge them

638
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,400
by fighting with General.

639
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,640
I'd like to ask General

640
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,800
to take care of them.

641
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,560
The scene was chaotic.

642
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,840
I didn't see anything.

643
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,440
I didn't mean to kill the soldiers.

644
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,600
Forget it.

645
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,920
Don't say anything else.

646
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,680
I'll take care of them.

647
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,640
Don't worry.

648
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,280
You've been in a hurry these days.

649
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,720
Have something to eat.

650
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,800
I can promise you

651
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,200
the previous two conditions.

652
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Now you can tell me

653
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,000
where Jun Feifan is now.

654
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,720
Not yet.

655
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,880
Are you kidding me?

656
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,880
General, you're too slow.

657
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,760
I just have a question.

658
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,360
Go ahead.

659
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,960
If you dare to ask General

660
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,720
what's the matter with Young Master,

661
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,320
if Young Master is in danger,

662
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,080
I can't betray him.

663
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,320
Don't worry.

664
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,760
I won't kill him.

665
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,280
I've seen many North Xuan people

666
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,640
with their family members

667
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,520
and go on a trip.

668
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,080
North Xuan's economy is weak.

669
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,280
They can't guarantee their lives.

670
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
I heard that Jun Feifan

671
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,800
has led the entire

672
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,240
Yanan economy

673
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
in the way of the People's Republic.

674
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,640
So I want to ask him

675
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,160
to help North Xuan's economy

676
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,360
to move out of the country.

677
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
It can also make North Xuan's people

678
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,040
live a warm life.

679
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,080
General, the people are

680
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,680
the blessing of North Xuan.

681
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,320
Now Young Master is in the West.

682
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,800
I know that the business

683
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,680
can take General to find him.

684
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,160
But I still have three conditions.

685
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,880
I want to send my goods to the West.

686
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
This way, I can keep Young Master

687
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,720
and Jun's family happy.

688
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,480
I didn't expect that Miss Qiluo

689
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,480
would be so loyal to Jun's family.

690
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,240
I can't be loyal anymore.

691
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,760
To protect Young Master's life,

692
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,760
I just want to ask for a little bit of peace.

693
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,560
General, we still have to make a decision.

694
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,360
If Young Master finds out that the business is in danger,

695
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,600
he will be in trouble.

696
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,920
I promise you

697
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,320
that I will go to the West tomorrow.

698
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,360
Then I won't disturb you.

699
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,840
I promise you.

700
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I promise you.

701
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
I promise you.

702
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
I promise you.

703
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
I promise you.

704
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
I promise you.

705
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I promise you.

706
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I promise you.

707
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I promise you.

708
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
I promise you.

709
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
I promise you.

710
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I promise you.

711
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I promise you.

712
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
I promise you.

713
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
I promise you.

714
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
I promise you.

715
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I promise you.

716
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
I promise you.

717
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
I promise you.

718
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
I promise you.

719
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
I promise you.

720
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
I promise you.

721
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I promise you.

722
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
I promise you.

723
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
I promise you.

724
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
I promise you.

725
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
I promise you.

726
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
I promise you.

727
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
I promise you.

728
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
I promise you.

729
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
I promise you.

730
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
I promise you.

731
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I promise you.

732
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
I promise you.

733
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,920
I promise you.

734
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
I promise you.

735
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
I promise you.

736
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
I promise you.

737
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
I promise you.

738
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
I promise you.

739
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
I promise you.

740
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,920
I promise you.

741
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,920
I promise you.

742
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
I promise you.

743
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
I promise you.

744
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
I promise you.

745
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,920
I promise you.
