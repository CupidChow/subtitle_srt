00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,700
Part of today's 1300 year 10 years of years

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,040
how are you

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,200
Is the truth

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,820
Thank you

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,340
Is this true you love me?

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,060
Respect to myself

11
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,260
I will wait

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,360
Still received

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,540
Don't move

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,280
I've been single for years

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,920
Why praise to myself

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,340
I understand

17
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,020
Promise me

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,720
Move

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,900
テロ份

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,260
You're working so hard

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,500
For this

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Retreat!

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Who sent you here?

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Qingming!

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Stop!

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Go!

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Qingming!

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,900
There are still many people.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,900
Let's go.

30
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Go!

31
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,900
Hurry up!

32
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Hurry up!

33
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Don't chase them!

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
My lord ordered us to force them to leave.

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Go back and seal your order.

36
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Go!

37
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Why are you here?

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Where is Young Master?

39
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Lord Luo, why are you in such a hurry?

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Young Master went to the city to look for Princess.

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,500
He is afraid that His Majesty and Empress Dowager will worry about him.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
He sent me to the palace to report to His Majesty.

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
His Majesty has been busy with the oil hunting recently.

44
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
He just fell asleep.

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
Don't disturb His Majesty anymore.

46
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
Besides, if Ah Lie is here,

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,900
Princess will be fine.

48
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
You go back to the Xuan Fu Palace and wait for my news.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
I'll take the soldiers to pick up.

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Lord Luo, we should go with you.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,900
The oil hunting is still going on for three days.

52
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,300
Ah Lie is the most popular option for the Langzhu.

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
All the tribes are watching the whole thing,

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
especially the west.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
If we move the Xuan Yu Army now,

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,100
we will be shocked.

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
I will go and protect them.

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,100
You go back to the mansion and do the construction.

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Please, Lord Luo.

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,500
Lord Jun.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,300
Lord Jun, Wang Du's mansion is here.

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Qi Luo.

63
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
Hurry up and find someone to go to the Xuan Fu Palace.

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,300
Yes.

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,900
Stop.

66
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,700
Who are you?

67
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
We are the merchants in the mountain.

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,700
We just met a bandit who was injured on the way.

69
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,100
We had to come here.

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,700
Can we be quick?

71
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,300
I can't make the decision.

72
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,700
I have to ask.

73
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,100
I'll go and get it.

74
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,100
I'll go and get it.

75
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,500
Here.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,100
The soldiers here are all officials.

77
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,500
Why are they here now?

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,900
They are probably bandits.

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,100
You and bandits say we are merchants.

80
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,700
Isn't this a place for the merchants to go in?

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,700
We are not familiar with this place.

82
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
If it's a farm,

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
we will suspect it.

84
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
If it's a farm,

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
they won't dare to go.

86
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,300
How do you prove

87
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,900
that you are ordinary merchants?

88
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,700
We are in a hurry today.

89
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,500
We can prove our identity

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,700
by wearing a bandit's shoes.

91
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,500
This is the jewelry

92
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,100
we made ourselves.

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,700
You can ask the merchants

94
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
to come to the mountain tomorrow.

95
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,700
You are the person in charge of the house?

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Yes.

97
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm sorry to say this.

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,100
I'm a man.

99
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm not a woman

100
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,500
who can take care of my wife.

101
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,700
I'm the woman in charge.

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,700
Yes.

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,100
The snake is beautiful.

104
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,100
It's beautiful.

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Since it's like this,

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,100
we can't wait for it.

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,300
Please.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,900
Thank you.

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
These two rooms,

110
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,700
I'll find someone to clean them up.

111
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,500
By the way,

112
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
there are a few important things

113
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
I need to repeat.

114
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,500
Those weapons

115
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
are used by us in the hunting area.

116
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
We are merchants.

117
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Don't be so angry.

118
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Don't run away.

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,300
Don't worry.

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,900
Why do you have so many wounds on you?

121
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm not sure.

122
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm afraid that

123
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
you will be hurt.

124
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm afraid that

125
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
you will be hurt so much.

126
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm a young warrior.

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
These are all small wounds.

128
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,500
This is the place

129
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,700
you've been looking for, right?

130
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,700
They have a headache.

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,500
That head.

132
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,300
Even a headache.

133
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,700
I should find

134
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,900
clues here.

135
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
These people are very cautious.

136
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
I'm afraid that you will find

137
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,700
some clues.

138
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
There will be a meeting three days later.

139
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,100
Before that,

140
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,500
I must find a way to let them talk.

141
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,700
Are you going to have a guess

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
about the black people in the secret forest?

143
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,900
The one who led me to leave Wangcheng

144
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
must be Xi Changkun.

145
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
But he didn't know

146
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,300
that I've been looking for a chance to get in.

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,900
This time, it's a serious matter.

148
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,100
I don't think it's Xi Changkun.

149
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,300
Someone sent a message to Qi Ming.

150
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,100
I came here to find him.

151
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
Xi Changkun doesn't know his identity.

152
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,100
Where did Li Youying come from?

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
I was in danger.

154
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,500
Qi Ming didn't come here without a clue.

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,900
He's worried about you.

156
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,700
We grew up together.

157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,700
It's natural for him to care about me.

158
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,900
You've lost a hairpin here.

159
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,500
I made this hairpin myself.

160
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,300
It's much more valuable than your hairpin.

161
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
You're really not a good person.

162
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
I didn't expect you to have a hairpin

163
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,700
that can make such a beautiful hairpin.

164
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,700
Go to sleep.

165
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
I'm going to sleep.

166
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,300
You're injured.

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,900
Of course, you're going to be left with a bed.

168
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
It's all bandits outside.

169
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
I can sit here and have a seat.

170
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,900
We pretend to be married.

171
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,500
We're going to be a couple.

172
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Those words are just a lie.

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,300
You don't have to be so serious.

174
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Okay, I'm going to sleep.

175
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
What's the good thing about you?

176
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
You're so selfish.

177
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,300
You're my person.

178
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
I shouldn't have someone else in my heart.

179
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm the princess of Beixuan.

180
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
She's just a girl from Yainan.

181
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,700
She's not qualified to discuss with me.

182
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
It's a wilderness.

183
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,900
I know your identity.

184
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,100
If you dare to mess with me again,

185
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,900
will you kill me?

186
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Okay.

187
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,900
Why don't you do it now?

188
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,100
You think your life is important.

189
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,100
You're like a person.

190
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
You're the one who's killed by others.

191
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
You're the one who's killed by others.

192
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
You're my one and only person who's killed by others.

193
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
What are you going to do?

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
You always make me unhappy because of Jun Qiruo.

195
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm going to kill him.

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,900
Your Majesty.

197
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,700
I've learned the whole thing in Lianzhong.

198
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,500
Your Majesty.

199
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,500
Your Majesty.

200
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,100
Mother.

201
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,900
Your Majesty.

202
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,900
Have you found the son?

203
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Mother, don't worry.

204
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,700
He's still in a good condition.

205
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Zhizhou, what's the situation?

206
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
I've been looking for him in Lianzhong.

207
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,500
I've found the princess and A'Lie's family.

208
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,900
But they've sent more people.

209
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
I'll find them soon.

210
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,100
Okay.

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,300
Keep an eye on them.

212
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,300
If you find anything,

213
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,300
report back immediately.

214
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,100
Yes.

215
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,900
Mother.

216
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
Don't worry too much.

217
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,900
Okay.

218
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,300
See you.

219
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:53,900
Good boy.

220
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,100
Keep a safe balance.

221
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,900
Mr Zhang.

222
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,000
There's news from someone is caught in the secret

223
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
General Lian has died in an instant.

224
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,200
We'll investigate A'lie's motives.

225
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
He said A'lie wanted to divert secret from us.

226
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,380
Get her out of the way and start ہuiaplu!

227
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,500
Yes, sir.

228
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,660
There must be men and women in the Chu Pong line

229
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,540
who are willing to shoot.

230
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,220
Man Vώςi was watching over them.

231
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,340
He must have fallen in love with them.

232
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,740
Where are you going to find them?

233
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,900
Mistress.

234
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,140
We're going to shoot them.

235
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,700
We own them.

236
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,780
for just getting toast.

237
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
You dead?

238
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,700
My wife has been deserved

239
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,260
a few more days.

240
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,940
Most importantly, we have not very much medicine here.

241
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,180
We cannot hold for more than a few days.

242
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,860
Medicine?

243
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,780
She's just about right.

244
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,340
Send some medicine to trained her fans

245
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,180
to bring you people.

246
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,740
She's young.

247
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
I can give medicine to you.

248
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,220
It's showing your rattling for the cure.

249
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,660
You are treating her wounds.

250
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,180
She cares not about you right?

251
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,820
I do not want it.

252
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,220
I'm a little bit of a grasshopper.

253
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,900
I can teach you how to make a mistake.

254
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,300
If you can make your own medicine in the future,

255
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,460
you will have a lot of left.

256
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,900
Yes, yes.

257
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,700
We used a lot of medicinal herbs yesterday.

258
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
We should report it to the police.

259
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Alright then.

260
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
I'll find someone to stay by your side and take care of you.

261
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,500
If you get hurt,

262
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,100
I'll take care of you.

263
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,300
Thank you, Chief.

264
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,900
Please stand up.

265
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,700
You have a injured spirit. Be careful.

266
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
Take care of your health. Come back soon.

267
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
What are you doing?

268
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Where is Brother Lie? He has a injured spirit.

269
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
It's dangerous to meet him. Can you bear it?

270
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,900
He has his own business to do.

271
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,500
I advise you not to be so impulsive.

272
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
If you get involved with the bandits,

273
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,100
you won't be able to see him again.

274
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,500
Jun Qiluo, I don't like you.

275
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
Leave Bei Xuan quickly.

276
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,300
What a coincidence. I don't like you either.

277
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,100
But life is not like what it is.

278
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I'm a princess.

279
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Brother Lie and Qingming are all princesses.

280
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,700
This is Bei Xuan. I'll take care of it.

281
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
I told you to eat. Don't be so anxious.

282
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,500
Do you want to drink water?

283
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I'll let you eat slowly.

284
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,300
Are you hungry? I'll drink some water.

285
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,100
You dare to press the button, Princess.

286
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,300
Let me tell you.

287
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
We have to live here for a few days.

288
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
It's okay if you can't see me.

289
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
If you let those bandits see the disaster,

290
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
I can't protect you.

291
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,100
Xuanlei and Shao Qiming will die because of you.

292
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,700
Isn't Princess such a master?

293
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,300
You said they are both your people.

294
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
Then I'll leave the responsibility to you.

295
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Isn't it hard to be a princess?

296
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,960
It was really hard for me,

297
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,800
and you paid no attention to me.

298
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,100
And you won't be able to be a princess again.

299
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,500
It seems to be a different life.

300
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,900
There was a什摘 the most massive room that day.

301
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,900
It seems that some of the people Mira-zhi and Xiao Mori

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,300
are involved in this court appearances,

303
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,200
so why bother to ask for them?

304
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,200
These are the likely objects

305
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,100
which Shen Yue managed to cover,

306
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,600
and Excuse my order?

307
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,260
Dismiss,

308
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,000
Just in case we enter again,

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
what we take place before the mission ends

310
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,340
This time,

311
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,020
you have no regrets.

312
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,620
This is the grass I asked the host.

313
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,540
It says it's effective for the healer.

314
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,860
Your Majesty,

315
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,060
the Chamber of Commerce is getting closer.

316
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,260
When shall we go back?

317
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,220
Let's get the gold and iron gold first.

318
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,940
But the gold and iron gold are not suitable.

319
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,460
If we can't go back in half a month,

320
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,180
I'm afraid no one can catch up with the Chamber of Commerce.

321
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,900
You're the only one in the family now.

322
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,900
I know your worries.

323
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,740
But

324
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,380
the gold and iron gold are important to Ye Nan.

325
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,180
I will make it up to you.

326
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,980
Get the gold and iron gold as soon as possible.

327
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm back.

328
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,900
Are you feeling unwell?

329
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm feeling unwell.

330
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,020
Where's my medicine?

331
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,500
I'll see you in the clinic.

332
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,020
Brother Lie.

333
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,140
You're back.

334
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,700
I'm in the clinic.

335
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,860
The medicine is ready.

336
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,300
Drink it up.

337
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,700
We'll call the inspection staff right away.

338
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,860
I heard that

339
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,020
there are Seven Sages soldiers

340
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,460
still watching this town.

341
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,740
Porkinky.

342
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,660
We're after the ghost afraid gods.

343
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,860
Who do you need special equipment?

344
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,300
Let's go to tell Miss Liu about these Bottom风 Drilles.

345
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,820
Who?

346
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,140
We've already told you that

347
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,420
there's no time for mats if we can't tell it clearly.

348
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,260
Nothing will happened.

349
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,540
We are hiding it.

350
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,300
Let's go.

351
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,380
and the five meals.

352
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,420
Please.

353
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm sorry to bother you.

354
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,580
You don't have any wishes.

355
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
You're still very enthusiastic.

356
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

357
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,140
You're welcome.

358
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,180
You've rewarded me

359
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,260
with a lot of money.

360
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,980
I should thank you.

361
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,180
In a few days,

362
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,580
we're going to the three-step course.

363
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,420
This meal

364
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,420
will be a farewell.

365
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,900
Why did you suddenly

366
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,020
go to the three-step course?

367
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,940
I have to agree with the military power.

368
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,660
I have to leave.

369
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,980
I'm willing to

370
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,980
do anything for you.

371
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm telling you.

372
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
A dozen years ago,

373
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,060
my brothers

374
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,340
were all treated as soldiers.

375
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,900
Why didn't you

376
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,780
continue to be a minister?

377
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,580
If it weren't for the opportunity,

378
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,980
I'd be killed.

379
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,300
Who would come here?

380
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,060
That's right.

381
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,540
The land is complex.

382
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
It's not a long-term situation.

383
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,580
But what did you do

384
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,380
to get here?

385
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,500
Nothing.

386
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,820
I never let anyone down.

387
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,420
It's all because of the past.

388
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,380
Back then,

389
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,380
we helped to do

390
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,780
a very important job.

391
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,060
But then,

392
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,340
someone had to cross the bridge

393
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
and kill the dead.

394
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,820
When we got home,

395
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,860
we hid in the same place.

396
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,460
I only followed the men

397
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,620
to fight with them

398
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,140
for three days and three nights

399
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,100
to bring the living here.

400
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,540
The two-step course

401
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,780
is the place of the chief.

402
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,940
So,

403
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,580
you're staying here.

404
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,740
But this place,

405
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,500
in addition to the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Western Affairs,

406
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,740
is a small town.

407
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,740
Did you

408
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,540
announce

409
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,980
the rescue troops of the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Western Affairs?

410
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,220
You're from Shanggu.

411
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,140
Why do you

412
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,180
have such a deep concern for the two-step course?

413
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,580
If the Shanggu family wants to build a family,

414
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,420
they must have more connections.

415
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,740
We rarely spend money on this matter.

416
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,660
But we only know a little bit about it.

417
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,180
The more we know about it,

418
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
the easier it is to expand.

419
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,540
But just now,

420
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,580
I heard the chief say that

421
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,180
we talked more.

422
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,540
It's all because of the Yang family.

423
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,460
It's not easy for everyone.

424
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,380
Come on.

425
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,460
The kids?

426
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:03,940
Come on.

427
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,940
Do you think about

428
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,420
the revenge in mind?

429
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,500
Yes.

430
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,220
combat Titan

431
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,220
is an enemy of Boya Jiang.

432
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,380
For the past decade,

433
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,460
I have planted

434
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,580
over more than a dozen of seed bal右s.

435
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,340
All of you

436
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,940
have not been completelyき

437
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,140
three years ago.

438
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Overall,

439
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,900
they may now

440
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Why did An Ban be ordered too?

441
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Why would the prince be dead?

442
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:50,380
The

443
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Boss, you've drunk too much.

444
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Come on.

445
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,220
Let's talk about this.

446
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Drink some wine.

447
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Come on.

448
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,380
You.

449
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,740
Take me back to Wangcheng.

450
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,780
Why should I send you?

451
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,540
Go away.

452
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Is that enough?

453
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
No.

454
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,380
Who are you looking at?

455
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
How much did you drink?

456
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,380
You're...

457
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
He's never left home.

458
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
It's hard for him to get used to it.

459
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
He has a big hand.

460
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
Is that enough?

461
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,380
Why do you care about me?

462
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Go away.

463
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
You used me to find Jun Qiluo,

464
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
but you can't take him away.

465
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
What do you know?

466
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
Jun Qiluo wants to take the Iron Crystal, right?

467
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
What else do you know?

468
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
I want to know.

469
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Please.

470
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,380
Jun Qiluo will never take the Iron Crystal.

471
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,380
What do you mean?

472
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
The Iron Crystal was given to Xi by Wang Xiong.

473
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
And Xi Changkun hates Brother Lie.

474
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
How could he hand it over to him?

475
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,380
When did that happen?

476
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
So Brother Lie really didn't tell Jun Qiluo.

477
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
It seems that Brother Lie hasn't had enough of this effort.

478
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
He wants to use the Iron Crystal to keep it.

479
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,380
So you want to take it away?

480
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
That's impossible.

481
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Unless you kill Brother Lie.

482
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
But with your ability,

483
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,380
you can't kill him at all.

484
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,380
You can only watch Jun Qiluo

485
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
work hard for Brother Lie for a lifetime.

486
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
And you can stay in the North County

487
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
and stay with me.

488
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Please.

489
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Let me go.

490
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Let me be sad.

491
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
Don't think about me.

492
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
The owner of the house

493
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
is still not aware of the situation.

494
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
What do you plan to do?

495
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
Before the Xuanyu Army comes,

496
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,380
we need to find a reason

497
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,380
to let them stay here.

498
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Fu Jun.

499
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
You're injured.

500
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
Are you hurt?

501
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
You must be careful.

502
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Otherwise, I'll be hurt.

503
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
These are all people from the mountain house.

504
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
We must be careful.

505
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Why do you keep looking at me?

506
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Do you mean it

507
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,380
to me just now?

508
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,940
I was like Greetings...

509
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,220
I'm not very close with you.

510
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,020
You are now a member of Xu Moon Emissary for Xincheng Palace?

511
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,460
It's actually New handsome's day.

512
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,060
I can't face следующ 국 set-up

513
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,500
without the Yellow Water fingering.

514
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
But Gu Jun Love is nelable.

515
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,900
Jiang Zhi is the best time to leave.

516
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,900
Besides this forest,

517
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,060
you're a man of the past.

518
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,060
I'll find a way to get back to Yangbu.

519
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,500
We don't care about the opportunity.

520
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,100
If we still don't see my body in the agreement,

521
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,780
you should go first.

522
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,420
You must feel the military power before the Shanghao Dauhui.

523
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,580
My lady.

524
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,380
The Shanghao Dauhui

525
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,940
must have the military power.

526
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,100
But the power is still on him.

527
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,180
Take it back.

528
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,660
Your majesty.

529
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,820
We've filled the imperial些 county with military officials.

530
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,180
He realises he has a life.

531
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,980
This is the government highness's order.

532
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,740
If he's Tool Manor,

533
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,380
I'll give you a different kind of punishment.

534
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,540
So will you keep$℃ack.

535
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,340
The Imprison King's Liu has taken care of the royal family.

536
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,860
It's taking days at the palace.

537
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,740
No matter what minister must think.

538
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,460
What a good plan!

539
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,020
Before the election,

540
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,500
Brother Wang has already given the West Department a chance.

541
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,700
If you want to get it back,

542
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,580
you have to think of a way.

543
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,060
I won't tell you.

544
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,860
It's a matter of time before the election.

545
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,340
There's no trick.

546
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,300
Then, did you think of a way?

547
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,660
How many promises do you have?

548
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,700
Since the contract is not working,

549
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,980
please return the money to me.

550
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,300
We'll be free from here.

551
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,420
We'll drink water.

552
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,940
Not with sufficient water.

553
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,700
Sinus kellhas come to Wangcheng from corruption.

554
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,860
You can'tève

555
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,500
the contract we executed,

556
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,260
and I am a businessman only.

557
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,300
I have my proof.

558
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,060
Besides, we wereeder Xia Ruroyue's fiance.

559
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,380
It won't be funny for me to discuss intimate called seal with the General.

560
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,460
So in your heart,

561
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,060
our interests

562
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,220
and our iron governing operations

563
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,340
are more important

564
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,980
than anything else.

565
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,460
Young soul,

566
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Yes.

567
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,260
Please return the form.

568
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,220
Xiao Fei,

569
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,740
give me the form.

570
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,540
You want to give me the agreement

571
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,380
because of her?

572
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,140
Or...

573
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,940
Mi Lin is just a prince.

574
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,900
You've already left with her.

575
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,660
I won't use the power of the Iron Thread Embroidery.

576
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,700
You came with me to Wang City

577
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,220
not for the power of the Iron Thread Embroidery.

578
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,940
Why did you suddenly react so much?

579
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,460
Qi Lu,

580
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,460
what are you hiding?

581
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,980
Give the Heart-Burning Order to Xiao Jie.

582
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Xuan Li!

583
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,860
What are you doing?

584
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
This is

585
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,820
the revenge you've taken on the Three Kingdoms.

586
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,140
If you dare to take Qi Lu away again,

587
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,100
I won't spare you.

588
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,060
You're a traitor.

589
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,460
Who do you think you are?

590
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,180
Xiao Jie,

591
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,860
we can't trust her anymore.

592
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,900
Qi Ming, I'll let you stop.

593
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,460
I won't kill you.

594
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,700
Trust me.

595
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,620
Brother!

596
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,660
I have done it.

597
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,720
Yes.

598
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,020
Brother.

599
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,080
Sister.

600
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
You have.

601
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,520
You must work so hard,

602
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,280
XiaEr.

603
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,540
XiaEr wants to win the battle like I do now.

604
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,060
But I shall win it.

605
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,620
Raise your own spirit.

606
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,660
All right.

607
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
You're worried about me?

608
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,660
You're not worried about yourself.

609
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,660
What's there to worry about?

610
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,660
I just want to say that if you really die here,

611
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,660
I won't take back the gold and the new business order.

612
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,660
Maybe I'll have to help you to get the name of your wife.

613
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,660
And I'll have to pay a lot of money to the debt.

614
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
How can I do this?

615
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Don't worry.

616
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,660
This injury is not serious to me.

617
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,660
I'll pay you back.

618
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Tell me.

619
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
You want to make a living.

620
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,660
You really just want to help Junfei to make a living.

621
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,660
You still don't believe me?

622
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
Of course I do.

623
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
What about you?

624
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,660
Believe me?

625
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Could it be that General has already thought of a way?

626
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Yes.

627
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,660
But you need to make a condition for me.

628
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,660
General.

629
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
You're being so considerate.

630
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
We've already made a deal.

631
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Are you going to leave?

632
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
You know it well.

633
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,660
Even if the bloodline is in the hands of Xichang Kun,

634
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
I'm the only one who can help you.

635
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
Or maybe

636
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,660
you didn't let anyone kill me last night.

637
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,660
Are you really worried about me?

638
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,660
General.

639
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,660
What's the condition?

640
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
I want it very simple.

641
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
You just need to help me find

642
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
the evidence of Xichang Kun's purchase of Junfei.

643
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
In this way,

644
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
I can get what you want.

645
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
I can also find what I want to find.

646
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
General.

647
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,660
We're going to get three departments in a day.

648
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
We're very cautious.

649
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
You'd better leave.

650
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Yes.

651
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Just a little bit.

652
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
When Brother Lie is well,

653
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I'll be paid back.

654
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Now,

655
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,660
if Brother Lie has any trouble,

656
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,660
he will surely ruin your debt.

657
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Little girl.

658
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
You're not that old.

659
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
You don't even want to talk.

660
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,660
We've already taken you in.

661
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,660
What?

662
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,660
You want to kill people with a knife?

663
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Exactly.

664
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
Please forgive us.

665
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Brother.

666
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
There are indeed some trouble these days.

667
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,660
I know

668
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
you need to go to the three departments to get the money.

669
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
But

670
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
we're seriously injured.

671
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Can you please

672
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
let us stay a few more days?

673
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
We won't fail.

674
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,660
If you can,

675
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
use this necklace to take it.

676
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
Come.

677
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
You're still unwell.

678
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Why did you come out?

679
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
You're my wife.

680
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
How can I let you face it alone?

681
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
You've been here for more than ten years.

682
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
You've been to the three departments.

683
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
You'll only be here earlier than now.

684
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
If you trust me,

685
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
you just need to cooperate with me.

686
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
I'll be back to save you.

687
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
I'll let you live a peaceful life.

688
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
You're all thieves.

689
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,660
You just want to protect yourself.

690
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
There are old people and children in the village.

691
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,660
And you have the same soil.

692
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
You have a good training.

693
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,660
You're more like soldiers and family members.

694
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
As for your weapons,

695
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
you're not here to kill people.

696
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
You're here to maintain your reputation.

697
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Right?

698
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
How can we trust you?

699
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Right.

700
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Why do you trust me?

701
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Right.

702
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
I'm the head of the department of the department.

703
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
The old case

704
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
has a great relationship with me.

705
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,660
I helped you

706
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,660
and myself.

707
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
General Xuan Lie.

708
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Right.

709
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
Xigu forced me to do this.

710
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Now that the war is over,

711
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
how can I confirm that

712
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
I can help you?

713
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Chief.

714
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Xichang Kun is in my hands.

715
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
The enemy of the enemy is Meng Ying.

716
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
I'm sure you can understand this.

717
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
We can help you.

718
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
What's the point of helping us?

719
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
Chief, can you lend me a word?

720
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Father has investigated the weapons and killed three people.

721
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,660
I wonder if you can help me find out the case.

722
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,660
We've been hiding here for years.

723
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,660
We're afraid that Xichang Kun will find out the whereabouts

724
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,660
and we won't have any place to hide.

725
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,660
If I help you,

726
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,660
what if something goes wrong?

727
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
How can I tell the people in the fortress?

728
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Do you want to hide forever?

729
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
Back then, I didn't know

730
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Xichang Kun was in charge of the case.

731
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
That's why I didn't know.

732
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Now I'm the head of the department.

733
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
His Majesty has promised that

734
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
if I become the head of the department,

735
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
I'll send out a lot of men to help me.

736
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,660
What did you get from me?

737
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,660
We were just responsible for the goods.

738
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,660
What exactly did the five princes hide in the fortress?

739
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Ten years ago,

740
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
we just started to get hurt in the north and west.

741
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
We must be able to communicate with the local authorities

742
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
at the place we're going to.

743
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,660
If you send weapons to Xichang Kun,

744
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
there will be a communication problem.

745
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,660
If we can make a paper to make Xichang Kun the most successful,

746
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
why do we have to hide it?
