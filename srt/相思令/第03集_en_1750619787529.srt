1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
If you are true to love, I really miss what you say

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,380
in public

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,260
They think I breathe認inh

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,220
right did I draw in the wrong words

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,240
or even know something

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,480
don't believe this

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,240
I know you still love me

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,500
still love you

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,240
I also like this

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Let you stay for me

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:43,240
After a long time, I still keep my head back

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,240
The universe is with me, no need

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,840
After all, I am like anjun

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,240
A little panic does not cheer up

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,140
Time agrees my��c

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,740
I am afraid of theavic

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,240
Who can write your gentle feelings

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Who will kiss me

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,240
I lost it, but now, I cannot離

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:41,080
ép5

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,400
Do Remember I have.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
Take a look at the Hangzhou Exchange.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,440
Miss Yu and I have gotten along better.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
She's a perfect man

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
who won't let go of any effort.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
I can't pass away.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
As a potatoes pie,

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,320
that's why I want to be with my father.

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,780
Buy a new one with care and leave.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,140
Put it alone.

31
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:46,880
Due to the new

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,720
I'll go to the kitchen.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,240
Everyone,

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
don't mind the table.

35
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
The selection is a matter of people.

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,800
We're going to the business in Yannan.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,280
I wonder if you are...

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,800
What a coincidence.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,920
He Shang Team, the leader, He Sang,

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,320
we are also the selection.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,240
I saw you two

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,560
coming here to disturb the two teams.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,880
I didn't expect you to be the selection.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Why are you disturbing me?

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,400
Xiao'er,

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,720
bring the cup and cups here.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
We can help if we go out.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,160
Besides, we are all the selection.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,320
But you are so arrogant.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,720
You are not like the North Xuan.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,720
Why are you so alone?

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,360
Where is your companion?

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
I was bullied by people

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
because of the arrogance of the identity.

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,040
I was forced to kill people

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,000
by the three departments in the Japanese Army.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,080
If we didn't help each other,

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,760
how could I have survived today?

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Although the Yao City

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
is a place with three departments,

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,480
the distance between the North Xuan and Liangzhu is close.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,000
The North Xuan people are more.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,360
The general of the selection is the guardian of the North Xuan.

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,320
It's even worse that

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
the people who are bullied by them

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
are the selection of the North Xuan.

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,680
I don't have the face to select the North Xuan.

68
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
I still want to go to the Yanan

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,040
to at least pay the funeral fee of the brothers.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,560
You

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,080
should go back to the North Xuan first.

72
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,480
By the way,

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,000
where is your document?

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,880
Document?

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,880
You are a bastard.

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
You stole all my stuff.

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,120
I have not seen the document.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
It's hard for you.

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,040
Without the document,

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I can't even go out.

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,000
If you want to go to the North Xuan,

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,400
you must cover the document

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,480
of the leader.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,120
Is there no other way?

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,440
Well, unless...

86
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,360
That's impossible.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,360
Unless you have the leader's order,

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,680
it's too difficult.

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,600
It's impossible.

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,840
General.

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,080
Let me help you.

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,360
Thank you.

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,960
How is your wound?

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,760
Thank you, General.

95
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,240
It's almost healed.

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
In that case,

97
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,280
we should

98
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
take the grudges in the desert.

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,800
Yes.

100
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
I helped you to cover the wound.

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,720
You helped me to get out of the desert.

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,920
You saved me in the wolf group.

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Now you are cleaning up the wound.

104
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
How are you going to repay me?

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,640
You pushed me into the desert.

106
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,600
What should I do?

107
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
But I saved you in the desert.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
Then you pushed me to the desert.

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,360
If I can control the storm,

110
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
I will definitely

111
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,800
kill all the soldiers

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,160
in the three departments.

113
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
This...

114
00:05:42,760 --> 00:06:02,260
Are you one of your

115
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,520
volunteers?

116
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,160
Yes.

117
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,800
I've put all the money I brought to you.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,080
Don't let me lose money.

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
So you've already decided on me.

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,880
You're a wise man.

121
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm willing to serve you

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
if I love you.

123
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,080
You're the one who raised me.

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,840
You're so quick to change.

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
Thank you for your kindness.

126
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,480
All right.

127
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
The wound is healed.

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,200
Please have a meal.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm going back.

130
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Young Master, we've checked it out.

132
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
Xuanli is staying at the Gongxuan Inn.

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
How many people are there?

134
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
Only He Ji Yao and a young master

135
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
have never seen him before.

136
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Xuanli never brought strangers around.

137
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,480
He's very important to him.

138
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
It doesn't matter whether he's important or not.

139
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,040
They're just a bunch of souls after this.

140
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,680
Xuanli's missing this time

141
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,000
is a great opportunity.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,440
Remember that.

143
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,280
Don't let him leave Yao City alive.

144
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,000
Luo Qi and Xuan Yu Jun

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,080
will come to support you

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,320
if you don't go far away.

147
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,760
Send someone to drag them away

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,480
to avoid our plan.

149
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,280
Yes.

150
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,840
Fu Jiang.

151
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,480
Last night,

152
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,520
he amaed the soldiers

153
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,840
who came to assassinate the army.

154
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,200
Now that he knows we've beenны

155
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
he's succeeded in precursorship.

156
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Shipyard VIP is suing you.

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,600
Young Master is not here,

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,880
how can we deal with it?

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,960
Actually,

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
theits idea is given to them.

161
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,680
Luo Fu Jiang.

162
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,320
Wu Chen Cheogram,

163
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
It seems that Heji is going to find the Young Master.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
Pass the order.

165
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
All of you,

166
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,720
go to Yaoqiao!

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,400
Self-serve!

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,800
Get ready for self-serve!

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,480
Sir, look at the embroidery.

170
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
Although it's not as beautiful as Ye Nan's,

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,240
there are a few styles.

172
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,600
What about the likes?

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
The likes are all I can see.

174
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,880
But they don't match.

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,440
I'll help you buy them.

176
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,160
Young Master.

177
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,840
We不知道 about

178
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,080
the ballast on their kitchen,

179
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,840
but maybe they're001.

180
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,840
I know.

181
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
Don't tell Super bilmiyorum to Opt 은 made one.

182
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,880
Tell him.

183
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Let's go.

184
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Smile! Smile!

185
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
What do you need to see?

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I want to buy some raw food.

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
These are the best raw food in Sanbukuan.

188
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
You can pick some.

189
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
If you have this box of fresh food,

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,720
you can pick any raw food in my stall.

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I don't want to do business.

192
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I only want the best raw food.

193
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Don't use these to make a big profit.

194
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
These are all raw food from Guanshan.

195
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
They are very pure.

196
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
You can make jewelry or tools.

197
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Only Yao Cheng can find them.

198
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
The hard work is not right.

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Are these all your goods?

200
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Yao Cheng is close to Liangzhou.

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
The best raw food is the best raw food.

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
How much do you want?

203
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,720
If the goods on the shelf are not enough,

204
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
you can order them.

205
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
If I give you some more boxes,

206
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
can you take me to see those?

207
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Yao Cheng's goods are in Beijing.

208
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
They are all in Beijing's hands.

209
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
They are all armed.

210
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
We are just afraid to pick some broken food around the city.

211
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Then, mother,

212
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
is there any hard food in India?

213
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
The hardest food is

214
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,720
the raw food from the Xuan Iron.

215
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
I see you are a businessman.

216
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
You are very close to each other.

217
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Xuan Iron is sold in Beijing.

218
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
But it hasn't been in the market for hundreds of years.

219
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,720
You can't even make it.

220
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Don't waste your energy.

221
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Thank you.

222
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I will make it.

223
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Go after him.

224
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Young Master,

225
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
that new tea was just made.

226
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Move it.

227
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
You are a thief.

228
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Say it.

229
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Where did you catch him?

230
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I don't know.

231
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
What are you talking about?

232
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Zuiying.

233
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Did Xichang Kun send you here?

234
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Yes.

235
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Lord Ximou.

236
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Uncle Kun.

237
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Where did you catch him?

238
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
General.

239
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Where did you go?

240
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
I went to you when I saw you.

241
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
It's okay.

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Let's go back first.

243
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Follow the gold chain.

244
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Master.

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Lanjie failed.

246
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Luo Qi successfully escaped.

247
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
He went to Yao City.

248
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
It's not a big deal

249
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
if they can't go to Yao City tonight.

250
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Yes.

251
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Then where did they go?

252
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I demand to have a man fictionして from today.

253
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Stay away from the front.

254
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,440
Some factories still need to be closed.

255
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm just a good man.

256
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,160
Young Master often tells me

257
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,600
to stop the business.

258
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
If you can't open it,

259
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,680
I'll take my leave.

260
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,400
I'll put the medicine here.

261
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,880
When did Miss Qiluo

262
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,560
make the famous dog knife?

263
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm just curious

264
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,920
why General Jiang

265
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,840
put the door of the inn here.

266
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,800
I just want to hang it for you.

267
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,320
That's what you mean.

268
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
I wronged Miss Qiluo.

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
It's okay.

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,560
Young Master,

271
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
I found a large number of armed soldiers outside the city.

272
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,520
It seems that this time

273
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,600
the Western Changkun is about to attack.

274
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,120
I think the Qingmu people

275
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
have already surrounded the inn.

276
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
We can't go out.

277
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,160
What should we do?

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
Luo Xi is still in the picture.

279
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,440
We can't

280
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,160
fight them alone.

281
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,200
I have my own plan.

282
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,000
You can protect Qiluo.

283
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,340
D Ih impeachment

284
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,460
psychiatrists

285
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,420
takes the throne given by the emperor

286
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,020
and the emperor's immunity.

287
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,540
We are not asking you

288
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,460
to brilliant nationalism.

289
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,740
We can ignore nationalism.

290
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,800
Butaw

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,240
will come very soon.

292
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,600
D등

293
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,200
will be adopted sooner.

294
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,540
Since you are second to a third,

295
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,520
you can't take problem.

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,440
You call everyone

297
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,600
to take the responsibility?

298
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,780
Thank you.

299
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,000
You didn't leave as you were

300
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,880
that late,

301
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,460
you evenve三ल

302
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,960
and failed limited

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,800
I'm here.

304
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm here to help you.

305
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,400
Help me with a hat.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,160
This is another transaction.

307
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,160
What's the use of it?

308
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
It's not worth it to cooperate with me.

309
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,320
It's not worth it to cooperate with me.

310
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
If you don't want to hurt Beixuan,

311
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,960
you can go.

312
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Okay.

313
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,240
Stop!

314
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
All of you, follow me!

315
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Yu Dadao, stop!

316
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,520
Hurry up!

317
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,680
Hurry up!

318
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,280
Hurry up!

319
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,840
Hurry up!

320
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,360
Hurry up!

321
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,840
Hurry up!

322
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,360
Hurry up!

323
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,920
Hurry up!

324
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,400
Hurry up!

325
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,160
You guys, let's go!

326
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,720
Let's go!

327
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,240
Yes!

328
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,840
Yes!

329
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,720
Chief,

330
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,440
the back door of the inn is already in place.

331
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
The four gates of Yao City

332
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,560
have been sent by the guards.

333
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,560
Xuanlie is a tough one.

334
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,000
And the Luozhi City

335
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
which is in the hands of Xuanlie.

336
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
Where is his old house in Yao City?

337
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,440
The Luozhi City is now in Wang City.

338
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,680
The old house is empty.

339
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,040
You can't let go of the police.

340
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
Send someone to guard it for me.

341
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Xuanlie is in the three departments.

342
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
He broke the Western Army's reputation.

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,600
He must be killed this time.

344
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,080
As long as Xuanlie dies,

345
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
no one will dare to move

346
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
the old house 12 years ago.

347
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,680
Father will definitely hurt me.

348
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,200
Go back!

349
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,240
So you're Xuanlie!

350
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,560
Just kill him!

351
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,680
Don't come close,

352
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,400
or I will kill him!

353
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,040
Young master!

354
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,560
You take this token to Yang Niu's old house in Luo's house.

355
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,560
He will come to save you as soon as he grows up.

356
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,760
I will help them to fight for your time.

357
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,760
The Great Wall

358
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Aren't you afraid that I will leave with another token?

359
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,760
In the desert, you will not leave easily.

360
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,360
Even if you want to escape, you will be able to save me.

361
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,560
I believe you and am willing to bet on it.

362
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,960
Of course, if I see the wrong person,

363
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
and you want to revenge for the wounded, then I have nothing to say.

364
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Save or not save?

365
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Forget it. I will have you every day.

366
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,760
I will go with both hands, but I will not go with both hands.

367
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,360
One, two, three.

368
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,160
One, two, three.

369
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,160
One, two, three.

370
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
One, two, three.

371
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Young Mistress, what should we do now?

372
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
I will ask Qi Luo to find Zhizhou.

373
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,360
The official will arrive in a while.

374
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,760
Isn't Lord Kuro in Wang City?

375
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,360
He will secretly come to Yao City to get a job every year.

376
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,760
But Qi Luo is a man in the field.

377
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,160
What if he takes the token and leaves?

378
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Is there anyone who is good and is willing to take the throne?

379
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
No, it's a good opportunity to come to the throne.

380
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,160
He Jing!

381
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,560
He Jing, hold on!

382
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Don't run!

383
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,160
Is there anyone?

384
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Who is outside?

385
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
It's good that I'm fine.

386
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,960
I haven't eaten or eaten for days.

387
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,960
Hang on!

388
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,680
Zhaoyi, Mount Bo temerngt Hailu.

389
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Sir, Xuanin World

390
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
is a vast dragon hill.

391
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
A mają can't leads to Qi Ilo orcious.

392
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
Master, will not you?

393
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,720
Rest assured.

394
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,240
I will not let you die this young.

395
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,800
Yes.

396
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,280
Luo Chizhou.

397
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,240
He will come back.

398
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,240
You all go to the hospital.

399
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Yes.

400
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Go.

401
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Xuanyi.

402
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Xuanyi.

403
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Xuanyi.

404
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,240
No.

405
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
There is a way.

406
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Why is there a woman?

407
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
She is the woman who went to give Luo Chizhou a letter.

408
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Yes.

409
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
There is not only He Jiyao and that Yan Nan guy around Xuanyi.

410
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
When did he take out a woman?

411
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
No.

412
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
He wants to kill someone.

413
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Go.

414
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Where is the water?

415
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Go save the fire.

416
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Save the fire.

417
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Go save the fire.

418
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Go.

419
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Young master.

420
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
The people are coming out to save the fire.

421
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Shall we

422
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
go and scare them back?

423
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
We are the rebels.

424
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
We are doing this to

425
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
make the death of Xuanyi

426
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
and us to take away the relationship.

427
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
To kill the people.

428
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Are you trying to make things worse?

429
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Young master, you are too much.

430
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I will go to Liangzhou and meet my father.

431
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
You

432
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
find out his whereabouts.

433
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Yes.

434
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Li.

435
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Li.

436
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Xuanyi.

437
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Xuanyi.

438
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Take them out.

439
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Come on.

440
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Don't touch my friend.

441
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Bastard.

442
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Get out of my way.

443
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Stop.

444
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Don't be afraid.

445
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Is that your friend?

446
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
I will help you to bury him.

447
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I will bury him.

448
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
This is my first time to live.

449
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
This is also my second piece of work.

450
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
This bloody iron is like mud.

451
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
It blows off the hair and gives it to you.

452
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Young master.

453
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Take it.

454
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
My sword is mine.

455
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
You remember it.

456
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Young master.

457
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
What are you doing?

458
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
What are you doing?

459
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Running away?

460
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Running away?

461
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Running away?

462
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
If you don't want to die, just be honest with me.

463
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
We have been using the little soft-shell for him.

464
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I didn't expect that he would recover so soon.

465
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
He is a little bit clumsy.

466
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
He is so cheap.

467
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
What's wrong with him?

468
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
This is a three-step land.

469
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
People are not enough.

470
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
They are not good at it.

471
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
They are always in trouble.

472
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Moreover, he is a man of the word.

473
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Let me tell you.

474
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
The shopkeeper of the town in Jinzao City

475
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
gave this to me.

476
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
You should wake me up tonight.

477
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I will make a toast to you.

478
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Tomorrow, you can't go out.

479
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Miss, Miss.

480
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Are you thirsty?

481
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
One bowl of water.

482
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
One bowl of water.

483
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Miss.

484
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Come on.

485
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Come on.

486
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Ladies and gentlemen.

487
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Take a look.

488
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,240
Today, the new goods are all in the top class.

489
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
The price is only ten thousand.

490
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
The price is higher.

491
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
The price is higher.

492
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
How is it?

493
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
You can take it away if you have money.

494
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I said ten thousand.

495
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Fifteen.

496
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Twenty thousand.

497
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Do you have more than twenty?

498
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Twenty-five.

499
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Thanks.

500
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Twenty-five.

501
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Twenty-five.

502
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Twenty-five.

503
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I'm selling girls.

504
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I want her.

505
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Go, go, go.

506
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Come here.

507
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
That's right.

508
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
I'll pay 300.

509
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Then pay me 500.

510
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
400.

511
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
450.

512
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
500.

513
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
500.

514
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
500 per one.

515
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
500.

516
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Go, go, go.

517
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
What's the rush?

518
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
I want to buy 50.

519
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
500.

520
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
500.

521
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
500.

522
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
I said it's gold.

523
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Gold?

524
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
What's that?

525
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
What's that?

526
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Gold.

527
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Gold for once, twice, three times.

528
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Go.

529
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Where did you get this?

530
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
How dare you steal from me?

531
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
You want to buy it?

532
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Is it because it looks good?

533
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Yes.

534
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
50 gold.

535
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
It's broken.

536
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Do you want it?

537
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
You, you, you.

538
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I, I, I, I.

539
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Go.

540
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
You stay by my side.

541
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
You stay by my side.

542
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
You stay here.

543
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
You have to be well-behaved.

544
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Don't worry.

545
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm not a bad person.

546
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Your eyes are so beautiful.

547
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I'll treat you well.

548
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Don't you hurt?

549
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Why don't you call me a stranger?

550
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Miss.

551
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Her face is thin.

552
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Her temperament is sharp.

553
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I have to adjust it.

554
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Here.

555
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
So you're not willing to teach me?

556
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
I thought it was my method to push you.

557
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm sorry for your teaching.

558
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
No way.

559
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
The West Department withdraws too quickly.

560
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
I think it's Be'er.

561
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Xichang Kun is not a fool.

562
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
You came here to make a confession.

563
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
You didn't bring many soldiers.

564
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Yuan Men didn't expect

565
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
to catch the West Department.

566
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Qiluo came to save me.

567
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
It's an unexpected play.

568
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
You're talking about

569
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Miss Qiluo.

570
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
She's really a good woman.

571
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
She can save the land,

572
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
steal the palace,

573
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
and kill the West Department.

574
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
And she wants to be loyal.

575
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
She has to be loyal.

576
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
It's a pity that she's a woman.

577
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Otherwise,

578
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
she must be a good woman.

579
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
She can surpass many men.

580
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
It's the first time I've seen you

581
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
praise a woman so much.

582
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
I just think

583
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
she's different from ordinary women.

584
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
She's smart,

585
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
humble,

586
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
and hate others.

587
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
She's even more hateful.

588
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Her cunningness is like a fox.

589
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
She's like a wolf.

590
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
I can't help but

591
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
want to find out.

592
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
A'Li.

593
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
You're not right.

594
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Anyway,

595
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I've already

596
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
taken care of

597
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
your fox in your mouth.

598
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
You should rest.

599
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
I'll bring her to see you later.

600
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
You're done washing.

601
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Sit down.

602
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Have some snacks.

603
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Okay.

604
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Sit.

605
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
You look so good.

606
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
You know what?

607
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
My mistress

608
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
has never heard of any of them.

609
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
And she's

610
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
taking you to her old house.

611
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
There's no one

612
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
but our old ladies

613
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
in this house.

614
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
She's so young.

615
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
It's so rare

616
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
to see a lady

617
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
in her heart.

618
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
She's so young.

619
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Last time I saw you,

620
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
I thought you were a gentleman.

621
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
But you didn't.

622
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
You're a pretty lady.

623
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
Don't be so angry.

624
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
My mistress

625
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
is tall,

626
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
handsome,

627
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
and handsome.

628
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
She's a talented woman.

629
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
She's a talented woman.

630
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
She's a talented woman.

631
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
She's a talented woman.

632
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
She's a talented woman.

633
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
She's a talented woman.

634
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
She's a talented woman.

635
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
And she's a good-for-nothing

636
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
and has a good parents.

637
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
She's a good-for-nothing.

638
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
She's a good-for-nothing.

639
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
When you're in this house,

640
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
you don't have to worry

641
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,240
about those complicated relationships.

642
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I'm not lying.

643
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
My mistress is so tall.

644
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
She's a child.

645
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Such a good boy

646
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
is hard to find.

647
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm ugly.

648
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
I'm very good-for-nothing

649
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
with his mistress.

650
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Your mistress is...

651
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
What are you talking about?

652
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
My mistress,

653
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
you're back.

654
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Mr. Luo is so worried about you.

655
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Sister Zhang,

656
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
it seems that your family is in danger.

657
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Let's go first.

658
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
You should stay with her.

659
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
My mistress,

660
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I think she's a good girl.

661
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
She must be a good mistress

662
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
for our Luo family.

663
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
You must live with her.

664
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
You're a noble lady.

665
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Aunt, don't be so soft.

666
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Let's go.

667
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
My mistress is very stubborn.

668
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,740
She's a woman with a lot of

669
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,240
bad habits.

670
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Miss Qi

671
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
still thinks of

672
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
being a man in front of them.

673
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
It's better to go away

674
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
from the family

675
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
with a man's own convenience

676
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
to avoid being hated.

677
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I'm taking the lead.

678
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
I'll come and see you.

679
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I'll leave you alone

680
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
before you get back.

681
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Is General awake?

682
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
He's awake.

683
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
But he's asleep.

684
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Don't worry.

685
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
I'll take you to see him

686
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
when you're all rested.

687
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Okay.

688
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Are you going to reward me?

689
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Don't worry.

690
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
I'll reward you for my fame.

691
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
No.

692
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Lord Luo,

693
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
are you still going to

694
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
prepare a man's dress for me?

695
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Okay.

696
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
I'll arrange it now.

697
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
The brother ordered that

698
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
he would be in charge of

699
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
the spy's work

700
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
in the northern county.

701
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
A few days ago,

702
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
he received a letter

703
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
saying that he found a new mine.

704
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
It's called...

705
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Xuan...

706
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Xuan Tie Jin Shi.

707
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Yes, Xuan Tie Jin Shi.

708
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
The brother suggested that

709
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
he would be in charge of

710
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
the spy's work

711
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
in the hands of the demons.

712
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Where is the mine?

713
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
The brother always keeps

714
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
the secret of the design of the spy's work.

715
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
If you want to know the truth,

716
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
I can write a letter

717
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
and ask him at home.

718
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I've been investigating

719
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
the rumours of Xuan Lian and his father.

720
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
I think it's not true.

721
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Xuan Tie Jin Shi is in the northern county.

722
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Without the news,

723
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
the book can only be used

724
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
to get Xuan Lian into the northern county.

725
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
