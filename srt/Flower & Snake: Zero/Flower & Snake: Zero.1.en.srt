1
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,520
<i>She's there, he said.</i>

2
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,290
Then he hung up.

3
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,060
Vabyron, huh.

4
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,521
The website streams live S&M...

5
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,010
<i>everyday at a set time.</i>

6
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,010
<i>No police complaints,</i>

7
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,039
<i>but net users
say it looks too real.</i>

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,800
<i>Abducted girls.
Live torture.</i>

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,490
<i>The kind of fantasy netizens love.</i>

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>We'll invade their fantasy.</i>

11
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:25,013
Flower and Snake.
- Zero -

12
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,660
You okay? Any injuries?

13
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,060
Mifuyu?

14
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,050
Big Sis...

15
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,020
Why?

16
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,440
<i>They kidnapped you?</i>

17
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:47,481
<i>Amamiya! You okay?</i>

18
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Go.

19
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,665
Go.

20
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,460
The front gate is unguarded.

21
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,567
<i>Amamiya!</i>

22
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Amamiya?

23
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,970
I'm fine.

24
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,490
You. Who are you?

25
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,260
Answer me!

26
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,500
Okay.

27
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,230
Okay, okay, okay.

28
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,760
"Home late so no dinner for me."

29
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:23,320
"Is he cheating?"

30
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,370
"He's always late."

31
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,670
"And he's handsome."

32
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,351
No, he's just busy.

33
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,380
"He's lucky you're so naive."

34
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,904
One of the men we killed
ran the show.

35
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,159
But they were hired.

36
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,687
Someone else set up the site
on an untraceable...

37
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,368
South American server.

38
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,410
Lieutenant?

39
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Just wait for the victim
to come around.

40
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,020
You don't look well. Go home.

41
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,250
Get some rest.

42
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,250
Mifuyu?

43
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,490
Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

44
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,480
I don't see you for years,
and now...

45
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,210
I'm a criminal?

46
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
What happened?

47
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,270
Mifuyu, what's wrong with you?
I was so worried!

48
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,499
Dad was hospitalized!

49
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,760
I don't give a shit!

50
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,810
Mifuyu...

51
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,890
Why'd you let me go?

52
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,010
I'm a criminal, you know.

53
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,250
You're too late.

54
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,210
You did a dumb thing, Big Sis.

55
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,130
I'll drag you to hell.

56
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,640
<i>Misaki Amamiya.</i>

57
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Who are you?

58
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
<i>Joseph.</i>

59
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,450
Joseph?

60
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,400
<i>You ought to get your
jacket dry-cleaned. It's filthy.</i>

61
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,370
Who are you?

62
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,574
<i>You let your sister,
a key witness, leave a crime scene.</i>

63
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,780
<i>You killed all suspects.</i>

64
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,290
<i>You act remorseful,</i>

65
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,900
<i>but you're relieved that
you could cover up for her.</i>

66
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,900
Answer me! Who are you?

67
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,130
<i>Why let your sister go?</i>

68
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,640
<i>Sisterly love?
Or to protect yourself?</i>

69
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,530
What's your connection to Mifuyu?

70
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>Answer the question.</i>

71
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
What do you want?

72
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,440
<i>Hold on to that phone.
I'll call again.</i>

73
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,429
"I've got no proof he's cheating."

74
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,890
"It's all in your mind, Chihiro?"

75
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,760
"You got me."

76
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Silly.

77
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,189
"This website is cool."

78
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,360
"What is it?"

79
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Vabyron?

80
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:25,299
"ENTER"

81
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,790
What is this?

82
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,370
"An illegal website."

83
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,130
"A real abductee."

84
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,590
"That's criminal!"

85
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,481
"It's uncensored."

86
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,430
"Real hardcore S&M."

87
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,390
S&M?

88
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,270
"Free entry, pay later."

89
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,310
"Payment options on the right.
Check it out."

90
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,320
"The devil is here!"

91
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,520
"See ya."

92
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,520
Looks like "The Ring".

93
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
It's a new woman.

94
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:45,383
Sorry.

95
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:00,010
<i>Investigate the history
of this woman.</i>

96
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,262
<i>On it.</i>

97
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,805
- Hiroki, keep watch.
- Yes ma'am.

98
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,267
"Pay to see more."

99
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,890
Oh dear...

100
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,420
So anyway, Chihiro
calls her mother-in-law "the devil",

101
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,810
and she caught her
typing it in our chat session.

102
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,480
She came up with
the craziest explanation!

103
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,840
So anyway,
Chihiro said her husband...

104
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,270
might get fired from his job.

105
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,170
Isn't that scary?

106
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,100
We're much happier,
the way we are.

107
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,940
<i>A new lamb to the slaughter.</i>

108
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,010
Are you the man behind Vabyron?
Or maybe...

109
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,320
<i>Go outside.</i>

110
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,860
I'm on duty.

111
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,210
<i>Go outside.</i>

112
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Where are you?

113
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,880
<i>Go to the toilets.</i>

114
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,590
<i>Enter the last stall.</i>

115
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,860
- <i>Are you in?</i>
- Yes.

116
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,420
- <i>Get undressed.</i>
- Huh?

117
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,000
- <i>I won't say it twice.</i>
- Is this a joke?

118
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,560
<i>Do I sound like I'm joking?</i>

119
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,600
No way. I'm not doing it.

120
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,920
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

121
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,461
<i>I don't like making threats.
But the fact is,</i>

122
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:49,391
<i>you let your sister go to
save your chances for promotion.</i>

123
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,440
So get naked?
Don't insult my intelligence.

124
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,410
<i>You know what to do.
I'm sure you'll act wisely.</i>

125
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,380
Are you manipulating my sister?

126
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,580
<i>Does it look that way?</i>

127
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,400
So she sold me out.

128
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,530
I'm undressed.

129
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,370
<i>Send me photos.</i>

130
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,790
No way!

131
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,690
<i>Well taken.</i>

132
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,340
<i>You're gorgeous.</i>

133
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,870
- Are we done?
- <i>No.</i>

134
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,400
Come on!
Is this your idea of fun?

135
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,711
<i>Take off your panties
and grind your ass.</i>

136
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,980
Hell no!

137
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,180
<i>Watch your mouth.</i>

138
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,490
<i>Do it. Obey my orders
and you'll get a reward.</i>

139
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,730
A reward?

140
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,561
<i>You want to know about Vabyron?</i>

141
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,420
I have to go this far
for information?

142
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,220
<i>Pride holding you back?
It doesn't matter.</i>

143
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,720
<i>Either way, you strip.</i>

144
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,320
I took them off.

145
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,370
- <i>Everything?</i>
- Yes.

146
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,730
<i>Liar.</i>

147
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,490
<i>Hurry up.</i>

148
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,840
Where are you?

149
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,030
<i>Grind your ass in a circle.</i>

150
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,090
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

151
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,130
<i>You'll only feel more ashamed.</i>

152
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,400
Happy now?

153
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,320
<i>How does it feel?</i>

154
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,790
<i>Do it.</i>

155
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,180
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

156
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
<i>Do it.</i>

157
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,560
<i>You make your eyebrows thick
to look tough,</i>

158
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,920
<i>but your facade is your weakness.</i>

159
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,260
<i>You need to show your true self.</i>

160
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,440
Are... we done?

161
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
<i>We're done.
Look down to the right.</i>

162
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,730
<i>That belongs to
Shizuko Toyama, correct?</i>

163
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,150
Yes. It was my present to my wife
on her birthday this year.

164
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,880
Why do you have it?

165
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,500
Where is Shizuko now?

166
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,370
She went home two days ago.
Her mother is rather frail.

167
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,580
Any contact from her?

168
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,140
No, not really.
But that's normal.

169
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,730
Has something happened to her?

170
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,560
Shizuko!

171
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,710
<i>Are you sure that's her?</i>

172
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,540
Why is she...

173
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,740
Shizuko! Hey! Shizuko!

174
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,760
Shi... Shizuko!

175
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,390
Shizuko and I...
have been married for 3 years.

176
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,458
I wanted to become
a freelance broker,

177
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,320
and despite the risk,

178
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,380
Shizuko encouraged me to.

179
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,100
Why's she doing this?

180
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,810
Ask anyone about Shizuko!
About the woman she was!

181
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,380
You won't find a more...

182
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,970
immaculate and loving wife,

183
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,280
anywhere!

184
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,650
Shizuko! Shizu...

185
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,810
Shut up!

186
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,880
Sorry.

187
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,904
That ring belongs to the
woman Vabyron captured.

188
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,380
How did you...

189
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,080
<i>What a bore.
All you talk about is work.</i>

190
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,650
I'm grateful for the info,

191
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,940
but I don't get you.
Do you want to help her?

192
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,060
Or are you just using me?

193
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,960
<i>Just obey my orders. That's all.</i>

194
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,970
I'm... a detective, you know.

195
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:46,300
<i>Don't make this more difficult.
Await my next order.</i>

196
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,530
Coming!

197
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,330
Thank you.

198
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,470
- Sign here please.
- Okay.

199
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,010
<i>Ma'am...</i>

200
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,300
Yes?

201
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,940
Sign here please.

202
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,680
Oh! Sure, sure!

203
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,730
What am I doing?

204
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,011
Cum with me!

205
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:13,111
Please!

206
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,770
Eddie!

207
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Do it properly.

208
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,630
Women need kindness.

209
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,530
Now, you must be tired.

210
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,140
Madam, good work again.

211
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,000
The president said
he enjoyed it too.

212
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,920
Especially...

213
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,550
the part where you
reached ecstasy.

214
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Eddie.

215
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,520
Towards the end,
the lady climaxed, did she not?

216
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,800
If you'd like something,
don't hesitate to ask.

217
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,130
Police are still investigating.

218
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,120
But the president said not to worry.

219
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,980
See you again tomorrow.

220
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,030
<i>Turn it on.</i>

221
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
<i>Turn around.</i>

222
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,360
<i>Spread your legs.</i>

223
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,940
- People can see me.
- <i>Spread your legs.</i>

224
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,820
You're just a pervert.

225
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,160
<i>Listen up. Use only polite language.</i>

226
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,210
<i>Fix that mouth of yours,</i>

227
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,620
<i>or you'll never amount to anything.</i>

228
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,649
<i>Lift your skirt.</i>

229
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,840
Are we done?

230
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,670
Please! Are we done?
They're looking at me!

231
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,090
Please! Have mercy on me!

232
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,370
<i>You're done.</i>

233
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:47,514
Oh! Oh!
Sister you dropped something!

234
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:49,214
Sister you dropped this!

235
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,270
<i>Was it scary?</i>

236
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,960
What'll you do with me?

237
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,260
We don't know who or where...

238
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,076
the women shown on Vabyron are.

239
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:12,233
Even though thousands
watch around the world.

240
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,580
<i>Stupid. Why do you think...</i>

241
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,404
<i>I told you where the girl was?</i>

242
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,300
You're the anonymous caller?

243
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,440
<i>There's one reason
why you can't find them.</i>

244
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,114
<i>They disappear through
the looking-glass.</i>

245
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,920
It's my mess, so I'll clean it up.

246
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,560
Why... did you come here?

247
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
You don't know?

248
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,162
I only do what I'm told.

249
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,970
I can't tell you.

250
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,300
Why did you come here?

251
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,240
For money?

252
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,010
Because you were told to?

253
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,610
Sometimes,

254
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,360
your eyes look sad.

255
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,037
Your mood changes.

256
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:18,452
I can feel it.

257
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,625
No! Don't!

258
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,139
No!

259
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,580
All women are the same!

260
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,560
You're no different!

261
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,430
And you don't function
like most men!

262
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,580
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

263
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,690
<i>- They gave me money.
- Money?</i>

264
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,203
<i>I ran away from home.</i>

265
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:35,635
<i>They gave me a place to live
to appear in the videos.</i>

266
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,510
<i>I got paid 3,000 yen a day.</i>

267
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,350
<i>You agreed to do it?</i>

268
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,900
A man gave me money.

269
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:53,460
He always told me to
pretend I was scared.

270
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,400
But I didn't have to,
because I was scared.

271
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,890
Oh. Also,

272
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,600
an old man called Makimura
came to see me sometimes.

273
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,880
Makimura?

274
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,820
I never saw his face,
but everybody sucked up to him.

275
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,180
Guess he's a big deal.

276
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,960
They called him President Makimura.

277
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,620
They're just porn merchants!

278
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,820
We didn't have to blow them away!

279
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,580
What about Shizuko Toyama?
Her husband filed a complaint!

280
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,880
A horny housewife doing porn...

281
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,960
is police business now?

282
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,360
You want us to leave Vabyron alone?

283
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,600
There are loads of
worse sites out there.

284
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,030
Keisuke Toyama withdrew his complaint.

285
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,530
You went to see Toyama?

286
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,170
He turned me away.

287
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,671
It happens.
Let's go for a drink.

288
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,530
Lieutenant.

289
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,961
About what the girl said.

290
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:08,210
She was visited by a man
called President Makimura.

291
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,540
Lieutenant,

292
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,140
does the name Gozo Makimura
sound familiar?

293
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,210
Come.

294
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,000
He's an art dealer...

295
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,730
and political and industrial fixer!

296
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:39,970
Is he putting pressure on us?

297
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,520
Drop the case.

298
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,940
That's all I can say.

299
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,910
Lieutenant...

300
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,780
Are you serious?

301
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,860
Shizuko Toyama's ring!

302
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,780
Where'd you get it?

303
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,120
Who'd you let escape?

304
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,900
You think I don't know anything?

305
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,170
What are you up to?

306
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,620
Don't think I can't end your career.

307
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,810
Want to touch me?

308
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:42,700
Yes.

309
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,940
If you want to touch me,
what do you say?

310
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,627
Please let me...

311
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,834
touch you.

312
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,650
Touch yourself too!

313
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,480
How is it?

314
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,780
It's warm!

315
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
<i>What is it?</i>

316
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,640
Gozo Makimura.
Surely you know him.

317
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,410
I was told to drop the case.

318
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,920
<i>So?</i>

319
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,010
I don't know what to believe anymore.

320
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,880
I want to meet you.

321
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,890
I'd like you to meet me.

322
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,660
<i>Come to this address.</i>

323
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,001
Hey, wanna see something cool?

324
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,330
I knew you'd come.

325
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,980
I know you inside out.

326
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,100
And look,
you've dressed up nicely for me.

327
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,110
A pleasing sight.

328
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,680
Makimura? Vabyron?

329
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,790
<i>Are you scared?</i>

330
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
Yes.

331
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,320
Trust me.

332
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,190
Surrender all that's inside you.

333
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,040
<i>Why did you let your sister go?</i>

334
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,340
Are you ordering me to answer?

335
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,760
I am.

336
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,610
Hate.

337
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,880
I hate my sister.

338
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,890
Since I was young,
I wished she was dead.

339
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,250
No matter how hard I tried,

340
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,770
I was never loved
as much as she was.

341
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,870
But on that day...

342
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,595
You might say I did it
to protect myself,

343
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:55,961
but I didn't.

344
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,770
I had a sudden urge to help her.

345
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,691
That made me...

346
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:05,900
hate myself as well.

347
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,750
A liberated younger sister,

348
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,000
and a self-restraining older sister.

349
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:17,780
It's so cliched.

350
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,420
No, it isn't.

351
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,610
I enjoyed it. Thank you.

352
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,610
Here's your reward.

353
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,040
Check Shizuko's husband's clients.

354
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,990
Good evening!

355
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,160
You were here?

356
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,310
You're a good girl as always,
Big Sis.

357
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:13,350
<i>You do everything
that's asked of you.</i>

358
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,560
Could you go this far for him?

359
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,470
I'll never lose to you.

360
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,920
Wait!

361
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,190
Get this straight!

362
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,490
Our clients don't want to see love!

363
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,050
The president is livid!

364
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,270
Use your brain.

365
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,750
It'll get infected.

366
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,320
You asked me why I'm here.

367
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,850
It's for my husband.

368
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,770
For his sake...

369
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,500
I'd persevere through anything.

370
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,390
You're...

371
01:00:06,961 --> 01:00:08,864
not like other women.

372
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,190
I don't know how other women feel.

373
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,690
Hey.

374
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,990
Sometimes at night,

375
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,730
you gaze at me
through the mirror, don't you.

376
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,630
It's alright.

377
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,760
I...

378
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,660
feel a little better when
I know you're watching me.

379
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,440
Despite this situation...

380
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,650
Despite this existence...

381
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,170
I'm glad you're here.

382
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:20,631
Something must be wrong with me.

383
01:01:36,434 --> 01:01:39,285
<i>Time to get ready.</i>

384
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,220
Tell the truth!
Your wife will be killed!

385
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,950
Killed?

386
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:12,500
Vabyron kills the women!

387
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,211
<i>Hey asswipe.</i>

388
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:20,464
Know who you're fucking with?

389
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,699
50 million. Better pay in full.

390
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:27,285
Please wait! I'm doing my best...

391
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:30,581
<i>Sell your house! Your land!
Or a kidney?</i>

392
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,829
Stop! I'll call the cops!

393
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,529
Shizuko! Get out!

394
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,250
Try calling them, madam.

395
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,133
This guy has billions in bad debts...

396
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:42,510
from misusing clients' money.

397
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,660
Sad, but true.

398
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:48,680
<i>They said they'd
show my wife naked...</i>

399
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:51,370
<i>on an illegal pay site.</i>

400
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,233
<i>By doing so,</i>

401
01:02:53,258 --> 01:02:56,534
I'd earn millions per day...

402
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:00,060
and be debt-free within a month.

403
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,970
I'll do it.

404
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,500
Shizuko! You...

405
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,834
My heart belongs to you alone.

406
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:16,740
Shizuko!

407
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,540
I'm begging you.
Please save Shizuko!

408
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,220
I don't care about myself!

409
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,030
Please save Shizuko!
I'm begging you!

410
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,430
I'm begging you!
I'm begging you!

411
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,399
Shizuko! Please save her!

412
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,400
Amamiya here.

413
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,690
<i>Police hospital, now.</i>

414
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,980
Mifuyu!

415
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,340
Stay back!

416
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,410
Why?

417
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,380
Why do something so stupid?

418
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,630
I said I wouldn't lose to you,
remember?

419
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,380
Don't!

420
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,390
Mifuyu!

421
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,710
Mifuyu!

422
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,070
Mifuyu!

423
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:52,179
Mifuyu!

424
01:04:54,354 --> 01:04:55,561
Mifuyu...

425
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,100
<i>It was my mistake.
They got ahead of me.</i>

426
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,860
<i>That's Makimura's style.</i>

427
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,080
Lead me to him.

428
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,390
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- Lead me.

429
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,380
<i>There's only one way.</i>

430
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,260
<i>Are you ready to die?</i>

431
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:30,110
"See Shizuko perform live!
Ladies free!"

432
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,240
For real?

433
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,670
<i>No way...</i>

434
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,850
Madam,

435
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,140
you've served us well.

436
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:11,000
Today your husband's debt
will be fully repaid.

437
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,020
No more Eddie.

438
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,500
Eddie?

439
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,590
Got any stomach medicine?

440
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,930
I'm nervous.

441
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,680
I'll give you time at the end.

442
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:52,590
Do what you like.

443
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,420
Madam,

444
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,170
I'll call when we start.

445
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,090
I won't... hurt you.

446
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,690
Today's guest.

447
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:30,531
She volunteered to become a slave.

448
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,650
Miss Misaki.

449
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
Eddie!

450
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,700
I'll untie you.

451
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:20,340
This is amazing!

452
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,190
Isn't this amazing?

453
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,177
It is!

454
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:37,865
It is amazing.

455
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,730
Face this way!

456
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,460
What the hell is this bullshit?

457
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,730
This mustache is awful!

458
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,191
I need attention to detail!

459
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:36,830
How's this?

460
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,250
Behold, the devil!

461
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,160
That's not it...

462
01:17:29,157 --> 01:17:30,743
Showtime!

463
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,820
Ladies and gentlemen.

464
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:44,015
We welcome you here today...

465
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,534
to Vabyron's celebration of the flesh.

466
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,070
Please be informed...

467
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,370
that the true star of today's party,

468
01:17:58,912 --> 01:18:03,830
our divine dictator of debauchery,

469
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:11,564
Mr. Gozo Makimura,
is in attendance here today.

470
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:17,040
Everyone, look this way.

471
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,740
He is present behind that mirror!

472
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,360
As you have kindly joined us,

473
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,398
would one of you like...

474
01:18:35,183 --> 01:18:39,345
to discipline these ladies...

475
01:18:40,546 --> 01:18:43,541
for our entertainment?

476
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,700
Me! Me! Me! Me!

477
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,150
Aren't you a lively one!
Please come up here.

478
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,597
Would you mind?

479
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:59,304
Excuse me!

480
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,600
A round of applause!

481
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,510
Thank you!

482
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:08,560
So where do you hail from?

483
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,530
I came from Saitama!

484
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:12,910
And your name?

485
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,300
Well...

486
01:19:14,893 --> 01:19:18,253
Whoa Nelly!
No need to tell us the truth.

487
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:28,464
I'm a huge fan of Madam Shizuko,

488
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,969
and I'm terribly excited to...

489
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,480
see her perform live today!

490
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:38,044
I'm sure Madam Shizuko
will be overjoyed to hear that.

491
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,834
Now then, please feel free to use...

492
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:44,170
any of these implements.

493
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:47,180
Ladies and gents,

494
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,188
enjoy our ladies' humiliation...

495
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:53,217
by a complete stranger...

496
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,602
to your heart's content!

497
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:49,313
Moan for me!

498
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,660
Hey, you.

499
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:39,520
Please punish me too.

500
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:07,218
I'm feeling awesome!

501
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,990
Mr. Kurokawa...

502
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,320
I brought...
I brought the money!

503
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,130
So free Shizuko. Free Shizuko!

504
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,380
Shizuko! Shizuko!

505
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,037
Mr. Toyama,

506
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:45,544
the real fun is about to begin.

507
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:51,111
Thank you! Oh, thanks! Thank you!

508
01:26:53,372 --> 01:26:54,372
Thank you!

509
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:07,010
I asked for concealer!
I don't have time for this!

510
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,821
Not this color again.
I wanted a wine one...

511
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,520
They're a hit.

512
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,190
Excellent...

513
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,920
Thank you, thank you!

514
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:49,280
Ladies and gents,
was that to your liking?

515
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:54,794
Now we've reached the climax
of our delightful party.

516
01:29:55,980 --> 01:30:02,434
We would like you to watch
the following film.

517
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,380
Tearful to hear,

518
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,370
and tearful to tell,

519
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:15,680
this is one woman's sad, sad story.

520
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,560
Its heroine...

521
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,540
is Madam Shizuko!

522
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:24,060
<i>You!</i>

523
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,421
Ladies and gents,

524
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:32,030
sit back, relax, and enjoy!

525
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:44,773
"The Tale of Shizuko."

526
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,280
<i>Shizuko Toyama.</i>

527
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:55,530
<i>Born and raised in an
affluent Tokyo household,</i>

528
01:30:56,050 --> 01:31:00,500
<i>she was an angelic little girl,
loved by all.</i>

529
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,150
However, one day,

530
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,160
<i>a terrible tragedy befell her.</i>

531
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,970
<i>Of all things, she was abducted
and held captive,</i>

532
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:21,630
<i>and her innocent body
was used as a plaything.</i>

533
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,420
<i>The ringleader...</i>

534
01:31:28,445 --> 01:31:33,244
was Gozo Makimura!

535
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:59,370
<i>President Makimura
had long coveted...</i>

536
01:31:59,395 --> 01:32:01,944
<i>the beautiful young Shizuko,</i>

537
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:06,570
<i>and at last
his desire was fulfilled.</i>

538
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:12,580
No! No! No!

539
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,840
<i>Half a year later,
tragedy struck Shizuko once again.</i>

540
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:36,817
<i>Of all things, she was pregnant
with President Makimura's child!</i>

541
01:32:39,422 --> 01:32:42,122
<i>She learned this too late to abort.</i>

542
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,880
<i>Her parents made her give birth,</i>

543
01:32:46,426 --> 01:32:50,018
<i>and secretly put the child
up for adoption.</i>

544
01:32:53,638 --> 01:32:58,555
<i>President Makimura covertly
kept watch over his child,</i>

545
01:32:59,637 --> 01:33:02,494
<i>and eventually took him in,</i>

546
01:33:03,748 --> 01:33:07,463
<i>giving him a special education.</i>

547
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:26,223
<i>He had a natural talent...</i>

548
01:33:27,174 --> 01:33:34,566
<i>for inflicting pain without pity!</i>

549
01:33:40,105 --> 01:33:45,843
<i>His gift brought him
the ultimate blessing.</i>

550
01:33:47,203 --> 01:33:51,329
<i>Yes! A joyous reunion...</i>

551
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:56,313
<i>with his birth mother,
Shizuko Toyama!</i>

552
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,880
No way!

553
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:29,900
It's a love story!

554
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,821
Move over Sophocles,

555
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:39,715
this epic saga will be
retold for generations!

556
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,700
And now, we come to the end.

557
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,550
We have prepared
a glorious conclusion...

558
01:34:46,884 --> 01:34:50,631
to this tragic tale.

559
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,760
Eddie?

560
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,610
Eddie!

561
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,720
What is Vabyron's greatest offering?

562
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:56,870
Yes, our magic trick in which
we make a person vanish.

563
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:04,510
Abracadabra!

564
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,100
Misaki Amamiya, Metro Police!

565
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,470
Lieutenant?

566
01:37:15,693 --> 01:37:17,880
Baba! What the fuck?

567
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,440
So it was you, Lieutenant.

568
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,998
We'll talk later.

569
01:37:54,121 --> 01:37:55,291
Let's go.

570
01:38:40,267 --> 01:38:42,492
Makimura!

571
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:38,759
Gozo... Makimura.

572
01:39:40,092 --> 01:39:44,375
The genuine article
died a long time ago.

573
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,212
The Makimura of today...

574
01:39:49,256 --> 01:39:52,344
is a phantom
that all of you created.

575
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,746
A wicked... fantasy!

576
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,754
Baba.

577
01:40:07,443 --> 01:40:11,410
Why did you use this bitch?

578
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,389
<i>Were you dreaming of</i>

579
01:40:16,364 --> 01:40:20,660
<i>deposing Gozo Makimura to claim
his throne for yourself?</i>

580
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:27,670
Where are the bodies
of your victims?

581
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,420
Bodies?

582
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,150
That internet rumor?

583
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,910
Don't jump to conclusions, bimbo!

584
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:44,600
They all took the money and ran.

585
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,760
I did it to please my audience.

586
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:55,070
That's all I wanted.

587
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:05,840
Wait! Who is Makimura?

588
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,610
"Life is but a dream..."

589
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,410
so embrace insanity.

590
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:41,730
It hurts...

591
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,140
Mother.

592
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:16,470
Shizuko?

593
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:23,940
There's no proof he was your son.

594
01:45:03,331 --> 01:45:08,667
Oh god, oh god, oh god...

595
01:47:24,575 --> 01:47:25,759
Okay.

596
01:48:18,192 --> 01:48:20,501
Look this way please.

597
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,900
Time you found yourself a job.

598
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:44,610
A husband mooching off his wife...
That's embarrassing.

599
01:50:08,986 --> 01:50:09,986
Hello?

600
01:50:13,837 --> 01:50:15,054
Hello?

601
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:17,620
Who is it?

602
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,370
<i>You know.</i>

603
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:26,470
Who?

604
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,520
<i>Makimura.</i>

605
01:51:06,344 --> 01:51:10,189
