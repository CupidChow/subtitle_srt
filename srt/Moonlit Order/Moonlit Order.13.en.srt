Miss Feng.

25
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:14,992
My belly hurts.

26
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:15,992
May I use the toilet?

27
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,031
Make it quick.

00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:18,792
Okay.

29
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:19,952
It's hurting.

30
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:26,952
Gu Qianfu?

31
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,072
Why is he here?

32
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,151
Spare some change, please.

33
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:33,792
Dusters.

34
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:35,191
Give me some food.

35
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,272
(Let's lay low.)

36
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:39,151
(Find the former Crown Prince
before she does.)

37
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:41,631
(Let me check my clues.)

38
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,352
Spare some change.

39
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:48,672
Spare some change.

40
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:49,992
Spare some change.

41
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:58,072
(Funds ran out long ago.)

42
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:00,272
(To think I would sink so low)

43
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,672
(and covet a beggar's meal...)

44
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:02,512
(How)

45
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,512
(u-utterly humiliating!)

46
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:05,711
(No way.)

47
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:07,792
(I can't do this.)

48
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:13,952
This pancake's completely dried out.

49
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,352
How do I eat this?

50
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,392
I didn't pick this up from the ground.

51
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,512
He threw it away.

52
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,191
I just happened to catch it.

53
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,871
After all, I'm Gu Qianfu,

54
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:37,512
a respectable imperial official.

55
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:52,832
People from

56
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,512
the Jing'an Bureau have no dignity.

57
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:56,871
Lure him away.

58
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:58,072
I don't want a tail.

59
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:58,992
Understood.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,512
Let's go.

61
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,272
Want a duster?

62
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:05,792
How much?

63
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:06,311
Five wen.

64
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:07,311
Too expensive.

65
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,711
Five wen for a lousy duster?

66
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,311
Two eggs and two quail eggs

67
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:14,232
cost the same.

68
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:15,552
Who'd buy this?

69
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,271
One wen and it's yours.

70
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,472
Cheapskate.

71
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,831
Who's a cheapskate?

72
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:25,112
- Do you know who...?
- Stop!

73
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:26,472
Stop.

74
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:28,831
Stop there, traitor.

75
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,191
Traitor?

76
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:36,792
He went this way.

77
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,271
Get him.

78
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,311
The former Crown Prince.

79
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,631
One wen.

80
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,831
Commander, we found Jia Xun's hideout.

81
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,431
Did he run away?

82
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:04,992
What do we do now?

83
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:06,552
Go over there.

84
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:07,311
Search.

85
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,040
Understood.

86
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:13,831
Young master.

87
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,391
You're quite handsome.

88
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,511
May I know your name?

89
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,071
I have no name.

90
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,672
H-how can that be?

91
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:23,431
Where are you from?

92
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,391
From where I came from.

93
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,792
Where are you going?

94
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:29,672
To where I should go.

95
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:32,232
Please stop teasing me.

96
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:33,672
We seem destined to meet.

97
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:34,912
I'd like to know you.

98
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:36,271
Miss.

99
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,152
We're not destined to meet.

100
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,032
You don't

101
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:39,871
have to know me.

102
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:41,431
I don't care.

103
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,912
Today, I'll make you my friend.

104
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,871
Having fun chatting?

105
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:49,552
I came at a bad time.

106
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,152
Honey.

107
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:53,431
Why are you here?

108
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:55,912
You got me wrong.

109
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,271
Who's your honey?

110
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:05,871
Why so angry, Miss Feng?

111
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:10,352
Am I angry?

112
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,951
Or are you guilty?

113
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:16,112
This is how I express admiration.

114
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:19,712
You talk about admiration,

115
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:20,751
but won't help me?

116
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,631
Hypocrite.

117
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:23,511
Miss Feng.

118
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,751
I know you don't want to

119
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:28,191
harm the innocent.

120
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,311
But this is the border

121
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,712
between Liang and Hua.

122
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:34,191
Liang is seven days'

123
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:35,391
travel away.

124
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,152
We own estates there.

125
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:39,472
No one can

126
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:41,631
pressure you there.

127
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:43,631
What?

128
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,751
My father

129
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,431
has been preparing for his retirement.

130
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,552
That place seemed remote to me.

131
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,352
But now I realize

132
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,152
that it's all part of his plan.

133
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:58,071
Escape with me.

134
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:05,112
I must complete the task

135
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,951
to dispel His Majesty's doubts.

136
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,071
Only then will you truly be safe.

137
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,191
My life is worth it

138
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,391
since I've met you.

139
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,271
(I sent a message
to Nanwu three days ago)

140
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:51,511
(to warn Xue Youshou.)

141
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,071
(You won't find him)

142
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,152
(this time.)

143
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,112
(He's already in Liang now.)

144
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,271
Mr. Xue.

145
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,232
Mr. Xue.

146
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:03,071
Come in.

147
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:08,792
Greetings, Mr. Xue.

148
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,431
Please pick up your message

149
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:11,464
at the escort agency.

150
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,552
Escort agency?

151
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,836
(Shunli Escort Agency)

152
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,592
(Meet at the beacon-lit border
near Zhidao.)

153
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,791
(Observe the vast Zhang River.
Abandon all worries.)

154
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,031
(Why hasn't he gone to Liang?)

155
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:37,712
Nothing.

156
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:38,271
Please stop.

157
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,192
- Master.
- Go home.

158
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:39,992
Go home.

159
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:42,832
Master, please help me.

160
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:45,031
I can't afford the medicines
for my grandson.

161
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,671
Please save him.

162
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:48,232
Master.

163
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:49,072
Take this.

164
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:50,192
Thank you.

165
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,712
Please get up.

166
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:52,391
Thank you.

167
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,151
Please get up.

168
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,192
You're a living saint.

169
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,832
Go now.

170
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,072
Master.

171
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,391
Come see my father.

172
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,911
He's coughing up blood.

173
00:08:59,031 --> 00:08:59,551
Where?

174
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,352
Show me.

175
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:07,871
Let me check your pulse.

176
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:13,952
It's nothing serious.

177
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:15,312
You're just stressed.

178
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,592
Get your father some medicine

179
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,031
at the pharmacy.

180
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:23,751
Wait.

181
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,511
Pawn this and get something

182
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,791
to eat.

183
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:35,232
Thank you.

184
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,271
Sit up.

185
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:41,871
I'm much better.

186
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,271
Alright.

187
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,192
Thank you.

188
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,151
Nothing.

189
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,072
He's such a nice person.

190
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:48,832
Indeed.

191
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:49,911
So compassionate.

192
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,911
He seems like a changed man.

193
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,432
Such virtue is rare.

194
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,472
Thankfully, he's here.

195
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,952
Master saved his life.

196
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:09,871
Breathe.

197
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:25,952
Come on in.

198
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:26,911
Careful.

199
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:34,031
Youshou.

200
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:36,751
Why are you still here?

201
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,472
Didn't I tell you

202
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,112
to take shelter in our estates

203
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,511
in Liang?

204
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:46,112
Years of fleeing

205
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,192
must end somewhere.

206
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,352
I explained everything in my letter.

207
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,271
Our family faces imminent doom.

208
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:54,992
You must leave.

209
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,312
When your father took me with him,

210
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,031
he said,

211
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,112
"Never contact me unless"

212
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:06,992
"it's critical."

213
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:08,952
At critical moments,

214
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:10,992
he'd contact me in person.

215
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,472
No messengers.

216
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,511
Especially not his son.

217
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,671
You look extremely

218
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:21,232
nervous.

219
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:22,911
Have you

220
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:24,952
found out about it?

221
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:27,712
Yes.

222
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:30,151
Father told me.

223
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:33,511
Why

224
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:34,911
didn't you tell me who you are?

225
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:38,352
You're a prince.

226
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,592
It's unfair that you

227
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:41,551
have to hide.

228
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,551
A prince?

229
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,151
The former Crown Prince.

230
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,072
It's shadier than being

231
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:52,952
the illegitimate son.

232
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,671
I deserve to die.

233
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,631
That emperor deserves to die.

234
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,352
Not you.

235
00:11:58,911 --> 00:11:59,712
Nonsense.

236
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,391
Watch your tongue.

237
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:03,871
I thought

238
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,472
the Emperor's murderous intent

239
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,671
was just a rumor.

240
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:08,911
I didn't know

241
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,671
that all the misfortunes
we've been through

242
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:14,352
were orchestrated by him

243
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:15,511
to eliminate us.

244
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,952
Even with his throne so secure,

245
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:19,871
he still targets

246
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,511
a defenseless man.

247
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,112
So inhuman.

248
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:24,712
Victors reign.

249
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:26,911
In his position,

250
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:28,952
he can do as he pleases.

251
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:30,671
Meanwhile,

252
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,232
I must struggle to survive.

253
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,592
I've let go of everything.

254
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:37,312
Right.

255
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:39,232
Does Father know

256
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,832
about your visit?

257
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:42,751
Yeah.

258
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,232
I can tell you're rebellious.

259
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,472
You must have come in secret,

260
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:52,751
against his orders.

261
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:56,511
Right.

262
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,432
You said that

263
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,352
you had been through a lot.

264
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:03,551
Are you hanging in there?

265
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,832
Father holds the title of Lord Dingyuan.

266
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,712
We can withstand some petty tricks.

267
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,911
Has your father decided

268
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,352
to abandon me?

269
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:27,271
We have plans in Liang.

270
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:29,232
Come with me.

271
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:31,671
Survival comes first.

272
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:36,911
Lord Dingyuan

273
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,511
is truly casting me aside?

274
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:45,832
Youshou,

275
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,031
my father has been

276
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,751
bedridden for years.

277
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,631
He's been exhausted

278
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:54,391
by this matter.

279
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,151
Don't blame him.

280
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,271
How could I blame him?

281
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,432
Without him,

282
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,072
I would have died

283
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:03,232
when I was seven.

284
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,511
My whereabouts are exposed.

285
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,072
Don't defy the authorities again

286
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:15,391
by letting me escape.

287
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:16,992
Turn me in.

288
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:19,352
Earn merit for the Xue family.

289
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:20,712
Are you crazy?

290
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,671
After all these years,

291
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm tired of hiding.

292
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,352
I'll sever all ties with the Xues.

293
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:31,271
Let me satisfy that Emperor's wish

294
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:34,232
and consider this

295
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,232
repayment for your help.

296
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:39,031
Youshou,

297
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,192
don't let everything go to waste.

298
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,391
Do you really think

299
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:44,511
we'll be spared

300
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:46,391
if we turn you in?

301
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,511
He doesn't hesitate to kill

302
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:50,631
his confidant.

303
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,671
My father risked our family

304
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:53,992
to protect you.

305
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:56,551
If you do this,

306
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,312
we'll be doomed together.

307
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,312
(Traitor.)

308
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:16,791
(Time to claim your life.)

309
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,472
Miss Feng...

310
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:20,472
How...

311
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:22,551
You are Xue Youshou?

312
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,031
Or should I call you

313
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,952
Crown Prince Jia Xun?

314
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,592
He's not the Crown Prince.

315
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,791
He's just my half-brother.

316
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:37,592
Xue Guardian Feng Zuoren

317
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,151
is here to kill you.

318
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:41,432
Any last words?

319
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:44,472
You'll kill me?

320
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,031
Don't.

321
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:09,791
The jade pendant.

322
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,151
You remember it.

323
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:16,871
Feng.

324
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:25,751
Young master.

325
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:28,871
(Young master?)

326
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:37,952
It's been so long.

327
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:41,352
I never expected

328
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,072
I'd see you again

329
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:49,432
in this lifetime.

330
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:55,432
After ten years,

331
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,192
we reunited here of all places,

332
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,632
but under such circumstances.

333
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:09,432
Youshou,

334
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,311
what's going on here?

335
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:22,751
I was homeless

336
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,071
when I was a child.

337
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:26,992
Young master and Madam saved me

338
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,872
and brought me home.

339
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:30,912
I always thought

340
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,632
that you were simply

341
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,511
from a wealthy family.

342
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:51,751
But you were

343
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,872
the former Crown Prince
and she was the late Empress.

344
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:56,551
After Mother died,

345
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,392
the Emperor sent assassins.

346
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,511
Lord Dingyuan

347
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,791
saved me.

348
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:10,551
- Run.
- Get him.

349
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,271
(Xue Fugui, younger years)

350
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,511
I'm Lord Dingyuan.

351
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:25,736
Come with me.

352
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:26,311
No.

353
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:27,751
Come with me.

354
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,432
To conceal my identity
as the former Crown Prince,

355
00:18:32,472 --> 00:18:33,511
I dare not show up

356
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,872
anywhere,

357
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:37,351
let alone seek you out.

358
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:40,111
I didn't expect

359
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:41,912
that you'd

360
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:45,152
become so skilled in martial arts.

361
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,152
After the bandits attacked

362
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:50,311
and we were separated,

363
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:52,152
His Majesty rescued me

364
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,271
and trained me.

365
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,432
(They share childhood bonds.)

366
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:01,751
(How can I compete?)

367
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,351
As Youshou said,

368
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:06,432
His Majesty must have

369
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,071
handpicked his personal guards

370
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,751
who have clear family backgrounds.

371
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,511
He must know your history

372
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:14,912
with Youshou.

373
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,511
Hexu, are you saying that

374
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:19,952
he orchestrated this?

375
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:21,511
Isn't that obvious?

376
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,152
He didn't tell you

377
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,551
that your benefactor

378
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:28,872
was the former Crown Prince

379
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,791
and ordered you to kill him on purpose.

380
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,311
Why would he

381
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,071
do that?

382
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:41,071
Had I actually killed young master,

383
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:42,831
then...

384
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:43,791
Yes.

385
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:45,632
He'll reveal the truth

386
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,672
afterward.

387
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,071
You'd commit suicide

388
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:51,392
out of guilt.

389
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:53,472
Then,

390
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:55,831
no one will know

391
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,952
of my existence.

392
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,031
Those bandits

393
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,791
were surely sent by him.

394
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,232
They failed.

395
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:10,511
So he trained Miss Feng

396
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,712
into an assassin

397
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,591
to come after you.

398
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,672
Nothing poses a threat
as long as he kills

399
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:18,351
the former Crown Prince

400
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:21,031
and the Xue Guardians' leader.

401
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,031
That's impressive.

402
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:27,432
His strategic brilliance
is awe-inspiring.

403
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,071
I once swore

404
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:33,672
to protect you and Madam.

405
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:35,791
But

406
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,672
I could only watch

407
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,071
as they took you away,

408
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:42,672
unable to react.

409
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:48,111
I vowed to tear your killers apart.

410
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:51,432
However,

411
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,031
the person I'd hate most

412
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:57,751
would be myself.

413
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:01,232
Miss Feng.

Feng Zuoren.

420
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:16,952
This isn't your fault.

421
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,712
Your fate was never yours to control.

422
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:22,392
First the former Crown Prince,

423
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:23,672
now

424
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:25,031
the Emperor.

425
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,791
I nearly

426
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,672
killed my own savior.

427
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,551
You should be grateful

428
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:34,912
that he sent you.

429
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:36,392
Thanks to you,

430
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,311
Youshou stands alive here.

431
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:40,831
And you get the chance to turn the tide.

432
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,472
♪The world's weight
rests on my shoulders♪

433
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:45,992
Feng.

434
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:47,591
Don't be foolish.

435
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:49,511
Only when I'm gone

436
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:51,511
will all problems be resolved.

437
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,392
I should have died.

438
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:55,872
I struggled to survive

439
00:21:56,912 --> 00:21:58,432
just to see you again.

440
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:00,952
Seeing you today,

441
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,392
I have no regrets left.

442
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:05,232
Young master.

443
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,111
Feng.

444
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:08,551
Hexu.

445
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:12,351
Turn me in.

446
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:13,152
No.

447
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:15,511
I won't let you die.

448
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:17,472
The Xue family and you are at risk.

449
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,952
I can't remain a coward.

450
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:22,992
Today, I realized that

451
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,472
even if life and death part us,

452
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,712
our souls remain connected.

453
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:30,152
At the Naihe Bridge,

454
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,111
I'll refuse Meng Po's soup.

455
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,511
I won't forget you, Feng.

456
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:37,192
I won't let anything happen to you.

457
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:38,952
I'll protect you

458
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:40,511
at all costs.

459
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,351
(If he dies,)

460
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,192
(he'll become her eternal love.)

461
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:46,791
I can't let you die.

462
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,031
If one of us must die

463
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,432
to protect the other,

464
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:51,831
I'll go.

465
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:52,751
No.

466
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:54,031
I'll go.

467
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:54,551
I'll go.

468
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:55,071
I'll go.

469
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:55,591
I'll go.

470
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,271
Enough.

471
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,311
Since you won't let each other die,

472
00:22:58,751 --> 00:22:59,271
I'll go.

473
00:22:59,472 --> 00:22:59,952
Go ahead.

474
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:04,912
I didn't mean it.

475
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:09,232
Get some rest.

476
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:11,071
You've rushed about

477
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:12,351
all day.

478
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:15,311
Youshou.

479
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,472
I meant to send you away,

480
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:20,672
but not anymore.

481
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,472
The Xue Guardian commander
is here to protect you.

482
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:31,192
Get some rest.

483
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,952
Let's talk tomorrow.

484
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:36,632
Youshou.

485
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,751
Your cottage only has one bedroom.

486
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:40,751
How can we

487
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:41,751
sleep here?

488
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,751
You two share the room.

489
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:45,111
I'll be outside.

490
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:45,872
- No.
- No.

491
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,392
How can a lady

492
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,511
sleep outdoors?

493
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:50,152
Exactly.

494
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,111
Listen.

495
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:52,751
Youshou and I will be out.

496
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:53,632
You stay.

497
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:54,432
No way.

498
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:56,672
Stay inside,

499
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:57,831
so I can protect you.

500
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,472
Let's share the room then.

501
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:00,111
- No.
- No.

502
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:07,511
I'll take a walk.

503
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:22,920
(I must accept punishment)

504
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:24,311
(to protect)

505
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:25,712
(young master.)

506
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:26,872
Giddyup.

507
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,591
Xue Hexu.

508
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:32,632
Are you crazy?

509
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:34,672
I could have

510
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:35,912
killed you.

511
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:37,152
But I had to

512
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:38,432
block you.

513
00:24:38,831 --> 00:24:39,232
You...

514
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,071
We always

515
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:46,551
end up bickering like this.

516
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:50,472
It won't happen again.

517
00:24:51,472 --> 00:24:52,591
We're both aiming to keep

518
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,432
young master alive.

519
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:57,472
I never expected

520
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,632
that all my efforts

521
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,192
would never sway you,

522
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:03,992
but his mere presence achieves it.

523
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:10,551
I'm still alive

524
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:13,152
because of him.

525
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,632
It's time to repay him.

526
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:17,992
But think about it.

527
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:19,912
If you die,

528
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:21,544
who will protect him?

529
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,632
Can you entrust him

530
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:25,672
to anyone else?

531
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:34,872
Feng Zuoren.

532
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:38,152
Why can't you

533
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:39,872
try to live for yourself?

534
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:45,232
Liang is right there.

535
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:48,672
It's a place full of possibilities.

536
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:53,432
Don't you want to see it?

537
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,031
Besides,

00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:00,152
you've just reunited
with your beloved one.

539
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,511

540
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:11,551

You haven't expressed your love
under the blossoms.
