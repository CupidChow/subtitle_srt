20
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:41,932
He was nice.

21
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,333
But are you sure His Majesty...

22
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,652
Meant to cultivate you?

23
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:51,693
If he truly cared about you,

24
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:53,572
would he have let you

25
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:54,572
become ruthless

26
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,104
and devoid of emotion?

27
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,733
Without His Majesty,

28
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:01,813
I would have died.

29
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,212
Fine.

30
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,072
That's it.

31
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:17,293
I'll stop.

32
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,293
If he hadn't saved you,

33
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,453
I wouldn't have met you.

34
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,212
I'm grateful. Happy now?

35
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,092
But you're barely over twenty

36
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:28,133
and your beloved has died.

37
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:29,733
Heaven has been

38
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:30,893
too cruel to you.

39
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:37,613
Why the long face?

40
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:41,133
I'll cherish you like you

41
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,053
cherished him.

42
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,293
I'll be your family

43
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,772
and keep you company.

44
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,893
I am your family already.

45
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm your stepmother.

46
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,932
Neither you nor my father

47
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:05,613
meant to get married.

48
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,453
I'll arrange your divorce.

49
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,733
Since when do you have a say?

50
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,652
I've always had a say.

51
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,293
From now on,

52
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,733
I won't call you stepmother.

53
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:18,173
What do you say?

54
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:19,613
May I ask your name?

55
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:23,532
Feng...

56
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:24,812
F-Feng Zuo...

57
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:25,652
Wang Feng.

58
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,613
What a simple and lovely name.

59
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,053
Wang Feng. Wang Feng.

60
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:31,692
Are you done?

61
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,333
Let's go back.

62
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:34,733
I have things to do.

63
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:36,932
What's more urgent

64
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,573
than getting medical treatment?

65
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,293
I must capture Gu Qianfu and find out

66
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,293
who commissioned him and whether

67
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,492
it's related

68
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,652
to the former Crown Prince.

69
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:49,932
We don't have to do it in person.

70
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,692
Still pooping?

71
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,424
I didn't finish last time.

72
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,333
Still?

73
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:06,632
None of your business.

74
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:08,333
What do you want?

75
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:14,772
My bounty.

76
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,332
You dare ask for payment?

77
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,012
Why?

78
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,252
Did you kill the target?

79
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:19,733
Yeah.

80
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:20,413
How?

81
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:23,144
I saw Xue Hexu fall from the cliff.

82
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,053
He's definitely dead.

83
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,452
Definitely dead?

84
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:29,132
Xue Hexu wailed on Xue Street

85
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,293
that his stepmother

86
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,812
died protecting him.

87
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:32,613
What?

88
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,213
Feels good.

89
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:54,701
(Xue Mansion)

90
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:57,973
Nobody is here.

91
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,332
Go patch up.

92
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:00,892
Will it work?

93
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:14,173
My goodness.

94
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,932
Hexu and Stepmother finally decided

95
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:20,533
to defy feudal traditions?

96
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,173
Fine.

97
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,012
Today, I will

98
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,413
safeguard true love.

99
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:33,613
You.

100
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:34,533
Come here.

101
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:37,252
Miss.

102
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:37,973
Pass on my word.

103
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,432
This area's restricted today.

104
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,213
I'm admiring the moon here.

105
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:42,892
Don't disturb me.

106
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,653
Understood. I'm on it.

107
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,293
(You were whispering sweet nothings)

108
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:04,492
(and canoodling with that evil woman.)

109
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,132
(She just passed away.)

110
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,932
(And you're sleeping soundly
like nothing happened.)

111
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:12,132
(Heartless brat.)

112
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:14,492
(You deserve to die.)

113
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,093
Perfect timing.

114
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,132
You're alive?

115
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:42,173
You adulterous scums.

116
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,853
Even that fall didn't kill you?

117
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:45,853
This time,

118
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,653
I must uphold justice.

119
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:55,613
Wait.

120
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:58,372
What?

121
00:06:58,613 --> 00:06:59,372
What?

122
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:00,252
I was...

123
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:01,572
I...

124
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:17,653
Stop it.

125
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:19,208
Grand Tutor Zhou

126
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:20,892
wants me dead. Why?

127
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,812
If I have offended him,

128
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:24,213
I'll apologize to him.

129
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:25,533
Mr. Gu.

130
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:26,773
Spare me.

131
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,853
You dare disrespect Grand Tutor Zhou?

132
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,332
Countless people

133
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,613
want you dead.

134
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:34,892
Grand Tutor wouldn't even
spare you a glance.

135
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:35,973
I received

136
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:37,053
a mission.

137
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:39,173
They said you're utterly wicked

138
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,293
and wanted you dead.

139
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:43,653
How...

140
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:45,053
How much did they offer

141
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,733
to make you hunt me?

142
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,372
Twenty thousand?

143
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:58,452
No way.

144
00:07:58,733 --> 00:07:59,733
It must be 200,000.

145
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:02,773
Two liang.

146
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:12,413
What's that?

147
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:13,733
Here's ten liang.

148
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,012
Spare me.

149
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:17,932
Take me to your employer.

150
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,012
And it's yours.

151
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:19,812
Deal.

152
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,132
A real man knows

153
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,053
when to yield.

154
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,132
(He's so desperate?)

155
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:39,773
What's wrong?

156
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,773
Who issued Gu Qianfu the murder order?

157
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,612
I gave Gu Qianfu the order.

158
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,612
My superior wanted him dead.

159
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,493
Take me to your superior.

160
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:49,972
Let me finish my business.

161
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:51,413
And I'll take you to Ms. Li

162
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:52,812
from the village.

163
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,413
I'm Ms. Li. What's wrong?

164
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,053
You wanted Xue Hexu dead?

165
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,212
Xue Hexu?

166
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,293
No idea.

167
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:03,852
Good heavens.

168
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,413
I just do laundry and cooking.

169
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:07,572
How could I kill anyone?

170
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:11,413
But distributing missions
earns commissions.

171
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,612
My contact is Mr. Wang

172
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:14,932
from the next village.

173
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,533
I don't know who wants Xue Hexu dead.

174
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,373
I just received the mission

175
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,972
from the Broadsword Sect disciple

176
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,413
Liu Xiaodan.

177
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:27,493
We don't have fixed wages

178
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,493
and earn commissions.

179
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:30,972
This month,

180
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,212
with no leads
on the former Crown Prince,

181
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:34,773
I'm penniless.

182
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,212
So I had to take odd jobs.

183
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:40,413
In short,

184
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,133
I've tracked down

185
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,293
the mission originator.

186
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:47,373
Broadsword Sect's Liu Xiaodan.

187
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:48,533
Ask him

188
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:49,612
whatever you want.

189
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,424
(Tomb of Liu Xiaodan,
Disciple of Broadsword Sect)

190
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,893
Gu Qianfu, how dare you tease me?

191
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,264
How would I know that

192
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:00,932
Liu Xiaodan

193
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,092
would die in a mission?

194
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,612
I did my best.

195
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:07,212
How do we question

196
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:07,852
a dead guy?

197
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,852
Need a psychic?

198
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:19,773
Business is tough.

199
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:21,332
More skills never hurt.

200
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,092
We still don't know who wants me dead.

201
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:29,932
But at least, we paid Gu Qianfu

202
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:30,732
to spare my life.

203
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:32,133
You can be at ease.

204
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:33,092
You fool.

205
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:34,493
At this point,

206
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:35,932
we need another approach.

207
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:39,173
You're terrified

208
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:39,972
I'd die?

209
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:45,133
Pressing matters await. Come.

210
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,092
(He...)

211
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,852
He is the former Crown Prince?

212
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,773
Days ago, I found his portrait.

213
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:05,732
Let's find him and hand him

214
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:06,893
over.

215
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:09,092
(No way.)

216
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:10,572
(It can't be him.)

217
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,212
(How could it be him?)

218
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:16,253
You know this man?

219
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:17,852
No.

220
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:24,852
No, I don't.

221
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,893
(Xue Hexu)

222
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,092
(is hiding something from me.)

223
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:42,653
It's him?

224
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:44,932
He's the former Crown Prince!

225
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:51,812
(Two years ago)

226
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:52,253
Father.

227
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,253
Look.

228
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:55,812
There's something odd.

229
00:11:56,972 --> 00:11:57,932
Something is sent south

230
00:11:58,253 --> 00:11:59,812
in the first month every year.

231
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:01,092
Sometimes money,

232
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,133
sometimes textiles,

233
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:03,133
sometimes rice.

234
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:05,893
At market prices, it's always 500 taels,

235
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,852
which is enough to sustain

236
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:09,732
any commoner for 20 years.

237
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:11,293
Hexu.

238
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:13,812
I'm providing

239
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:17,133
for my former subordinates
who fought for our nation.

240
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:19,173
Forget about it.

241
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,653
We can't spare this expenditure.

242
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:24,373
Alright.

243
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,612
You spend money and effort

244
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,852
on some illegitimate child,

245
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,373
while neglecting your own children.

246
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:38,373
Have you lost your mind?

247
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,212
Mother.

248
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,013
Back then, we had no choice

249
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:43,293
but to make such a decision.

250
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:46,612
After all these years,
many things can't be undone.

251
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,293
Now we must see this through to the end.

252
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:50,332
You...

253
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,522
(Xue Mansion)

254
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:18,496
(Nanwu Town)

255
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,452
Try this, sir.

256
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:22,533
Try it.

257
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,013
(Nanwu Dock)
Fresh cucumbers, crisp and juicy.

258
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:24,852
Try some.

259
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,253
Try some, sir.

260
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,612
Crisp and fresh. Try one.

261
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,332
He wanders around without purpose.

262
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,533
We can't do anything about him.

263
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:35,692
Master,

264
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:37,533
please help my useless son.

265
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:38,932
Please get up.

266
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:45,493
(Xue Youshou, Xue Mansion)

267
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,173
He's a good child.

268
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,293
But an evil spirit possessed him

269
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:50,692
and corrupted his soul.

270
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,452
Without immediate intervention,

271
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,653
disaster will surely follow.

272
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:58,293
Your entire clan could be doomed.

273
00:13:58,893 --> 00:13:59,452
Master,

274
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:00,612
so...

275
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,368
How can we exorcise the evil spirit?

276
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:05,773
How to avert this calamity?

277
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:07,653
My master cultivated for a millennium

278
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:10,612
to build this celestial tower

279
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,173
with boundless magic.

280
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,133
Celestial tower?

281
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:15,572
Where is it?

282
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:17,692
Far as the horizon,

283
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:20,812
near as your sight.

284
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,493
A millennium of cultivation

285
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:27,013
for such a small tower?

286
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:32,572
Mountains needn't be tall.
With immortals, they become holy.

287
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,413
Within this tower,

288
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,092
my master enshrines
the Ultra Supreme Elder Lord.

289
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:40,253
Master,

290
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:43,013
bury 100 liang of gold under this tree.

291
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,013
I'll perform rituals daily

292
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:46,893
for 49 days.

293
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:48,452
Golden pills will form.

294
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,692
All gold will be returned.

295
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,493
I'll keep none.

296
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,533
The pills will be yours.

297
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,852
One pill per day

298
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:57,773
for a month

299
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,013
should cure your son.

300
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:02,253
You charge nothing.

301
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:03,493
What a living Buddha.

302
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,572
I'll bury the gold now.

303
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:05,452
Hurry up.

304
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:06,152
Hurry.

305
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,013
My ritual connects

306
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:20,773
Heaven and Earth.

307
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,612
No observers are allowed.

308
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:23,493
Master,

309
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,053
please leave now.

310
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,572
Thank you, Master.

311
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:46,932
This Daoist priest didn't show

312
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,253
any signs of divine power.

313
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:50,092
Exactly.

314
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,332
Master resorted to this method

315
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,812
out of desperation.

316
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:57,013
He's full of mumbo jumbo.

317
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,092
Let's keep watch closely.

318
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:02,373
By the cosmic decree!

319
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:19,812
Thank you, Master.

320
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:36,893
Take care, sir.

321
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:37,612
Alright.

322
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:40,812
Mr. Xue.

323
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,413
Please come in.

324
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:52,084
(Nanwu Beauties)

325
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:54,173
Lan.

326
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:55,932
Let's begin.

327
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,053
You can enjoy music anywhere

328
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,692
with little money.

329
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,732
You don't have to come

330
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,132
and waste a fortune.

331
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,533
The music you play

332
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,172
is unparalleled.

333
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:12,693
Even the magistrate
begged for three months

334
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,372
and still couldn't meet you.

335
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,852
Naturally,

336
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,652
you outrank the magistrate.

337

Get lost.

347
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:31,092
Who are you?

348
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:33,288
My surname is Xue.

349
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:35,293
Lord Dingyuan

350
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:36,773
is my father.

351
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:22,733
Xue Youshou.

352
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,172
Pay your rent.

353
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,412
Two liang. It's been half a year.

354
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:32,213
Enough with your tricks.

355
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,213
Pay today or get out.

356
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:40,293
There you go.

357
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,572
Your impressive demeanor

358
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:43,812
really brings honor

359
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,852
to our humble establishment.

360
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:47,213
Come on.

361
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,213
Hurry.

362
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:49,132
Please sit.

363
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:49,852
Here.

364
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,892
Get him some new bedding

365
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:54,693
and a tea set.

366
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:55,733
Keep the rest.

367
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:57,213
Alright.

368
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,013
I always knew Xue Youshou was blessed.

369
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,693
I'll work on it now.

370
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,412
You had 100 liang of gold,

371
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,572
but can't pay two liang of silver?

372
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:13,812
You followed me?

373
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,973
Let me pay the rent for you.

374
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,053
So unnecessary.

375
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,213
Lord Dingyuan Xue Fugui

376
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,132
is your father?

377
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,412
Did he tell you that?

378
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:32,293
No, he didn't.

379
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:33,612
I found out.

380
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:35,773
You

381
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,693
were born to his concubine?

382
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:41,053
Concubine?

383
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:45,172
Concubine.

384
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,172
I don't deserve recognition.

385
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,733
Your mother is the legitimate wife?

386
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:02,412
I'm Xue Hexu.

387
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:03,453
Second in line.

388
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,768
I was born with
my twin sister Xue Nuannuan

389
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:07,688
on the fifth of the fifth month.

390
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,933
You seem about my age.

391
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:10,984
Your birthday?

392
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:14,216
The fifth of the fifth month?

393
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:17,332
We were

394
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:19,372
born on the same day?

395
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:24,812
That is

396
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:28,852
my birthday.

397
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,533
The same day.

398
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:34,253
He made them give birth

399
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:36,253
on the same day. What an animal.

400
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,053
Why are you here?

401
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,973
Not to arrest me, I hope?

402
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:43,612
No harm intended.

403
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,372
Hasn't Father

404
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:49,053
ever come looking for you?

405
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:50,013
No.

406
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:53,412
How cold-hearted.

407
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:56,493
He gives you 500 liang yearly,

408
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:58,973
yet you live like this?

409
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,773
I was exiled at seven.

410
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:03,372
I was too young

411
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,652
to manage finances.

412
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:07,933
He sent money to a former subordinate.

413
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:09,213
But

414
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,132
he kept it all.

415
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:15,372
I couldn't even keep day-old bread,

416
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,572
let alone have tasty pickles.

417
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:19,053
I was eight

418
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:21,332
when I started roaming the streets.

419
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:24,572
Meanwhile,

420
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:27,253
they've been leading a wealthy

421
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:28,892
and luxurious life.

422
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:31,172
For real?

423
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:35,240
I'll get your money back.

424
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:37,372
No need.

425
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:40,053
I don't want to

426
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,693
burden your Xue family.

427
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:43,693
Perhaps this is

428
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:46,132
heaven's punishment for me.

429
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:49,092
Why

430
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,533
are you here exactly?

431
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:52,773
To check on you.

432
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,852
That jade pendant

433
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,053
looks nice.

434
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,253
It says "Qinghe" on it.

435
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,412
There must be another piece

436
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:08,493
marked "Zhengming"?

437
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:13,933
This is

438
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,293
the only thing my mother left me.

439
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,612
It should be treasured.

440
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:23,053
Yet I shattered it by mistake.

441
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:25,453
But it does have

442
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,053
the "Zhengming" on it.

443
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:36,652
What a pity.

444
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:37,933
It's broken.

445
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:40,013
But it's pretty.

446
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:46,092
