I, Feng Zuoren...

Long live Your Majesty!

22
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:57,035
Rise.

23
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:02,994
The jade pendant.

24
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:11,395
I want

25
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:14,074
to say something.

26
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:15,234
Go ahead.

27
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:21,835
Do you find

28
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,794
this jade pendant familiar?

29
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:29,434
The late Emperor gave one to you

30
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:31,794
and one to me.

31
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:34,395
Yours wrote 'Virtuous'.

32
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,674
While mine wrote 'Integrity'.

33
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:49,714
You are...

34
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,234
I am your brother,

35
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:53,555
Jia Xun.

36
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:16,915
Father.

37
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:18,915
You lie gravely ill,

38
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,635
yet the Crown Prince Jia Xun

39
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,835
can't even attend to you.

40
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:28,475
Such a nation's heir

41
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:30,115
lacks virtue.

42
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:34,995
For the sake of Hua,

43
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:38,035
I implore you

44
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,154
to appoint a capable heir.

45
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:49,915
Father, look!

46
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:12,954
I... grant it.

47
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:16,594
Promise me

48
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:21,874
to treat your brother well.

49
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:28,755
Father.

50
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,434
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees.

51
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,195
My son Jia Ji

52
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:49,394
possesses exceptional wisdom
and virtuous humility,

53
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,314
with noble character and talent.

54
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:53,955
He is hereby titled Crown Prince,

55
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:55,675
so decreed.

56
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:00,114
Thank you, Father.

57
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:02,594
I shall live up to your expectation.

58
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:42,675
I've exhausted my entire life

59
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,114
for this throne.

60
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:48,994
Yet in the end,

61
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:51,475
everything

62
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,915
proves meaningless.

63
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,475
Are you here to seize the throne?

64
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:10,114
I can't let you succeed.

65
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,594
I beg you

66
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,635
to spare the Xue family.

67
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,235
What gives you the right

68
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:20,834
to bargain with me?

69
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,035
This throne is mine!

70
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,475
Even after my passing,

71
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,594
it shall remain with my heir,

72
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:28,075
the current Crown Prince.

73
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:29,755
The Xue family

74
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:32,075
harbors you, a former dynasty traitor!

75
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,314
All of you must die!

76
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:37,714
If you agree

77
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:39,554
to spare my family,

78
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:41,314
I vow to you

79
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,795
to leave Hua's borders with them,

80
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:46,195
and never return.

81
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,515
But if you remain stubborn,

82
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,035
refusing to spare them,

83
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:52,515
I have my ways

84
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:53,994
to achieve my goal.

85
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,154
You're threatening me?

86
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:09,635
Do not presume I am blind

87
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,035
to your countless deceptions

88
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:13,314
with Feng Zuoren!

89
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,675
I won't believe

90
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:16,274
a single word from you.

91
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:18,235
In the end,

92
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,714
you'd still come
to steal my son's throne.

93
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,195
Is it that difficult?

94
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:36,554
Let me tell you.

95
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,955
The Mandate of Heaven

96
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:39,355
shifts to the virtuous ruler.

97
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:40,795
Like Yao, Shun, and Yu.

98
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,195
Make your choice aligned
with Mandate of Heaven.

99
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:44,874
Right?

100
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:48,795
Call you Your Majesty one last time.

101
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:50,874
Abdicate to me

102
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,274
and I'll ensure
the Crown Prince's peaceful life.

103
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:55,915
Guards!

104
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:57,795
Seize them!

105
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:02,834
They've bribed them.

106
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:05,795
Even the guards recognize

107
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:08,394
the throne won't be yours anymore.

108
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:10,515
Capture them three

109
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:14,594
and kill them.

110
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,515
Wait, Xue Guardians are all in trouble.

111
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:21,515
Want to summon them?

112
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:22,795
No one would come.

113
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:23,635
Get them!

114
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,314
All of you, stop!

115
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,394
Come on, hurry!

116
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,154
Hurry! Come on!

117
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:37,834
Come on.

118
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:38,954
Come on.

119
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:41,315
What are you doing?

120
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,555
Capture them.

121
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:45,514
Feng Zuoren,

122
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,594
escort His Majesty to safety first.

123
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:50,875
The Crown Prince is still here.

124
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:52,795
You escort His Majesty out.

125
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:54,035
I'll get him.

126
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:55,555
Go!

127
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:00,555
Wait, what's wrong?

128
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,154
I haven't finished. Why leaving?

129
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:06,754
After them.

130
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:08,795
He said the Crown Prince
is in the palace.

131
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:10,194
Come on.

132
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:11,355
You, chase the Emperor.

133
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,795
The rest, the Crown Prince.

134
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:13,594
- Yes.
- Yes.

135
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:38,915
Having pretended
as Crown Prince for years,

136
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:45,315
now, I shall become the true Emperor!

137
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:57,514
Stop that.

138
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,514
Go get the Crown Prince.

139
00:09:58,594 --> 00:09:59,514
Why daydreaming here?

140
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:00,355
Let's go!

141
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:03,035
Hyah.

142
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:04,235
Hyah.

143
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:07,154
Hyah.

144
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:08,594
- Hyah.
- Hyah.

145
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:09,675
Hyah.

146
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,274
Hyah.

147
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:14,995
- Hyah.
- Hyah.

148
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:34,555
Hyah.

149
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:35,235
Hyah.

150
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:40,995
Whoa.

151
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:41,714
Whoa.

152
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,675
Leave him, and I'll show some mercy.

153
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:45,634
Miss Feng,

154
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,074
I'm scared.

155
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:52,394
Don't be scared.

156
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,115
I swear I'll

157
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,675
safely deliver you to His Majesty.

158
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,576
Close your eyes.

159
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:24,168
Your Majesty,

160
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:25,315
hide there.

161
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:26,355
I'll divert them.

162
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:27,555
Be careful.

163
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,514
Keep alive.

164
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,274
Alright.

165
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,355
Hurry.

166
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:31,915
Come on.

167
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:33,074
Hurry!

168
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:33,995
Hurry!

169
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:37,274
Get down.

170
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:40,875
They're running fast!

171
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:42,714
Where are they?

172
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:43,435
I'm exhausted.

173
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:46,274
How can we catch up?

174
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:47,816
Check there.

175
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:51,355
Your Majesty, I'm here to protect you!

176
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:51,995
Chase him!

177
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:52,795
- Go! There.
- Go! There.

178
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,475
- Go!
- There.

179
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,274
Drop the act.

180
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:20,634
There's no one around now.

181
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,475
You can...

182
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,754
Reinforcements are coming.

183
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:30,315
They won't escape.

184
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,514
Let's search.

185
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:33,795
Check there.

186
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:08,555
Your Majesty!

187
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,714
I'm here to protect you!

188
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,235
This won't work.

189
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:24,394
Reinforcements are coming.

190
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:30,514
Take off

191
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:31,714
your robe.

192
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:40,235
You've finally shown your true colors.

193
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:41,475
Right.

194
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,555
At lease, you could wear it

195
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:47,915
before death.

196
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:09,154
Wait here.

197
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,035
Mr. Gu will come to join you.

198
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,954
To you, this robe represents

199
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:18,995
your lifelong pursuit of power.

200
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:20,915
To me,

201
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,634
it's mere a flashy burden.

202
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:35,235
There! The Emperor went that way!

203
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:36,514
After him!

204
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:38,184
Whoever captures Emperor Jia alive

205
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:39,795
will be promoted as General.

206
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,675
Don't kill me.

207
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,675
Don't kill me.

208
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:42,754
Don't kill me.

209
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:43,954
Don't kill me.

210
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,154
Don't kill me!

211
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,035
I'll grant you thousands of gold

212
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,435
and a thousand cities!

213
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:10,834
Sorry for coming late.

214
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:11,944
Your Majesty,

215
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:13,355
please have them.

216
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:39,675
This is heavenly auspice.

217
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:43,194
Hurry!

218
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:05,315
You old man.

219
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,235
Treacherous man!

220
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,235
Try to manipulate the Emperor
and control the nation?

221
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:10,954
Today,

222
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,514
I shall kill treacherous ministers

223
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:15,355
to uphold justice!

224
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,154
Are you addressing me?

225
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:20,714
You harbored
the former Crown Prince years ago,

226
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,394
and now you've secretly
ordered border troops back.

227
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,555
It's you plotting rebellion!

228
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:36,315
Heaven has warned you.

229
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,355
Surrender now!

230
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,520
Grand Tutor Zhou,

231
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,544
our soldiers

232
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:43,074
went to the Emperor Jia and his son.

233
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:43,954
What to do?

234
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:47,795
We have no choice.

235
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:49,115
Seize him!

236
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:52,675
Xue Fugui.

237
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,754
I bet you won't abandon your own son.

238
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:57,915
All soldiers, heed the order!

239
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:58,555
- Yes!
- Yes!

240
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:00,115
The Emperor's command!

241
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:01,274
- We shall obey
- We shall obey

242
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:02,315
- and execute!
- and execute!

243
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,274
Don't blame me,

244
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,035
but your father.

245
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,075
Ungrateful son, come here!

246
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,154
Know why the late Emperor

247
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,514
made me Lord Dingyuan?

248
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:38,874
From General Chen Tang's memorial

249
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,754
to Emperor Yuan of Han.

250
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,435
Those who dare challenge Han,

251
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:46,274
will be perished!

252
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:48,754
Take them away,

253
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:50,915
awaiting His Majesty's judgment.

254
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:51,474
- Yes!
- Yes!

255
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:24,514
Feng.

256
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:25,835
You're okay.

257
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:27,234
Had I arrived later,

258
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:28,555
you'd not be okay.

259
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:36,835
You traitors.

260
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:38,315
Die!

261
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:47,795
Impressive!

262
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:55,675
Look out.

263
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:15,715
Father!

264
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,788
Taking the Crown Prince down with me

265
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:23,874
is a good end.

266
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:34,994
Ridiculous!

267
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,435
Want to die with His Highness?

268
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:40,315
Your Majesty.

269
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,474
I've safely delivered

270
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:43,675
His Highness to you.

271
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:45,754
Really?

272
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,354
Are you that kind?

273
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,715
I won't trust

274
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:54,915
any of you.

275
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:57,634
Killing me and my son

276
00:19:58,514 --> 00:19:59,274
would grant you

277
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,075
the nation.

278
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:08,648
Your Majesty,

279
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:10,675
we risked our lives

280
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:12,274
protecting you.

281
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:13,595
Hope you feel our loyalty.

282
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:17,035
Fear not.

283
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:18,114
Go.

284
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:21,715
Father.

285
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:24,435
Why does he wear the imperial robe?

286
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:37,555
Your Majesty,

287
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:40,474
let bygones be bygones.

288
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,955
I beg you return to the palace

289
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,114
to govern for the people.

290
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,795
I am terminally ill,

291
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,474
and my son is young.

292
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,955
I have no one to trust.

293
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:20,915
Jia Xun,

294
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:22,595
if I want you

295
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,555
to help govern the nation,

296
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,234
after my passing,

297
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,915
you can ascend the throne.

298
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:30,835
Okay?

299
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:33,154
I only ask one thing.

300
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,675
Spare my son,

301
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:39,595
your nephew.

302
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:48,595
Your Majesty,

303
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,555
I don't know Jia Xun,

304
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,394
but Xue Hexu.

305
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:56,234
The Crown Prince shall reign,

306
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:58,035
and none shall harm him.

307
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,555
Your Majesty,

308
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:03,754
consider the Xue family's loyalty,

309
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:04,915
please spare them.

310
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:07,154
To keep my life,

311
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,715
it costs too many innocent lives

312
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,114
and troubles you.

313
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:14,955
We all pay the price

314
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,114
for our decision.

315
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,075
Your Majesty,

316
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:20,035
let the tragedy

317
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,195
end here.

318
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:47,795
Hexu.

319
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:52,394
I don't think he'll come with me.

320
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,075
He hates me.

321
00:22:58,435 --> 00:22:58,874
Father.

322
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:01,675
This is your chance for redemption.

323
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:02,955
Don't run.

324
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:34,354
Lord Dingyuan.

325
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:37,634
Why would someone noble like you
to come here?

326
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:39,835
Youshou.

327
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,195
I'm here to take you home.

328
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,195
His Majesty has spared you.

329
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:49,435
Would he be that kind?

330
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:53,234
I know.

331
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:56,754
You're here to execute me.

332
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,354
You'll kill me yourself.

333
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:07,315
You'll personally eliminate me,
such a traitor.

334
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:10,394
Fine.

335
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:12,915
What a loyal lord!

336
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,274
Youshou.

337
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,634
All these years,

338
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,555
I've failed you.

339
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:29,754
I was wrong.

340
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,114
How could you ever be wrong?

341
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:38,754
You're always right.

342
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:42,715
Everything you did was right.

343
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:45,955
You're right to abandon me

344
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,075
and choose him.

345
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,075
You are loyal and righteous.

346
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,474
You're the nation's pillar.

347
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:00,595
Youshou.

348
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,715
I was really wrong.

349
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:08,274
I shouldn't have sacrificed you,

350
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,394
