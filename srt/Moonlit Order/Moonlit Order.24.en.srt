We mistreated you.

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,492
Welcome back.

27
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:44,212
I won't let you suffer
any more hardships.

28
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:10,412
Come home with me.

29
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:13,333
Alright.

30
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:16,692
Buddy.

31
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:17,932
Buddy.

32
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:19,893
How much do you make?

33
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:21,373
I'll double it.

34
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:22,492
Let me out.

00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:25,533

Buddy.

37
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:32,052
How much do you make?

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,292
I'll triple it.

39
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,093
I'm the Grand Tutor.

40
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:36,492
I'm Grand Tutor Zhou.

41
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,373
I own countless mansions.

42
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:39,533
Pick one to live in.

43
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:40,492
Be my confidant.

44
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,132
You're getting executed this autumn.

45
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:43,613
Still acting all high and mighty?

46
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:47,173
Grand Tutor.

47
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:51,973
Qianfu.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,212
Qianfu!

49
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:54,613
Qianfu.

50
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,173
Qianfu.

51
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:56,973
Grand Tutor.

52
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,373
I knew you'd come.

53
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,373
You've suffered.

54
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,772
I'm sure you know

55
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,333
what I did at the court was just an act.

56
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:04,253
You've always

57
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:05,733
treated me like your own

58
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:06,453
over the years.

59
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:07,692
How could I betray you?

60
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:10,333
I've devised an escape plan.

61
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:11,333
Unfortunately,

62
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:13,013
we two can't manage alone.

63
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,733
I need some money to pay off

64
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,173
the guards.

65
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,213
Makes sense.

66
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,653
That's easy.

67
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,132
Here's 3,000 liang.

68
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:39,372
I know it's not much.

69
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,692
Here's the key to my treasury,

70
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:54,213
which is more loaded
than the national treasury.

71
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:55,653
Take it.

72
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:56,933
Bribe whoever you need.

73
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:02,852
Qianfu.

74
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:04,333
Don't just

75
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:06,132
rely on bribes.

76
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:09,213
Learn seduction tactics.

77
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:11,493
What?

78
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:13,972
Seduction.

79
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:15,692
What?

80
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:16,812
Seduction.

81
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:18,173
Seduction?

82
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:29,972
(List)

83
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,453
Here are all my concubines'
portraits and deeds.

84
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,292
Take it all.

85
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:35,933
Use them as needed.

86
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:40,893
Got it.

87
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:52,092
Grand Tutor.

88
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:54,653
What is it, Qianfu?

89
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,773
Call me by my full name.

90
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,092
Gu Qianfu.

91
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,453
Fine, Gu Qianfu.

92
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:02,613
What's wrong?

93
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:06,572
Don't you

94
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:10,213
owe me 3,000 liang pension?

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,490
What do you mean?

96
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:24,252
Qianfu.

97
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:26,773
You should've told me to step aside.

98
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:28,333
Now that the door is open,

99
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:29,893
just get me out.

100
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:40,733
Let's go, Qianfu.

101
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:44,292
What now, Qianfu?

102
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:48,773
What are you doing, Qianfu?

103
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:54,773
What am I doing?

104
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:57,053
Repaying debts

105
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:59,092
- Qianfu.
- is only right.

106
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,013
Murder and arson.

107
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:02,773
- Flipping truths to lies.
- What's wrong?

108
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:04,493
Committing every vice.

109
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:06,613
- You deserve this.
- Stop.

110
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:09,893
We always pay

111
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:11,733
for what we've done.

112
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:17,493
Qianfu.

113
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:19,453
Oh, right.

114
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:21,213
Nobody has used

115
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,733
so many idioms nonstop, huh?

116
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:24,613
I'm an educated man.

117
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,252
How was my acting, Mr. Gu?

118
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:32,488
Almost matched mine.

119
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:35,213
Transfer illicit funds
to the national treasury.

120
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:37,692
Release his innocent family members.

121
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:38,453
Yes.

122
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:41,213
Grand Tutor.

123
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:42,933
Take care.

124
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,613
Gu Qianfu. Mr. Gu.

125
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:47,972
My hero. My warrior.

126
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,572
Spare me.

127
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,132
A life spent groveling in the dirt.

128
00:07:54,893 --> 00:08:00,333
And it all comes to dust.

129
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,933
We went through some disturbances.

130
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,013
Thanks to Miss Feng,

131
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:20,333
Mr. Gu,

132
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,053
my brother Jia Xun,

133
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:24,053
and all esteemed ministers,

134
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,933
the disturbances have now been quelled.

135
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:31,933
So he's the real Prince Jia Xun.

136
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,013
That's right.

137
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:36,333
My long-lost brother Jia Xun

138
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:37,453
has returned.

139
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,853
I hereby appoint Jia Xun
as Grand Mentor to the Crown Prince

140
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,293
and Regent

141
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,533
to guide the Crown Prince's education.

142
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:48,893
Yes, Your Majesty.

143
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:49,853
My gratitude.

144
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,413
Miss Feng protected me

145
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:58,453
and shall be promoted to Commander
of the Imperial Guard.

146
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,453
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,213
Mr. Gu saved me

148
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,572
and shall be promoted
to Chief of the Jing'an Bureau

149
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,213
to monitor all officials.

150
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:14,533
Thank you, Your Majesty.

151
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,132
The rest of you shall receive
three years' extra wage.

152
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,893
May you all fulfill
your duties diligently

153
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,653
and restore integrity
to the imperial court.

154
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:29,973
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

155
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:35,812
Jia Xun.

156
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:37,973
Now, shouldn't you

157
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,093
address me as Brother?

158
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:41,973
Brother.

159
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:50,533
Brother.

160
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,213
Can I make a request?

161
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:04,172
Men should prioritize their careers.

162
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:06,853
Your foremost duty now

163
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,492
is to guide the Crown Prince.

164
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:12,333
Other matters

165
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:15,973
will be arranged in due time.

166
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:20,893
Court dismissed.

167
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,812
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

168
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,200
Scholars, farmers,
artisans, and merchants.

169
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:41,416
Throughout history,

170
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:43,973
merchants are always ranked last.

171
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:45,252
People don't see

172
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,492
that harnessing capital properly

173
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,093
can boost agriculture

174
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,812
and strengthen the nation.

175
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,052
Grand Mentor,

176
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:54,612
how would breaking the boundaries

177
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:58,052
between these professions
benefit our nation?

178
00:10:59,132 --> 00:10:59,653
Well...

179
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:03,773
Which current predicaments
could be resolved?

180
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:06,413
How much money could it

181
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,252
offer to the national treasury

182
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:09,853
every year?

183
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:13,213
Money-wise...

184
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:14,172
It's fine.

185
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,692
You may ponder this carefully.

186
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:17,612
It happens

187
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:18,812
that you haven't

188
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,612
handed in your memorials
to Father, right?

189
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:25,692
I find this proposal excellent.

190
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:28,293
Your vision surpasses ordinary men.

191
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:29,932
It's truly remarkable.

192
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,013
Thank you, Your Highness.

193
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:37,768
(Administrative Office)

196
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,213
You can stay.

197

27.

198
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:22,932
Me?

199
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:24,612
Stay?

200
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:32,893
Mr. Gu.

201
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,172
Mr. Gu.

202
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,692

204
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,052
Play with this.

205
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:42,932
Nothing else.

206
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:45,453
Like this?

207
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,893
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:49,293
Let me try again.

209
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:50,013
Not bad.

210
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:51,172
Hold them together.

211
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,052
Just hold it like this.

212
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:57,013
Hold it steady.

213
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:57,533
Here.

214
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,013
Okay.

215
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:58,492
Look.

216
00:12:58,533 --> 00:12:59,372
Fold it in half.

217
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,132
- Pinch here.
- Fold.

218
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:02,413
Harder.

219
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:07,572
Where's my wife?

220
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:09,172
Jiaoqian?

221
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,732
She went to get the leek filling.

222
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,612
Father, look.

223
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:16,773
Did I wrap this well?

224
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,252
Not bad.

225
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:22,132
How's mine?

226
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,572
Make sure it's sealed tightly.

227
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:26,973
Don't mess with my dumplings.

228
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:41,812
From now on,

229
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,172
this is your home.

230
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:44,893
You're in charge.

231
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,052
(Ledger)
Take over these ledgers.

232
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:50,932
It's our collective decision.

233
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:52,572
It's your home.

234
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:54,172
Take care of it.

235
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:58,453
It's our home.

236
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,812
We never intended

237
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,372
to switch identities.

238
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:07,773
We are even.

239
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:10,453
Do you mean that?

240
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:18,013
Let's be honest here.

241
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,692
Feng Zuoren is quite remarkable.

242
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,093
She's skilled in martial arts,

243
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,492
and beautiful...

244
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,072
Let's say her martial arts.

245
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:29,372
Don't get cheeky with

246
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:30,732
your older brother's wife.

247
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,533
Am I not older than you?

248
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,853
We need to clarify this.

249
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,093
Who is older?

250
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,853
I'm the elder. You're the kid here.

251
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,372
Why aren't you the kid?

252
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:42,333
Why am I the kid?

253
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,492
No way.

254
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:44,252
Forget it.

255
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:44,732
Here.

256
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:45,692
I can't read them.

257
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:46,492
Yes, you can.

258
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,492
I can't.

259
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,692
You're knowledgeable.

260
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:50,213
You got this.

261
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:56,840
(Ten Years Later)

262
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,420
(As the Emperor passed away,
the nation mourned in white garments)

263
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,579
(The Crown Prince ascended the throne,
granting amnesty to all)

264
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,213
By decree of Heaven,

265
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,052
His Majesty proclaims.

266
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:15,572
We shall build a prosperous era
with our people.

267
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:16,492
Promote...

268
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,932
Promote the royal family's legacy.

269
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,252
Pray for favorable weather

270
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:25,732
and peace across the land.

271
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,612
Xue Hexu is hereby appointed
Supreme Regent,

272
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,013
Grand Tutor,

273
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,732
and Duke of the Nation.

274
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,533
So decreed.

275
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,692
Thank you, Your Majesty.

276
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:45,052
But I have one more request

277
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:46,572
to make.

278
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,252
Men should prioritize their careers.

279
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,413
For now, focus on the reform

280
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,692
of the social classes.

281
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,692
Other matters
will be arranged in due time.

282
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:01,288
Court dismissed.

283
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,413
- We thank Your Majesty.
- We thank Your Majesty.

284
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,252
That sounds familiar.

285
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,372
It's been a million years.

286
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:17,572
When will you finally

287
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,172
let me marry Feng Zuoren?

288
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,172
Like father, like son.

289
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:27,812
(They say the same thing.)

290
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:29,653
(I can't keep)

291
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:31,492
(waiting passively forever.)

292
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:40,052
What's this?

293
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:41,768
(How Do Nobles Marry Secretly
Without Imperial Approval?)

294
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:43,293
Nothing.

It's been ten years.

298
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,332
We're still not married.

299
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:14,573
I don't mind.

300
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:17,293
But I do.

301
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:21,653
Let's go somewhere.

302
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,013
Where are we going?

303
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:32,252
Almost there.

304
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:36,732
Ready?

305
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:40,092
Three.

306
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:41,612
Two.

307
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,092
One.

308
