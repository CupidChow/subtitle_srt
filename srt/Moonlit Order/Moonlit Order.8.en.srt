=Episode 8=

20
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,043
Come on, Ms. Wang.

21
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:53,644
We've been waiting.

22
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:55,043
Sit.

23
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:06,803
Ms. Wang has been with us
for some time now.

24
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:09,843
I may be old, but I'm not blind.

25
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,604
I believe

26
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:15,764
she can no longer continue like this.

27
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:17,843
I hereby declare

28
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:19,324
that starting today,

29
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:23,788
Ms. Wang will formally
take over all household affairs.

30
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:26,709
Let's begin with managing the accounts.

31
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,109
(Alright.)

32
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,908
(If they are hiding
the former Crown Prince,)

33
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,269
(there will be expenses.)

34
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,068
(I can audit the accounts)

35
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,149
(and find clues.)

36
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,269
I disagree.

37
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,149
Managing accounts isn't that simple.

38
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:50,269
If her calculations are wrong,

39
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:52,508
we will fall into chaos.

40
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:53,829
That's easy.

41
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:56,269
Just test her abilities.

42
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:58,748
Tell me.

43
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,508
Two thousand nine hundred sixty-eight

44
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:04,628
multiplied by

45
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,228
four hundred fifty-six

46
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:06,829
equals?

47
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,109
One million three hundred
fifty-three thousand four hundred eight.

48
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:18,269
One million three hundred
fifty-three thousand four hundred...

49
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:20,748
Correct.

50
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:29,068
Thirteen thousand
six hundred eighty-nine

51
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,029
divided by thirty-nine equals?

52
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:32,468
Three hundred fifty-one.

53
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:37,508
Correct again.

54
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,228
That's right.

55
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:42,748
We verified it yesterday.

56
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,149
It was 351.

57
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,908
She did it even without an abacus.

58
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:50,989
(Xue Guardians can handle math.)

59
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:56,709
Ms. Wang has such math skills.

60
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,628
What a blessing for the Xue family.

61
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:02,149
Jiaoqian.

62
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:03,549
We can't let

63
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,029
her rare skill go to waste.

64
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:06,429
Ms. Wang.

65
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,589
Hexu has been managing the accounts.

66
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,709
If you have any questions,

67
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:12,668
just ask him.

68
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:13,908
Understood.

69
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:20,629
You've repeatedly

70
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,228
protected our family members these days.

71
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:26,189
You're a good-hearted young woman.

72
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,389
I feel reassured to entrust

73
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,908
the household to you.

74
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,629
Thank you, Madam.

75
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,308
Honey, what's wrong?

76
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:54,908
Dongyang,

77
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,548
do you also agree
to let Stepmother take over?

78
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,189
She is a capable woman.

79
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,589
And she's been
holding our family together.

80
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,629
I don't see a problem here.

81
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,509
I see all kinds of problems.

82
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,468
You're just too innocent.

83
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,348
She's up to something.

84
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:15,308
You...

85
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:26,829
Grandmother,

86
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,149
I have a question.

87
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:32,189
Hexu was handling accounts
perfectly well.

88
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:35,108
Why did you suddenly
ask Stepmother to take over?

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,788
Hexu has always been narrow-minded

90
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,428
and opposed Ms. Wang at every turn.

91
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,788
He doesn't want her
to expand the family line.

92
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:47,589
What I mean is,

93
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:48,749
over these years,

94
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,788
Hexu has exhausted himself
for the Xue family.

95
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,788
Any children Ms. Wang bears

96
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,749
would naturally be the legitimate heirs.

97
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:59,629
Ms. Wang's position

98
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,149
should naturally precede Hexu's.

99
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,589
But Hexu is also a legitimate heir.

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,269
That's not what I meant.

101
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:10,668
I'm saying

102
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,269
the burden of account management

103
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,069
must eventually
be entrusted to your father's wife.

104
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:19,829
I see.

105
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,189
You saw Hexu burdened by this task.

106
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,029
So you made

107
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,108
Stepmother share his burden.

108
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:28,788
You're the best, Grandmother.

109
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:49,868
Shops.

110
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:51,108
Fields.

111
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,348
Workshops.

112
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:54,760
(Account Book)

113
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:57,108
Got it.

114
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,308
Look at this.

115
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,428
Xue Hexu really knows

116
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,428
how to scheme for money.

117
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:13,428
So sneaky...

118
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:15,829
Are you fine?

119
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:18,509
You were out all night.

120
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:19,709
I got worried.

121
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:21,189
Found the painting?

122
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:24,949
(Xue Hexu is full of tricks.)

123
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,788
(I can't tell him about the painting.)

124
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,108
I was worried that

125
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,908
the Grand Tutor might notice

126
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,069
and implicate you.

127
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:33,908
So I stayed out for hours

128
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,509
before returning.

129
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,149
How thoughtful of you.

130
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:40,389
It's fine.

131
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,308
We'll come up with

132
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:43,868
another plan.

133
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:45,868
Perhaps

134
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,468
I've caused too much trouble.

135
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,749
So, Grandmother let you

136
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,468
take over the account books.

137
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,788
Or maybe your grandmother thought

138
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,829
you'd been working too hard

139
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,228
and asked me to assist.

140
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:04,829
Of course.

141
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,428
It's possible that

142
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,749
she dislikes you.

143
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:14,908
You have family troubles,

144
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:16,509
while I have no family.

145
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,308
If anyone disrespects me,

146
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:20,829
I'll cut them down.

147
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,829
If they disrespect me,

148
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:24,908
I'll make them fear me.

149
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:29,428
It's fine.

150
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,588
I don't mind as long as you mean well

151
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:33,869
for the Xue family.

152
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,588
(Does he think I'm comforting him?)

153
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,029
(I'm not. I didn't.)

154
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:40,948
(No way.)

155
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:42,629
Alright.

156
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,428
Let me show you our shops.

157
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:52,808
(Xue Street)

158
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:54,229
The Xue Street

159
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,588
was funded and built
by my family years ago.

160
00:08:58,548 --> 00:08:59,509
The local government

161
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,068
wanted to thank us.

162
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,869
So they named it Xue Street. Right?

163
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,989
Not quite.

164
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:07,948
They wanted to thank us

165
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,308
and sent us a crate of farm eggs,

166
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,989
sacks of rice,

167
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,269
and rapeseed oil.

168
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,828
They even hired the best painter

169
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:14,989
to paint us at our house

170
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:16,989
and publish the painting

171
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,428
in the daily gazette.

172
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:19,588
However,

173
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,068
Grandfather rejected the idea

174
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,588
and insisted on naming it

175
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:23,708
Xue Street.

176
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,908
Your grandfather
was a true man of principle.

177
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:33,828
I'm from Swiftwind Security.

178
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:34,869
Should we deliver

179
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,029
the seafood shop's goods this afternoon?

180
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,308
That's right.

181
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:39,109
Understood.

182
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,229
(Escort Agency)

183
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:42,788
Their rent must be high.

184
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,828
You only see part of the picture.

185
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:47,749
The escort agency may seem
to occupy a large space.

186
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:48,469
But this is

187
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,788
necessary for logistics and storage.

188
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,389
They also keep the street safe

189
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,509
and transport things.

190
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,308
It's a win-win.

191
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,708
I see.

192
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:02,308
(Moonlit Luxury)

193
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,428
Can't even afford a bag!

194
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,068
Honey.

195
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:06,109
Honey.

196
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:26,948
Ms. Gui.

197
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,869
Run your business honestly,

198
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:30,869
or I'll raise your rent next month.

199
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,068
Are you raising my rent

200
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,428
because it's easy to bully a woman?

201
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,708
Why are you bullying her?

202
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,229
Madam.

203
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:45,989
When will the bag

204
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:46,989
be restocked?

205
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,629
That model is extremely popular.

206
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,308
Keep waiting.

207
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:52,828
Why did Mr. Wang's third concubine

208
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,068
get hers yesterday?

209
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,068
She also

210
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:58,188
purchased a coin purse,

211
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,109
water flask, watch, and bamboo hat

212
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,029
to get that bag.

213
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,788
Then

214
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,869
how much would it be?

215
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,428
Our customers

216
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,629
would never fuss over petty expenses.

217
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:11,029
After all, this bag

218
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:12,308
doesn't suit

219
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,149
those who don't have money.

220
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:14,668
You...

221
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:15,908
It was out of stock,

222
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:17,788
but you sold one to another lady.

223
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,989
Are you pulling some magic trick here?

224
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:28,788
You clearly have

225
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,308
many bags in stock.

226
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:32,948
Alright. This is a scam!

227
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:34,708
It's not a scam.

228
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,269
It's a bundle purchase.

229
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:37,828
Bundle purchase?

230
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,269
It means

231
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:42,389
she's forcing you to buy

232
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,149
these outdated trinkets

233
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:46,029
with the bag.

234
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,149
Ms. Gui.

235
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,068
I've told you many times

236
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:52,668
to run an honest business.

237
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,109
Raising your rent

238
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:55,269
was a warning.

239
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:56,548
But you don't change.

240
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,629
I'm revoking your shop lease.

241
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,068
Move out next month.

242
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,389
Just like that?

243
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,749
We signed a contract.

244
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,548
You break promises and jack up prices

245
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,349
on a whim!

246
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,509
Be the judge.

247
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,588
Let's report it.

248
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,109
What are you doing?

249
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,068
What...?

250
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:14,469
This is

251
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,749
the contract we signed.

252
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:17,989
It clearly states

253
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,349
that if you don't run

254
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:20,548
(Lease Contract)
an honest business,

255
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,428
(Lessor: Xue Fugui, Lessee: Gui Xiang)
I can reclaim the shop.

256
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,548
But you owe me tenfold the annual rent.

257
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:32,989
(Moonlit Luxury)

258
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:33,869
You let her off?

259
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,548
This much is enough.

260
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:36,629
She will learn.

261
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:38,509
Take it.

262
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:47,788
(He looks and sounds)

263
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:48,869
(like a brat,)

264
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,469
(but has decent character.)

265
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:53,668
(Wait.)

266
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,149
(Why am I praising him?)

267
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,368
(Administrative Office)

268
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,121
(Jing'an Bureau Procedures)

269
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:08,188
Thank you.

270
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,389
Thank you, my lord.

271
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:11,548
Next.

272
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:13,428
Mr. Gu.

273
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,109
Greetings.

274
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,029
Mr. Gu is here.

275
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,029
Let's see what 27 says.

276
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,469
What's your problem?

277
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:21,512
(9527)

278
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,109
27?

279
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:26,788
Mr. Gu.

280
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,629
Long time no see.

281
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,749
Got it.

282
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:43,464
(9527)

283
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:49,668
Here.

284
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:21,109
What?

285
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:25,109
It's your salary.

286
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:26,068
Whose?

287
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,109
Yours.

288
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:31,869
What?

289
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:33,349
It's your salary.

290
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:34,029
Whose?

291
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:34,869
Yours.

292
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:38,828
Stop kidding.

293
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:39,708
One wen?

294
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,109
Mr. Gu.

295
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:42,229
You know

296
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,229
you don't have a fixed wage.

297
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:46,788
You had no missions this month.

298
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,040
Hence,

299
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,149
the little pay.

300
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:52,629
I had no missions?

301
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:53,948
Didn't I follow

302
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,149
Xue Hexu and Feng Zuoren

303
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:55,869
for clues?

304
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,029
But you made no progress.

305
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:05,828
No progress?

306
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:08,908
So no payment?

307
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:10,548
Mr. Gu.

308
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,668
Don't make this hard for me.

309
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,708
Alright, 27.

310
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,588
Anyone here?

311
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,188
Is anybody here?

312
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:14,749
What are you doing?

313
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:16,668
Taking a dump.

314
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:17,509
Taking...

315
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,509
In the storage room?

316
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:21,948
None of your business.

317
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:23,588
What do you want?

318
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:33,428
I heard you offer

319
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:34,788
short-term employment

320
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,109
opportunities.

321
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:37,989
Yes.

322
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,989
Turn screws in the south.

323
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,548
Haul bricks in the north.

324
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:43,828
Harvest kidneys westward.

325
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:45,029
Take lives on the spot.

326
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:47,068
I have all kinds of great jobs here.

327
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,509
Pick one.

328
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:52,308
The one with
the highest reward, of course.

329
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:53,548
Alright.

330
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:57,269
A commission just came in today.

331
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,828
Urgent and important.

332
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:00,989
Are you willing to take a life?

333
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,548
Easy peasy.

334
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:03,269
How much?

335
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:04,509
Two liang.

336
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,108
A human life for just two liang?

337
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:09,108
Buddy,

338
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:11,229
the uphill climb
is always tough at first.

339
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,308
Will you do it?

340
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:15,909
Yes.

341
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,388
Such jobs are my specialty.

342
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:23,515
(Bounty Order No. 57)

343
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,348
(Xue Hexu?)

344
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:30,909
Just wait.

345
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:34,909
Don't poop here.

346
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:35,749
None of your business.

347
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:37,068
Why do you care?

348
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,904
(Xue Street)

349
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:53,308
I'd like to thank you.

350
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:56,068
You're a real go-getter,

351
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:57,749
but one word from others

352
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,308
could end your life.

353
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:01,308
Human life

354
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,909
is the most precious thing.

355
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,148
Only the living get to
experience good fortune.

356
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:08,108
From now on,

357
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:09,828
I'll investigate with you.

358
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,749
You apologized once
with the cherry blossom cake.

359
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,868
Now you're giving me more?

360
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:18,989
Why is that?

361
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:20,588
Shouldn't

362
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:21,749
young ladies all like

363
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,469
soft pink pastries?

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,628
Am I wrong?

365
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,669
I've lost my mind.

366
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,669
What was I even expecting?

367
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,229
Miss, Sir.

368
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:38,148
Check these fans.

369
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,388
Look at these exquisite paintings.

370
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,628
In broad daylight.

371
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:55,949
Stepson and stepmother.

372
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,029
That's Feng Zuoren we're talking about.

373
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:00,949
Xue Hexu,

374
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,709
you're so desperate.

375
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:06,909
No wonder someone wants you dead.

376
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,548
Utterly despicable.

377
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,509
Miss, this one suits you.

378
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:30,469
You like this fan?

379
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:31,108
I'll pay.

380
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,348
We're being followed.

381
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:39,189
Alright.

382
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,189
Today,

383
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,269
I'll enact heaven's justice

384
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,828
and take your life

385
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:49,348
and feed you to the dogs.

386
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,029
Let's go.

387
00:19:58,709 --> 00:19:59,189
Miss.

388
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:01,068
Take a look at this. It's lovely.

389
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,348
Two eggs. Two quail eggs.

390
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:09,469
Five wen. Pay up.

391
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,868
Two eggs. Two quail eggs.

392
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:13,669
Five wen?

393
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,588
I'll report you to the Market Office.

394
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:20,628
Not enough.

395
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:22,828
Crooked merchant.

396
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,548
You ruined my plan.

397
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,068
(What is this place?)

398
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,029
(Why did they come here sneakily?)

399
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:38,189
(Where are they?)

400
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:40,029
Gu Qianfu.

401
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:47,788
You're following me?

402
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:49,749
How dare you?

403
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:51,229
Following you?

404
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,429
You flatter yourself.

405
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,189
You're about to die.
Stop being so clingy.

406
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:18,509
Xue Hexu,

407
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:19,868
prepare to die.

408
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,669
(Gu Qianfu wants to kill Xue Hexu?)

409
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:26,509
(Wait.)

410
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,068
(Why should I save him?)

411
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:37,548
(I obtained
the former Crown Prince's portrait.)

412
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:40,388
(I shouldn't care if Xue Hexu dies.)

413
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:55,029
We have no feud.

414
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:56,628
Why do you want me dead?

415
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:01,509
Someone paid handsomely

416
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:03,628
for your head.

417
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:04,868
How much?

418
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:19,949
That's your question?

419
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:25,868
You work for the bounty

420
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:27,509
instead of following orders.

421
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:28,868
Who exactly

422
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:30,108
wants Xue Hexu dead?

423
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:33,348
(So nosy.)

424
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,029
(Get a taste of)

425
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,029
(your own Bone-Eroding Powder.)

426
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:38,828
What a nuisance.

427
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,469
You keep ruining my plans.

428
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:45,388
(Today I'll kill two birds
with one stone,)

429
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:47,548
(settling old and new grudges.)

430
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:50,588
Go.

431
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,669
Leave.

432
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:18,709
I'll let you lovebirds die together.

433
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:22,429
No.

434
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,269
No!

435
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,788
Xue Hexu.

436
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,909
So many people want you dead.

437
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:07,509
You must've committed countless evils

438
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:08,949
and deserve to die.

439
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,828
To think Feng Zuoren
will keep you company,

440
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:18,828
it's creeping me out.

441
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,308
I guess I rid the world

442
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,709
of evil.

443
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:27,709
First victory achieved.

444
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,429
I'll be rolling in riches from now on.

445
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:13,308
Wake up.

446
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:14,749
Wake up.

447
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,429
This pit's dark, damp,

448
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:27,669
and it's monsoon.

449
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,348
There's a faint miasma lingering.

450
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:32,828
We need to find a way out soon.

451
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:35,108
Or we'll die here.

452
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:52,189
I'm cold.

453
00:25:58,408 --> 00:25:59,148
I'm cold.

454
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:00,868
