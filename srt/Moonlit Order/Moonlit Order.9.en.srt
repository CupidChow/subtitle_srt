84
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:24,493

All the girls have been sold.

192
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:43,373
You're the only one left.

193
00:14:58,613 --> 00:14:59,572
Gentlemen.

194
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:00,453
What's wrong?

195
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:01,572
We're buying this girl.

196
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:03,812
What an honor.

197
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,572
Talk over here.

198
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:11,253
Name your price.

199
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,213
She's cheap.

200
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,052
Four wen.

201
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:18,093
Thank you, my lords.

202
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,453
Come on. I'll take you to swing.

203
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:09,292
Are you ready?

204
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:10,652
Here we go.

205
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:34,412
A kite.

206
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,133
A kite must fly

207
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:48,772
against the wind.

208
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,572
And no matter how high it flies,

209
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:53,133
I hold the string.

210
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,172
Unfortunately,

211
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:56,572
I can't go outside.

212
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,733
Why can't you go out?

213
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,493
Because

214
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:03,532
this is home.

215
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:05,653
The guards and my mother told me

216
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:07,372
that only home is safe.

217
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,048
(Feng)

218
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,332
Young Master.

219
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:40,092
Is my embroidery beautiful?

220
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,092
Yes, it is.

221
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:01,493
Young Master.

222
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,413
Didn't you say it's safe at home?

223
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,612
Why are bandits coming to kill us?

224
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:08,213
We've been betrayed.

225
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:09,532
Feng.

226
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,612
We can't trust anyone anymore.

227
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,973
Young master, I'm scared.

228
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,052
Bite my arm.

229
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,453
(Stay alive.)

230
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,013
Young master.

231
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:06,933
Young master.

232
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:09,572
Young master.

233
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,728
(Tomb of Young Master)

234
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:30,653
The dead can't return to life.

235
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:33,893
Do you know

236
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,772
why you lost him?

237
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:39,933
It's because

238
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,612
you weren't strong enough.

239
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:44,812
You must become the strongest

240
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,173
to avoid

241
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,852
being hurt.

242
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,332
Water only after training.

243
00:19:58,332 --> 00:19:58,933
The weak

244
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:01,253
don't deserve to live.

245
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:18,292
Thank you.

246
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:19,772
Hang in there.

247
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:32,612
This circle

248
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,893
is your arena.

249
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,052
Anyone who steps out

250
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:38,693
dies immediately.

251
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:40,612
Among you,

252
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,372
only the strongest one

253
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:43,933
will survive

254
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:46,372
and be my successor as the commander

255
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,812
of the Xue Guardians.

256
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:52,572
You'll no longer get beaten

257
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:53,772
like stray dogs,

258
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,572
beggars, or livestock.

259
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:57,772
You'll become

260
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,816
His Majesty's confidants.

261
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:32,292
Careful.

262
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:52,052
The two of you will fight to the death.

263
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:53,893
The winner

264
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:55,693
becomes the next commander.

265
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,653
The former commander is dead.

266
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:29,372
I am the new commander.

267
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:31,413
Heed my order.

268
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:33,572
End the internal battles.

269
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:34,973
Right now.

270
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,292
Violators will be

271
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:37,493
executed.

272
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:03,612
Thank you for clearing
all obstacles for me.

273
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:05,532
You should've died long ago.

274
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:33,332
Though His Majesty

275
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:34,693
rescued and cultivated me,

276
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:35,852
still,

277
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:40,013
I was betrayed by my sworn comrades.

278
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:42,772
Thus, I'll trust no one ever again.

279
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:44,973
I must grow strong

280
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:47,132
to avoid any harm.

281
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,532
It's a shame I can't repay

282
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:53,973
Young Master's kindness.

283
00:24:58,213 --> 00:24:58,933
He was kind.

284
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,413
But are you sure His Majesty...

285
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:06,893
Meant to cultivate you?

286
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:08,812
If he truly cared about you,

287
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:10,612
would he have let you

288
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:11,653
become ruthless

289
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:13,173
and devoid of emotion?

290
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:16,693
Without His Majesty,

291
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:18,772
I would have died.
