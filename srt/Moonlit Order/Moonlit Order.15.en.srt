=Episode 15=

19
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:49,891
How did you escape?

20
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,490
Even sect leaders...

21
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,130
Do you remember

22
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,251
how Gu Qianfu
was trying to kill me before?

23
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,410
Am I that valuable?

24
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:02,050
Why chase me so relentlessly?

25
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,171
20,000 liang?

26
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,251
Impossible!

27
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:09,410
Must be 200,000 liang.

28
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:10,931
Two liang.

29
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,130
Your turn.

30
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,290
Wait!

31
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,251
Think I'm someone

32
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,450
who can be bribed

33
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,730
by one liang?

34
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,410
I offered two!

35
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,570
These two liang

36
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,290
double what you'd get

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,211
for this job.

38
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:34,771
How'd you know?

39
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,091
I don't.

40
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,371
Just guessed.

41
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,531
Your throwing skills are divine,

42
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,331
yet you're poor.

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,410
Must be the lowest-ranked assassin.

44
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,091
Assassin ranks go Class A to G.

45
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,091
Class A takes 200 liang.

46
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,971
Class B 100 liang.

47
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,491
C 50 liang.

48
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:54,890
D 10 liang.

49
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,850
E two liang.

50
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:57,730
G one liang.

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,251
A Class A assassin
took the job at 200 liang.

52
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:01,610
But when

53
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,971
it gets to you...

54
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,211
So,

55
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,931
they do nothing

56
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:11,890
yet earn

57
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:13,371
hundreds liang!

58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,850
I work so hard

59
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,211
yet earn one liang daily!

60
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:18,651
Exactly!

61
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:19,771
The middleman

62
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,690
exploits much.

63
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,570
Spot on!

64
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,771
Then why not

65
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,010
take my two liang?

66
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,651
Take it

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,931
and pretend to kill me.

68
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,690
Then

69
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,170
grab midnight snack

70
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:32,971
and get off work.

71
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,331
Perfect, right?

72
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,331
(Money is not working?)

73
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,251
Go.

74
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,051
Wait.

75
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:07,690
Why?

76
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,331
Knife.

77
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,891
You're ruthless, bro.

78
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,091
It's okay, you can go.

79
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:25,850
I'll handle it.

80
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,810
Farewell.

81
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,011
Xue Hexu!

82
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,370
What?

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,011
Gu Qianfu lied?

84
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,850
He denied coming to kill you

85
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,410
under Grand Tutor's order?

86
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,451
Gu Qianfu is innocent.

87
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,290
The order passed through many.

88
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:07,490
And Gu Qianfu

89
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,771
didn't know
it is Grand Tutor Zhou's order.

90
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,810
I wonder

91
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,610
why the Jing'an Bureau hired

92
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,211
assassins twice to kill me,

93
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,610
instead of

94
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,451
using their men?

95
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,691
Young Master's missing

96
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,050
likely connects to Grand Tutor Zhou.

97
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,370
Youshou's missing?

98
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,370
When?

99
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,850
Dawn today,

100
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:30,331
when you departed.

101
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:32,170
(According to Grand Tutor,)

102
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:33,971
(Youshou isn't the Crown Prince.)

103
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,531
(What's his relationship
to Grand Tutor?)

104
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,891
(Who am I really?)

105
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,810
The Emperor saw Youshou's portrait.

106
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,131
I'd never surrender him,

107
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,730
nor let you take his place.

108
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,170
Since I take his place,

109
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,571
let's fake my death

110
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,370
to end this hunt!

111
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:56,850
Youshou has lived
as a shadow for decades

112
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,211
and suffered much.

113
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:00,571
Time for someone else to take over.

114
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,211
My survival

115
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:06,091
must stay secret.

116
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,730
It'd be dangerous

117
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,050
if others know it.

118
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:13,451
Be careful

119
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:15,131
then.

120
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:16,571
I know.

121
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:17,930
For you,

122
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,410
I'll survive.

123
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:24,250
(Perfect timing)

124
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,250
(to uncover Grand Tutor's motives,)

125
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,131
(find out where Xue Youshou is,)

126
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,571
(and why he impersonates me.)

127
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,490
(Memorial)
Miss Feng has arrived.

128
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:16,451
I confirmed

129
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,930
the former Crown Prince

130
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,930
is the illegitimate son
in the south of Xue family,

131
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,610
Xue Youshou.

132
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,691
I've executed him.

133
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,410
Jia Xun.

134
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,771
This nation

135
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,850
belongs to me.

136
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:18,971
Heavenly blessings descend!

137
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,410
Your Majesty, you're the true emperor.

138
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,891
Your boundless fortune

139
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,891
shall ensure Hua Dynasty's
everlasting prosperity.

140
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:30,011
Long live His Majesty!

141
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,331
(This Immortal knows
how to pick his moment.)

142
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:37,530
Rise.

143
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,811
Feng Zuoren.

144
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,130
You seem to have forgotten something.

145
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:56,650
Your Majesty.

146
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,211
People of Xue family

147
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,530
were also pawns.

148
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,451
It was all that rebel's scheme.

149
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,850
It seems

150
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,331
you want to protect the Xue family.

151
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,091
I wouldn't dare.

152
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,331
I haven't fully verified

153
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,730
Xue Youshou's true identity.

154
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:13,250
So...

155
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,650
You failed to complete my mission.

156
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,411
Guards! Take her away and

157
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:17,211
execute her!

158
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,010
Your Majesty.

159
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,931
Avoid bloodshed
within the palace recently.

160
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,331
Wait!

161
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,211
Mr. Immortal,

162
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:50,890
you make sense.

163
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,650
Thank you for your mercy.

164
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,232
Your Majesty,

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,171
I'll obtain a blessed talisman
from the temple

166
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,091
to ward off evil for you.

167
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,370
Thank you, Mr. Immortal.

168
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,091
(Feng Shui array?)

169
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,370
(This man knows Daoist arts well.)

170
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,730
Your worries have eased.

171
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,211
Let me divine.

172
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,610
(Western-style?)

173
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,571
(Blending Eastern and Western styles?)

174
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,691
Your Majesty,

175
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,730
wear red garments

176
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,370
or crimson cords recently.

177
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,770
On an auspicious date,

178
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,730
go visit temples for worship

179
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,890
and pray for protection.

180
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:31,971
(Indian?)

181
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:33,490
(Japanese?)

182
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,250
(Why various styles?)

183
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,520
Your Majesty,

184
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,530
the time has come.

185
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,130
Right.

186
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,691
Attendants!

187
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,890
Your Majesty,

188
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,211
this is the Foot Bathing Cauldron,

189
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:55,971
mandated by heaven,

190
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,130
a divine artifact
protecting all living beings.

191
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,411
Its interior

192
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:03,091
contains mysterious energies.

193
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,730
Soak nightly for one hour

194
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,890
to strengthen your body

195
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,051
and absorb cosmic essence.

196
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,850
(This is just a regular foot basin.)

197
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,691
(Ten wen for three.)

198
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,370
Heavenly Nectar Oil!

199
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,610
It's extracted from heavenly dew.

200
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,370
When added,

201
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,730
it improves circulation
and nourishes skin.

202
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,811
(Ordinary rose oil,)

203
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:34,370
(three wen per jug.)

204
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,610
(Enough for half a year.)

205
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,571
This is the Nine-Cycle Golden Pill!

206
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,010
(Is it just brown sugar ball?)

207
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,370
Not yet.

208
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,051
One final step required.

209
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,211
Now!

210
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,171
Mr. Immortal is really remarkable.

211
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,171
Not only medicine and divination,

212
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,250
but also masterful in Feng Shui.

213
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,650
Thanks to him,

214
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,051
Your Majesty's health
has improved greatly.

215
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,411
Is that true?

216
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,370
Absolutely!

217
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:17,864
Your Majesty,

218
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,250
just follow my methods,

219
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:21,890
then you

220
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,691
could rule over Hua

221
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,211
for thousands of years.

222
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,411
For thousands of years?

223
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,850
Can my body

224
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,770
truly last that long?

225
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:39,451
Absolutely.

226
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,171
Based on your birth chart

227
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,370
and current celestial observations,

228
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,650
if you want to stay healthy,

229
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,291
avoid bloodshed recently.

230
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,171
Otherwise, it'll diminish your fortune.

231
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:57,211
In that case,

232
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,811
I shall

233
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,490
temporarily spare Feng Zuoren

234
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,411
and the entire Xue family.

235
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,250
Your Majesty,

236
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,691
time to go to sleep.

237
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,331
Align your head 45 degrees southwest,

238
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,130
using the Heavenly Pillow I provided,

239
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,291
to optimally absorb the moon's essence,

240
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:22,130
purify the toxins in your body,

241
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,530
and get restful sleep.

242
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:27,411
Thank you, Mr. Immortal.

243
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:38,811
Stop!

244
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,091
By schedule,

245
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,451
Yuehe should be on duty tonight.

246
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,250
Where is she?

247
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:49,091
Mr. Immortal said her zodiac
conflicts with His Majesty's,

248
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,091
so she's reassigned.

249
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,130
What's that in your hand?

250
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,530
Let me tell you.

251
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,130
This is Blessed Sleep Elixir.

252
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,211
Just one sip

253
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,451
guarantees peaceful sleep.

254
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,850
Eight liang per bottle.

255
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,250
Silk tree bark,

256
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,411
spina date seeds,

257
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,451
poria root...

258
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,571
All common sedative herbs.

259
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,370
(It surely brings peaceful sleep.)

260
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,650
(But eight liang?)

261
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,451
(A string of coins buys a vat-full.)

262
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,291
Mr. Immortal is skilled in medicine

263
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,730
and divination.

264
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:24,770
He once predicted

265
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,610
I'd gain wealth
on this month's eighth day,

266
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,530
and it came true!

267
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,971
We get paid every eighth day.

268
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,571
Common knowledge.

269
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,890
He's just a fraud.

270
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,411
Thank you for saving my life.

271
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:47,530
Your mighty powers earn imperial favor.

272
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,931
Might I request a divination?

273
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,291
What concerns you?

274
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,730
As Western divinations,

275
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,650
different birthdates align
with twelve zodiac houses.

276
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,571
Born on the first of the twelfth month,

277
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,971
what's my zodiac house

278
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:07,730
and my fortune this month?

279
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:14,850
Well,

280
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,610
by Western divinations,

281
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,010
your zodiac house

282
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,770
is Scorpio.

283
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,650
Scorpio's fortune this month...

284
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:24,971
With good luck,

285
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,650
disasters become blessings.

286
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,291
But with ill luck,

287
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:30,931
bloodshed awaits.

288
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:32,130
(Nonsense!)

289
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,770
(My zodiac house)

290
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,091
(isn't Scorpio at all,)

291
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,250
(but Sagittarius.)

292
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,691
(He knows nothing.)

293
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:40,130
Then,

294
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:42,571
I've been gaining weight

295
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,451
lately.

296
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,850
Any solution?

297
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,211
Your figure is admirable,

298
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,490
yet you're so strict with yourself.

299
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,291
Everyone wants

300
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,730
to be perfect.

301
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:58,091
You've

302
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,250
asked the right person.

303
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,291
Just follow my dietary plan

304
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:04,331
and exercise schedule.

305
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:06,250
Most crucially,

306
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,490
have my Fitness Elixir.

307
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,091
(Weight-loss Tea)
In a month,

308
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,770
you'll slim down.

309
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,171
88 liang.

310
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:19,931
Per bottle?

311
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,530
For three days.

312
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,250
Three days per treatment,

313
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,051
minimum ten treatments.

314
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:27,250
(Eat)

315
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,770
(half-bowl rice per meal.)

316
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:29,832
(No food after noon.)

317
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,250
(Four-hour daily exercise.)

318
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,411
(Dieting and exercising.)

319
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:34,811
(Why do I need his elixir?)

320
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,530
I have no money. Maybe next time.

321
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,250
Wait.

322
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:41,890
It seems you don't trust me.

323
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,571
Then I'll divine
another fortune for you.

324
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,530
The person you seek

325
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,010
is just

326
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:02,370
in front of you.

327
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,010
Young Master?

328
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:17,371
You seemed so tense,

329
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,931
so I teased you.

330
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,010
I've been searching for you.

331
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,330
Never imagined you'd enter the palace.

332
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:24,730
But

333
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,611
why are you Mr. Immortal?

334
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,211
Long story.

335
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,131
Guards!

336
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,570
Coming!

337
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:43,851
This...

338
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:44,330
Yueji.

339
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,770
Coming.

340
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:05,371
During my wanderings,

341
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,810
I met a Taoist priest,

342
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,931
an eminent scholar
from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

343
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:11,851
Been through a lot,

344
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,451
he brought me back here.

345
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:16,330
Fate plays its tricks.

346
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:17,931
To survive,

347
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,691
I have to stay
in the most perilous place.

348
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,131
But you've been here for so long,

349
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,691
why not tell me about it?

350
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,651
First,

351
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,770
it is risky.

352
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,330
Second,

353
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,371
in the palace,

354
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,971
every word and action

355
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,290
is monitored by the Emperor.

356
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,651
I wanted to tell you privately,

357
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:42,530
but

358
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,891
I couldn't guarantee

359
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,330
escaping the Emperor's surveillance.

360
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:49,691
Moreover,

361
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,611
once I told you who I am,

362
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,330
you'd act rashly,

363
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:56,770
exposing yourself to danger.

364
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:58,931
My silence

365
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,971
protects you.

366
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,730
You left without word,

367
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,770
I thought you'd been killed.

368
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,691
That day the Emperor
suddenly summoned me,

369
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,211
I had to leave urgently

370
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,891
without farewells.

371
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:15,891
Right.

372
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:17,810
We need a thorough plan.

373
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,010
Tell me,

374
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,250
where is Xue Hexu?

375
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,851
He

376
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,211
died by Grand Tutor Zhou's men.

377
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,451
I made him killed.

378
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,411
What matters now

379
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,530
is to protect the Xue family.

380
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:40,570
Rest assured.

381
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,810
Lord Dingyuan saved my life once.

382
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,891
I'll surely find a way
to protect his family.

383
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,931
I need an imperial edict

384
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:51,810
to legitimately

385
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,691
meet with Lord Dingyuan.

386
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,611
(Taiji Hall)

387
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:01,256
Your Majesty,

388
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,611
this cushion comes from jade carved

389
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,611
from the ice bed once used

390
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:09,250
by the Condor Heroes couple.

391
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,730
Regular use prolongs life

392
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,050
and stays healthy.

393
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,530
Why

394
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,971
did it shatter?

395
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,451
You could break even
such an unbreakable item

396
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,411
with mere sitting,

397
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,891
proving you are so mighty

398
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,570
that nothing can stop you

399
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,171
in the war

400
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,171
from now on.

401
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,770
Long live Your Majesty!

402
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:54,891
Your Majesty,

403
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,290
this Life-extending Elixir

404
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:59,810
is purified for seven days,

405
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:02,810
can cleanse your impurities.

406
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,050
Why sand inside?

407
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:21,171
These are Essence Crystals formed
during purification.

408
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,490
A once-in-a-century marvel!

409
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:24,651
This signifies

410
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,530
heaven itself blesses you.

411
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:35,770
Your Majesty,

412
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,290
last night I made a divination

413
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:40,851
and discovered

414
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:43,211
why you fell ill.

415
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,330
Tell me.

416
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,050
You need
to lift the burden in your mind.

417
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,371
(What has he been through)

418
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,211
(to become what he is now?)

419
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,090
You mean,

420
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:57,371
the burden in my mind

421
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,411
caused my sickness?

422
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:00,611
Exactly.

423
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:03,931
I deduced from the divination

424
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:05,770
that the burden in your mind

425
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,810
lies southeast,

426
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,851
the mansion in the third street.

427
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,451
It's the Xue Mansion.

428
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:20,412
(Xue Family Ancestral Hall)

429
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,211
Hexu.

430
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,971
You promised to watch me grow up

431
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,330
and get married.

432
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,730
Why would you...

433
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:35,611
You're so young.

434
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,971
How could you leave your father

435
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,651
alone?

436
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:44,810
Hexu.

437
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,530
You must be hiding somewhere,

438
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,010
playing tricks on me.

439
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:49,330
Come out now!

440
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,131
I'll get angry if you don't show up!

441
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:51,611
Dongyang.

442
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:52,330
- Dongyang!
- Come out! - Dongyang.

443
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,971
You're just playing with me, right?

444
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:54,931
Come out now!

445
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,050
- Dongyang!
- I'll get angry!

446
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,611
- I'm getting angry!
- Dongyang!

447
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,891
Dongyang!

448
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,371
Show yourself.

449
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:03,010
- Hexu.
- Stop this!

450
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,891
Enough!

451
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:05,971
Dongyang!

452
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:06,851
Come out now!

453
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:07,691
- Stop hiding!
- Dongyang!

454
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,250
- I'm getting angry!
- Dongyang!

455
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:09,851
Calm down.

456
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:10,611
Come out now!

457
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,530
I'm getting angry.

458
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,810
- I'm getting angry!
- Dongyang!

459
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:16,851
Hexu!

460
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:18,891
Hexu!

461
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:21,411
Dongyang!

462
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:22,050
Dongyang.

463
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,171
You're consumed by grief.

464
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,451
He's right there.

465
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,570
- His spirit appears!
- Dongyang!

466
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,090
I understand your pain,

467
00:23:31,851 --> 00:23:33,530
but you must face reality.

468
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,411
Hexu is dead.

469
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,651
No, Grandmother.

470
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:37,851
He's truly there.

471
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:39,530
(Forgive me,)

472
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,680
(Dongyang.)

473
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,250
Grand Tutor Zhou.

474
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:46,250
I'll make you pay with blood!

475
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:49,131
Lord Dingyuan, come
to receive the imperial decree.

476
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:02,330
By Heaven's Mandate,
the Emperor decrees:

477
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,330
Recent disturbances
plague the Lord Dingyuan's Mansion.

478
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,371
There might be evil forces haunting.

479
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,250
Mr. Immortal from the Imperial Astronomical
Bureau comes to eradicate them.

480
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,810
That's it.

481
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,290
We thank Your Majesty's grace.

482
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,451
Mr. Immortal.

483
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,090
Your Majesty.

484
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,211
The former Crown Prince's threat

485
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,651
no longer exists.

486
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,730
Are you sure?

487
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:41,211
The one I do not want to see

488
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:43,570
has gone?

489
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,490
Exactly.

490
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,330
However,

491
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:51,451
there are evil forces
haunting in the Xue family,

492
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:55,090
threatening your fortune.

493
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,851
I'll go eliminate them for you.

494
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,090
I'll do a clean job, I swear.

495
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,730
Proceed as you advise then.

496
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:05,810
You'd handle it.

497
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,411
Yes, Your Majesty.

498
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,330
Alright. All rise.

499
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,330
I sense

500
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,371
the evil forces haunting in the mansion.

501
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,490
My lord.

502
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,371
Take me there.

503
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:36,971
