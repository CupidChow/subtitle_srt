Enough now!

26
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:09,796
Shut up.

00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:10,835
If you're jealous,

28

go find a woman.

00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:17,675
Xue Youshou,

30
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,036
or rather, the real Xue Hexu.

31
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:22,196
He's known everything from the start.

32
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:23,316
This shows his cunning

33
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:24,555
is beyond our calculations.

34
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:26,636
He's colluding with Grand Tutor Zhou,

35
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:28,395
planning something evil.

36
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:30,184
I also discovered You...

37
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,796
He colludes with imperial chefs

38
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,240
to poison the Emperor.

39
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,395
I bet Grand Tutor Zhou
is behind all this.

40
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,196
Xue Youshou stole my identity,

41
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:43,395
deceiving Emperor Jia.

42
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:44,995
And Grand Tutor Zhou

43
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:47,076
knew I am the former Crown Prince,

44
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,076
yet attempted to kill me secretly,

45
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:51,304
even forged
the bone-portrait identification.

46
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,796
They deceived Emperor Jia

47
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:53,916
and poisoned him.

48
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:55,715
Once Emperor Jia dies,

49
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:57,435
their goal

50
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,036
will be the throne.

51
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,155
After His Majesty's gone,

52
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:03,036
Grand Tutor Zhou will announce

53
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,316
Xue Youshou as the true Crown Prince.

54
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:07,756
Xue Youshou's ascension

55
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,275
would be legitimate.

56
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:12,796
We can't let his scheme succeed.

57
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:13,995
We must stop him.

58
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:14,835
Will you?

59
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,196
Their mutual destruction

60
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:19,875
is exactly what you want.

61
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,196
Gu Qianfu.

62
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,916
What do you mean?

63
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,800
Emperor Jia wanted your life,

64
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,076
and Xue Youshou stole your identity,

65
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,995
even nearly took the woman you love.

66
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,916
You must hate them deeply.

67
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:41,236
If I were you,

68
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:43,636
I'd let Xue Youshou kill the Emperor

69
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,875
before revealing my true identity.

70
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,356
Two birds with one stone.

71
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,636
I have no idea.

72
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:55,916
I can't think clearly.

73
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:58,956
(He suffered greatly)

74
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:00,155
(and lost his memory.)

75
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:02,516
(Finally, he found peace here,)

76
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,356
(yet got hunted by me and Gu Qianfu.)

77
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,395
(At this moment,)

78
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,916
(if even I pressure him,)

79
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,236
(he'll have no one left to trust.)

80
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,155
If you have no idea,

81
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:21,235
then drop it.

82
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,556
Whatever you choose,

83
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,076
I'll support you.

84
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:30,715
Feng.

85
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:32,436
Thank you.

92
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:55,595
and hide.

93

95
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:01,436
He's right.

96
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,795
Go with Gu Qianfu first.

97
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:05,915
Alright.

98
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:09,956
Let's go. Stop it.

99
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,595
(I must stop
Xue Youshou's poisoning first.)

100
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:56,196
Freeze!

101
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,436
Miss Feng.

102
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,395
What are you doing?

103
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:13,676
Your Majesty.

104
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,355
Fortunately, I discovered this in time

105
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,395
to prevent Feng Zuoren's scheme.

106
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,436
Feng Zuoren
has long plotted against you,

107
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,516
colluding with the Xue family to rebel.

108
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,076
You are wasting time

109
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:27,516
framing me and the Xue family,

110
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:29,116
but should've investigated

111
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:30,756
why His Majesty's health declines

112
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,956
despite prolonged treatment.

113
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,035
These herbs came from the Xue family.

114
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:36,516
Did imperial physicians

115
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,516
check the previous medicines?

116
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:39,915
Your Majesty,

117
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,475
Imperial physicians confirmed

118
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:44,076
the medicines aren't tainted.

119
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:44,876
However...

120
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,516
What?

121
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:47,756
The medicines

122
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:49,316
aren't tainted,

123
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,595
but your pulse shows abnormalities.

124
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:53,155
This is unbelievable.

125
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:54,595
A patient's pulse

126
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,835
surely shows abnormalities.

127
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:56,835
The medicines

128
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,035
were made

129
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:00,035
of Western herbs
prepared by the Xue family.

130
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:01,035
In my opinion,

131
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:03,035
the Xue family might be likely

132
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,475
harboring Crown Prince Jia Xun

133
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:06,915
and plotting rebellion.

134
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:09,556
They tampered with the herbs

135
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:11,035
to poison you.

136
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,436
False accusations!

137
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:15,235
The Xue family

138
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:18,035
dares to be this audacious?

139
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,436
Your Majesty,

140
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,035
Feng Zuoren

141
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,035
has married into the Xue family.

142
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:24,676
At first,

143
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:26,996
you assigned her
to monitor the Xue family,

144
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,436
yet now she defends the Xue family.

145
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:31,355
She must be bribed by the Xue family

146
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:32,756
to conspire in rebellion!

147
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:34,035
I...

148
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:35,915
Your Majesty.

149
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:14,116
(Oh, no!)

150
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,076
Your Majesty,

151
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,076
look what it is.

152
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,396
Your Majesty,

153
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,115
these are the same Western herbs
from the Xue family.

154
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:42,875
This monster

155
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,755
has been poisoning you.

156
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:49,436
(That sachet was part of his scheme.)

157
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,556
I noticed you've been feeling restless.

158
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,355
I put some calming herbs in here.

159
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:56,715
Wear it

160
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:58,676
to ease your mind.

161
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:02,076
Thank you.

162
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:07,875
(I told you)

163
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:09,916
(whether she's willing or not,)

164
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,156
(she'll help us.)

165
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,556
Evil shall not taint the imperial body!

166
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:23,235
Traitor!

167
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,276
Do you admit your crimes?

168
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,196
Issue my imperial decree,

169
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,316
strip Feng Zuoren
of Xue Guardian command.

170
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,196
Jing'an Bureau

171
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:37,156
assumes control of Xue Guardian.

172
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,316
Take Feng Zuoren

173
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:41,595
and

174
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,076
the Xue family to the prison,

175
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:45,956
awaiting judgment.

176
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:19,556
What's wrong?

177
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:21,995
Anything to say?

178
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:25,355
Lord Xue.

179
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,156
Feng Zuoren,

180
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,355
want to defy the Emperor?

181
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,396
Lord Xue has led us for years,

182
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:34,316
devoted and upright.

183
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:35,835
She remains our exemplar.

184
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,316
If anyone dares frame her

185
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:38,956
and arrest her,

186
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:40,715
we won't comply.

187
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:42,076
Warn the Xue family now

188
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:43,436
things are bad

189
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:45,515
and they're wanted now.

190
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,475
Yes, my lord.

191
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:54,076
You frame me

192
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:56,156
and the Xue family for rebellion.

193
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,196
Now I'll purge treacherous ministers

194
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:00,956
to protect His Majesty

195
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:02,676
from further deception.

196
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:05,835
Only Grand Tutor Zhou bears guilt.

197
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:07,235
The rest of you,

198
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:08,956
stop protecting him.

199
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:23,956
Feng Zuoren, how dare you

200
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,076
twist truth here?

201
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,036
Don't heed her nonsense!

202
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,676
By imperial decree,

203
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,475
the one

204
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,755
who captures Feng Zuoren gets promotion.

205
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:36,916
Xue Guardian, listen!

206
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:37,635
Yes!

207
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:38,676
Secure the perimeter.

208
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,396
I'll claim Grand Tutor's head.

209
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:41,595
Yes.

210
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:49,475
Why...

211
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,595
Why fear her?

212
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:54,316
Xue Guardian,

213
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,076
do you defy the Emperor?

214
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:06,355
Hold on.

215
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:07,916
(Wait.)

216
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,316
(If we resist now,)

217
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:11,875
(it'd confirm my charges)

218
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:14,355
(and implicate everyone,)

219
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,316
(leaving the Emperor unprotected.)

220
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:17,755
(This is a trap.)

221
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:18,956
(I can't kill him.)

222
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:21,475
I've changed my mind.

223
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:23,036
I'll go with you.

224
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,276
Xue Guardian.

225
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,276
During my absence,

226
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,556
Jing'an Bureau
will take over Xue Guardian.

227
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,635
Once everything is clarified,

228
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:33,436
I'll be released.

229
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:50,956
Take her.

230
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:04,556
Search!

231
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,212
(Xue Mansion)

232
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:25,916
He got away.

233
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:27,076
Let's go

234
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,515
tell Grand Tutor.

235
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:28,916
Go!

236
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:33,355
Lord Dingyuan,

237
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:34,436
it's been a while.

238
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,156
I've come

239
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,316
for the Xue family's treason.

240
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:41,916
By imperial decree,

241
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,635
I need to arrest you all

242
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,076
for investigation, nothing personal.

243
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,076
(No. I'm late.)

244
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,276
Reveal the traitor's whereabouts,

245
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:28,956
and I'll grant you an intact corpse.

246
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:36,956
The traitor is right before me.

247
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,076
Still making

248
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:42,875
stubborn talk.

249
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:43,995
Beat her.

250
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:44,755
Yes!

251
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:54,796
Xue Fugui!

252
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:59,835
You've harbored a traitor for years.

253
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,715
Your entire family are imprisoned,
yet you show no remorse.

254
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:03,956
Tell me,

255
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,396
where's Xue Hexu?

256
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:08,355
Villain! Release my stepmother!

257
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,956
You've already killed Hexu!

258
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,276
Don't try to hurt my family.

259
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:12,835
Stepmother?

260
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:15,355
Do you know

261
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,076
how many times

262
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:18,916
she puts your entire family in danger?

263
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,956
She's a bloodthirsty monster!

264
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:23,156
What?

265
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,316
What?

266
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,036
Let her tell you herself.

267
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:27,316
How many times has she

268
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,316
tried to destroy your Xue family?

269
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,556
Poisoning,

270
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:32,115
arson,

271
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:33,316
blade executions?

272
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:34,715
You're right.

273
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:36,076
Bring her here.

274
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:44,595
Go inside.

275
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:52,235
Great!

276
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:53,235
Stepmother is here,

277
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,316
she'll protect us.

278
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:55,676
I'm not scared now.

279
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:56,556
Stepmother,

280
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,276
is what that bad man

281
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:00,076
said true?

282
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,396
Everyone,

283
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,115
salute the Xue Guardian Commander,

284
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:09,436
Miss Feng Zuoren.

285
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,396
My lord, you...

286
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,316
Miss Feng,

287
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:19,115
you're well-known
throughout the court and beyond.

288
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:20,515
Xue Guardian?

289
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,115
The storybooks say

290
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:26,635
it's a ruthless spy agency.

291
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:28,875
They dismember, behead,

292
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:30,635
draw-and-quarter,

293
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,076
skin alive,

294
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:33,396
brand with irons,

295
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:34,835
castrate...

296
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,995
Resort to cruelty.

297
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:37,875
Stop that!

298
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,556
So Miss Feng,

299
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,196
do you intend to kill us?

300
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,875
(Let the internal strife begin.)

301
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,595
(Whether Feng Zuoren
destroys the Xue family,)

302
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,396
(or the Xue family kills her,)

303
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:55,995
(both outcomes benefit me.)

304
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,396
(As for that traitor Xue Hexu,)

305
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,755
(he's alone)

306
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:03,036
(and powerless to do anything big.)

307
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,156
The Emperor sent me to you

308
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:10,916
to figure out

309
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,315
if you harbor the former Crown Prince.

310
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:14,755
After that, I was told

311
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:17,436
to eliminate you all.

312
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,596
But during my time with you,

313
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:28,876
I experienced

314
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,596
a family warmth I've never known.

315
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,956
That's why I hesitated.

316
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,715
Until I discovered
the former Crown Prince's portrait

317
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,075
and the ledger.

318
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:44,275
I realized

319
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,116
the day I uncovered the truth

320
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,315
would be your doom.

321
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:04,436
But you showed me

322
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:06,515
care and kindness.

323
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,916
It'd make me a monster

324
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:14,995
to harm my family.

325
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:18,636
Move!

326
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:21,795
Hey, you!

327
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,235
Feng Zuoren.

328
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:27,116
When you married into the Xue family,

329
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,836
you kept claiming we were one family.

330
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:33,035
Is this how you treat family?

331
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,676
Holding such a huge secret
in your heart,

332
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,075
with no one to confide in.

333
00:18:58,156 --> 00:18:58,876
Child,

334
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,396
you must've suffered greatly.

335
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,755
Since you've been honest with us,

336
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,196
then we are truly family.

337
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:10,396
Fear not.

338
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:13,555
We can always figure out a solution.

339
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,035
Exactly.

340
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,156
At worst,

341
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,755
just sacrifice
another Xue family member.

342
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:24,795
Father.

343
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:27,156
Who will you sacrifice this time?

344
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:28,876
Dongyang?

345
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:30,156
Nuannuan?

346
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:32,956
Grandmother maybe?

347
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:33,676
Youshou,

348
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,315
you ingrate!

349
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:37,795
What do you want

350
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:39,475
from us?

351
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:40,995
I wonder

352
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,396
when I fell into the water at seven,

353
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:47,436
why you didn't save me?

354
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,196
(Back then, I accidentally)

355
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,836
(pushed that traitor into the water.)

356
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:54,876
(I tried to save him,)

357
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:56,836
(and fell in myself.)

358
00:19:58,315 --> 00:19:59,715
(Yet you focused on rescuing him)

359
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,035
(and ignored me.)

360
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,995
(I'm your real son.)

361
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:06,636
(Yet you let him)

362
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,475
(steal even my name!)

363
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,196
All this is fate.

364
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,356
Since you stole his jade pendant,

365
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:14,836
from now on,

366
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,035
it'll belong to you.

367
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,315
His identity

368
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:19,916
will be also yours.

369
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:22,436
Just go.

370
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:24,515
No!

371
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:25,836
Father,

372
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:27,596
don't drive me away!

373
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,156
I'll return his jade pendant.

374
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:33,035
I'll repay him a-thousand-fold.

375
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,235
This pains me too,

376
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:40,636
but...

377
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:46,956
Perhaps

378
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,235
this is fate.

379
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,235
I'll send an old subordinate

380
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,116
to accompany you south.

381
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:57,636
You'll have

382
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,995
protection and provisions.

383
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:02,475
You want

384
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,396
to go to the south with me, right?

385
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,356
Now is your chance.

386
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:11,555
No, Father.

387
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:13,436
Don't drive me away.

388
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:15,636
I was wrong.

389
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:17,795
Father.

390
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:25,315
From now on,

391
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:27,916
don't call me Father.

392
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:30,035
Take him away.

393
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:30,636
Yes.

394
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:32,995
Father!

395
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:34,636
Father, no!

396
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:35,596
Father!

397
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:37,396
Father!

398
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:39,755
Father!

399
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:44,075
Father,

400
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,275
I'm your real son!

401
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:49,075
All these years,

402
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:51,315
to protect Xue Hexu,

403
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:54,035
you sacrificed me?

404
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:56,356
Why?

405
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:58,916
Why me?

406
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:01,596
You sent me to the south.

407
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,596
I've been alone since childhood,

408
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:08,315
yet you still

409
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:11,636
don't know why I treat you like this.

410
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:14,876
I wonder why you did it to me.

411
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:16,876
Because of you

412
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,396
and your blind loyalty
to the late Empress.

413
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,555
To protect her son,

414
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:23,956
Jia Xun.

415
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:25,916
Father,

416
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:30,235
I'm the real Xue Hexu.

417
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:34,035
Jia Xun should've lived in hiding,

418
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:36,795
yet he's living carefree.

419
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:38,035
While I

420
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,676
must conceal my identity.

421
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,555
I lost my name at seven.

422
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:48,515
I've been

423
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:51,436
all alone all these years!

424
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:53,636
What do you mean?

425
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,876
You're Hexu?

426
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:57,636
Hexu is not that

427
00:22:58,196 --> 00:22:58,956
rude,

428
00:22:59,436 --> 00:22:59,956
and arrogant.

429
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:03,555
Dongyang,

430
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:05,356
Nuannuan.

431
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:08,116
Don't you recognize me?

432
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:10,436
I'm Hexu.

433
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:12,755
We used to

434
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,216
play together when we were kids.

435
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:17,075
Didn't you two love me most?

436
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,956
Take a good look at me.

437
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:24,836
That Xue Hexu is an impostor!

438
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:33,235
What?

439
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:35,475
You don't believe me?

440
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:38,156
Ask Father then.

441
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:40,795
He swapped me with the fake Xue Hexu

442
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:43,356
when I was seven.

443
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,116
It made us all to reunite

444
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:47,636
in this prison today.

445
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:50,995
This is all

446
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,235
your fault!

447
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:55,916
It's all your fault,

448
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:58,515
Xue Fugui.

449
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:14,836
You're my grandson.

450
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:17,356
I recognize you.

451
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,156
Youshou.

452
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:22,555
When you came to Xue Mansion
to exorcise evil forces,

453
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:26,436
you promised to protect the Xue family.

454
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:30,315
Is this how you protect us?

455
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:33,196
You told me to wait,

456
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:37,755
only for our whole family
to end up imprisoned!

457
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:40,196
What do you want?

458
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,156
What do I want?

459
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,075
What do I want?

460
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:52,676
Since everyone

461
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,636
believes I'm the former Crown Prince,

462
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:56,356
fine!

463
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,916
Why shouldn't I play along?

464
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,235
If Emperor Jia Ji can rule,

465
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:04,596
then I, Jia Xun,

466
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,035
can do it too!

467
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:10,636
Jia Xun?

468
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:11,636
Youshou.

469
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:13,555
You ingrate!

470
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:15,436
This is treason!

471
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:17,436
This is rebellion!

472
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:18,755
Father,

473
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:20,876
don't be anxious.

474
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,596
Once I become emperor,

475
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,715
I won't have to hide anymore.

476
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,235
And our Xue family

477
00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:30,876
won't have to live in fear either.

478
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,235
I'm doing this for you all.

479
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:35,636
How can this be rebellion?

480
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,636
So you've been involved all along,

481
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:42,035
hiding your true identity
from the start,

482
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:44,436
and using my gratitude
towards Young Master?

483
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:46,075
You're

484
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:48,676
a monster with hands
drenched in carnage.

485
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,075
And you fantasize about
others fighting for your affection?

486
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:01,315
Go be a couple with Xue Hexu

487
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:04,715
