Take care of her.

Wait for me.

00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:57,493
Okay.

56
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:05,320
(Jing'an Bureau)

57
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,654
Greetings, sir.

58
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,493
Look who it is.

59
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:23,784
You're Xue Hexu

60
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:26,574
who embarrassed me
at the Flower Banquet.

61
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,957
What brings you here today?

62
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,158
Want to dismantle my mansion?

63
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:32,158
I was foolish

64
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,877
and failed your concern for my father.

65
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,317
You warned me at the Flower Banquet,

66
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:38,798
yet I failed to be alert

67
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:40,757
and got my father poisoned by villains,

68
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:41,918
with his life in danger.

69
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,877
I'm here to beg for the antidote.

70
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,358
Please help us.

71
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,077
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned?

72
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:51,838
Yes.

73
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:53,877
Diagnosis shows

74
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:55,397
it's Deadly Poison.

75
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,397
Common physicians can't treat it.

76
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,557
If you offer help,

77
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:01,637
I'll repay you

78
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:02,718
even with my life.

79
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:09,718
As colleagues,

80
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,077
I can't stand idle.

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,358
But you know what?

82
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,397
Deadly Poison is a peculiar poison.

83
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:20,957
Let's be honest,

84
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,238
Lord Dingyuan

85
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,877
crossed the line and did wrong

86
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:29,278
at the prince's incident a decade ago.

87
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:30,798
I bet he's

88
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,397
targeted by someone.

89
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,478
I can save him now,

90
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,678
not forever.

91
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:42,478
If you offer help,

92
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:44,678
the Xue family will remember this grace.

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,757
If you want to ask questions,

94
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:48,397
I can give you answers

95
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:50,718
after my father's recovery.

96
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,317
Please wait

97
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:53,877
for a few days.

98
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,557
You want

99
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:59,358
to take my antidote today,

100
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,557
yet make me wait days

101
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,278
for answers?

102
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:05,158
I beg for your mercy.

103
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:12,197
Right.

104
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,997
Do you possess

105
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:16,678
a portrait of the late empress?

106
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:18,637
Give it to me,

107
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,838
and I'll give you the antidote.

108
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,317
(Why do they all want that?)

109
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:26,838
Okay.

110
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:27,798
The painting

111
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:29,478
for the antidote.

112
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:30,637
Go.

113
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:41,118
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned?

114
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,877
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned.

115
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,877
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned.

116
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,118
Nuannuan, here.

117
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:09,077
What to do, Hexu?

118
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,637
Her hands grow colder.

119
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:11,557
Start a fire.

120
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:12,358
Got it.

121
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:24,278
Alright.

122
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:25,757
I'm here.

123
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:28,077
So cold.

124
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:29,957
So cold.

125
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:41,718
(Ms. Wang,)

126
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:42,997
(hang on.)

127
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:44,558
(Hang on.)

128
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:47,718
(Ms. Wang,)

129
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:49,718
(you'll recover soon.)

130
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:54,517
(Why be so silly?)

131
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:58,198
(What matters more than life?)

132
00:08:59,037 --> 00:08:59,997
(Why took the poison?)

133
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:02,677
(What are you hiding?)

134
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:11,318
Why do you live

135
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:13,757
such a difficult life?

136
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,637
I still found sweetness in such moments.

137
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:25,438
I'm truly heartless.

138
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,718
Hexu, is she alright now?

139
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:52,877
Young Master,

140
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:54,517
don't go.

141
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,598
Get out.

142
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:35,438
I...

143
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,877
I didn't die.

144
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,958
Hexu begged for the antidote.

145
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,997
(Deadly Poison
belongs to Jing'an Bureau.)

146
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,358
(Did he go to Grand Tutor Zhou?)

147
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,877
(How could he leave unscathed?)

148
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:55,757
Come on.

149
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:57,397
Chicken soup stewed with ginseng.

150
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:58,277
Let her drink it.

151
00:10:58,877 --> 00:10:59,464
Jiaoqian.

152
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,198
When Dongyang had raging fever,
you didn't use this ginseng.

153
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:04,958
Now you've stewed this?

154
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:06,637
Why save me?

155
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:08,958
I should be dead.

156
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:15,917
Everyone out.

157
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,118
Why do you

158
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:34,517
always speak of death?

159
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:35,997
Once dead,

160
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:37,238
you can do nothing.

161
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,198
Nosy.

162
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:40,958
Those truly wishing to die

163
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:43,037
don't struggle for life like you do.

164
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:45,478
Your family has gone.

165
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:48,198
They wouldn't want you
joining them so soon.

166
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:51,558
You know nothing.

167
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:52,757
Yes,

168
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,037
you're right.

169
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:56,037
Because you've never been frank.

170
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,958
Do you know saving me

171
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,397
will bring disaster to Xue family?

172
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,358
The Xue family has suffered a lot.

173
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:08,558
But we

174
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,677
won't abandon those in need.

175
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:12,478
Everyone has

176
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,397
to look out for themselves.

177
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,797
I can say the same words to you.

178
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:19,157
If you seek death again,

179
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:20,958
I won't

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,198
stop you anymore.

181
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:26,757
Rest now.

182
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:28,198
I'll leave.

183
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:41,797
I blamed you when Dongyang went missing,

184
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:43,318
but he's back now.

185
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,157
Why sought death?

186
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:47,558
Come to us with problems.

187
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,198
We'll figure it out.

188
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:51,358
Our family's already in chaos.

189
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:53,238
If anything happens to you,

190
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:55,118
the Xue family will collapse.

191
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,598
Stepmother.

192
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:58,917
I'll behave from now on.

193
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:00,997
Don't be upset

194
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:02,917
and leave me.

195
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,238
I like you.

196
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,797
(If Feng Zuoren hadn't caused trouble,)

197
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,198
(letting Hua Biliang escape,)

198
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,198
(I'd never have tracked him down.)

199
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,598
(Now that Xue Hexu
gave me the painting,)

200
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:39,797
(it's time to use him.)

201
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,598
(With this person here,)

202
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:45,677
(let's see how long you can
keep it a secret, Lord Dingyuan.)

203
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,216
(Emperor's Portrait, Empress's Portrait)

204
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,397
I have my rules.

205
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:14,397
If you

206
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:17,438
expect me to sketch their son

207
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:18,997
from these two portraits,

208
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:22,838
don't bother asking.

209
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,877
You misunderstand.

210
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,037
Sorry to make you suffer.

211
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,797
I just tried to test you.

212
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,757
Seeing your integrity,

213
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:48,598
I dare confide in you now.

214
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:50,718
If we are

215
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,958
trying to protect ordinary people,

216
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:56,277
why would I go this far and do all this?

217
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:00,397
What

218
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:02,397
do you want exactly?

219
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:08,677
It was safe that no one
knows the whereabouts

220
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:10,358
of the former Crown Prince.

221
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:12,838
But now His Majesty

222
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,037
sees the former Crown Prince
as a thorn in his flesh,

223
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:17,677
he'd spare no one

224
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:18,958
even it means to kill.

225
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,677
If we stand by idly,

226
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,917
the former Crown Prince

227
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:26,078
will only be waiting to die.

228
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:29,958
His Majesty

229
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:31,118
is getting frail.

230
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,598
Recently,

231
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,238
he's obsessed
with immortality practices.

232
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,157
He neglects state affairs

233
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:40,037
and people.

234
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:42,917
The people grumble with discontent.

235
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:44,637
And officials

236
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:47,037
dare not voice their anger.

237
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:52,277
Now, I want you

238
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,877
to sketch the former Crown Prince

239
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,598
just to help and protect him.

240
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:03,997
Also all the people

241
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:06,358
in the nation.

242
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,277
So you didn't burn the painting,

243
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:22,598
but traded it for the antidote.

244
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:24,877
Yes.

245
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,397
I couldn't let you die.

246
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,677
With the parents' facial features,

247
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,517
he can sketch

248
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:34,637
their offspring's face?

249
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:36,118
Quite a skill!

250
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:37,917
I thought

251
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:39,637
he failed to draw money notes,

252
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:40,757
so you wanted him dead.

253
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:42,677
Be serious.

254
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:43,397
So,

255
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,037
the Emperor sent you here to find

256
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,198
the former Crown Prince,

257
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,198
but none of you know what he looks like,

258
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,277
then you stole
the late Empress's portrait

259
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,877
for the sketch.

260
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:55,958
But you gave

261
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,198
the late Empress's portrait

262
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:58,118
to Grand Tutor Zhou.

263
00:16:58,478 --> 00:16:59,238
Then they must...

264
00:16:59,238 --> 00:16:59,997
Stop right there.

265
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:02,558
He wanted the painting for the antidote.

266
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:03,877
Otherwise, you'd have died.

267
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:06,637
The Emperor

268
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,078
gave you poison?

269
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:12,437
Failed my mission,

270
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:14,397
I've accepted my fate.

271
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:16,838
He is so cruel.

272
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:18,518
How dare you!

273
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:19,798
I won't let you die.

274
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:24,088
♪Night clouds blush crimson,
yet fingertips miss their touch♪

275
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,815
♪Fear shatters tremors of the heart♪

276
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:31,749
♪Like chains binding snow swans,
swirling yet confined♪

277
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,760
♪Imprisoned within♪

278
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:35,278
I vaguely remember

279
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,118
when I held you in my arms,

280
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,598
you lost consciousness

281
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:41,637
and your body turned cold...

282
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:44,677
Stop right there.

283
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,237
If Grand Tutor Zhou discovers

284
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,877
that you harbor the former Crown...

285
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:50,758
No former Crown Prince here.

286
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,278
Every household has its secrets.

287
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,118
The Xue family's loyalty to Hua Dynasty

288
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,998
can be witnessed by heavens.

289
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:01,197
Annoying.

290
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:02,118
Get out.

291
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:04,118
From now on,

292
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,118
I'll find the former Crown Prince

293
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,558
and the truth with you.

294
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:10,798
Why would I trust you?

295
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:13,437
If you can't find him,

296
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:14,957
the Emperor will kill you.

297
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:16,798
Now only by working together

298
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:17,798
can we find him.

299
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:20,477
I won't harm you either.

300
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,758
(If he wants to harm me,)

301
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:25,197
(he would never save me)

302
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:26,437
(and invite trouble.)

303
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:31,598
My men found out

304
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,917
Grand Tutor Zhou caught Hua Biliang.

305
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,000
Then he must've had
the portrait of the former Crown Prince.

306
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:38,038
Go figure out a plan.

307
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:40,518
Okay.

308
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:50,998
Sir.

309
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,798
Hua Biliang completed the portrait.

310
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:57,437
Kill him.

311
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,157
Yes.

312
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:16,717
What's wrong?

313
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:18,237
Sir.

314
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,118
Mr. Xue sent a dancing troupe

315
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,237
to cause a scene outside.

316
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:22,998
And Hua...

317
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:24,477
(As expected,)

318
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:26,558
(they caught Hua Biliang.)

319
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,118
Mr. Xue, good day.

320
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:41,437
Thanks to your antidote.

321
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:43,318
My father has mostly recovered.

322
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,118
I'm here to express my gratitude.

323
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:46,998
Well, I brought a dance troupe

324
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:48,278
to liven up your mansion.

325
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:49,758
And some gifts.

326
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,838
Please accept them.

327
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:57,518
(My men found
Grand Tutor's secret chamber)

328
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,038
(is in the Jing'an Bureau.)

329
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:25,358
Since Lord Dingyuan
has mostly recovered,

330
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:29,798
are you here

331
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,717
to fulfill your promise?

332
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,078
Tell me,

333
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,518
what exactly did Lord Dingyuan tell you?

334
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:37,998
Yes.

335
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:40,637
I should tell you about this.

336
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:42,477
This morning,

337
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:43,957
when I went to my father,

338
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,237
I got dragged

339
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,838
by my sister-in-law to breakfast.

340
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:47,877
To be honest,

341
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:49,637
the breakfast spread was impressive.

342
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,677
Pancakes, handmade noodles,

343
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,677
dumplings, sesame cakes,
and red bean buns.

344
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:55,237
There are many varieties.

345
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,197
I ate many buns

346
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,118
and steamed rolls

347
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,278
until I was stuffed.

348
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,197
Even now,

349
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:01,437
I am so full that...

350
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,397
Enough! Enough!

351
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,397
Your Xue family

352
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:06,397
is rich with food.

353
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:07,437
I know it.

354
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:10,078
Are you deliberately
avoiding the subject?

355
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:29,957
Who's in there?

356
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,157
Yes.

357
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,477
But breakfast is important

358
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:47,998
for us.

359
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:48,677
Enough.

360
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:50,358
Just tell me

361
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,998
what Lord Dingyuan told you.

362
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:58,157
Well,

363
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,157
I went to my father

364
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:01,477
and told him

365
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:02,558
I had questions to ask

366
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:04,078
and he must answer truthfully.

367
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,957
And he was convinced

368
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:07,798
by my solemnity.

369
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:09,157
But then,

370
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,237
he asked me,

371
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:16,637
"You already know it?"

372
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:20,038
After confirming no one was around,

373
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:22,558
he confessed everything to me.

374
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:28,397
What did he say?

375
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:30,118
He said

376
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:32,358
he was sorry to me.

377
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,038
Why would he say that?

378
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:36,558
He said

379
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,278
I'm not the second kid
of the Xue family.

380
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:43,358
Actually,

381
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:47,118
I am

382
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:49,838
the third kid.

383
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:52,237
My younger sister and I are twins,

384
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,838
but he didn't want her
to be the elder sibling,

385
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:56,917
so he made me the older brother.

386
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:57,877
Never thought

387
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,877
I've endured my sister's bullying,

388
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,477
and he felt so sorry.

389
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:02,998
Xue Hexu!

390
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:04,397
How dare you fool me!

391
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,118
Sir.

392
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:15,598
Wait here.

393
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:17,197
I have things to handle.

394
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,477
Why do you come and go like a shadow?

395
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:12,038
Found it?

396
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:13,957
I saw a painting,

397
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:15,637
but was nearly discovered.

398
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,437
I need to go there again.

399
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:18,798
Perhaps

400
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:20,677
we should retreat for now.

401
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:22,798
Those petty guards

402
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,038
are no match for me.

403
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:25,480
I must retrieve it

404
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:26,877
no matter what.

405
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,118
Fine.

406
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:30,118
You're capable.

407
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:31,758
But be cautious.

408
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:33,477
You go first.

409
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:34,637
I'll hold them up.

410
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:47,798
I...

411
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:49,798
Xue Hexu!

412
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,677
You've been talking nonsense here,

413
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:54,078
holding me up.

414
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:55,957
What are you up to?

415
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:57,358
Confess now.

416
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:58,998
Sir, you misunderstood me.

417
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:00,998
We were having a pleasant conversation.

418
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,118
You tried to lure me away
and steal my stuff.

419
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,677
You villain!

420
00:25:07,477 --> 00:25:07,998
Sir.

421
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,237
Ever since I came here,

422
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,358
I've been right here.

423
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,477
Do you mean

424
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:15,717
you lost

425
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:17,157
something valuable?

426
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,798
Not really.

427
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,197
But there was an intruder.

428
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:25,758
Sir.

429
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:27,318
Sir.

430
00:25:27,848 --> 00:25:29,544
The dance troupe is
making a scene again.

431
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:30,758
They claim Mr. Xue asked

432
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,157
them to do it every two hours

433
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:32,838
until

434
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:34,917
Mr. Xue settles their payment.

435
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:38,798
Yes, yes.

436
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:41,397
I forgot to pay them.

437
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,677
With so many people watching,

438
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:45,717
if I don't pay them, it'll be...

439
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,758
Convey my gratitude to Lord Dingyuan.

440
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:58,477
However,

441
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:00,477
let me remind you.

442
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:03,758
Don't be fooled by someone

443
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,518
cleverer than you

444
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:06,877
even without realizing it.

445
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:48,877
Greetings.

446
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:52,758
Feng Zuoren.

447
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:54,838
How dare you show up here?

448
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,397
I sent the Chief
of the Imperial Household

449
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:59,318
to teach you a lesson.

450
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:00,677
Never expected

451
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:02,998
you'd repay me with a suicide attempt,

452
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,078
cause a scene,

453
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,518
and even involve an outsider
to save your life.

454
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:08,957
You've

455
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:10,758
embarrassed me.

456
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:12,157
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,197
The Deadly Poison you gave me

458
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:16,197
was from the Jing'an Bureau.

459
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:17,518
It's not potent.

460
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:18,877
Which reveals

461
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:21,078
the Jing'an Bureau's poisons
are not effective.

462
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:22,278
This matters.

463
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,518
Hope you can check them.

464
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:25,157
You are here

465
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,877
to complain against the Jing'an Bureau?

466
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:29,397
I've finally obtained

467
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:31,358
a portrait of the former Crown Prince.

468
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:52,798
Look at him.

469
00:27:53,998 --> 00:27:55,157
Nothing but

470
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,477
a wretched fugitive.

471
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:00,558
Your Majesty, please allow me

472
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:01,558
to catch this man.

473
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:03,397
Do not disappoint me again.

474
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:04,957
Leave!

475
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,917
(They asked me to come
to the main hall.)

476
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,278
(What are they up to?)

477
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:25,096
