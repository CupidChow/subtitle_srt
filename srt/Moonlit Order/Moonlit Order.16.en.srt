=Episode 16=

19
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:25,548
His Majesty asked me

20
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,027
to eliminate the evil forces,

21
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:28,108
but

22
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,187
I can also pray for the deceased.

23
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:32,508
If he

24
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,427
sees you all

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,348
grieving so painfully,

26
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:37,707
he'll be uneasy

27
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:39,548
in the underworld.

28
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:41,627
My lord,

29
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:43,108
Old Madam,

30
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:45,348
and everyone,

31
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,627
don't be so sad.

32
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:50,348
Are the evil forces

33
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:52,707
the vengeful spirit of my brother?

34
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,627
Do you want
to destroy his soul completely?

35
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:55,587
Nuannuan,

36
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:56,587
manners!

37
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:58,268
This is His Majesty's

38
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,467
most trusted Mr. Immortal.

39
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,228
If he's truly capable,

40
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:05,587
make Grand Tutor Zhou pay with blood!

41
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:06,907
Instead of

42
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,668
trying to fool us and profit from

43
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,147
the dead!

44
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:11,068
Liar!

45
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:15,427
Hexu,

46
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:16,747
if your spirit hears me,

47
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:18,907
punish this liar!

48
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:22,508
Exactly.

49
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:23,948
Big liar!

50
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:33,027
Hexu.

51
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:36,548
Hexu.

52
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:37,307
- Dongyang!
- Dongyang!

53
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:37,948
- Hexu!
- Dongyang!

54
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:38,348
Dongyang!

55
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:38,988
Come out!

56
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:39,907
- Hexu!
- Dongyang!

57
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:41,108
Calm down.

58
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:43,467
Please forgive them.

59
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,508
Nuannuan is still young.

60
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:46,988
Dongyang acts like a child.

61
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:48,467
Don't take their words

62
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:49,867
seriously.

63
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,228
Stepmother, he...

64
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:52,867
He's there.

65
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:53,707
No. It's real.

66
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:54,627
Enough.

67
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:55,948
- Hexu, come out!
- Dongyang!

68
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:56,788
Enough!

69
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:58,627
Stop the nonsense.

70
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,187
Or I'll punish you.

71
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,228
Mr. Immortal,

72
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:05,587
please follow me.

73
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:12,988
My lord and Mr. Immortal
have matters to discuss.

74
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,508
No one else may approach.

75
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,028
The floor is so slippery.

76
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:55,627
Jiaoqian.

77
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:01,427
Hexu!

78
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,307
Right there.

79
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:04,067
He's right there.

80
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:06,788
Jiaoqian.

81
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:08,988
Dongyang must be too heartbroken

82
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,028
and seeing things.

83
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:11,668
Take him away.

84
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:12,588
Remember,

85
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:14,267
do not let anyone

86
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,307
disturb Mr. Immortal.

87
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:18,708
I...

88
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:20,267
I...

89
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,548
So you've been hiding
in the Xue Mansion.

90
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:35,348
The most dangerous place

91
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,108
is the safest.

92
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:37,908
I can

93
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:38,947
use supplies here.

94
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:41,387
Alright.

95
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,427
But the people in Xue family

96
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:46,187
are so upset.

97
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:47,947
Are you hurt?

98
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:49,307
Did you get punishment?

99
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,468
Young Master protected me

100
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:55,187
and the Xue family.

101
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,228
You already ignored
the old acquaintance.

102
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:02,908
I knew him first.

103
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,548
Of course,

104
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:06,067
he's the old acquaintance.

105
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,028
You admit you've ignored me, Feng?

106
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,108
What did you say?

107
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,588
You used to call me

108
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:14,228
Miss Feng.

109
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,668
Young Master calls you Feng,

110
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:18,588
why can't I?

111
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,507
I'll do it anyway.

112
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:20,708
Feng! Feng!

113
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:22,187
Feng! Feng!

114
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:23,427
Feng!

115
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:41,627
Just joking.

116
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:45,427
Why would Xue Youshou

117
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,747
serve the Emperor

118
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:47,548
in the palace?

119
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,387
Long story.

120
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,548
He needs to meet with my lord

121
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:52,507
to discuss the plan.

122
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:53,788
I'll keep

123
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:54,988
the eunuchs away.

124
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:56,387
Stay hidden

125
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:57,468
and behave.

126
00:06:58,148 --> 00:06:59,228
Let's meet later.

127
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:13,668
You!

128
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:14,947
That hurts!

129
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:16,387
Don't be mean.

130
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,108
What's going on here?

131
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,067
Long story.

132
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:24,187
Then make it brief.

133
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,548
Well,

134
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:31,307
that day I drank wine at the tavern.

135
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:35,187
The wine made me

136
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,708
feel dizzy.

137
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,668
And I met some beggars I knew,

138
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:40,507
- so I chatted with them...
- Get to the point!

139
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,348
Get to the point!

140
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:42,668
The point?

141
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,708
Grand Tutor Zhou captured me,

142
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,148
threatened me with the Xue family,

143
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,067
and asked me

144
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:55,468
to follow his orders.

145
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:58,148
To enter the palace as an immortal

146
00:07:58,548 --> 00:08:00,108
and gain the Emperor's trust.

147
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:01,827
For the Xue family,

148
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,507
I had to agree.

149
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:04,867
You fool!

150
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:06,908
How could you agree?

151
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,867
This is treason!

152
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:13,228
Double penalties!

153
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,788
Once your identity is exposed...

154
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:22,387
He threatened me with the Xue family.

155
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,627
What should I do?

156
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,867
Watch the Xue family

157
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:28,187
perish together?

158
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:35,468
Then you should die.

159
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,108
You should've died first.

160
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:43,228
That way,

161
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,267
Grand Tutor Zhou
wouldn't use this secret

162
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:47,828
to threaten anyone.

163
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,547
And your identity

164
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:54,387
would've died with you.

165
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,147
You're the one who should die,

166
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:02,108
not Xue Hexu.

167
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:20,387
Father.

168
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:22,667
What are you saying?

169
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:26,228
Have you forgotten

170
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,507
I'm the real Xue Hexu?

171
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:32,828
Your son is me, not him.

172
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,188
All these years,

173
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:37,747
I've lived a tough time

174
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:41,468
pretending to be
the former Crown Prince.

175
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,747
Now you tell me

176
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:47,907
to die?

177
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:57,027
You brought that remnant home.

178
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,068
I just wanted to see his jade pendant

179
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,588
and accidentally pushed him.

180
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:04,308
He fell into the water himself.

181
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,267
Yet you wanted your own son

182
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:09,667
to take the blame?

183
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,907
He's the imperial prince!

184
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:22,108
When you pushed him,

185
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:24,428
he was only seven.

186
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:27,787
After we saved him,

187
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:30,627
he lay unconscious for three days

188
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:34,228
and lost all memories.

189
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:38,547
So,

190
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,387
all these years,

191
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:43,547
you've made me

192
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:45,948
away from home

193
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:48,828
and my family.

194
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:52,507
Father,

195
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:55,787
Nuannuan and I are twins.

196
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:58,948
When we're kids,

197
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:01,627
she was closest to me.

198
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,667
But now?

199
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,108
Have you forgotten

200
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,747
when you last saw me

201
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:12,547
and what Mother's dying words are?

202
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,108
Have I ever complained?

203
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:20,787
Father.

204
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,948
The former Crown Prince is dead.

205
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:28,267
Late Empress,

206
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:33,507
I've failed your trust.

207
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:40,907
Now,

208
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,747
we failed to protect
the former Crown Prince.

209
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,027
But at least, we protect the Xue family.

210
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,588
I've survived all these years

211
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,348
just for the Xue family.

212
00:11:58,988 --> 00:11:59,428
Father,

213
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:05,667
I'm now the Emperor's trusted immortal.

214
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,588
We can use this

215
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,108
to save our family.

216
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,348
(I'm the former Crown Prince.)

217
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:25,547
(I'm)

218
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,588
(the Young Master
that Feng Zuoren mentioned.)

219
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,011
(Xue Family Ancestral Shrine)

220
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:52,744
(Hexu, Seventh Generation)

221
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,147
I'm Xue Hexu,

222
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:56,627
here to greet.

223
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,188
Are you really Hexu?

224
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,267
I thought you were dead.

225
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,024
Grandmother.

226
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,308
It's me.

227
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:26,188
Sorry for deceiving you.

228
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,468
Please forgive me.

229
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:38,828
Alive.

230
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:40,708
It's good then.

231
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:42,667
It's good then.

232
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:43,708
Grandmother.

233
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,147
I feigned death this time

234
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:49,428
and accidentally knew something.

235
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,667
I need to ask you.

236
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:51,988
Please sit.

237
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:53,747
Come on.

238
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:06,547
I want to know

239
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:08,468
what happened

240
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,308
when I was seven.

241
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:18,787
Back then,

242
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,228
your father often took you
to play in the suburbs.

243
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:26,588
One day, he claimed
you drowned and fell ill.

244
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,948
He said you needed to recuperate

245
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:30,867
in the south.

246
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,267
That journey

247
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,468
took three years.

248
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,588
You're already ten when you returned.

249
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,667
In these three years,

250
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,267
you never saw me once?

251
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,547
Your father said
you were cursed by the River God,

252
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:53,468
fearing we would offend the deity.

253
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,907
So no one was allowed to visit you.

254
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,108
Nuannuan cried so hard,

255
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:00,787
yet he still didn't allow.

256
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:02,428
I hired a carriage

257
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,588
traveling day and night,

258
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:07,747
yet he intercepted me halfway.

259
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,588
Well,

260
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:11,867
no one ever saw you.

261
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,228
When I returned after three years,

262
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,428
did you notice something?

263
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,988
What do you know?

264
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:32,228
I am not

265
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:35,988
the son of the Xue family.

266
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,027
Father hides the truth

267
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:41,228
that he switched me

268
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,068
with the real Hexu.

269
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:53,108
Between ages seven to ten,

270
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,387
children's features change drastically.

271
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,428
But connected by blood,

272
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,108
how could I not recognize

273
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,188
my own grandson?

274
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:06,627
Yet your father

275
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:08,428
kept insisting

276
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,027
you were Xue Hexu.

277
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:11,547
I knew

278
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,068
he always acts prudently,

279
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:16,147
never acts recklessly.

280
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,267
No matter how I questioned him,

281
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,948
he kept claiming

282
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:21,907
you were my real grandson.

283
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,507
Who are you exactly?

284
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,308
I'm the one

285
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,428
who repeatedly puts
the Xue family in danger,

286
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,108
drawing the Emperor's suspicion.

287
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,387
You are

288
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:58,387
the former Crown Prince, Jia Xun?

289
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:06,067
Why did you hide this from me?

290
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:11,188
I...

291
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,587
I never hide this from you.

292
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,468
At seven, I fell into water

293
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,628
and lost my memories.

294
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:22,388
Father seized this chance

295
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:24,948
to swap me

296
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,148
with the real Hexu,

297
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,948
and asked him to leave,

298
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:29,908
pretending to be me.

299
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,107
Even now,

300
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,267
my memories are still missing.

301
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:39,988
I overheard

302
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,708
all this

303
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,988
during Father's argument

304
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,188
with the real Hexu.

305
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:53,908
Then where is the real Xue Hexu,

306
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:56,908
my grandson?

307
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,868
He's that Mr. Immortal
who came to our house.

308
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:01,908
Father named him

309
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,547
Xue Youshou.

310
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:06,747
What?

311
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,948
That hypocritical,

312
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,507
swindling charlatan?

313
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:17,228
What's going on?

314
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:21,267
Grandmother.

315
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:23,507
It's a long story.

316
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:25,988
What the Xue family suffers

317
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:28,908
stems from Father saving me years ago.

318
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:30,587
Now,

319
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,347
traitors manipulating the court

320
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:34,148
know my identity.

321
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,347
That's why I feigned my death.

322
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:38,787
I came to you

323
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,267
only to ask you for favors.

324
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:43,148
First,

325
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,107
I thought I wasn't good enough,

326
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,267
so you

327
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,388
always went against me.

328
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:53,107
Never imagined

329
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,027
you noticed something wrong back then.

330
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,428
So you've also been kept in the dark.

331
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,547
You only thought

332
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,948
I was distant and indifferent to you.

333
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,652
♪A kiss through gazes♪

But I never realized

336
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,428
you've endured the pain
of losing your grandson.

337
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,468
Yet still entrusted me
with managing the Xue family.

But every time I see you,

00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,107
it reminds me of my grandson.

you're innocent.

You are in grave danger,

This is Old Zhang,
my maternal family's longtime servant.

He's utterly loyal to us

368
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:05,747
and has never entered Xue Mansion.

369
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:08,228
No risk of recognition.

370
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:11,747
He is honest and quiet,

375
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,228

376
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:22,868
Grandmother, thank you.

You're not young anymore.

389
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:00,428
Do you still love Ms. Wang?

390
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:06,988
Since she joined our family,

391
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,908
she's fulfilled her role as a madam.

392
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,668
Dongyang and Nuannuan really like her.

393
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,868
She's straightforward,

394
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,027
sincere,

395
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:19,388
and kind.

396
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,267
But she's no suitable match for you.

397
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:40,668
Excuse me.

398
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:42,787
Anyone here?

399
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:52,868
You must be Mr. He. Please come in.

400
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:55,195
(Villa)

401
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,708
You must be Old Zhang and Miss Hua.

402
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:03,747
Madam Xue sent me here

403
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:04,948
for exam preparation.

404
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,307
I'm He Yandao.

405
00:23:07,827 --> 00:23:09,428
We understand your purpose.

406
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:10,628
We will surely

407
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:11,908
treat you well.

408
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:29,067
(Grandmother said Old Zhang is quiet)

409
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:29,988
(and never gossips.)

410
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:31,587
(So he's mute.)

411
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:34,067
Where is your hometown?

412
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:35,428
Any siblings?

413
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:37,148
From Chang'an.

414
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,188
Two siblings and I.

415
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:40,107
I'm the second.

416
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:43,587
(When will you take the exams?)

417
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,228
Are you betrothed?

418
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:50,468
Not yet.

419
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:52,067
(Wait.)

420
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:53,468
(I want to ask)

421
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,107
(when you'll depart for the exams.)

422
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,148
Any crush?

423
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:00,148
(No,)

424
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:01,507
(my daughter talks nonsense.)

425
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:02,228
(Sorry.)

426
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:03,388
I'll help you.

427
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:21,787
Mr. He.

428
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:26,868
I damaged your kite,

429
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:28,307
and I should fix it.

430
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:29,307
Never expected

431
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:30,948
you have such skilled hands.

432
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,708
There's a word on the kite.

433
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:46,787
From an old friend.

434
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,547
Your crush?

435
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,067
Then I'll become your crush too,

436
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,107
and leave my name on the kite.

437
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:00,547
I'll bring your meal.

438
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:04,988
Wait, what?

439
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:23,808
(Clue Diagram, Feng Zuoren)

440
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:30,027
Xue Youshou, oh Xue Youshou.

441
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:32,307
You've impersonated me,

442
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:33,908
lured me to my death,

443
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:34,908
and deceived Feng.

444
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:37,027
