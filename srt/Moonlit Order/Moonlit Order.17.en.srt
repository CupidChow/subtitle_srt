Oh my.

21
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,176
Why didn't you go to Liang?

22
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,080
It's not the right time yet.

23
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,280
The Xue family is still in crisis.

24
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,040
How's it going?

25
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,719
Young Master did well

26
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,320
and exhausted all means

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,600
to win Emperor Jia's trust.

28
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,160
He might even cure him.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,679
Xue Youshou has infiltrated
Emperor Jia's inner circle

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,799
with two objectives.

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,399
First, to buy time.

32
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,080
Secondly...

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,040
Could he have other motives?

34
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,839
(Xue Youshou is impersonating)

35
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,160
(your Young Master.)

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,679
(But I can't expose him yet.)

37
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,239
(Unfortunately, I can't recall)

38
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,119
(anything from our past.)

39
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,999
I was ordered

40
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,920
to kill your entire family.

41
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,360
But Young Master

42
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,920
suggested His Majesty avoid bloodshed.

43
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,719
Thus, it was postponed.

44
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,559
Emperor Jia was gravely ill.

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
How is he doing?

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,999
Thanks to Young Master,

47
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,600
His Majesty has been improving.

48
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,959
So, the key to saving the Xue family

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,279
lies in fully restoring
Emperor Jia's health

50
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:10,040
so the Crown Prince
can inherit the throne.

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,719
That's right.

52
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,839
Young Master is struggling.

53
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,839
This can't last forever.

54
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,679
You keep praising your Young Master

55
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,640
as if I'm not here.

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,320
Why are you shouting?

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,119
I'm not shouting.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,799
I'm reminding you

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,119
that you also have me.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,839
(You only care about that imposter,)

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,880
(ignoring the real one before you.)

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,999
(Fine.)

63
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,559
(Helping him is helping myself.)

64
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,320
Two people are

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,239
better than one.

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,239
Come and see.

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
I knew you were full of tricks.

73
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,279
Not yet.

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,160
There's more.

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,719
Look.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,760
Monk robe,

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,279
Daoist robe, Western attire.

78
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,200
All here.

79
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,800
You'll look convincing

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in any of these.

81
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
Proficient in both Eastern
and Western studies.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,959
Let me remind you.

83
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,120
Keep your distance from Xue Youshou

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
in the palace.

85
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,359
Don't be exposed.

86
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,680
I need your lecture?

87
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,680
Obviously you do.

88
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,760
You're making eyes

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,399
at each other.

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,839
Watch it.

91
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,599
You're making eyes

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,359
at me.

93
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:06,159
Yeah.

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
That's right.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,919
Because I like you.

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,399
Why else would I hide?

97
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,000
It blows our cover if others find out

98
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm into you.

99
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,159
Smooth talker.

100
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,959
Are you abandoning me

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
because of him?

102
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,039
What's the next plan?

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,640
The plan

104
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
is...

105
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,440
There is none.

106
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:25,760
Your Majesty.

107
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,320
After a day and night of exorcism,

108
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,640
the stars indicate that

109
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,599
the evil influence

110
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,399
is mostly purged.

111
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,399
Good.

112
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,279
Next,

113
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,399
I'll help Your Majesty

114
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,159
activate your vitality

115
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,399
to eradicate all illness.

116

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,000
Can I

118
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,719
truly recover?

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,864
(Young Master.)

120
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,200
(Offer His Majesty
psychological guidance.)

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,320
(Make him believe)

122
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,519
(he's the true chosen ruler)

123
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,839
(to bring him inner joy.)

124
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,839
Your Majesty.

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,479
Observe this Western crystal sphere.

126
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,560
Why are you suddenly worked up?

127
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,784
Your Majesty,

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,519
I behold your extraordinary leadership

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
within the crystal's radiance.

130
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,039
You shine like brilliant sunlight,

131
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,640
casting glorious illumination
upon the masses,

132
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,000
earning natural reverence and devotion.

133
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,919
Each decree you issue

134
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,800
shapes the welfare of all living beings.

135
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,159
Your wisdom and valor

136
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,959
form the cornerstone
of our thriving nation.

137
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,240
Really?

138
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:53,279
However,

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,800
within this brilliance,

140
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,479
I detect threads of concern.

141
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
Your pursuit of perfection sets

142
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,599
unattainable standards.

143
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,560
Naturally,

144
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,440
this fuels your greatness.

145
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:12,880
However,

146
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,880
excessive anxiety

147
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,719
and relentless governance

148
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,959
consume you day and night.

149
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
You are absolutely right.

150
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,200
Sleepless nights plague me.

151
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,320
In this crystal's glow,

152
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,160
I witness your passion

153
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,599
propelling you forward

154
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,520
toward greater glories.

155
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,119
I will achieve

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,999
greater glories?

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
(Make him believe)

158
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:53,440
(his reign will last millennia.)

159
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:54,560
Your Majesty,

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,560
through this crystal's luminescence,

161
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,879
I foresee your sovereignty

162
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
enduring as sunlight,

163
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,040
inextinguishable.

164
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
It shall illuminate

165
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,520
for a millennium

166
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,759
and eternity.

167
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,479
Your counsel

168
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
enlightens me.

169
00:09:58,839 --> 00:09:59,320
This...

170
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,479
This...

171
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,560
This is way too heavy.

172
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
You got this, Your Majesty.

173
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,400
Astounding!

174
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,440
Your robust health is a blessing

175
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,759
to the nation.

176
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:12,999
Impressive.

177
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,752
Young Master.

178
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,119
You've spent hours here

179
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,160
examining shadows.

180
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Is it a shadow play?

181
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,239
No.

182
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,320
It's a method of

183
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
Western divination.

184
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,560
Fascinating.

185
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:40,759
May I try it?

186
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,560
Certainly.

187
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:43,400
Come here.

188
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,680
Sit.

189
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,280
Place your hand on the paper.

190
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,999
Now,

191
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll trace

192
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,359
the outline of your palm with ink.

193
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,639
What a leisurely time.

194
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,920
Who are you?

195
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,959
You're too old

196
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,879
to be excused

197
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:14,959
for barging in.

198
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,119
Take it easy.

199
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,128
We're allies.

200
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,359
She's not my ally.

201
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,200
Indeed.

202
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,160
We're not allies.

203
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,200
How rude of you

204
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:22,800
to just barge in.

205
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,800
Oh my.

206
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,639
Put your swords away.

207
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,520
It's freaky.

208
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,879
Who is this young woman?

209
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,320
I asked Miss Hua

210
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
to examine Emperor Jia's remedy.

211
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Does it really

212
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,160
require physical contact?

213
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,080
I was tracing

214
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,200
her palm outline.

215
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,440
Come and see.

216
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:51,920
Sit.

217
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,839
Put your hand here.

218
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,759
Now I'll trace

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,599
the outlines of your palm.

220
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,759
Do you have to

221
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,879
be so close to me?

222
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,680
This is the key to the treatment.

223
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,400
See anything?

224
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:40,520
Look.

225
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:41,680
Your fate

226
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
is filled with twists and hardships.

227
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,320
This means your life

228
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,839
is full of challenges.

229
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,479
But when facing adversity,

230
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,040
you never retreat.

231
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,320
You overcome every obstacle

232
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,680
with your wisdom.

233
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
That's so accurate.

to you?

237
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,959
You know the answer.

238
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah.

239
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,280
Young Master matters

240
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,759
more than me now.

241
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,719
But think carefully.

242
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,639
Who is the most crucial person

243
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,759

aren't you?

256
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,959
Come on.

257
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,200
That's the treatment.

258
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,320
The key lies here.

259
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,080
You make up something
based on the other person's

260
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,200
reaction.

261
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,520
Xue Youshou is a master of deception.

262
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,320
He got this.

263
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,759
Young Master is not like that.

264
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,280
People

265
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,440
change.

266
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,560
You haven't

267
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,719
seen him for years.

268
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,879
Look at you.

269
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,839
You have

270
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,639
become Emperor Jia's pawn,

271
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,479
nearly killing him.

272
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,400
Meanwhile,

273
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,759
he hid the fact

274
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,719
that he was Mr. Immortal,

275
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,119
proving he never trusted you.

276
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,440
You'd better

277
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,719
stay vigilant.

278
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,400
He is simply cautious.

279
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,119
Unlike you,

280
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,920
careless.

281
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,639
Indeed.

282
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I can't match him.

283
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,160
That's why I willingly

284
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,239
withdraw from this love rival.

285
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,560
Miss Hua

286
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,368
is Old Zhang's granddaughter.

287
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,400
My grandmother introduced her to me.

288
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,719
Now that you've found Young Master,

289
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,040
I won't pester you.

290
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,200
I won't be

291
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,639
overbearing.

292
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
You still indulge in

293
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,879
romantic notions at this point?

294
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,520
I didn't

295
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,040
hold anyone back.

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,599
Look.

297
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
I've found the remedy.

298
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,440
Your Majesty,

299
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,480
look at your palm outline.

300
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,800
A winding yet unyielding fate line

301
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,720
reveals a life full of challenges.

302
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,879
But your willpower
surpasses ordinary people.

303
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,199
A mere palm outline

304
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,520
reveals so much?

305
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,159
The line remains distinct

306
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:22,919
when folded thrice.

307
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,960
That means, when facing peril,

308
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,480
you never back down.

309
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,520
You overcome every obstacle
with your tenacious resolve

310
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:31,439
and wisdom.

311
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,080
With such a ruler,

312
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,040
the nation prospers and people rejoice.

313
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,199
I've sacrificed immensely

314
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,560
for this nation.

315
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,040
Your Majesty,

316
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,080
keep it close to your heart.

317
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,720
This symbolizes

318
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,560
the realm lying firmly in your grasp.

319
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,960
Why do you seem so gloomy?

320
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,000
This charade

321
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,720
is just for morale-boosting.

322
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:45,639
What a fraud.

323
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,760
It's a necessary expedient.

324
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,480
Yesh.

325
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,679
Deception

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,359
isn't a sustainable path.

327
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,800
Of course.

328
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,480
Thank you for working

329
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,520
with me.

330
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,080
Right.

331
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,599
Have you imagined

332
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:06,399
your desired life?

333
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,199
I have.

334
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,320
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

335
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,520
It was on this very day

336
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,919
that we parted.

337
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,119
We've finally reunited.

338
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,320
I won't part with you again.

339
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,439
From now on,

340
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,520
I wish to celebrate

341
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,760
this festival with you forever.

342
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,119
Young Master.

343
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,560
Let's focus on getting out

344
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
of trouble for now.

345
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,119
Alright.

346
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,760
Here's a gift for you.

347
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,919
You've been restless these days.

348
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:44,040
I put some

349
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,839
tranquilizing herbs in it.

350
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,119
Keep it with you

351
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,000
to feel better.

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,560
Thank you.

353
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,800
Trust me.

354
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,480
We will eventually

355
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,280
be together.

356
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:37,864
Young Master.

357
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,280
Happy festival.

358
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,839
Wine among the flowers.

359
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,240
It's perfect for two people.

360
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,800
This is to you.

361
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,800
Alright.

362
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,119
Miss Hua.

363
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,359
To the moon.

364
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,080
To our hometown.

365
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:09,800
I toast

366
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:11,839
to you, Miss Hua.

367
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,119
That was lyrical.

368
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,399
Why don't you drink first?

369
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,879
Alright.

370
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,760
Young Master.

371
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,159
Why isn't your beloved one

372
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
celebrating this festival

373
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
with you?

374
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,119
Forget it.

375
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,359
Let's drink

376
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,679
to the brilliant

377
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,839
moonlight.

378
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:49,919
Alright.

379
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,159
Cheers.

380
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:12,960
Already?

381
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,679
(Well, Xue Hexu.)

382
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
(I rushed to bring you food from home.)

383
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,159
(But you are)

384
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,080
(having so much fun with her.)

385
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,080
(What a lecher.)

386
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:45,839
(How dare you grope her?)

387
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,280
(She has feelings for you.)

388
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,960
(So you just sweet-talked her.)

389
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,280
Miss Hua.

390
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,159
I'm in love with someone.

391
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,159
I'm not sure

392
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,080
whether she likes me.

393
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,800
But she is

394
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,439
the love of my life.

395
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,119
True love is worth cherishing.

396
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,240
You should keep your love

397
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,919
for someone who cherishes you.

398
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,696
Why are you here?

399
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,000
Grandmother asked me

400
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,760
to bring you some food.

401
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:40,919
Let's go.

402
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,879
Your favorite.

403
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,320
All I wish is to be with you

404
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,960
in a humble home.

405
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,240
I have you

406
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,399
and Grandmother.

407
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,520
But Youshou is all alone.

408
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,599
No wonder.

409
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,720
No wonder what?

410
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
(His drive is on another level.)

411
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,159
(His mind is hard to read.)

412
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,800
(Unless you're him,)

413
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,480
(you can't figure out his plans.)

414
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,199
No wonder

415
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,599
he'd rather die

416
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,879
than keep hiding.

417
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,480
Want to go out?

418
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,280
Let's lay low.

419
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,760
Where to?

420
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,359
I want to visit

421
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,080
where you and Young Master stayed.

422
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,720
What for?

423
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,879
I want to know

424
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,159
how I lost to him.
