Stop!

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,820
I believe now.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,780
I believe you, okay?

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,100
I haven't even started.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,660
Are we ending it already?

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,540
I've failed to recognize the hero.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,180
Your martial art skill is good
and you're the best in the world.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,860
It was a misunderstanding.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,540
(Mr. Matchmaker, you've set me up.)

12

(Since his health has no problem,)

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,420
(everything else will be easy.)

(Have I gone too far just now?)

17

(Although this woman is crazy,)

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,540
(she's a young lady after all.)

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,660
Young Master.

20
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,987
There's something in my eye.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,460
Can you blow it for me?

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,860
Is it better now?

23
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,542
It's better now.
Thank you, Young Master.

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,820
Get lost then.

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,090
Servant.

26
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:30,838
Is there any order, Young Master?

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,460
Have someone investigate
the background of Qiao Chuchu.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,060
The more detailed, the better.

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,780
Yes. I'll do it right now.

Your Highness.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,740
The spy reported that

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,660
Li Wuyou has

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,500
a woman now.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,900
They're very close and intimate.

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,820
We're investigating
the identity of this woman.

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,900
I think this person isn't ordinary.

40
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,860
Sir.

41
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,300
My report is done.

42
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:15,134
Stop.

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,060
I get it.

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,980
Stupid.

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,620
The Soul...

46
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:25,459
Soul-Setting Pearl.

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,180
Its... whereabouts?

48
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,420
I was incapable.

49
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,982
I haven't found
the whereabouts of Soul-Setting Pearl.

50
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:33,542
Keep...

51
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:34,397
Keep investigating?

52
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:36,365
Yes.

53
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,380
I understand.

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,540
Scoundrel.

55
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,260
You know my problem.

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,380
Yet you forced me to talk.

57
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,980
Annoying Li Wuyou.

58
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,580
You were mean to me again.

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,180
What a bad temper.

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,780
You don't deserve a wife.

61
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,540
You're wrong.

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,340
Aren't you his wife?

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,260
Who?

64
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:01,892
Who's talking?

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
(Second Prince of Huasheng Empire,
Li Wuming)

66
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,318
You're the one

67
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,100
who spent one night with Wuyou,

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
yet you didn't go crazy or faint.

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,060
Ms. Chuchu.

70
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,540
I'm the second prince
of Huasheng Empire,

71

Li Wuming.

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,580
I don't know you.

73
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,740
Ignorant.

74
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm the champion
of the World Prettiest Boy

75

for three consecutive years

76
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,860
and the best first boyfriend.

and handsome man.

80
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,540
What kind of list is that?

81
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,820
Why is the standard so low?

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,620
I think

83
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,700
you're not as handsome as Li Wuyou.

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,500
What?

85
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,100
