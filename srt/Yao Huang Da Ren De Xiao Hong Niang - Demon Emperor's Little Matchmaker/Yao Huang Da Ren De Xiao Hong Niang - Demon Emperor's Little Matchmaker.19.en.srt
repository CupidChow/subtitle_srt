00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,350
Chuchu.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,900
Oh no, sister-in-law.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,090
Please help me.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,220
Sister-in-law.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,660
Please help me.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,740
Sure. How?

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,320
Aren't you the Little Matchmaker
of Matchmaker's Hall?

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,090
Can you please

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,620
connect the red rope

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,260
between me and Ms. Yueying?

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,740
Turns out you

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,500
like Ms. Yueying.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,340
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,580
I, Qiao Chuchu,

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,140
am the best matchmaker.

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,640
Later,

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,020
I'll pretend to be
a thief and ambush her.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,860
You'll take the chance to save her.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,580
Remember,

22
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,610
you must be fast.

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,450
Would this work?

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,120
The best way to make a woman love you

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,780
is this.

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,430
But aren't you...

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,800
Don't worry. I'm experienced.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,570
Look forward to winning her heart.

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,420
Your Highness.

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,910
Ms. Chuchu.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,060
Why are you here?

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,980
Yueying, I...

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,530
Why don't

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,950
you save

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,150
the Second Prince first?

36
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,630
My plan was

37
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,390
supposed to be perfect.

38
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,250
It was the Second Prince's fault.

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,450
You were too unlucky.

40
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,420
She was the one who saved you.

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,620
I couldn't save the beauty,
instead, I was saved by her.

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,140
A hero is doomed to be lonely.

43
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
It's okay.

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,660
We failed this time,

45
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,590
we'll find another way next time.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,140
Am I fated to turn old and die alone?

47
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,030
God, why are you so ruthless?

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,470
Do you know your crying is fake?
Stop crying.

49
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,790
Let me ask you seriously.

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,690
If Yueying keeps rejecting you,

51
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,590
would you marry a woman from
a noble family as the empress wishes?

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,450
Of course not.

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,480
But what if Her Majesty doesn't agree?

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,810
I, Li Wuming, swear

55
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,700
that I'll marry
no one else but Rong Yueying.

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,410
Unfilial son!

57
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,910
What nonsense were you talking about?

58
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,220
I would like to marry Rong Yueying.

59
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,690
I hope for your agreement.

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,650
Scoundrel!

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,350
I think you're obsessed.

62
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,800
You're the Prince of Huasheng Empire.

63
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,260
You're free to choose
any daughter of any noble family.

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,280
Yet you want to choose a lowly woman

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
with an unknown background.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Mother.

67
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,930
I've decided.

68
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,500
Let's talk about this when you get her.

69
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,970
A marriage

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,980
can't be decided by one person.

72
