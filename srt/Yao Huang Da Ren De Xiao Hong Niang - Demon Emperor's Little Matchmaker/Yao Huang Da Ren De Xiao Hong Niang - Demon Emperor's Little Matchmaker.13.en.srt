Charge!

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,090
You're overconfident.

5
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,530
I was about to find
someone to vent my anger.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,100
Li Wuyou.

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,170
What's wrong?

8
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,690
Nothing.

(I'm totally defeated.)

00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,930
What aren't you moving, rubbish?

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,010
Charge!

Retreat!

18
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,530
Young Master, are you okay?

19
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,250
I'm fine.

20
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,970
Find out where they're from.

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,650
Roger. Let's go.

22

Young Master, how are you?

23

I'm fine.

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,810
Young Master.

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,410
Young Master.

26
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,010
Young Master.

27

Are you feeling better?

I'm feeling hot.

29
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,210
Very hot.

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,210
(It seems his condition
is very serious this time.)

Don't go.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,530
It's dangerous out there, Chuchu.

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,090
(He's in such a condition,)

35
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,090
(yet he's worried about my safety.)

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,970
Why is this little monster

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,850
out here again?

38
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,090
Nonsense! I'm not a little monster.

39
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,170
Your father is a big monster.

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,290
(Little Wuyou)
And he created you, a little monster.

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,050
(Little Wuyou)
You and your father

42
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,650
worked together
to kill Princess Mingzhu.

43

-The monster is about to kill.

Uncle.

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,370
Servant.

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,330
Take him away.

48
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,930
Send Young Master Wuyou
back to the courtyard.

49
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,290
Guard him strictly.

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:10,930
Look after him.

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,570
I'm not a monster.

53
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,090
I'm really not a monster.

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,210
Not a monster.

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,650
Li Wuyou, wake up.

56
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,370
Li Wuyou, wake up.

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,650
Chuchu.

58
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,850
Don't leave me.

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,130
Okay.

60
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,970
I promise you,

61
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,010
I'll never leave you again.

62
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,010
I'll never push you
to other women anymore.

63
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,090
