00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,220
It's...

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,450
im... impossible.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,040
You were cursed by

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,180
Demon Prince.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,390
It's impossible that you're still fine.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,350
It was indeed your doing.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,540
Your curse

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,480
must have been an unverified product.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,230
It was useless against me.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,520
Im... impossible.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,150
Unless...

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,950
Unless

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,600
you have the Soul-Setting Pearl

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,230
and you could repel the curse.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,730
That's not right, Sir.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,690
Did I translate it wrongly?

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,670
Doesn't...

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,950
Doesn't exist!

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,960
Hey!

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,900
What are you mumbling?

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,140
Are you going to fight?

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,900
Let's fight.

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,700
(Qiushui Court)

26

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,020
Sir.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,480
It looks like we can't defeat them.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,190
Let's go.

31
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,840
Let's go.

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,170
Stop pursuing.

33
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,530
Hubby.

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,530
You're amazing.

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,570
You defeated them in just two strikes.

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,480
Of course.

37
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,960
Well, look at how great your hubby is.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Young Master.

39
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,040
Hubby, how are you?

40
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,630
Hubby, wake up.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,270
Yueying, how's Li Wuyou?

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,010
Young Master is very weak.

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,190
His essence is unstable.

44
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,310
I'm afraid he's dying.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,230
It's impossible.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,720
Isn't he a half-demon?

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
He's unlike a normal human.

48
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,430
He'll not die so easily.

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,490
Right?

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,000
Yueying, am I right?

51
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,530
The Soul-setting Pearl
is an ancient artifact.

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,560
The previous Demon Emperor

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
transferred all his demonic power to it.

54
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,690
It's very powerful.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Chuchu.

56
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,630
The forbidden spell on him
wasn't neutralized yet.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,280
Using the pearl forcefully

58
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,370
can cause backlash

59
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,470
and it's fatal.

60
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,420
Impossible.

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,270
Li Wuyou, wake up.

62
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,050
Li Wuyou, wake up.

63
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,370
Li Wuyou, didn't you say

64
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,810
that you're going to marry me?

65
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,630
Why are you going
to marry me in this state?

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
Wake up, okay?

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,210
Wake up.

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
Ms. Chuchu.

69
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,740
It's all my fault.

70
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,580
I wasn't good enough.

71
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,440
I didn't manage to protect Young Master.

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,250
It's my fault, Ms. Chuchu.

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
It's not your fault.

74
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,670
At this point,

75
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,430
other than Daluo Jinxian,

76
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,060
no one can save him.

77
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,390
Daluo Jinxian?

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,970
That's right.

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,480
Mr. Matchmaker is also an immortal.

80
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,970
And also Taibai Jinxing.

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
They can save Li Wuyou for sure.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,160
Take good care of Li Wuyou.

83
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,310
Wait for me.
