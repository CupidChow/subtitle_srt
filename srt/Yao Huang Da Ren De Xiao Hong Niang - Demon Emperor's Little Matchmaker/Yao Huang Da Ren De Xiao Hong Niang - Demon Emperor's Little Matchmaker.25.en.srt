3
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,950
Li Wuyou, you're awake.

4
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,390
You're really awake.

5
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,380
Mr. Matchmaker is finally reliable.

6
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,210
Chuchu.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,100
Was it worth it
to sacrifice so much for me?

8
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,930
You found out all about it?

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,110
Li Wuyou.

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,360
Don't feel psychologically burdened.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,460
It was my will.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,700
Otherwise,

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,010
you can also

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,010
be my slave.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,110
Care for me and love me every day.

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,960
Give me all your money
and do all the housework.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,350
Remember all the anniversaries.

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,260
Okay. I promise you.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,750
Don't you need some time to consider?

20
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,070
Of course not.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,920
Time's up.

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,250
Chuchu, I, Li Wuyou, swear

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,530
that I'll be your man when I'm alive

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,990
and your ghost when I'm dead.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,900
I'll never leave you.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,950
Same for me.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,670
What does it mean?

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,140
It means...

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,570
Let's get married soon.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,910
Then I'll have Wuming

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,240
choose an auspicious day

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,490
so we can get married soon.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,180
What auspicious day?

34
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,730
Why wait further?

35
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,350
Let's get married today.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,480
I'll let Yueying and the rest know.

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,620
So soon?

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,350
The bride and the groom
bow to heaven and earth.

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,230
Bow to heaven and earth.

40
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,690
Bow to the parents.

41
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,610
Bow to each other.

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,050
The ritual is done.

43
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,820
Okay. It's late now.

44
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,830
Hurry to your bridal chamber.

45
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,510
Sorry.

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,590
Because it was too hasty,

47
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,810
I couldn't organize you a grand wedding.

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,110
It's okay.

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,830
I think this is just right.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,740
Besides, we're now

51
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,940
husband and wife officially.

52
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,620
After all, I've fulfilled

53
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,870
my promise to you then.

54
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,030
What do you mean?

55
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,970
I'll surely find you
someone who loves you

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,240
and understands you.
