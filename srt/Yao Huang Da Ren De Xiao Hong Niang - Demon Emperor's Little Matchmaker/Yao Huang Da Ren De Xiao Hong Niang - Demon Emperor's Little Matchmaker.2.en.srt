3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,560
Doesn't everyone
in Huasheng Empire know about it?

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,760
The romantic love story
between your mother,

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,960
Princess Mingzhu,
and your father, the Demon Emperor.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,880
It's the trendiest book
in the bookstore.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,200
Three for two.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,600
Young Master, you're hurting me.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
(This woman isn't simple.)

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,480
(Let's see how long you can pretend.)

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,760
Don't come near.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,240
What are you doing?

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,320
Zhang San, Li Si.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,200
Get to work.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,880
You, demon!

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,600
Okay.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,800
Let go.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,760
Sir.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,200
Sir, carry on.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,600
We didn't see anything.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,080
Young Master, I didn't see anything.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,280
Get out.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Roger.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,560
Let's go.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,280
Young Master, let me go.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,960
I didn't come here to sleep with you.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
I see.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,360
Tell me, what other purpose do you have?

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
I'd rather die than tell you.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,960
You're stubborn.

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
Don't blame me for being rude.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,200
(Curse you!)

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,440
(Why must it happen now?)

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,440
What's going on with you?

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,040
It's so hot.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,960
Are you feeling hot?

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,680
My body temperature
is lower than normal people.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,600
Maybe you'll feel better with me.

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,640
(Why is this woman so cooling?)

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,360
(It's so comfortable.)

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,600
Are you feeling better now?

42
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
(He fell asleep.)

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,360
(He pretends to be fierce.)

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
(Turns out he's
just a sick, pretty boy.)

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,480
(I knew that
Mr. Matchmaker is unreliable.)

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,160
(Matchmaker's Hall)

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
(Little Matchmaker of Matchmaker's Hall,
Qiao Chuchu)

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,440
Mr. Matchmaker, you're back.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,920
Mr. Matchmaker, listen.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,240
(Matchmaker)
I've met a really rare pair...

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,640
Oh my.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh my.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Say something.

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
Oh my.

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
Stop drinking.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,360
Tell me,

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
Did Taibai Jinxing bully you again?

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Nonsense.

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
Would I be afraid of that old man?

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
He's just a tiny follower
of Jade Emperor.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He's no match to me,

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,280
an immortal
who's in charge of all the marriages.

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm the Matchmaker after all.

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,520
Who made you angry then?

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
All because of Li Wuyou.

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,600
Li Wuyou?

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Li Wuyou is the future Demon Emperor.

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,280
But it hasn't been confirmed yet.

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,760
I owed the old Demon Emperor a favor.

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,640
I promised to get
his son a happy marriage.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
But not only that Li Wuyou

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,720
is a half-demon,

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,520
but he also doesn't have any love roots.

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
What should I do?

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,400
What is there to worry about?

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,520
If he doesn't have love roots,
just plant him one.

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,880
Do you think it's a tree?

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,400
Even if you plant it,
it doesn't necessarily grow.

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,680
If it grows, it may not blossom.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,520
If it blossoms, it may not bear fruits.

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
Chuchu.

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,000
Li Wuyou is cool and heartless.

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,920
His temper is worse than his mother's.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
You even know his mother?

85
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
Let's talk about that next time.

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
To make him fall in love

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,120
is as hard as forcing him to die.

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
Is it that bad?

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,520
Poor me. Because of this,

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,040
I went bald at the age of 2000.

91
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,680
I may lose this beard soon.

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Whoever can help me with this

93
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll hire her

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,400
as the official Little Matchmaker
of Matchmaker's Hall.

95
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
Mr. Matchmaker.

96
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Here, have a drink.

97
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,000
Well,

98
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,160
what do you think about me?

99
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,000
