=Episode 10=

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,320
Oh no, this time you must...

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,120
Sorry, I didn't know you're...

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,640
Carry on. I'll be back later.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,640
No need.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,760
Chuchu, go back for now.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,880
Remember to come over
to massage me tonight.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,106
Okay.

10
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:53,044
Stop looking.

11
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:54,547
She's long gone.

12
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,404
I didn't expect
Ms. Chuchu to be so attractive.

13
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,324
She could even break this big iceberg.

14
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:08,084
Have you two...

15
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:09,284
Have we what?

16
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:12,244
Wuyou.

17
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:15,724
Stop pretending.

18
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:17,204
You have good connections
outside the palace.

19
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,124
Investigate the source
of this red rope for me.

20
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:21,244
No problem.

21
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:22,704
Another thing,

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,632
stop being busybody.

23
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,806
But you must promise me one thing.

24
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:28,646
No way.

25
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:31,444
I haven't even mentioned what it is.

26
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,644
You're too quick in rejecting.

27
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:34,684
Ms. Chuchu.

28
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:36,484
Yueying.

29
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:38,524
Thank you, Ms. Chuchu.

30
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,164
Thank me?

31
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:42,324
Since you're here,

32
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,884
Young Master has changed.

33
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,858
Really?

34
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:48,644
But he still looks cool to me.

35
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:50,324
I've been following
Young Master for many years.

36
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,284
I've never seen him so cheerful

37
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:53,755
and personable.

38
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:56,164
It's all your credit, Ms. Chuchu.

39
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:57,404
How...

40
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,964
How was he then?

41
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:06,637
I know what you want to say.

42
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,884
Rong family has been protecting
the Demon Emperors for generations.

43
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,484
They've protected us
for over a thousand years.

44
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,924
Yueying isn't just my servant,

45
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,764
she's also my family.

46
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:22,844
Hence unless she agrees,

47
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:25,484
I won't give her to anyone.

48
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:35,384
Your Majesty.

49
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,286
Your Majesty.

50
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:43,175
It's the Empress.

51
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,417
What's the matter?

52
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:50,044
Your Majesty.

53
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:53,124
The matter in the courtyard is settled.

54
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:56,244
We've fulfilled my duty

55
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:59,444
and we're not sorry to the late princess.

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,820
I get it.

57
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:05,884
In fact,

58
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:07,924
it's difficult for the girl.

59
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:09,284
Should we

60
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:11,204
reward her with more jewelries?

61
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,724
Do as you see fit.

62
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:18,364
Your Majesty, there's another thing.

63
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:21,084
Our second son, Wuming,

64
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:23,204
is at the age of marriage now.

65
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:25,324
Your birthday will be in a few days.

66
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,164
I wonder if we should

67
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:30,204
invite the daughter
of the prime minister over...

68
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,564
I get it.

69
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,906
Do as you see fit.

70
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,506
Yes, Your Majesty.

71
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,783
I see.

72
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,319
(No wonder Li Wuyou
has such an indifferent and sad look.)

73
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:58,183
(Turns out he has been very lonely.)

74
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,684
(Since Ms. Yueying
cares so much about Li Wuyou,)

75
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:06,404
(I wonder if the two of them...)

76
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:08,964
Ms. Chuchu.

77
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:10,924
Ms. Chuchu.

78
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:13,204
Ms. Chuchu.

79
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,524
I can tell that
Young Master likes you a lot.

80
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:16,926
Please...

81
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:19,422
make him happy, okay?

82
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:21,804
You said he likes

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,804
me?
