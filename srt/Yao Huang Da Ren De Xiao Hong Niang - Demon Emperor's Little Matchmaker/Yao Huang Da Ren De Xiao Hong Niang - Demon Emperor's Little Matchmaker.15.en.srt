3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,790
Sir.

4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,070
Congratulations, Sir.

5
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,390
You achieved great power.

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,590
You'll conquered the three realms

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,080
in no time.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,840
I led some people to ambush Li Wuyou.

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,040
I failed.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,080
We were even injured by his guards.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,120
Sir.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,760
I was close to
not being able to come back

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,610
to see you.

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,990
Stupid!

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,590
However,

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,960
Li Wuyou was injured by
the magic staff which has demonic power.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,120
It proved that

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,020
Soul-Setting Pearl is not with him.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,240
I also found a new piece of information.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,240
Perhaps it's useful for you, Sir.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,760
Speak.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,800
In the past few days,

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,640
Li Wuming was inquiring everywhere

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,450
about the Love Rope
from Matchmaker's Hall.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,440
I think this is fishy.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Match...

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,480
Match... maker?

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,440
Yes.

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,250
Mingzhu.

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,590
Could I have

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,370
really done wrong?

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,150
Ms. Chuchu asked to see Your Majesty.

33
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,730
Let her in.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Your Majesty, I dare to ask you

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
to apologize to your nephew.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760
Wanton!

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
You're a little concubine
who doesn't know a thing.

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,000
How dare you act wildly in front of me?

39
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,390
Servant!

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,880
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,880
Even if I risk the death penalty,

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,300
I must say this.

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,260
Why are you to
put the pain of losing your loved one

44
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,050
on your nephew?

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,950
He's innocent.

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,460
Of course, I know.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,120
But he looks exactly

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
like his father.

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,960
Whenever I see him, I...

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
The dead is gone.

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,580
The best way to commemorate your sister

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,020
is to treat her child well.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Isn't it?

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,600
Are you sure
this is from Matchmaker's Hall?

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm sure.

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,240
This is Love Rope
from Matchmaker's Hall.

57
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,850
It's used to test if you're enamored.

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,970
(She's an immortal. No wonder.)

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,720
Wuyou, what are you planning to do next?

60
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,460
What?

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,800
Qiao Chuchu approaches you
for ulterior motives.

62
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,720
Do you want to keep her by your side?

63
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,090
You're too short-sighted.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,080
I'm too short-sighted?

65
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,260
I shall see further.

66
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,210
Turns out you have...

67
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,780
Wuming, listen up.

68
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,190
My wife

69
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,140
shall be Qiao Chuchu alone.

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,880
The lonely me
feels the ruthless neglect.

71
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,080
My heart aches.

72
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,800
It's so painful
that I can't breathe and sleep.

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,560
Wuyou.

74
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,310
Your acting is bad.

75
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,920
I'm just jealous and envious.

76
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,960
When will Ms. Yueying be like you?

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,840
Young Master.
