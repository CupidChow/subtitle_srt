00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,900
What are you doing?

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,740
Young Master.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
Why are you awake?

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,020
You're drooling like mad.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,867
Do you think I'm dead?

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,100
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,339
Perhaps I focused too much on you.

10
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:45,342
Blame yourself,
you're a feast to one's eyes.

11
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:49,181
What is this?

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,820
Red rope.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,380
I know this is a piece of red rope.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,707
What is this for?

15
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,401
Well...

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,980
You have no idea.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,220
There's a tradition in my hometown.

18
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,043
After putting on this red rope,

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,700
other than keeping
you away from disasters,

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,820
it'll also ensure you a smooth marriage.

21
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:17,637
If that's the case,

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,460
why did you sneak into my room at night

23
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,059
when no one is around?

24
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:25,913
To give you a surprise, of course.

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,860
How was it?

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,620
Are you surprised?

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,740
(This is a normal piece of red rope.)

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,100
(There's no demonic power at all.)

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,220
(Is she speaking the truth?)

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,780
Young Master, let me put it on for you.

31
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,221
After having this,

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,180
perhaps you won't fall ill again.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,547
Besides, perhaps you can find

34
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:50,507
the love of your life soon.

35
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,300
From now on, everything will run smooth.

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,360
Love of my life?

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,740
I don't need this thing.

38
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,812
No. Getting married is good.

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,860
For example?

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,220
When you're happy,

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,380
she'll be happy with you.

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,420
When you're unhappy,

43
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,420
she can comfort and encourage you.

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,180
No matter you're
wealthy or poor, healthy or sick,

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,420
she'll never leave you

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,660
and will always be with you.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,060
Are there so many advantages?

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,260
I promise.

49
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm having a headache.

50
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,940
Give me a massage like last time.

51
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,180
Okay.

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,940
Is it comfortable?

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
Not bad.

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,500

(That's great.)

Where's my Love Rope?

59

That thing is never accurate.

60
