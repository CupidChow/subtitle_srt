3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Ms. Chuchu.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm just a servant.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,440
I don't know anything.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,280
If you want to ask,

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,640
ask the Young Master yourself.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,360
I'm taking my leave.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,080
I'll ask him then.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,306
I'm not afraid of anyone.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,240
Where's your young master?

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,520
Young Master.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,440
Is there anything wrong?

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,280
There's nothing wrong.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,840
However,

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,800
Ms. Chuchu said she has
something important to talk to you.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,280
She's outside.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
Let her in.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,520
Young Master, how are you feeling?

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,880
Last night...

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,160
Is there anything?

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,120
Let's drink some tea first.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,272
Speak up. Don't beat about the bush.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,080
So,

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,480
do you

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,480
have

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,560
a painful topic?

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,320
A painful topic?

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,560
What do you mean?

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,840
I mean...

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,960
Regarding that.

32
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,240
Although we just met last night,

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,760
we're friends after all.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,040
If there's a problem, just let me know.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
We'll figure out a way together.

36
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:50,468
Why do you think...

37
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:54,554
What?

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,640
Why do you think I have a painful topic?

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,080
Last night in the room,

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
you turned into another person suddenly.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
So I guessed...

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
What are you doing?

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,720
Strike!

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
Young Master, I...

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
didn't...

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
see...

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,640
anything.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,280
Get lost!

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
Leave!

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Hurry away.

51
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
I didn't expect

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,880
our young master to be so amazing.

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,120
That's right.

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,000
The two of you.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,520
You're gossiping about Young Master.

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
Do you want to lose your job?

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,920
Leave.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
Roger.

59
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,400
Young Master, what do you want to do?

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,760
I want to prove myself, of course.

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,200
How to prove?

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,920

Don't be afraid.)
