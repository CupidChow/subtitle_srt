=Demon Emperor's Little Matchmaker=

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,820
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,290
At ease.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,020
You have to ask

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,070
what she thinks.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,700
No need to ask.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,840
I say yes.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,660
Yueying.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,080
Yueying.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,920
Young Master
and Ms. Chuchu arranged this.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,220
Are you not interested in
the Second Prince at all?

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,960
I...

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,780
I don't know either.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,090
Why don't you give him an opportunity?

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,650
Our ranks are very different.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,490
Besides,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,480
the men from
the royal family are unfaithful.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,220
Who can guarantee that

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,340
this isn't just
a momentary novelty to him?

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,030
Who cares about the ranks?

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,030
Yueying.

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,900
You're like a sister to me.

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,620
You're more than enough for Li Wuming.

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,110
As for if he's sincere,

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,100
we shall try it out.

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,530
Thank you for
being sincere, Your Highness.

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,690
I...

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,310
will not disappoint you.

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,300
This is a sudden twist.

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,380
Am I dreaming?

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm not dreaming.

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,460
This is real.

34
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,650
No way. I don't agree.

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,150
Unless I'm dead,

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,260
I'll never approve of this marriage.

37
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,100
Your Majesty, say something.

38
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,430
Alright now.

39
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,490
It seems the royal family

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,360
will have a wedding soon.

41
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,430
Wuyou, listen to me.

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,470
Speak up. I'm going to see Chuchu.

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,740
Last night,

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,460
Mother cried and
threatened me with death.

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,320
She made noise until late night.

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
She insists
that I call off the marriage.

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,900
That's your mother.

48
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,020
Figure out something yourself.

49
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:10,900
You...

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,430
You can deal with her better than I do.

51
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,940
Although Mother looks

52
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,780
very formidable usually,

53
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,820
she doesn't even care about my father,

54
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,470
in fact in her heart

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,740
she cares the most about you.

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,950
Oh no, Young Master.

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,800
Chuchu is taken away
by the empress' subordinates.

58
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,490
What?

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,420
Wuyou.

60
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,770
Your Majesty, Ms. Chuchu is here.

61
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,970
Let her in.

62
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,820
Your Majesty, are you looking for me?

63
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,120
How dare you?

64
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,620
You're not greeting me

65
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,170
on your kneels.

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,190
Qiao Chuchu.

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,860
I've been kind to you.

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,000
Why are you always against me?

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,390
Your Majesty, what does it mean?

71
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,220
My admiration for you

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,720
is as endless
as the surging water of Yangtze

73
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,700
and overflowing
like the water of the Yellow River.

74
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,660
Wanton!

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,700
Stop talking nonsense here.

76
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,980
I can stop caring

77
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,930
about Li Wuyou.

78
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,410
But Wuming

79
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,310
is my only hope.

80
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,650
I don't allow anyone to ruin him.

81
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,570
Your Majesty.

82
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,180
It's a great thing
that the Second Prince

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,690
can be with the person he loves.

84
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,740
How would that ruin him?

85
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,650
As the saying goes,

86
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,250
you can demolish 10 temples,
but never destroy a marriage.

87
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,130
The couples
who have signed the Marriage Book

88
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,250
and engraved their names
on the Three Lives Stone

89
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,450
are brought together by fate
that's cultivated for hundreds of years.

90
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
Your Majesty.

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,640
Why are you being so stubborn?

92
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,310
A young lady with a sharp tongue.

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,840
No wonder Li Wuyou

94
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,660
is so fascinated by you.

95
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,680
Sadly, I don't buy this.

96
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,470
Servant.

97
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,220
Tear her mouth.

98
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

99
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,900
Let's talk.

100
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,340
Don't use violence.
