=Demon Emperor's Little Matchmaker=

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,820
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,000
Young Master.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,400
After giving the leading Yaksha

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,360
a lesson,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,030
I let him go deliberately

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,990
and followed him.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,310
He indeed went into
the territory of Demon Prince.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
In order not to alert them,

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,960
I didn't pursue further.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,090
It seems Demon Prince
knows about Chuchu's presence now.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,360
He'll surely harm her.

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,630
Young Master,
why don't I lead some soldiers over

14
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,730
to catch him off guard?

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,840
No way. That's too dangerous for girls.

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,960
It should be the men who take the lead.

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,760
Are you questioning my ability?

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,320
No, Ms. Yueying.

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,240
That's not what I mean.

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,430
Alright now.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,120
The enemy is keeping us in the dark.

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,240
We can't just
charge into the tiger's den.

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,880
But there's one thing

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,360
that I don't understand.

25
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,160
What?

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
Demon Prince has been
monitoring me for so many years.

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,080
He must know that
I don't know how to use spells.

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,640
Why didn't he kill me?

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,720
Yet he's trying to harm Chuchu now.

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,360
This is what I don't understand.

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,880
Is it possible...

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,160
that you have
something that they're afraid of?

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,320
Besides guards,

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,060
Father didn't leave me anything else.

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,190
If there's something,

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,240
it's perhaps at His Majesty.

37
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,700
That's simple.

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,660
Just ask Father right away.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,750
I get it.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Running errands and
passing the words are my job.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,400
I don't need to go.

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,780
Speaking of the devil.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
What now?

44
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,830
Father is here.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
(Wuyou.)

46
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,430
(I actually never hated you.)

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,900
(I just don't know
how to face my failed self.)

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,600
(Luckily, Chuchu reminded me.)

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,380
I came today

50
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,070
to apologize to you.

51
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,960
In fact,

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,640
I...

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
don't hate you,

54
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,200
but

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
myself.

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,650
I hate that
even as the head of a nation,

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
I still

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
couldn't protect my sister.

59
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,580
I could only watch her

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
sink deeper and deeper.

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,350
I know

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,550
your mother gave you the name "Wuyou"

63
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,550
before she passed away.

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
She wished that

65
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,490
you'll have a happy and safe life

66
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,790
that's without worries.

67
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
I...

68
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,800
didn't take good care of you.

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,040
I've disappointed your mother.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,120
This Soul-Setting Pearl

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,580
is from your father to you.

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,880
Keep it well.

73
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,880
It may save you at critical moments.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
When you have time,

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,880
take that girl to my palace

76
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,540
to have a meal with me.

77
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,860
Are you talking about Chuchu?

78
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,270
She's a brave girl.

79
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,610
She dared to scold me because of you.

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,240
However, her stubbornness

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,800
is similar to your mother's.
