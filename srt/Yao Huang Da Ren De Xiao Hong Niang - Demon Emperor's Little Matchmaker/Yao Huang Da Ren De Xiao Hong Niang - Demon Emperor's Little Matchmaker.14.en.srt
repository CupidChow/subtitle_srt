=Episode 14=

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,510
Young Master.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,110
Is your injury really fine?

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,950
Be gentle.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,710
Should we find you a physician

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,310
to have a look at it?

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,910
No need.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,180
Don't let anyone in the palace

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,030
know about my injury.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,090
I've already found out.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,460
Why did you leave

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,440
without informing?

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,100
Look at what you did to yourself.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,270
This courtyard isn't a prison.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
We're not criminals.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,150
Why can't we leave freely?

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,710
You!

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,540
Wanton!

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,860
How dare you talk to me like that?

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,280
If I knew this,

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,710
I should have...

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,870
Should have what?

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,950
Should have killed me as a baby?

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,310
Let me tell you,

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,190
you can still do it

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,230
right now.

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,750
You!

29
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,390
Your Majesty.

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,590
Don't be angry.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,910
Since he's not grateful,

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,950
just take it
as if we've raised a vicious wolf

33
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,630
and cut all ties with him.

34
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,630
Let him live on his own.

35
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,230
Your Majesty, this is wrong.

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,990
His Majesty is
the uncle of Young Master.

37
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,550
They're a family and related in blood.

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,910
How can they just cut all ties?

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,270
Who do you think you are?

40
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,750
You're just a lowly concubine.

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,870
How dare you...

42
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,430
Chuchu is my woman.

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,320
Let's see who dares to touch her.

44
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,630
Your Majesty.

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,870
Look at him.

46
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,610
Not only I'm the Empress,

47
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,990
but also their senior.

48
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,830
How dare they treat me like this?

49
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,820
They're rebellious.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
(Young Master, forget it.)

51
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,070
(Don't make a big deal out of this.)

52
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,710
(It's not going to end well.)

53
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,350
(Okay, I get it.)

54
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,630
(Young Master
understands me by just a look.)

55
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,910
(This tacit understanding is awesome.)

56
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,350
Alright.

57
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,490
I didn't expect

58
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,940
that's how you see me.

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,350
Alright.

60
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,670
From today on,

61
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,630
go wherever you like,

62
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,910
be wherever you want to be.

63
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,950
I...

64
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,410
don't care anymore.

65
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,870
Your Majesty, wait for me.

66
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,590
Young Master.

67
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,910
I think His Majesty

68
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,550
cares about you.

69
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,830
Perhaps there're
misunderstandings between you.

70
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,110
No.

71
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,110
To him,

72
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm the murderer who killed my mother.

73
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,070
That's right.

74
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,750
If I didn't exist,

75
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,030
Mother might still be alive.

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,360
That's not like it.

77
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,710
Princess Mingzhu sacrificed herself

78
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,510
to give birth to you.

79
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,310
It proved that your life

80
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,710
is more important
to her than her own life.

81
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,850
And your father, Demon Emperor.

82
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,510
Although he has lost his essence,

83
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,190
he would love to
prepare everything well for you.

84
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,040
Wuyou.

85
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,230
Don't disappoint them.

86
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,230
You're right.

87
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,830
After all,

88
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,810
I was born out of love.

89
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,380
Besides, I have you now.

90
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,990
God has mercy on me.

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
By the way,

92
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,310
what did you call me just now?

93
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,070
I like it a lot.
Can you call me that again?

94
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,230
No.

95
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,190
Promise me,

96
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,350
never call me Young Master again.

97
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,870
What should I call you?

98
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,870
Hubby.

99
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,230
You...

100
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,230
