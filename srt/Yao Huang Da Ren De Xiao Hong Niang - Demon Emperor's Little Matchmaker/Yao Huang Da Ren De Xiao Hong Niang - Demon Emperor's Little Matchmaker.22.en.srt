2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,820
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
What happened?
Your acting is too exaggerated.

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,320
Li Wuyou, what happened?

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,040
Are you having another demonic attack?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,880
No.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,240
This is a different feeling than before.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,450
Here.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,760
I'll help you lie down

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,450
and then look for Yueying.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,040
Yueying.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,640
Come with me to see Li Wuyou.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,720
Okay. Let's go.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,880
Yueying, hurry and look.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Li Wuyou is...

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,480
This..

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,680
This...

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,190
isn't quite right.

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,500
Be well.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,560
He looks exactly like Wuyou
when he was small.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,760
This is amazing.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,960
Silly boy.
He's a small version of Young Master.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,240
They of course look exactly alike.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,280
Are you done staring?

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,640
If yes, think of a way please.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,760
Li Wuyou,
I found you some fitting clothes.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,960
Put them on.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,360
Li Wuyou.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
Why do you look so cute as a child?

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,000
So round and soft,

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,320
just like a dumpling.

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,630
But why do you

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,310
look so familiar?

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,480
Chuchu, as long as you like it.

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,610
This double standard!

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
He's Wuyou indeed.

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,160
What? Do you have a comment?

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
No.

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
Honey, console me.

40
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,720
Alright now.

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,080
Even as a child,
he's still Young Master.

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,840
You can't offend him.

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,360
Besides, we aren't married yet.

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,350
Don't call me that.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,320
Oh no.

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
What happened out there?

47
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,110
Demon Prince is
attacking with his people.

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,160
Listen up.

49
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,100
Hand over Li Wuyou and Qiao Chuchu

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,840
so you can live.

51
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,790
He's saying threatening words.
Let me do this.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,570
Hey!

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,360
I think you're saying
the opposite, old fool.

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,500
Right now

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,520
get lost immediately.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
Or else I'll beat you up.

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,640
Who are you calling an old fool?

58
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,690
I'm very handsome.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,400
You have no taste.

60
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,050
Aren't you called Yaksha?

61
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,490
Don't you know the meaning of Yaksha?

62
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,360
Read more
when you have time, illiterate.

63
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,650
Fellow audience,

64
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,600
it's time for the fighting scene.

65
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,120
Since the stuntmen are not here,

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,300
I shall tell you how the story develops.

67
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,400
Rong Yueying and Yaksha
fought for 500 rounds.

68
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,360
At last, Rong Yueying kicked

69
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,790
Yaksha,

70
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,400
which is me, down to the ground.

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,400
Awesome, Honey.

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,080
That's right.

73
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,430
You're so weak.

74
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,330
Wait for it.

75
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,140
Sir.

76
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,010
Sir, they're too arrogant.

77
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,170
Teach them a lesson.

78
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,330
You're going to suffer.

79
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,360
You'll suffer horribly.

80
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,020
I wonder if Yueying and the rest

81
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,240
can stop them.

82
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,720
Demon Prince dares to come here,

83
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,130
he must have Demonic Magic now.

84
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
Yueying and the rest

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
aren't his match.

86
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
What should we do then?

87
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,680
We only have one way now.

88
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,640
Chuchu, where's
the Soul-Setting Pearl I gave you?

89
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,080
Honey.

90
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,010
Are you okay?

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,200
Don't call me that in public.

92
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,700
Kill me instead.

93
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,170
Don't touch my wife.
