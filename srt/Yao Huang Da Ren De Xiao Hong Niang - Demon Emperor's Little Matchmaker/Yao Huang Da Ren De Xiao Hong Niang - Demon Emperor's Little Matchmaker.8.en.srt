00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,720
(Oh my.)

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,520
(I actually saw
Young Master smile just now.)

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,600
Wuyou.

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,480
I think I offended Taibai Jinxin today.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,240
My brain is full of golden stars.

8
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,840
You used to offend an immortal
every day when you were a kid.

9
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,880
Are you not used to it yet?

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,920
Wuyou,

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,880
you're heartless,

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,360
ruthless,

13
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,360
and unreasonable.

14
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,472
It's a shame that I've sneaked here to
see you every month since I was eight.

15
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:22,105
I was punished so much by Mother.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
Are you sure you came to see me?

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,840
A real gentleman
doesn't expose others' secrets.

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
Here, Yueying.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,480
Take Second Prince to take
some tranquilizing medicine.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,760
Yes, Young Master.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,320
Okay.

22
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,566
Thank you, Ms. Yueying.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Your Highness, this way.

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,160
Okay.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
(Wealthy or poor,
healthy or ill, never leave your side.)

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Ms. Yueying, do you like to watch shows?

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,480
I don't.

28
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,202
What about storytelling?

29
00:01:57,443 --> 00:01:58,217
I heard that Tianxiang Restaurant

30
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,600
has an amazing storyteller.

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,240
I don't like it.

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
I know you're loyal to Wuyou.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,320
But can you...

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,160
Can you think about yourself?

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,080
For example,

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,640
a place you belong.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Thank you for your thought.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,080
But my life

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,720
is all about serving Young Master.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,760
To die for Young Master

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,880
is the best place I belong.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
What do you mean?

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,120
What do you mean by this?

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Why are you living for others?

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,920
What do you mean by this?

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,840
Why can't you give me an opportunity?

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,360
Let go.

48
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,400
Your Highness,

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,840
are you okay?

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Yueying, why are you here?

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
I was looking for you.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,800
Ms. Chuchu.

53
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,320
Aren't you...

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
the Second Prince?

55
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,109
Ms. Chuchu, we met again.

56
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:14,688
Your Highness,

57
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,120
this is...

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,960
Just a style.

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
The trendiest panda-makeup of the year.

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Isn't it special?

61
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,360
It's indeed special.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Ms. Chuchu.

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Why were you looking for me?

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,680
I almost forgot
about the serious matter.

65
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,520
I came to ask you something.

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,600
Do you know
what Young Master Wuyou likes to eat?

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,850
♪The wind of the early summer♪

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,300
♪Created a starry sky♪

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,270
♪The dream in my heart♪

70
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,290
♪Froze at the street
intersection in the morning♪

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,381
♪I've passed the end of the galaxy♪

72
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,690
♪I've seen the crowded traffic♪

73
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,200
♪In my mind♪

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,410
♪Your smile is engraved♪
