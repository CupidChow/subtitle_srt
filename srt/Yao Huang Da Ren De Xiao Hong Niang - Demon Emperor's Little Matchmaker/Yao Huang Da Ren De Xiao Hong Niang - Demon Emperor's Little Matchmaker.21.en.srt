3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,120
(The empress called for
Chuchu without informing.)

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,500
(Something bad must be happening.)

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,100
Tell me.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,820
How did you and Li Wuyou work together

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,660
to set up His Majesty using witchcraft?

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,180
No.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,620
I didn't do anything, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,060
You're not going to
speak the truth without some torture.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,980
I shall poke you.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,020
(Chuchu, please be fine.)

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,500
(Wait for me.)

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,620
Your Majesty, help me.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,700
Chuchu.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,740
Li Wuyou.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,940
Listen.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,180
Your Majesty wanted to tear my mouth.

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,740
She's so scary.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,500
You don't look like you need help.

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,960
I need it.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
Luckily, you're here in time.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,200
You're rebelling.

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,460
Do you think I'm dead?

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,800
How dare you display
your affection here?

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,590
Where are the guards?

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,900
These two are disrespectful.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
Take them down.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,380
Stop.

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,180
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,220
Step down.

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,950
Your Majesty.

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,300
Empress.

36
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,380
Look at yourself.

37
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,420
It's very inappropriate

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
for an empress to act like this.

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,300
Your Majesty.

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm just managing
the imperial harem for you.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,520
Why am I wrong?

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,560
I govern the empire with benevolence.

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,150
Without forethought,

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,900
you took someone back for lynching.

45
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,560
Is this how you
manage the imperial harem?

46
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,900
Mother.

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,360
This time you're wrong indeed.

48
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,980
Wuyou and Chuchu are our family.

49
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,640
Why did you make the situation awkward?

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,050
Wuyou, Chuchu.

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
Are you alright?

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,780
Your Majesty, I'm fine.

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Pass on my decree.

54
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,980
The empress is grounded for a month,

55
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,660
so she can reflect on herself

56
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,460
in the imperial harem.

57
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,780
Li Wuyou. Qiao Chuchu.

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,980
Curse you!

59
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,940
His Majesty is on your side.

60
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,540
Even my son is on your side.

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,360
Who are you?

62
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,660
I... am here... to help... you.

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,780
Help... me?

64
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,900
I'll... help you...
fight... Li... Wuyou.

65
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,520
These are presents from Mother to you.

66
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,100
Her Majesty?

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,240
Why is the witch so kind suddenly?

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,250
She even give me presents?

69
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,980
No.

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,940
What I'm saying is,

71
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,340
doesn't Her Majesty hate me?

72
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,510
I don't know either.

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,680
Perhaps she has come around it

74
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,800
and thought she went too far last time.

75
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,080
Hence she's giving
you presents as an apology.

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,560
Take them.

77
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,190
Please thank Her Majesty for me.

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,000
What are these?

79
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,540
Why are they so messy?

80
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Li Wuyou, you're back.

81
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,310
What happened? Why are you so happy?

82
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,380
Nothing. I'm happy to see you.

83
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,870
No wonder you're heavier now.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
Because the happiness made you fat.

85
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,620
Do you want a piece of me?
