3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,110
Mr. Matchmaker.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,420
Please come to the Mortal Realm with me.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,030
Kneel!

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,290
Did you forget

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,670
why I let you go to the Mortal Realm?

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,730
Mr. Matchmaker.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,860
I know that I've disappointed you.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,700
But Li Wuyou is in danger.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,720
Please save him.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,250
When the two of you met,

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,110
I thought you were going
to find him a good match.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,900
I didn't expect...

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,710
Mr. Matchmaker, I've decided to

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,340
become the best Little Matchmaker.

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,570
Why?

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,410
Because I want to find Brother a lover.

19
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,970
(Turns out Li Wuyou)

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,380
(is that little boy.)

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,600
Chuchu, let me ask you.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,680
Do you really want to save Li Wuyou?

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,160
(Chuchu, I, Li Wuyou,
want to declare to the Three Realms,)

24
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,930
(that I'm going to marry you officially.)

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,450
Even so,

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,270
not only that you can't
become a Little Matchmaker,

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,600
but your immortality will be taken away.

28
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,650
You can only be a normal mortal girl.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,360
Are you willing to do that?

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,460
Without Li Wuyou,

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,440
it would be
meaningless to be an immortal.

32
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,550
I'm willing.

33
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,150
A cursed fate.

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,040
A cursed fate!

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,510
Forget it.

36
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,050
Chuchu, I'll ask you one more time.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,080
Have you thought this through?

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,880
Everything in
the past life shall be dust

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,300
and disappear
in front of each others' eyes.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,660
We've said goodbye after all.

41
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,860
Are you still holding grudges?

42
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:44,990
Chuchu.

43
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,470
(The spirit of Soul-Setting Pearl)

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,580

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,330
(to remove
the demonic poison in Li Wuyou)

46
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,090
(and neutralize the forbidden spell.)

47
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,730
(Chuchu.)

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,740
(I hope your effort will not be in vain.)

49
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,180
Rascal.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
If you dare wrong Chuchu,

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,430
I'll not have mercy on you.
