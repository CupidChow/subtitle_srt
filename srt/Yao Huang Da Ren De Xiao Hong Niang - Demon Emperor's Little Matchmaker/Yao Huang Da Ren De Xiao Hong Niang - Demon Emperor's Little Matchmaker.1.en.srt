That's a good name.

You used up your essence

I fear no death.

What I'm afraid of

29

is to be without you in the Netherworld.

30

This is the sixth one.

It seems the daughters of the officials

are too coward.

52

I'm tired.

Guard the entrance of the courtyard.

Don't let random people in.

So that they don't be frightened again.

58

Yes, Her Majesty.

yet there's a red veil.

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,440
So unnecessary.

68
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,301
I think so too.

What's going on?

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,000
Which brainless person
started the rumors?

82

Saying you're an ugly monster.

83
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:44,258
But according to me,

84
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:46,052
you're a beauty.

How can you tell?

86
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:55,244
It's said that inner beauty
is more important.

87

Although half of your face is covered,

(You're afraid indeed.)

93

You can change color.

You're so cool.

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,000
Can you change into other colors?

96
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,319
For example,

97
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,291
yellow,

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,560

100
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,208
Aren't you afraid after seeing me?

101
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,653
Why should I be afraid?

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
As the saying goes,

103
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
there are good and bad people,

104
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,920
there are good and bad demons.

105

You're a human...

106
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,072
You have two bloodlines.

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,960
According to
the folk rule of like begets like,

other than your look,

109
