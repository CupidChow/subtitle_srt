=Episode 27=

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,490
The forbidden skill on
Young Master is neutralized.

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,540
He's now worthy of the name of

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,940
Demon Emperor.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,630
Congratulations, Wuyou.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,270
Let me do it.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,270
Hubby, we just got married,

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,190
yet you've to attend
the Demon Realm Conference.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,920
The marriage leave
of Demon Realm is too short.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,110
Why don't I just stay?

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,870
Forget it.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,360
This is the best chance
for you to be famous

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,430
after being recognized
by the Demon Realm.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,610
How can I delay it?

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,710
Don't worry. I promise that

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,360
I'll get back as soon as I'm done.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,760
Okay.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,420
I warn you.

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,490
Take good care of your sister-in-law.

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,210
If she misses any of her fingers,

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,390
I'll not have mercy on you.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,830
Wuyou, don't worry.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,570
Leave your wife to me.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
I'll leave my wife to you.

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,710
The two of us...

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,610
Give it to me. Hurry.

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,590
Young Master,
I'll wait for you in front.

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,590
Honey, wait.

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm not done.

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,510
Wait for me.

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,080
Sir.

33
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,110
Move aside.

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,030
Get your face away from me.

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,760
Sir.

36
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,750
This is the best chance to catch them.

37
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,810
As long as we have Qiao Chuchu,

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,570
no matter how strong Li Wuyou is,

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,670
he can only surrender.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,260
Listen. Chin up.

41
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,960
Not even a single fly is allowed in.

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,080
Yes, Your Highness.

43
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,650
Mother, why are you?

44
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,970
Wuming.

46
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,640
I came to send you some dumplings.

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,740
But there was a shadow

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,900
that went that way.

49
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,880
What? Where?

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,910
Right over there.

51
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,630
What is that?

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,720
No. It's Yaksha. Come with me.

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Pursue!

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,160
Stop!

55
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,550
Hurry!

56
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,720
It's boring to sleep alone.

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,250
I miss Li Wuyou.

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
Li Wuyou smells better.

59
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,530
Who is that?

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,420
It's me.

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,150
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,920
Chuchu.

63
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,810
Just now Wuming and the rest saw

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,110
that someone unknown was breaking in.

65
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,010
I was worried that
you might be in danger.

66
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,430
So I came to check you out.

67
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,810
Who are you?

68
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,900
Your Majesty will never be so nice to me.

69
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,700
Speak up.

70
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,440
What a smart young lady.

71
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,370
You're indeed someone
from Matchmaker's Hall.

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,460
You're a demon.
