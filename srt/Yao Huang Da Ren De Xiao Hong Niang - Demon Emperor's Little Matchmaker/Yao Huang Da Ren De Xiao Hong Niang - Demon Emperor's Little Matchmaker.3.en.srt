=Episode 3=

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,811
Well,

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,920
what do you think about me?

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,160
You?

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,720
No.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,600
Why not?

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,600
Mr. Matchmaker.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,200
I can surely complete this task.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,680
Chuchu, forget it.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,440
Li Wuyou is like a time bomb.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,720
It may explode anytime.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,080
I don't have the heart

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,000
to let the cute Chuchu risk this.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,280
No way.

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,560
Mr. Matchmaker, let me do it

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,440
Alright then.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,400
I shall let you go.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
But you must promise me two things.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,760
What?

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,560
First,

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,960
don't fall in love.

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,120
Second,

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,960
you're not allowed to use spells.

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,200
Otherwise, everything will be voided

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,920
and you have to
come back to Heaven instantly.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Or else...

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,080
I promise you.

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
I'll get ready now. Wait for me.

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
(When I complete this task,)

31
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,400
(I'll become
the official Little Matchmaker.)

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,760
(I'm so tired.)

33
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:26,912
(She behaves oddly and
her body temperature is abnormal.)

34
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,444
(She may be a spy
sent by the Demon Prince.)

35
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:34,246
Young Master, don't be afraid.

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,240
You'll be better after some massage.

37
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:44,618
Young Master.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,280
Help the girl put on her clothes.

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,480
Young Master.

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,320
Could you have...

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
You asked too much.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
It's bright now.

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
Where's Li Wuyou?

45
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,080
You are...

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Ms. Chuchu.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm Rong Yueying.

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,440
These are the bodyguards
of our Young Master.

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,560
(Guard, Zhang San)
Zhang San.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,680
(Guard, Li Si)
Li Si.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,920
Congratulations, Ms. Chuchu.

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,520
You've become the second wife

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,520
of Young Master Wuyou.

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,880
Second wife?

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
Am I not the concubine?

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
It's actually the same.

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,320
It just sounds better.

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,040
I get it.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,720
Just like

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,480
the scientific name
of frogs with warts, toads.

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,560
It sounds better.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
But toads remain toads.

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,360
Why are you laughing?

64
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
Get the things.

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,583
These are some gifts

66
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,840
from our Young Master.

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
I even get presents.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
These things look pricey.

69
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
It's a worthy journey indeed.

70
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,400
(She's just a country girl
who hasn't seen the world.)

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
(Why does the Young Master
care so much about her?)

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,760
By the way, Yueying,

73
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:16,607
can I ask you

74
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,807
