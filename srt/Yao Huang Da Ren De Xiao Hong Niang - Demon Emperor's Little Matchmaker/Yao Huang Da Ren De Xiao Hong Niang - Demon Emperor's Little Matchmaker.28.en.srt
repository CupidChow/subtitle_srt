3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,140
Young Master,
I'm very happy for you today.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,960
When we arrive at Demon Emperor's Hall,

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,730
you can succeed to
the throne of Demon Emperor

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,180
and restore your family glory.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,830
The previous Demon Emperor

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,650
can finally rest in peace.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,690
All thanks to Chuchu.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,200
Yes. Ms. Chuchu was a great help.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,620
Oh no, something bad happened to Chuchu.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
The protection amulet
I gave her has disappeared.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,770
Chuchu.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,010
You're fast.

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,790
You must have rushed back
before the ritual is done.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,910
Demon Prince.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,260
Indeed.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,380
Congratulations on
succeeding to the throne.

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,300
Don't do anything to me.

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,050
Or else it'll be
the empress who gets injured.

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,400
What do you want? Where's Chuchu?

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,930
As long as you give up
the Soul-setting Pearl

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,820
and your demonic power,

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,840
I'll return you

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,110
your unharmed beauty.

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,210
Wuyou, don't trust her.

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,130
This must be a scheme.

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,930
Wuming.

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,660
Okay.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,510
Provided that

31
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,120
I can see Chuchu first.

32
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,690
Okay. You're frank.

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,340
As long as you behave,

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,660
after Li Wuyou agrees to our conditions,

35
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,050
I'll let you go.

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,020
What conditions?

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,280
They're of course...

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,370
You don't need to know this.

39
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,380
I think

40
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,880
Demon Prince
didn't even tell you about it.

41
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,850
Perhaps he has always
wanted to get a new subordinate.

42
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,690
A more helpful assistant.

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,720
Nonsense!

44
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,180
Really?

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,980
Does he always scold you
or even beat you up?

46
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,560
He...

47
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,370
In this world,

48
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,710
why does everyone

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,180
look down upon me?

50
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,100
What did I do wrong?

51
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,400
Who did I offend?

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,200
Okay, stop.

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,350
What did I do wrong?

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,290
Stop.

55
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,630
It was unnecessary.

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,280
Actually after awhile,

57
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,430
you look

58
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,490
quite unique.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,750
It takes time to appreciate beauty.

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,160
Well,

61
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,740
Demon Prince told me not to kill you.

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,420
But he didn't say
that I can't cut your face.

63
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,020
I want to torture you slowly.

64
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,180
Cut your face

65
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,980
so you become ugly.

66
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,340
Let's see if Li Wuyou still wants you.
