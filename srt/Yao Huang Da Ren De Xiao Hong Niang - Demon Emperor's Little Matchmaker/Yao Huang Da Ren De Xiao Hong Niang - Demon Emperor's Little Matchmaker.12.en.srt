We're looking for an honest marriage.

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,180
Qiao Chuchu.

14

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,460
You hurt me.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,940
Are you angry?

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,620
I took off your mask

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,540
without your permission.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,020
But I just wanted you
to know more ladies.

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,380
So that you can find

29

No way.

You provoked me first.

I didn't...

51
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,380
Since I was little

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,570
I've been living alone.

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm used to closing my heart
and keeping my distance from everyone.

Therefore, Qiao Chuchu,

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,660
you need to be responsible for me.

57
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,740
But I...

You're not allowed to use spells.

70

Or else everything will be voided.
