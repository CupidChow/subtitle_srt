3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,120
I can tell that
Young Master really likes you.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,530
Please...

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,510
make him happy.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,030
(Could Li Wuyou really...)

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
Impossible. It's impossible.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,040
What's impossible?

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,400
I mean

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,720
it's impossible that

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,080
my massage isn't comfortable.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,520
Young Master.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,840
You look better nowadays.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,120
It's okay.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,280
(I haven't had
a demonic attack for awhile now.)

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,360
(I wonder if it's relevant to this.)

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,680
Where's the red rope I gifted you?

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,080
The Second Prince saw the red rope today

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,720
and thought it was unique.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,120
So he brought it back

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,160
to copy one.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,280
He'll send it back tomorrow.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,640
Okay. That's fine.

24
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,870
(If I lose something from the Heaven,)

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,050
(I bet Mr. Matchmaker
will scold me very bad.)

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,840
Young Master, what do you think

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,480
about Yueying?

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
About what?

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,200
Does she look good? Is she cute?

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,360
I've never paid attention to it. Why?

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
(It seems they're
not interested in each other.)

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,760
(Forget it. Let's figure another way.)

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,860
I work overtime every day recently.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,320
My back hurts and my legs are cramped.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,010
I don't even have the strength to walk.

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,720
What are you doing, Young Master?

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
Didn't you say that you're tired?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So I want to

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,000
carry you to the bed to rest.

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,240
I was obviously asking for a reward.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,520
Didn't you get it?

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,370
(The brain of a straight boy.)

43
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,720
(Everything needs to be clarified.)

44
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,070
Then I shall

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
have someone

46
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
send something to you tomorrow.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,640
I don't need jewelries.

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,120
Her Majesty

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,080
sent a lot of them over yesterday.

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,720
I have no space for it anymore.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,800
Besides,

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,080
we're trapped
in this courtyard every day.

53
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,670
We don't have a way to spend the money.

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,000
What you mean is

55
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,280
you would like to go out?

56
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,640
No just I, but we.

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,720
Young Master.

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,960
Aren't you bored
staying just in the courtyard?

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
The world outside is interesting.

60
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,360
Just go out and have fun with me, okay?

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,600
Young Master,
look how happening it is out here.

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
Is your mood better now?

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,280
As long as you're happy.

64
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,490
You're tired, right?

65
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's rest and have some tea
before we continue.

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,850
Good idea.

67
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,730
Waiter, get us a pot of good tea.

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,760
Our young master is thirsty.

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay.

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,720
Look at him.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
He's wearing a mask.

72
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,450
What kind of trend is that?

73
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,600
Perhaps he wants to attract attention.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
He wants to be special for attention.

75
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,590
You're right.

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,480
That's nothing odd for ugly people.

77
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,120
What do you mean?

78
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,890
Our young master is
the most handsome guy in the world.

79
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,270
He wears a mask
so that fan girls like you

80
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,870
don't miss his good look.

81
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,750
Have a look, everyone.

82
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,150
Stop bluffing.

83
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,730
I know all the handsome people
in Huasheng Empire.

84
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,450
But I haven't heard about him before.

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
Indeed. Look at his mask.

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,400
There's not even a diamond on it.
How unfashionable.

87
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,120
Unfashionable.

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,280
Young Master.

89
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,880
He's so handsome.

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,400
Very handsome indeed.

91
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,320
Look at me.

92
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,640
So handsome.

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,280
How can he be so handsome?
