00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,330
Chuchu.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,260
Chuchu.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,320
Demon Prince.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,330
Stop using crooked ways.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,490
Let's have a real battle

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,070
to see who's the true Demon Emperor.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,650
Surrender.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,650
Or else...

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,990
Li Wuyou, don't do silly things.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm not hurt. I'm fine.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,470
Demon Prince.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
You've successfully crossed my baseline.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:51,020
(A Couple with Respect for Each Other)

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,450
It's just a doppelganger
of Demon Prince.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
It seems this matter isn't as simple.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,620
Hubby.

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,990
I miss you so much.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,290
Are you okay? I miss you too.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,990
Are you really okay?

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,160
Will you vomit blood later?

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,910
Do you have so little
confidence in your husband?

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,480
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,230
Wuyou is

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,880
a true Demon Emperor now.

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,360
In the Three Realms,
there're not many people

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,690
who can beat him.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,760
But as the saying goes,

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,060
a man dreads fame
as a pig dreads being fat.

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,810
There's Demon Prince today.

32
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,460
What if there are
more enemies in the future?

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,180
What should we do?

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,000
I wanted to have a baby.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,610
Don't worry, baby's mother.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,510
The baby's father
has everything planned.

37
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,900
Empress.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,130
Here.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,680
Empress.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
You were possessed by Demon Prince.

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,020
Thanks to Wuyou
and Chuchu for saving you,

43
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,340
you got out of it safely.

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,530
Your Majesty, my mind was corrupted,

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,730
that's why the bad people
could take advantage of me.

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,610
Where are Wuyou and Chuchu?

47
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,600
I've to apologize to them.

48
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,930
Okay.

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,860
Father.

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,750
Father.

51
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,570
Wuyou and Chuchu went missing.

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,690
They left behind this letter.

53
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,780
Your Majesty.

54
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,780
What is written in the letter?

55
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,210
They're...

56
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,660
gone.

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,720
Hubby,

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,540
why don't you wear a mask anymore?

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,000
The demonic poison is neutralized.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,220
I don't need a mask anymore.

61
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,100
I knew it.

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,380
No matter what disease it is,

63
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,200
nothing can beat us.

64
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,110
Of course.

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,190
By the way, we left just like that.

66
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,210
Shouldn't we
bid farewell to His Majesty?

67
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:32,990
No need.

68
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,370
I wrote them a letter to explain.

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,370
As long as we have time,

70
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,330
we'll come back to visit them.

71
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,510
Where should we go next?

72
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,900
Next,

73
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,080
we shall become a free couple

74
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,860
who isn't envious
of other couples or immortals.

75
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,620
Okay?

76
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,380
I'll go wherever you go.

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,720
