3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,910
Why don't you carry on?

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,590
This is unfair to you.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,280
Chuchu.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,840
I, Li Wuyou,
want to declare to the Three Realms

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,600
that I want to marry you.

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,550
Wuming.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,960
Mother.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,370
Are you looking for me?

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,280
Are you

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,030
planning to
sneak into the courtyard again?

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,240
No.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,200
I was going to see

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,440
Father in the Imperial Study Room.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,920
I wonder what magic potion

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,640
Qiao Chuchu gave to your father.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,440
Recently, he treats the monster

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,000
entirely different.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,840
He's completely another person.

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,720
Mother, we're family.

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,310
Who's family with him?

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,260
He's a half-man, half-demon monster.

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,980
Keep your distance from him.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
That monster

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,040
is born with a curse.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,200
Because of him,
your elder brother died as a baby.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,480
Wuming.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,040
You're the only son I have left.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,440
You must protect yourself.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,600
If

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,200
anything bad happens to you,

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,880
I...

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,480
Wuming.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,480
I've invited Lady Ding
over to admire the flowers.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,560
Let's talk next time.

37
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,130
This lad.

38
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,810
Could he have a lover now?

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,780
I'm hoisted by my own petard.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
No way.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,730
I must figure a way

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,760
to punish this girl
who doesn't know the rules.

43
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,360
What's going on?

44
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,670
Go back to sleep if you're tired.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,070
But I want to stay with you longer.

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,920
Then I'll sleep with you.

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,630
But didn't you say
that you'll wait until

48
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,740
we're married officially before we...

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,070
What are you thinking about?

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm talking about sleeping.

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,660
What did you think?

52
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,370
However,

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,560
if you can't wait any longer...

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,680
No.

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,400
We...

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,480
No, no rush.

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
I have no rush.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,170
Don't sleep.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,880
Let's chat.

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,280
Do you want to hear
some fun stories of immortals?

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,520
Sure. Are your stories real?

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,450
Of course.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,240
The paparazzi of
Nantianmen Magazine is my best friend.

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,720
From Jade Emperor of Lingxiao Palace

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,680
to the Horse Protector,

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,160
I know all about

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
their gossips.

68
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,660
Tell me a story that you find

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,920
the most fun.

70
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,360
Everyone says that

71
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,480
the relationship between
Mr. Matchmaker and Taibai Jinxin

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,960
isn't good at all.

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,420
Everyone thinks that's

74
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,720
because their
eight characters don't match.

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
In fact...

76
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,720
In fact it's
because they used to like Flower Fairy

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,170
when they were young.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,760
But Flower Fairy liked Maori Xingjun.

79
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
Isn't that funny?

80
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
It's quite funny.

81
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,960
I'll tell you another one.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,600
I think

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,440
today isn't
suitable for too many jokes.

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
Lest we may not be able to fall asleep.

85
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
Some other day perhaps.

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,470
You're right.

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
Teach me how to write.

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,520
What are you doing?

89
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,630
The two of you.

90
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,660
Can you pay more
attention in the daytime?

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,080
There's a poor and sad person here.

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,680
Wuming.

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
Isn't there a saying,

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,480
"You have to strive for your happiness"?

95
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,280
I know.

96
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,420
But her heart is made of stone.

97
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,420
There's no use no matter how hard I try.

98
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
What are you talking about?

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,920
Be simple. Talk in a simple form.

100
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,530
