3
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,290
I'm sorry, Mr. Matchmaker.

4
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,210
Li Wuyou, why are you back?

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,820
How was your conversation
with His Majesty?

6
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,700
It was great.

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Chuchu.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,940
Thank you.

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,060
It's okay.

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,300
It's good that you can untie the knot

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,270
in your heart.

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,580
By the way,

13
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,700
this is for you.

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,020
What is this?

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,460
Don't open it.

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,340
Open it in the future.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,020
But you must promise me,

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,580
no matter what happens,

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,940
never lose it. Okay?

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,380
Li Wuyou.

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,740
I want to tell you something.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm actually...

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,100
You're actually
a Little Matchmaker, right?

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,790
How did you find out?

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,620
(Little Chuchu)
Brother.

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,780
(Little Chuchu)
Why are you here alone?

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,420
Where are your parents?

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,820
This is for you. It's very sweet.

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,740
Go away. Leave me alone.

30
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,370
Why are you so fierce?

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,980
If you behave like this,

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,660
you'll make people who love you sad.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,540
No one loves me
and no one cares about me.

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,340
How is it possible?
Even if there's no one now,

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,180
there may be someone in the future.

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,100
Don't worry.

37
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,090
In the future, I'll surely find you

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,380
someone who truly
loves you and understands you.

39
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,670
Who are you?

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,340
I am...

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Chuchu.

42
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,680
Come back.

43
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,980
I have to go now.

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,340
Bye, Brother.

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,820
Don't run around.

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,620
You clumsy girl.

47
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,870
You didn't even know
that your identity was exposed.

48
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,500
Oh no.

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,010
I came to the Mortal Realm for my duty.

50
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,560
But I'm dating with you now.

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,510
I'm worried that
Mr. Matchmaker may find out.

52
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,490
Qiao Chuchu, listen.

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,340
It doesn't matter if you're an immortal,
a demon, a mortal or a ghost,

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,820
you're the love of my life.

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,980
No one

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,860
can stop me from being with you.

57
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,980
Are you lying to me?

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,380
What do you think?
