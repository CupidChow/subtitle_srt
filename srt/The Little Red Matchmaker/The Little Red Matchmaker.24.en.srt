=The Little Red Matchmaker=
=Episode 24=

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:21,800
Ah.

3
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:23,200
Ah.

4
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:48,966
Don't mess it up.

5
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,400
That's all for today.

6
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,933
It's said that those who catch fireflies

7
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,766
are meant to be married.

8
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,066
I remember it now.

9
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:35,966
Master,

10
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,733
you've finally remembered.

11
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,733
You remember it now?

12
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:46,200
Time's up for you.

13
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,800
Ah.

14
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:51,666
Master.

15
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:55,966
Ah.

16
00:01:58,933 --> 00:01:59,733
Ah.

17
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,366
Ah.

18
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:07,500
Ah.

19
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,566
Since I can't mess up your relationship,

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
I'll just destroy both of you.

21
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,766
I'll destroy you

22
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,533
every time you reincarnate.

23
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,466
Be a pair of star-crossed lovers then.

24
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,400
But he'll die if he remembers me again.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,366
Actually, there's still a way out.

26
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,466
But...

27
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,728
I, Hong Luan,

28
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,866
am willing to shed my essence

29
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,933
and be a mortal forever.

30
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,233
(Only by your use of the Eternal Union,)

31
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,800
(can the nine-tailed fox be sealed again
for five hundred years.)

32
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,766
(But after that,)

33
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,066
(without your essence,)

34
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,100
(you'll be a mortal forever)

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,966
(and suffer from loving in vain,)

36
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,533
(never to be liberated.)

37
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,066
(Now I realize)

38
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,700
(that love is taking responsibility
for your beloved persons and matters.)

39
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,266
(So, my duty with Tian Xi)

40
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:17,066
(is to ensure peace for all beings.)

41
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,533
(I believe that my Master, like me,)

42
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,733
(is willing to sacrifice for the world.)

43
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,066
(Nine stars wander in harmony at first.)

44
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,666
(Clear everything and feel relaxed.)

45
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,100
(Lingering look gives me brilliance.)

46
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,566
(Know all and get relieved.)

47
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,933
(Be high up with a sudden rise.)

48
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:38,066
(Let me be the foreseer of all.)

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,666
(The Eternal Union.)

50
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,633
Die.

51
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,333
