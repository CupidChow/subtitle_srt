2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Master.

3
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:32,864
Master?

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,920
What's wrong?

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,720
Nothing.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,160
Something unexpected...

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,460
Something unexpected happened.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,160
What can't I know...

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,520
This...

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Wow!

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,320
I see.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,800
So your personality is caused
by this strange illness.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
And I can serve as your medicine.

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,320
No wonder you're so nice to me.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
Then why don't you treat me?

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,480
Why is it useless?

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,640
Got it.

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,960
Gone.

19
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:14,816
(Heartless Curse)

20
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:19,120
Nine-tailed fox uses human grudges
for cultivating the essence.

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,120
The curse is called Heartless Curse.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,104
Infected people must avoid contact with
the opposite sex to prevent illness.

23
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,640
In severe cases, it can be fatal.

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
If you want to break the curse...

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Nine-tailed fox,

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,920
it's you again.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,200
Did you cast Heartless Curse on Master?

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,808
So what if it was me?

29
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:52,840
Humph.

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Hey.

31
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,560
Well...

32
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,760
Why was I struck too?

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
You!

34
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:40,920
Tears?

35
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,240
You mean

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,760
my mark was cast by nine-tailed fox?

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,160
And your tears

38
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,679
can help me break the curse?

39
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
Yes.

40
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Master,

41
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,080
you had relationship
with nine-tailed fox,

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,800
and then you abandoned her

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
and were retaliated against by her,
right?

44
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,080
How could that be?

45
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,800
Master,

46
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,720
I still can't cry.

47
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,600
Ah!

48
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,569
Ah!

49
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Ah, Yingying,

50
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,280
does this towel have onion on it?

51
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,400
Ah?

52
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
Master,

53
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,080
I can't cry even when you are crying.

54
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,840
Am I crying?

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm shedding tears.

56
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,280
Is there a difference?

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
I have never shed tears.

58
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,800
I don't even know

59
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,880
how tears are shed.

60
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:29,600
What are you doing?

61
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,160
One cries when he is sad.

62
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Just be a fool who won't be sad,
okay?

63
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,600
You are scolding me again.

64
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
But I can't cry.

65
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
What will you do?

66
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:58,722
(Great Doctor with Utmost Sincerity)

67
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Hey, stop pinching.

68
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
My nose is squashed.

69
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,960
The method is ineffective.

70
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Has the curse been strengthened?

71
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,520
Don't move.

72
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
(To be continued)
Master,

73
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,080
dress up well tomorrow.

74
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
I will take you for treatment.

75
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
Take me for treatment?

76
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,400
What illness do I have?

77
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Loneliness.

78
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
