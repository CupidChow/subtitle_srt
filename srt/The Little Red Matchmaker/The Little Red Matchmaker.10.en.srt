2
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,320
The moonlight is enchanting.

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,080
May all wishes come true.

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,520
Why do you look at me?

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
It seems they're having a great time.

6
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,800
The moon

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,240
is so round tonight.

8
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,520
The moon is really so round!

9
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,040
It's rounder than pancakes
from my village.

10
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,440
Although the moon is round,

11
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,400
I feel lonely,

12
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
and always hope for someone's company.

13
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,240
You have me.

14
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,320
With me, Lone Wolf,

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,640
you'll never be alone.

16
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,880
He should understand me this time.

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,440
Come on!

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Here we are, Master.

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,440
Miss Mei,

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,040
are you still feeling lonely?

21
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm a bit cold.

22
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
Are you all deaf?

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,840
Come on, everyone, gather around!

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,800
Ok, coming.

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Hurry up.

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,920
Don't push.

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,520
Oh, my!

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Miss Mei, are you still cold?

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
Oh, my!

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm being crushed.

31
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:07,648
Ah?

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600

It must work.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Miss Mei, watch your step!

57
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,880
How...

58
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,520
How did they get here so fast?

59
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,620
Come on.

60
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,320
Ah.

61
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:36,814
Hmph.

62
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:38,976
Ah!

63
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,000
Why me again?

64
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,600
The mortal world is really dangerous.

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
Hey, Master.

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,800
Hmm?

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,360
Today is not a day for killing.

68
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,840
Let's go!

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,880
Alright.

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
We'll do as you say.

71
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,560
Where is it?

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,120
Hey?

73
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
How can...

74
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Why do you look at me?

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,840
Miss Mei, is there a particular reason
for walking?

76
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,840
We've been around over a hundred times.

77
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,120
For a few more times.

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

79
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
Where is it?

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,720
Miss Mei, are you stepping on something?

81
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,640
Ah?

82
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,840
I'm not.

83
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,200
It's getting dark now.

84
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
Miss Mei, let's get back.

85
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,800
Hey?

86
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,520
Hey,

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,440
why aren't you waiting for me?

88
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,840
Hey.

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,800
Hey.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,240
No.

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,800
Oh, my!

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,880
What's going on?

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,880
I told you not to make the net so tight.

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
How could I know I'd be caught?

95
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,160
The tighter the net,

96
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,440
the closer the people.

97
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
Master, let's change the position.

98
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Okay.

99
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,513
I...

100
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:02,840
Let me borrow your hairpin.

101
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,704
(To be continued)

102
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:41,920
Wow.

103
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Getting lost is

104
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,960
because you came into my lonely life.

105
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
