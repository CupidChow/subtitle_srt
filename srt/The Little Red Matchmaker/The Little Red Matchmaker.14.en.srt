Come on.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
The best way
to mess up a relationship is

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,000
to start a new one.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,200
When did it start?

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,440
I don't know.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,600
Muke.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,600
Miss, look.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,904
Give me the embroidered ball.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,528
Ah.

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,120
Dr. Jiang got it.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,584
- Get out of here.
- Get out of here.

13
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:13,152
- Let's go.

14

Miss.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Miss.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
Today is my lucky day.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,240
Is this how you treat my illness?

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,120
Yes.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,200
With Miss Muke by your side,

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,320
are you still lonely?

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
What are you up to now?

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,280
Master.

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960

(Three Hundred Questions about Muke)

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
You need
to learn how to flirt with girls.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Otherwise, your loneliness

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
is incurable.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,160
I've been teaching you for a while.

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,080
You will have a test today.

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,680
Now,

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,360
I will pretend to be Miss Muke.

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,480
Show off what you've learned recently.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
It's a starless,

36

37

Oh.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Miss Muke.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Have you eaten yet?

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
What?

44
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,520
Is there a worse way
to strike up a conversation?

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,760
Why don't you ask Miss Muke
if you can feel her pulse,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
do acupuncture,

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,480
or take medicine?

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,600
Isn't this more in line
with your persona as a doctor?

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,680
Master, please be serious.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Pursuing a girl requires great effort.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,120

Come on.

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,320
Flirt with me.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
I can't do it.

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,640
You can't do it?

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,760
Have you forgotten what you learned?

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
You're not her.
