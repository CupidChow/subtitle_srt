2
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,099
You don't remember at all?

3
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,266
Qing.

4
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:44,999
Are you there?

5
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:52,666
How about this?

6
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,933
My favorite snack.

7
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,900
(Master.)

8
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,299
(I will make you remember.)

9
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,566
I really can't remember.

10
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:44,599
It's okay.

11
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,599
You can forget about me.

12
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,966
But you can't forget love.

13
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:20,104

(Ying)

15
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
You finally remembered.

16
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,466
I didn't.

17
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,300
But I've fallen in love with you again.

18
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:26,666
Master.

19
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:28,666
Master.

20
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,266
After tonight,

21
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,966
if Jiang Changqing still loves you,

22
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,066
the Heartless Curse will be triggered,

23
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:44,666
and he will die.

24
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,066
I can save him.

25
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,400
What do you want?

26
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,999
Kneel before me.

27
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,166
Beg me.

28
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,000
After taking this pill,

29
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,299
he will forget you.
