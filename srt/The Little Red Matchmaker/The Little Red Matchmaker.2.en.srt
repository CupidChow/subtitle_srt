=The Little Red Matchmaker=
=Episode 2=

2
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:13,760
Back then, Tian Xi
and Hong Luan cut one of my tails,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,920
leaving you suffer alone
in the mortal world.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,160
Now,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,240
they've met again.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,200
So what?

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,960
Can they break the Heartless Curse?

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,600
Very soon,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,240
you will surely break the seal.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,560
Then, we will make the world ruthless

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,240
and revive the Fox Clan.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,680
The Heartless Curse is the last line
of defense, so we must not be careless.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,120
We can't allow the pair to be together

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
and return to their places.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,160
No one can hinder the revival
of the Fox Clan.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,520
Don't worry.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,600
I will make them pay

18
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:55,720
in blood.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
Little matchmaker,

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,520
the mortal world is very dangerous.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,840
(Great.)

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,400
(I finally have the time
to get some air.)

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,560
(Step two,
approaching the target to make a match.)

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,360
What a terrible singer.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,480
Turns out he has a good face

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,760
but an awful voice.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,120
Let's go.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Hurry.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Tonight is my treat.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,080
The rumor about him is true.

32
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,480
It's cold.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,760
He looks cold on the outside

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,560
but is warm inside.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
Thank you.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,800
His personality...

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,600
He likes pretense.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Hmph.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,160
Where is he?

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Darn you.

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,080
A fox demon.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,680
Why are there so many demons
in the mortal world?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,160
I'll seize you
and make some extra money.

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
What's going on?

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
(It's forbidden to use magic
in the mortal world.)

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
(Salary deducted.)

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,600
Why not say it earlier?
Did you do this on purpose?

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,160
You deduct my salary to buy wine.

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Don't die.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm expecting to use you
to get promoted.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,760
(I need to find an opportunity
to stay by his side.)

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
What are you doing?

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,480
Well,

54
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
the bandage is too long.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Looks good.

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,800
That beggar hit me so hard.

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Exactly, that beggar was murdering you.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I'll avenge you later.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
Why did you follow me?

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
(I need to find a reason to stay.)

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Actually, I want to be your apprentice.

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,200
I've heard that you're highly skilled

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,320
and kind-hearted.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
You're demanding in masters.

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
Of course.

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,680
You've passed the test,
so I allow you to become my master.

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Wait.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,240
You

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,720
allow me?

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
(Since she can be touched,)

71
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,120
(she might cure my illness.)

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,880
So what can you do?

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,720
I have a good memory.

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Then show it to me now.

75
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,320
Feel the pulse

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,320
to find the cause of the illness.

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,600
Strong pulse means strength,

78
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,720
while weak pulse
means deficiency of vital energy.

79
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:34,922
The pulse...

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,960
It always has its own way of beating.

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,800
The pulse...

82
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:43,904
Yes.

83
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:44,840
Feel the pulse...

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,880
Gotta do it slowly.

85
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Master.

86
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
Have I qualified or not?

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
Not yet. Continue to learn.

88
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,304
(Great Doctor with Utmost Sincerity)

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
I've been a doctor for years.

90
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,400
Yet I've never felt a pulse like this.

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,640
It's going up and down,

92
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,200
like sawing.

93
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,200
(Step three of matchmaking,)

94
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,120
(customizing a relationship.)

95
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,200
Miss Zhang, what's your problem?

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,040
Chest distress, shortness of breath,

97
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
dizziness, and fatigue.

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
Your pulse is chaotic.

99
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,160
And you're weak.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,760
Master, it's that serious?

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,000
Why not take a closer look?

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll get you some tea.

103
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, no.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Master.

105
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,080
Master.

106
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,680
Master.

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,600
Master, are you alright?

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,960
(Where is she?)

109
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,989
