Siyue.

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,760
Siyue.

Master.

Master.

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,000
Master.

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
I will save you.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,160
Yue Lao, what's wrong with you?

9
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,440
Master, hang in there.

10
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,320
Master, you're awake.

11
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Here.

12
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,240
Come on.

13
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,600
Luckily, you're fine.

I'm not hungry.

Master.

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Aren't you afraid
of hurting Miss Siyue's feelings?

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,680
Lying will make her sadder.

32
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,320
What if she becomes a nun?

33
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
There's no convent nearby.

34
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,880
How could she become a nun?

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,080
Maybe she's already at home.

36
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
You understand her that well?

37
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
Is she very complicated?

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
I think you're very complex.

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
What's complex about me?

40
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Go find some firewood.

41
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
Oh.

42
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Alas.

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
Finding firewood is easy,
but finding the one you like is hard.

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,840
The beloved one is hidden among people.

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
Master,

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
you always stand outside the crowd.

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,600
How can you find the one you like?

48
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,600
It's like

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,320
all your efforts

50
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,160
will

51
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:55,080
end

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,760
in vein.

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,320
It's in vain.

54
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,800
Alas.

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,640
No matter what,

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
I can help you.

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,320
Let's not make your efforts in vain.

58
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,240
None of your business.

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Big turtle.

60
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,640
What?

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,680
I said you're like a big turtle,

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,880
always hiding in your own shell.

63
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
Your sedan chair is your little shell.

64
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
Your clinic is your big shell.

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
You like lively places,

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
but you never visit.

67
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
You seem cold,

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,280
but you're warm-hearted inside.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,520
You are always away

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,080
from others

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,640
and hiding in your big shell.

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,320
I…

73
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,800
Am I not right?

74
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,520
The prosperity
of this world has nothing to do with me.

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
I am only responsible
for treating illnesses.

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,120
Alright.

77
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
You treat your patients.

78
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,520
Well,

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,000
I treat you.

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm not sick.

81
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,320
You're lonely.

82
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,480
Isn't it a sickness?

83
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,560
