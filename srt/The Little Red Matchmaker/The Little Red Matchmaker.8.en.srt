Hehe.

62
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
I will nose around.

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
It's dangerous.

64

Master.

67
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,280
Move away.

68
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,160
You look skinny.

69
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,640
Hehehe.

70
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,400
You're my type.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,056
Ah.

72
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:29,920
Hehehe.

73
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,848
Ah.

74

76
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,520
Ew!

77
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,960
Don't be shy.

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,720
Hey.

79
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,120
Get lost.

80
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,080

84
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,408
Cool.

85
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
I've only been away for half a day.

86
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,920
You've already forgotten what I said?

87

Be principled thieves.

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
Don't be greedy for wealth or lustful.

89
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,960
Strive to be

90

91
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,480
