00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,440
Changqing.

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,800
Siyue.

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,440
I am really good...

5
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
At creating a romantic atmosphere.

6
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,040
Thank you.

7
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,200
My pleasure.

8
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,160
The mortal world is very dangerous.

9
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,840
Changqing!

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,040
Help!

11
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,320
Save her.

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,240
Changqing!

13
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Changqing!

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
Miss, are you alright?

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,800
Are you alright?

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,240
Get away.

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Well,

18
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,560
the mortal world is really dangerous.

19
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,000
Unbelievable.

20
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,640
She can always save the day.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,560
This is their fated reaction.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Your magical power is now weak.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You must not act rashly
before I break through the seal.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,960
I will come out soon.

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Another layer is cracked open.

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,480
Sister,

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,880
we will be reunited soon.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Xiaojiu.

29
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,240
You must find a way to cut their ties.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,200
Don't worry.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,880
I just don't believe

32
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,800
that Liu Yingying

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,760
is always lucky.

34
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,512
(Great Doctor with Utmost Sincerity)

35
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,280
Master, you're awake.

36
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Master, are you alright?

37
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
Water.

38
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:26,520
Water.

39
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:27,760
Got it.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,160
Are you my disciple or my jinx?

41
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,080
You always trouble me.

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
Master, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Changqing.

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,200
What are you guys doing?

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,200
I...

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,280
I accidentally...

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,640
Oh, alright.

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,400
Move aside.

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,000
Get away.

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,040
Okay.

51
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,620
Changqing.

52
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Chicken soup.

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Siyue.

54
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:24,736
It's hot.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,840
I'll eat it later.

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,640
It's getting cold.

57
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,800
Take a sip.

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,080
Come on.

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Alright.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,800
(They're like a blazing fire
and dry wood.)

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,240
(Let me fan the flames.)

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,280
Oh.

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,880
Let me do it.

64
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,240
Let me help.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,120
Oops.

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,400
Let me.

67
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:36,736
Let me help.

68
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,680
Let me help.

69
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,560
Come on.

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
I can do it.

71
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,000
Give it to me.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,400
I...

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,360
Left hand,

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,320
and right hand.

75
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,840
Changqing, are you alright?

76
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Help me up.

77
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,640
Get out.

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Changqing.

79
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,520
Changqing!

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,240
You haven't finished?

81
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,200
You're so dumb.

82
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
Do you know how difficult it is?

83
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,280
It's harder than getting a monk
to eat meat.

84
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
How about you fire me?

85
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,560
It's alright not to be a deity.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
Guess what?

87
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,280
It's approved
that if you finish the task,

88
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,880
your salary will be doubled
and you'll be made permanent.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm not giving up.
