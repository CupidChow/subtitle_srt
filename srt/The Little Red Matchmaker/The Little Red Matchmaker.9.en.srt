=Episode 9=

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,440
Ahh.

3
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:17,056
Hey.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,400
I've known little.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,880
Only now do I understand

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,780
that meeting Lone Wolf would make you

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,200
regret for your whole life.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,296
Hmph.

9
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:27,800
Ahh...

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,320
He is so handsome.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,560
Do you know

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,360
at that time

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,160
my horse got frightened,

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,240
and there were cliffs ahead?

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,800
I was extremely scared.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,680
Suddenly,

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,440
Lone Wolf came down from the sky

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,440
and saved me.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,840
Miss,

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,280
are you okay?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,760
Lone Wolf is the most handsome man

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,720
in the world.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,080
What about Master?

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
Don't mention him.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
He is just a blockhead,

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,600
and not handsome at all.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,160
Come on, and don't just look at it.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Pork head is delicious.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
Changqing,

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
it's not that I want to keep Miss Mei.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,640
I really can't send her away.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,160
Miss Mei, here are some food and water.

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Before the sun goes down,

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,880
hurry on your way.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,680
Master,

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm lost.

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,000
Hmmm.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,760
If you don't have basic skills,

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
how can you join me
in robbing the rich to aid the poor?

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Stay focused!

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,400
Master, I'm lost again.

43
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,384
Come on.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Thank you, Lone Wolf.

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
It will trouble you

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,520
to take care of Siyue.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,160
OK.

48
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:58,259
Ahh?

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Well, I still think
Master is more handsome.

50
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:05,182
Hmmm?

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Lone Wolf is handsome.

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,820
Lone Wolf is handsome.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,720
Lone Wolf is handsome.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,040
All right, Miss Mei, I get it.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,840
You like Lone Wolf now.

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm not.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't want any more men.

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,960
I don't believe that.

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
It's true.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
I'll no longer fall for any man.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,040
We

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,440
must be strong and independent.

63
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
After falling for a man,

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,600
we find it hard

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,800
to wander through the world.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,720
Hmmm.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
Let me tell you.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,280
No man

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
is good.

70
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,560
Therefore,

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,680
I swear now

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
to stay away from men.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,720
I,

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,640
Mei Siyue.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,920
I, Liu Yingying.

76
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,920
Swear to Yue Lao

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,000
that we will ignore bad men from now on,

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,960
and not fall into the love trap.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
I don't think we just deny everything

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
due to transient displeasure.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,280
For Lone Wolf,

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,000
we can give him another chance.

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
If once is not okay,

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,320
then just twice.

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,120
Yue Lao, what I just said is wrong.

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,520
Don't listen to me.

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
Improper friends ruin one's whole life.

88
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:08,032
Woops!

89
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:18,969
Oh,

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,470
Changqing,

91
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,000
you should rest early.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,880
I'll go back.

93
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:52,992
You...

94
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,760
Why did you
apply such ugly makeup on me?

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,584
I'm afraid those bandits

96
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:01,856
would fancy you.

97
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
Am I so good-looking?

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,040
As I drank too much,

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
I eat something

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,640
to warm up.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Hey.

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
Don't you know

103
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,440
that you should respect the master?

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
I shall eat first.

105
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,040
Wait.

106
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Respect the old and love the meat.

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,960
Master, don't you like meat?

108
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,880
It's respecting the old
and loving the young.

109
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:52,561
OK.

110
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,800
(To be continued)

111
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,440
