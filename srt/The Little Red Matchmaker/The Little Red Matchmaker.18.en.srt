2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,700
Yingying.

3
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,933
The first milk cake in spring.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,366
Shall we try it together?

5
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,333
No.

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,466
This is bad.

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,166
Alas.

8
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,066
Woody,

9
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,366
no matter how many times I've practiced,

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,933
I still feel uneasy.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,366
Yes,

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,966
I can cure
a lot of intractable diseases,

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,133
but now I'm just a lovesick fool.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,133
Blossoms are all open in my dreams.

15
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,933
Ripples of thrill pass through me.

16
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,899
The breeze understands my feelings.

17
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,866
My mind is entwined
with red strings of fate.

18
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:41,766
Well.

19
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,133
It turns out professing my true feelings

20
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,566
may take all my courage.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,600
Woody,

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,266
do you think I'm being too blunt?

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,333
Or maybe too hasty?

24
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:02,933
Hey,

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,400
should I wait a bit more?

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Let's try again.

27
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:12,766
Yingying.

28
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,766
Master, were you looking for me?

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Do you believe...

30
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,100
Tiantu acupoint.

31
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,366
The glabella.

32
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:26,433
Master.

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,100
Oh!

34
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,200
Yingying,

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
memorize these acupoints.

36
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,200
I will test you later.

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,600
I

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,366
really

39
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:02,500
like

40
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:03,600
you.

41
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,499
(What a beautiful day)

42
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,899
(for a love confession.)

43
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,899
(What a perfect day)

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,333
(for a love confession.)

45
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:51,633
Yingying.

46
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,366
Master.

47
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:57,566
Master!

48
00:03:58,766 --> 00:03:59,933
I forgot the medicine!

49
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:14,566
You

50
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,466
and I.

51
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,933
Make or break.

52
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,099
Go for it!

53
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,833
Just say it.

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Good luck.

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,133
Master,

56
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,000
emergency!

57
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:58,366
Come on!

58
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
Ma...

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,833
Daniu?

60
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:15,966
Daniu?

61
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,266
Hey!

62
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,333
I have a friend...

63
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Go home already!

64
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,733
Master,

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
actually...

66
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,600
A man

67
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:23,799
should confess his love first.

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,333
Before I met you,

69
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,666
I was solitary

70
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,099
and aloof.

71
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,266
I felt my world was pitch-black

72
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,666
without a trace of hope.

73
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,566
But then one day,

74
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,266
a ray of light entered my world.

75
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,733
It was your face,

76
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,666
your smile,

77
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,133
and your gentleness

78
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,166
that saved me.

79
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,333
I really wanted
to take your hand back then

80
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,266
and have you lead me away.

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,800
But I was afraid
to shatter the peace we had.

82
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,133
So I hesitated

83
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,366
and held myself back.

84
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,266
But I understand now.

85
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,799
If you love someone,
you have to say it out loud.

86
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:16,766
Yingying,

87
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,366
I like you.

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Yingying.

89
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,533
Let me help you with it.

90
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,366
(So, was this hairpin
meant for me all along?)

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,966
(Of course,)

92
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,833
(dummy.)

93
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,666
Actually,

94
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:59,199
I like you too.
