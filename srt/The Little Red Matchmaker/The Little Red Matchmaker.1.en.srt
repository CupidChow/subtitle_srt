(the nine-tailed fox caused chaos
in the three realms.)

3

(She fed on the resentments
and indifference of human couples)

(to cultivate her essence,)

5

(Nine-tailed fox)
(As a result, lovers hardly ended well.)

7

(Tian Xi and Hong Luan, deities in charge
of marriage, descended to end her.)

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,800
(A battle between immortals
and demons is about to erupt.)

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm fine.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,560
Watch out!

14

Tian Xi!

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,920
Are you crazy?

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,312
No!

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,120
I will make you pay for this.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
The Heartless Curse
will make you loveless

19

(and made her become a matchmaker.)

29

(Is it a right decision?)

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,040
(Ninety-nine couples)
Congrats. Ninety-nine couples got married.

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
One more couple to go
before promotion and pay raise.

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
I'll go for it.

33

Yue Lao.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,440
Yes.

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
If Tian Xi and Hong Luan don't return,

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,840
you will be thrown
into the mortal world.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,080
Well,

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,480
give me one more month.

39

(I can't believe it.)

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,840
Don't run.

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,800
Failed.

Who is it getting in the way
of my promotion?

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,680
You've ruined my performance.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,150
You...

48
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,656
I...

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,600
Can't you be more serious?

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm warning you.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,880
If you fail again,

52

I won't give you another chance.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I've taken the test a million times.

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,520
It always told me
I didn't understand love well enough.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,200
Is the system or me cheating?

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,760
All right,

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
I'll help you.

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
You sneak down to the mortal world

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,360
and find someone named Jiang Changqing.

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
As long as you change his lonely fate,

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,520
I guarantee you a promotion and a raise.

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,600
But if you can't,
you'll stay in the mortal world.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,320
Don't try to fool me.

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,280
I won't go.

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
You have to.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,160
Off you go.

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,320
You're my scapegoat.

Yes.

76

He's the most handsome doctor here.

77

that he's not interested in women.

I'll give you candy
after the acupuncture.

Liar. Give me the candy first.

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,000
Eating too much candy
can cause toothache.

84

Get the candy.

85

What illness?

111
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,480
You're
