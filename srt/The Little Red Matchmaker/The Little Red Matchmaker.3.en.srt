2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,520
Master.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,080
Master.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,040
Master, are you alright?

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
I was worried about you.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,480
I'll get out of here.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,360
Wait a moment.

8
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Master.

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,600
The shape of your rash looks strange.

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,400
(No.)

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
(I can't let her know my secret.)

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,080
(How come the rash on my hands)

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
(disappeared so quickly this time?)

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,520
Master,

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,240
this medicine is so good.

16
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
It works instantly.

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,880
(Who exactly is she?)

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
(That definitely wasn't the effect
of the ointment.)

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,960
(Well,)

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,720
(could touching her cure my illness?)

21
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:48,560
I've heard that Miss Zhang is unwed.

22
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,320
She excels at music, chess,
calligraphy, and painting.

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,000
She truly is

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,960
a graceful and virtuous lady.

25
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,760
I can read it upside down.

26
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Have you finished your study?

27
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,520
Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li,

28
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,920
Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang.

29
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,520
Tall, handsome, and short ones.

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,600
None of them is good.

31
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,000
Jiang Changqing, I...

32
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
What are you doing?

33
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,920
I...

34
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm tired.

35
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
Just stretching a bit.

36
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,920
(Mei Siyue)

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,800
(I missed one.)

38
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,480
(Found you, Mei Siyue.)

39
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:42,784
(Zhuque Street)

40
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
Master, how long haven't you been out?

41
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Where are you taking me?

42
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,640
Master, look at the braised carp.

43
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
You're a foodie.

44
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,520
It's so lively tonight.

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
Sugar-coated haws.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Sugar-coated haws.

47
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,680
Master.

48
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,600
I take one.

49
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,560
Here.

50
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,640
It's delicious.

51
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Thank you, Master.

52
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
Master, you eat first.

53
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Eating too many sweets
can harm your health.

54
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,920
You're a good doctor.

55
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,160
You can cure me.

56
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,440
That's why I'm not afraid.

57
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
Sugar-coated haws.

58
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,480
Sugar-coated haws.

59
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
Ever since I got sick,

60
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
it's been a long time
since I've relaxed.

61
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Master.

62
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't run around.

63
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,880
What's wrong with you?

64
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
(Oh, no.)

65
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,040
(The strange illness flared up again.)

66
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200
