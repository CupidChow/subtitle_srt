=The Little Red Matchmaker=
=Episode 13=

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,573
Don't move.

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,680
This is

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,360
a woman's hair.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Other women's hairs
can be used for curses.

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,520
Can your hairs

7
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:05,760
suppress curses?

8
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,720
With this sachet,

9
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,560
you will no longer fear women.

10
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,880
You look good when smiling.

11
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,520
You should deliver the medicine.

12
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,970
(Great Doctor with Utmost Sincerity)

13
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,680
Master, what are you doing?

14
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,056
Nothing.

15
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:26,938
Ah.

16
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:44,800
Hey.

17
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,240
Master, what are you doing?

18
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,680
Ah.

19
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,207
Eh.

20
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,200
Yingying.

21
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you feel
that Master has been acting strange?

22
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Speaking of which,

23
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,720
indeed, he has been.

24
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah.

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
I got it.

26
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,280
He must be feeling lonely
after losing Miss Siyue.

27
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
Oh.

28
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,000
Daniu.

29
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,560
We should help him out.

30
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,520
Definitely.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Hmm.

32
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,440
Why do you keep following me?

33
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,480
Master.

34
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
Have you been sleeping poorly?

35
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
So you feel down.

36
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,280
Also,

37
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,080
you feel anxious

38
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
and pressured.

39
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,720
There are many things you can't say.

40
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,800
(Could she have found out?)

41
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,720
(Did I make it too obvious?)

42
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,880
What are you thinking?

43
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,920
Do your work.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why has he been running hot and cold?

45
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,600
Turns out
that when one falls for someone,

46
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,200
one will be the loneliest.

47
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,880
Master.

48
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,840
Dress up well tomorrow.

49
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
I'll take you for treatment.

50
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
Take me for treatment?

51
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
What illness do I have?

52
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,400
Loneliness.

53
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,920
Is she asking me out

54
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,240
for a date?

55
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Unexpectedly,

56
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:52,640
Tian Xi and Hong Luan are still tough
without magical powers.

57
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
The deeper the bond between them,
the harder it is to deal with.

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,960
Your magical power hasn't recovered yet.

59
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
We must find another way.

60
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,120
I'll break them up.

61
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,320
I'll arrange a wrong marriage
for Jiang Changqing.

62
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,880
Hmph.

63
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,880
Muke.

64
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,760
Stop thinking about the poor Mr. Zhang.

65
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,960
I've found good men in the city for you.

66
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
Choose one.

67
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,120
Miss Muke, my family is the richest
in the east city.

68
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,360
My father is a high-ranking official.

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,312
Come on.

70
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,400
The best way
to mess up a relationship is

71
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,680
to start a new one.

72
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:08,960
(To be continued)

73
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,120
In the future,

74
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I will never

75
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,720
make your heart

76
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,160
or hands cold.
