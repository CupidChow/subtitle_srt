24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,366
You did well.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,066
I'll achieve success soon as well.

26
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,299
No matter how deep the bond
between Tian Xi and Hong Luan is,

27
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,266
they can't break the Heartless Curse.

28
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,733
As it was made from
Hong Luan's lost soul and spirit,

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,400
only her tears can break it.

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,900
But without a soul and a spirit,

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,500
her ability to love is damaged

32
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,733
and she can never cry tears.

33
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,999
So, it is an invincible curse.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,533
Sister, you're indeed awesome.

35
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,499
You have successfully destroyed
the marital tie between them,

36
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,299
so they can never return
to their immortal places.

37
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:54,099
I will be unstoppable.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,070
It's been five hundred years.

39
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:58,600
I can be free finally.

40
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,066
Xiaojiu,

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,066
once I turn the mortal world
into a ruthless one,

42
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,299
we can unite again.

43
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,699
Then the mortal world will be ours.

44
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:37,033
- Moonlight scatters before my bed.
- Moonlight scatters before my bed.

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,500
Did I teach you like this?

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,866
Huh?

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,366
Can't you be serious?

48
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:49,399
Say that again.

49
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,536
(If I get drunk,)

50
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:58,166
(my heart won't hurt so much.)

51
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,799
Stop drinking, please.

52
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,099
The nine-tailed fox has broken the seal,

53
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,733
and you're going to lose your job.

54
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,399
What's the point of being a fairy?

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,933
I can't save my beloved one,

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,333
nor can I save the common folk.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,533
Is there really no other way?

58
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,333
In fact,

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,766
you are the Hong Luan.

60
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,399
Once Tian Xi and you get married,

61
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,766
you can return to your places.

62
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,699
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

63
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,399
It won't give us any help.

64
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,933
You've lost a soul and a spirit.

65
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,099
You can't even remember who you are.

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,133
How can you do it?

67
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,533
Over the years,

68
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,966
(I've been searching for
your soul and spirit.)

69
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,650
(Five hundred years ago,)

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,733
(the fragments have drifted here.)

71
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,266
(I used magic
to turn you into a matchmaker.)

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,733
(But you can't even recall who you are.)

73
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,133
(It must be in the battle)

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,700
(that your ability to love was damaged.)

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,700
Could there really be no ways
to break the Heartless Curse

76
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,600
or defeat the nine-tailed fox?

77
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,733
There's still a way out.

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,733
(Great Doctor with Utmost Sincerity)
The couple bow to each other.

79
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,266
Let go of my master.

80
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,366
He will not marry you.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,166
It's not up to you.

82
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,833
You should ask first,

83
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:23,033
whether he still remembers who you are.

84
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,300
Master, come with me.

85
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,933
I don't know you.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,100
Changqing and I are the perfect match.

87
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,733
You'll never break the Heartless Curse.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,933
The Heartless Curse

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,733
is created by your soul and spirit.

90
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,933
Only your tears can break it.

91
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,533
But you have lost them,

92
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,799
so you'll never be able to shed tears.

93
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,699
How can you break it?

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
What's more,

95
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:06,466
the world will soon be mine.

96
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,399
Liu Yingying,

97
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,666
you lose.

98
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,933
Master, come with me.

99
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,999
You want to ruin my plan again.

100
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,866
Today I'll make you dead without tombs.

101
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,733
The nine tails unite.

102
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,966
Mission accomplished.

103
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,533
You're just struggling desperately.

104
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,566
(To be continued)
You remember it now?

105
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,199
