2
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:27,666
You…

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,666
Three Hundred Questions

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,920
about Muke, article five.

5
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,399
Article six for Pulse Diagnosis.

6
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:44,966
Miss Muke is so nice.

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,733
Why do you put a long face?

8
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,666
It's like the reflection of the moon.

9
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,466
It looks very beautiful,

10
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,899
but a stone drops…

11
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:10,966
That's the look.

12
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:11,766
Keep it.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,166
Can I graduate now?

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Hmm.

15
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:21,966
Yes.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,100
Why do you always keep a straight face?

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,133
You look so good when smiling.

18
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,433
Alright.

19
00:01:58,866 --> 00:01:59,666
Stop it.

20
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,399
This is the hairpin you give her.

21
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,699
Tomorrow is your first date
with Miss Muke.

22
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:15,866
Don't mess it up.

23
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,699
So you wanted to throw the ball
to Zhang Sheng.

24
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:55,533
Zhang Sheng
and I were childhood sweethearts.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
My father disdains him
for repeatedly failing imperial exams.

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
He wants
to cancel my engagement with him.

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,300
I had no choice

28
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,766
but to stop my father in that way.

29
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,699
Sadly, Zhang Sheng and I are in love,

30
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,066
but we can't be together.

31
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:13,299
I only love Zhang Sheng.

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,733
In this world,

33
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,533
is there not a way

34
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,599
to help lovers end well

35
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,599
and spare them a bumpy road?

36
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,500
Are you talking

37
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:32,099
about her?

38
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,699
You're good at flirting.

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,166
But she doesn't know my feelings.

40
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,799
Although you're smart,

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,200
you cannot fathom a girl's heart.

42
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,099
Miss Muke.

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,300
Do you know what to do?

44
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,999
Both you and I have someone we like.

45
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,566
And we each have our difficulties.

46
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:15,733
Well,

47
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,799
what if we pretend to be lovers?

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Firstly, it can pacify our parents.

49
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,299
Secondly, it can
test Yingying's true feelings.

50
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,333
If she really cares about you,

51
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,266
she will surely not remain indifferent.

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,733
I'll be returning.

53
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,466
I should be happy.

54
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:04,766
(You're not good at flirting?)

55
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,500
(You liar.)

56
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,866
It worked.

57
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,066
Help me with the wedding outfits.

58
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,233
Hmm.

59
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,700
You have a similar figure to Miss Muke.

60
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,300
Why not try it on for her?

61
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,600
Congratulations to you and Miss Muke.

62
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,566
In this world,

63
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,733
can true lovers get their happy ending?

64
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,933
Master, what do you think love is?

65
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,399
It's pleasant to meet first.

66
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,499
It's joyful to meet again.

67
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,099
Missing each other.

68
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,666
Parting is sorrowful.

69
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,066
One doesn't know love first.

70
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,366
One doesn't feel love
when meeting again.

71
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,133
Unconsciously,

72
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,966
love has taken root.

73
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,333
(To be continued)
In my whole life,

74
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,100
I've always

75
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,733
only loved you.

76
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,499
