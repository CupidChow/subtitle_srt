2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:12,133
It's like fish in a bar.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,766
It's like fish in a barrel.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:16,676
Yan.

5
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,699
I've treated you well.

6
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:20,366
You're so ungrateful.

7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,599
Yingying.

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,099
You're a good child.

9
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,766
I wronged you before.

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,166
I underestimated you.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,566
Liu Yingying.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,366
Do you have anything else to say?

13
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,766
I have packed your things.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,800
I was deceived by you.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,866
I planned it.

16
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,766
Yan has approached me many times.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,000
She's up to no good.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,766
My mother was bewitched by her.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,333
I always feel she seems familiar.

20
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,799
But I don't know why.

21
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,266
Take a whiff.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Fox stench.

23
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:28,999
The lady in white that night…

24
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,136
Doesn't it smell like the scent

25
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:32,966
of Yan?

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,466
But she has many sachets on her.

27
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,699
I can't smell it.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,599
You haven't learned
the four diagnostic methods well.

29
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:47,333
It seems there's a faint stench covered
by the fragrance.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,166
Good for you.

31
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,199
It is not easy to deal with Yan.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have a plan.

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,966
(But you have to convince your mother
to work with us.)

34
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,999
(First, create an illusion.)

35
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,699
(Make Yan believe she has succeeded)

36
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,799
(by using your mother to break us up.)

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,466
(Then you and I pretend to quarrel)

38
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,599
(to make Yan think
she has an opportunity.)

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,266
(Finally, I will pretend to be defeated)

40
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,266
(and leave to make her believe)

41
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,566
(she's the winner)

42
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,666
(and lower her guard.)

43
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,866
(The rest is up to you.)

44
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,533
Yue Lao's talisman really works.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,866
You are the smartest.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
I've suspected Yan for a long time.

47
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:41,999
Surprise?

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,133
You're clever.

49
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,566
My son is lucky

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,733
to have you.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,333
Hmph.

52
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,899
I was almost deceived by you.

53
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:56,833
Hey.

54
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,466
How was my acting?

55
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
You acted extraordinarily well.

56
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:06,933
Hmph.

57
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,864
You think

58
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,566
this is the end?

59
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,000
She's a fox demon.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,866
Mother.

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,200
Mother.

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Mother.

63
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:46,633
Ah.

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Jiang Changqing.

65
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
I'll give you one more chance.

66
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
You two die together?

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,366
Or you marry me?

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,866
In the next life,

69
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,866
we must be together again.

70
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,966
I can't see you die.

71
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,566
It's just a pity

72
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,166
that it's about to take effect soon.

73
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:53,966
Ah.

74
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:55,733
Master.

75
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,166
Master.

76
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,799
This is the ending.

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,100
Huh?

78
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,666
What on earth is going on?

79
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,533
I've found some information.

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Five hundred years ago,

81
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:32,499
the nine-tailed fox fought
against Tian Xi and Hong Luan.

82
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,166
(The nine-tailed fox was sealed away.)

83
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,199
(Tian Xi fell into the cycle
of reincarnation.)

84
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,066
(Hong Luan disappeared.)

85
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,533
(It took me many years to find out)

86
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,266
(that Jiang Changqing is
the reincarnation of Tian Xi.)

87
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,533
(Only by helping him with matchmaking)

88
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,066
(can Tian Xi return to his place.)

89
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,533
(And Yan is the severed tail,)

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,166
(helping the nine-tailed fox
break the seal.)

91
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,566
That's why she obstructed you
time after time.

92
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,533
What do we do now?

93
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,699
Just wait and see.

94
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,475
(Introspect Thrice)

95
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,133
Let go of him!

96
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:09,533
Hmph.

97
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:11,333
Yan.

98
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:12,766
Who is she?

99
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,666
Master.

100
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,499
Don't you recognize me?

101
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:00,799
Now, the Jiang residence is
under my control.

102
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
What kind of spell did you cast on him?

103
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,266
There isn't any spell.

104
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,499
It's just the vows of your love

105
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,299
that triggered a stronger curse mark.

106
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,272
The Heartless Curse

107
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:21,133
will make him
forget the person he loves.

108
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,599
I will make him remember.

109
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,900
Whatever you do is useless.

110
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,799
I just like to see you sad.

111
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,299
If you don't believe it, just try.

112
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,333
(To be continued)
I didn't remember.

113
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,499
But I fell in love with you again.
