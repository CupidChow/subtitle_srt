2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,566
Vixen,

3
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,266
next time,

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,300
remember to wash off the fox stench
from your body before you come.

5
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:18,400
Liu Yingying, let's fight to your death.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,300
To your death.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,800
So ruthless.

8
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:27,800
Yingying.

9
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:28,966
Master.

10
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:31,866
Who is she?

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,200
She is the one who cursed you.

12
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:40,733
It's poisoned.

13
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,300
Yingying.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,500
Yingying.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,766
Sorry.

16
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:30,433
Yingying.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,033
I'm here.

18
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,266
It's okay now.

19
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,166
Yingying.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Yingying.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,533
Yingying.

22
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:07,999
Yingying.

23
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,066
Wake up.

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,900
I have so much to tell you.

25
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,466
Actually, when I first saw you,

26
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,766
I fell in love with you.

27
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,499
But I refused to admit it.

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,633
Because I was afraid

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,333
that it wasn't what I wanted.

30
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,866
I hindered the beginning
of a beautiful love story.

31
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,799
But every time I smelled your scent

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,700
or caught a glimpse
of your smiling face,

33
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,499
I couldn't help but get close to you.

34
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,866
From the moment you appeared by my side,

35
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,699
I felt an inexplicable sense
of belonging in my heart.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,300
I feel your warmth
shattered my loneliness.

37
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:51,733
Yingying.

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,500
Don't leave me alone.

39
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,933
Don't leave me alone.

Master.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,200
I'm here.

50
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,133
Let me sleep a bit longer.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,100
I'll get up

52
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,733
and start memorizing
the acupoint chart soon.

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
You'll definitely get better.

54
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,766
It's okay now, Yingying.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,766
I am here.

56
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,333
Master.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,366
Don't leave me.

58
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:48,933
I am here.

59
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,166
Master.

60
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,899
Yingying.

61
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,166
It seems I had a very long dream.

62
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,199
What did you dream about?

63
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,199
I dreamt someone said

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,966
warmth

65
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,933
shattered the loneliness.

66
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:38,733
Ugh.

67
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,366
That's kind of cheesy.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Master,

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,300
what happened

70
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,066
just now?

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,233
Nothing.

72
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,333
I'll go
and decocte medicinal herbs for you.

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,766
Master,

74
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:20,866
I really don't remember
what just happened.

75
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:28,333
(Could the dream just now be real?)

76
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:41,766
Yingying.

77
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:45,966
Are you okay now?

78
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,733
I'm fine.

79
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:50,933
That's good then.

80
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:01,766
Master.

81
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,099
The medicine is overcooked.

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,000
Master, what's wrong with you?

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,900
It's nothing.

84
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:19,533
Daniu.

85
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,533
I have a friend
who has been troubled by love recently.

86
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:30,566
He does not know how to
express his love to the girl he adores.

87
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,744
Oh, I see.

88
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:35,133
Do you have any ideas?

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,100
It's simple.

90
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,600
You know about 'wall thud', right?

91
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,166
Just do like this.

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,333
And then tell her

93
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,966
"I like you. Be my woman"

94
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,266
Well...

95
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,099
Anyway, that's how
I told Xiaoyu how I felt.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,000
By the way, Master.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,533
When did you get a friend?

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,266
Hurry up and chop the wood.

99
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:01,933
Oh.

100
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:16,533
Senior.

101
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,066
Yes?

102
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,466
I have a friend

103
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,466
who is a fairy.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,466
But she has fallen in love with a mortal

105
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,066
who she needs to help.

106
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:26,833
Tell me.

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,666
What should she do about it?

108
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,266
Liu Yingying, have you been reading
too many storybooks?

109
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,333
Fairy?

110
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,766
Are you talking about
the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl?

111
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,666
Let me tell you,
their situation is really tragic.

112
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,000
Yingying,

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,366
their story didn't have a good ending.

114
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,166
Think about it.

115
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,199
A single father

116
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,999
raises two children alone.

117
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,966
The children only get to
see their mother once a year.

118
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,100
How will they feel?

119
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,399
How sad they are.

120
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,300
Why did they choose to start a relationship?
What do people enter into relationships for?

121
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,900
It's just too sad.

122
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,100
For being together everyday.

123
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,066
No good ending.

124
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,966
For seeing each other every day.
For eating together.

125
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:57,666
It's just too sad.

126
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,466
For playing together.
For going out together.

127
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:00,466
It's not going to end well.

128
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,866
It's not going to end well.

129
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:04,700
Well...

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Yingying.

131
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,466
Yingying.

132
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:08,966
What's going on here?

133
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,166
Why does everyone suddenly
have so many friends these days?

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,766
(To be continued)
Gentle winds and light clouds.

135
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,266
A good day for a confession.

136
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,266
Clear sky and vast clouds.

137
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,733
