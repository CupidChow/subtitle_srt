=The Little Red Matchmaker=
=Episode 6=

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,240
Hurry.

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,320
What?

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,160
Give me acupuncture.

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,160
There was something wrong with the food.

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,120
It will be troublesome
if it works again.

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,880
Just do it.

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,120
Oh.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,640
Master.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,480
Where should I needle?

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,720
Jianjing.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,520
Where are you putting it?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,960
That's a suture.

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,440
Oh.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm sorry, Master.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,440
Two fingers from the shoulder.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Okay.

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
You're doing it better.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,960
The acupuncture point chart.

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Recite it ten times.

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,960
You…

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
What are you doing?

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,560
What are you doing?

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
Keep going.

25
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:26,752
Yongquan.

26
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,416
Tianzong.

27
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:30,600
Qihai.

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,160
Qihai.

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,360
Shenyu.

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Quchi.

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,400
Master, I will go
and decoct the medicine.

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Qing.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,560
Did anything happen?

34
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Mother.

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
You made me have too much turtle soup.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,280
It's good you're fine.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,160
It's good.

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,400
You must clean up for me.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,120
Otherwise, if Miss Siyue blames me,

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,360
I will have to ask for the money back.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
No worries.

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
Do your work.

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
This time,

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
Liu Yingying can't explain it clearly.

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
I will tell Mrs. Jiang now

46
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,640
that Liu Yingying is stealing money.

47
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:37,623
Hmm.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,880
Things are getting interesting.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,760
Hmph.

50
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,400
You are forcing me to be a bad person.

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,960
Come on.

52
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
Miss Siyue is so scattered.

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,080
(Using others to realize my goal.)

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,400
(This is what a villain should do.)

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
(Miss Siyue,)

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,320
(it's more interesting in this way.)

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,520
What is the smell?

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,720
Liu Yingying.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,280
What are you doing?

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Somebody! Help!

61
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,000
It's on fire!

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,920
Liu Yingying.

63
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Liu Yingying!

64
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't you die!

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,560
Oh, my goodness.

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Liu Yingying!

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,760
Liu Yingying,

68
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
I didn't believe Xiaoyu
when she said you were stealing money.

69
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,360
I didn't expect you to destroy evidence

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,160
by setting fire to the house.

71
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,520
No, I didn't.

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,360
It was Xiaoyu.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,880
She asked me to clean.

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
I didn't.

75
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,080
Enough!

76
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
The fact is clear.

77
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,144
You can't deny it.

78
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:50,676
Hmph.

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,440
Today you set fire to the room.

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Tomorrow, will you burn down my mansion,

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,040
letting us die with you?

82
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,760
Siyue saved you.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
I will not tolerate someone like you.

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Someone!

85
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,311
Drive her out of here.

86
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,280
Let go!

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,080
Hold on!

88
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,040
Master.

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,540
Qing.

90
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,595
Mother.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,760
Master, it really wasn't me.

92
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
You were caught red-handed.

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
You can't argue.

94
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,780
Don't do the crime

95
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,040
if you can't do the time.

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Siyue,

97
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,440
you've gone too far.

98
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,160
Changqing.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,360
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,120
Mother.

101
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Laifu can testify.

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,120
Siyue intentionally locked Yingying
in the room.

103
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Yes, Madam.

104
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,840
I saw Xiaoyu lock the door.

105
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,200
Miss Siyue was also there.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,160
Siyue.

107
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Was it really you?

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
Aunt.

109
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,280
I didn't do it on purpose.

110
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
I just hate Liu Yingying.

111
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,320
I want you to drive her out.

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,720
But I didn't set fire to burn her.

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,560
Siyue, why are you so willful?

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,632
Qing, Siyue admitted her mistake.

115
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,920
Let it go.

116
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
Mother.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,780
If Yingying was framed,

118
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,000
she would be driven out.

119
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,520
Siyue made a mistake,

120
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,440
and you just let it go?

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,080
So, what do you want?

122
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,040
Mother.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,440
Siyue can't always live here.

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Her father must be concerned.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,680
Siyue has reached the age
to get married.

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,480
She should go home
and spend more time

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,720
with her parents.

128
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,520
Changqing.

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you mean?

130
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,400
I mean

131
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
you shouldn't waste your time on me.

132
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,760
When we were little,

133
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,080
we used to play house.

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,080
You played the groom,

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
and I played the bride.

136
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,080
Everyone said we were a perfect match.

137
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,440
I believed I would surely marry you.

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,040
You would definitely marry me.

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Siyue.

140
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,960
That was just a casual jest.

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,400
Why take it seriously?

142
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
No.

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,560
I took it seriously.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,640
I must marry you.

145
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
If you don't marry me,

146
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll become a nun.

147
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,616
Miss Siyue, wait for me.

148
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:48,352
Siyue.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,800
Siyue.

150
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
- Miss Siyue.
- Don't be stubborn.

151
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,600
Master, you're too cold.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,760
Miss Siyue is beautiful.

153
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,560
Why are you not into her?

154
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,120
You will regret it eventually.

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,960
None of your business.

156
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,480
Miss Siyue.

157
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Siyue.

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
- Miss Siyue.
- Siyue.

159
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Miss Siyue.

160
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,600
- Miss Siyue.
- Siyue.

161
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,360
Miss Siyue.

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
Miss Siyue.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Miss Siyue.

164
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,760
She's been away all night.

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Has anything happened to her?

166
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
She's so clever.

167
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,600
She will be safe.

168
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Let's split up and search.

169
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,520
Okay.

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,680
Miss Siyue.

171
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,600
Miss Siyue.

172
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,360
Siyue.

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
Miss Siyue.

174
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,400
Miss Siyue.

175
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,040
Miss Siyue.

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,320
Siyue.

177
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
