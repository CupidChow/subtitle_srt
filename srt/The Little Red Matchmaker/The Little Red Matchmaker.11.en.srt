2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,824
Why is my love so hard?

3
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,259
It never runs smoothly.

4
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,299
I was tortured by you before.

5
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:27,499
Now, I'm tortured by him.

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,899
Am I a kitchen knife?

7
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:38,099
I have a plan.

8
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,096
(Farewell Letter)

9
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,139
Oh?

10
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,339
In our whole village,
only our Asst. Master know how to read.

11
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,139
Sorry for that.

12
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:55,459
Read.

13
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,739
Eh.

14
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:02,848
This.

15
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,056
Big...

16
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:06,339
Er...

17
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:07,499
Ah?

18
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,179
Oh,

19
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,579
well done.

20
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:15,419
Didn't you say you could read?

21
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,099
But what's written here aren't words.

22
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,419
Then what are they?

23
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,699
Are you looking down on me?

24
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,259
Big...

25
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,459
Let's perform it for you.

26
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,539
Master,

27
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,979
I'll play Miss Mei.

28
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,939
You will play Lone Wolf.

29
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,019
Is that okay?

30
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:52,379
I'll play?

31
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,179
Yes.

32
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,179
For Miss Mei's happiness,

33
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:56,739
go for it.

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,419
I'm leaving now.

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,659
Master,

36
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,059
do you have anything to tell me?

37
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:21,859
Don't get lost again.

38
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,219
Do you know

39
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,139
why I've been getting lost all the time?

40
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,099
Master, please say it.

41
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,779
If you don't say it, I will leave.

42
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,680
Wow.

43
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,339
Getting lost is

44
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,979
because you came into my lonely life.

45
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,659
Since you showed up,

46
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,259
nothing can go back.

47
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,259
Are you my disciple or my nemesis?

48
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,059
Master, where should I give acupuncture?

49
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:29,739
Jianjing.

50
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,339
Where are you giving acupuncture?

51
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:33,979
That's suture.

52
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:34,819
Oh.

53
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:36,259
I'm sorry, Master.

54
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,339
I told you not to make the net so tight.

55
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,379
The tighter the net,

56
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,619
the closer the people.

57
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,739
Just tell me.

58
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,259
What should I do?

59
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:01,779
Chase.

60
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,219
- Chase.
- Chase.

61
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,179
I see.

62
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:05,979
So it is.

63
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:06,699
Chase.

64
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:08,699
Master,

65
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:09,259
clothes.

66
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,739
- Come on.
- Master.

67
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:12,539
- Come on.
- Master.

68
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,499
Come on.

69
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:21,419
Master,

70
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,859
your acting skill is really bad.

71
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,339
It's because your script is bad.

72
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,059
I...

73
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:31,419
Hmph.

74
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,739
Miss Mei.

75
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:10,899
I heard you like me.

76
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:14,606
Yes.

77
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,619
I won't let you get lost again.

78
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:34,827
I want to be up here.

79
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,779
It happens I like you too.

80
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:54,979
What?

81
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,059
I'm saying the next line.

82
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,419
Lone Wolf ran out before hearing it all.

83
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:02,639
I see.

84
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:06,779
Let's go.

85
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,440
Master,

86
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,579
what is love?

87
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:47,059
Why does it always bring joy and sorrow?

88
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:50,720
What?

89
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,179
Do you want to try it?

90
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,179
Me?

91
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:57,859
With who?

92
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,899
Who do you want to try with?

93
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,859
I think you should be the one to try it.

94
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,139
Other men

95
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:08,864
are

96
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:10,388
dating

97
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:11,619
several ladies.

98
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,179
Look at yourself.

99
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,899
You seldom

100
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,499
have a desire.

101
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:18,699
Hey,

102
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:19,959
tell me,

103
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,849
you have illness,

104
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,259
right?

105
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,699
You should give yourself acupuncture.

106
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:28,899
How can I mess around with relationship?

107
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,459
A good man should be faithful.

108
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,499
Love is as deep as the sea.

109
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:36,339
Hold hands of my beloved

110
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,699
to grow old together.

111
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,259
Just don't hold your own hands

112
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,339
when you are old.

113
00:07:59,019 --> 00:07:59,779
Look!

114
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:00,699
Shooting star!

115
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,539
Master, make a wish.

116
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,339
- Make a wish!
- Make a wish!

117
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:22,779
- Make a wish!
- Make a wish!

118
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:23,584
Hehe.

119
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,499
Master, what wish did you make?

120
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,704
(You fool)

121
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,379
(wouldn't understand.)

122
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,539
Are you scolding me again?

123
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:56,864
