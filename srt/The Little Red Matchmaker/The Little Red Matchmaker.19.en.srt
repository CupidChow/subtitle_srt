2
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,695
Shennong tasted the herbs.

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,816
The best way to identify medicines

4
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:24,228
is to taste them.

5
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,028
What do I taste like?

6
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,628
Sweet.

7
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:43,528
Master.

8
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:44,995
Bad news.

9
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:46,595
Mrs. Jiang was bitten by a snake.

10
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:55,478
Changqing.

11
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:55,778
Yes.

12
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:57,211
You must save her.

13
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,811
Yan sucked out the poison.

14
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:01,811
Otherwise, I would have died.

15
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:40,778
Ah.

16
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:41,411
Ouch.

17
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:48,178
Liu Yingying.

18
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:48,444
Ah.

19
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:51,011
It looks nice.

20
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:05,411
Decoct the medicine.

21
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:08,844
Yes.

22
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:12,778
Don't cry.

23
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:16,544
Poor girl, you've been suffering.

24
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:21,844
Now I am homeless.

25
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:23,844
Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,444
I'm here for you.

27
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,978
You can stay in my house.

28
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:28,778
Hmph.

29
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,211
Your story is fake.

30
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:33,644
You have so many sachets.

31
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,111
To repel mosquitoes?

32
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:38,744
The medicine is here.

33
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:42,744
Here.

34
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:46,944
It's hot.

35
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:50,944
Is it hot?

36
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:55,744
It's not.

37
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,411
It's because I got seriously poisoned.

38
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,144
My senses are a bit disordered.

39
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:04,178
Yan.

40
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:05,378
I feel so dizzy.

41
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,144
Don't worry.

42
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,244
You will be alright.

43
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:10,511

Qing.

79
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:57,511
Qing.

80
00:05:58,544 --> 00:05:59,578
Are you there?

81
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:01,611
Accompany me to check on Yan.

82
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:04,444
Changqing?

83
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:05,278
Eh?

84
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,644
Where is he?

85
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:29,178
No, thanks.

86
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:31,344
You eat it.

87
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,511
I'm not hungry.

88
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,544
When we are together,

89
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,578
why do you always avoid my mother?

90
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:48,704
She has misunderstandings about me.

91
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:49,911
I am worried.

92
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,811
Don't worry, I'm here.

93
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,744
Let's clarify it with my mother.

94
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,844
Give me some more time.

95
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,244
You don't have much time left.

96
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:17,744
Qing.

97
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:19,778
Look at this prescription.

98
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,244
What does it mean?

99
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:22,811
Miss Yan.

100
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,840
It's too early

101
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:24,977
for you to study this.

102
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:27,544
Qing.

103
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:28,377
Qing.

104
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:29,664
Take a look.

105
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:31,378
What medicine is this?

106
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:35,378
I have to go out now.

107
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,811
Qing, I'm so dizzy.

108
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,244
Qing.

109
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:47,778
I hurt myself.

110
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:49,611
You check on me.

111
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,811
Let me help.

112
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:58,644
Qing.

113
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,278
She…

114
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,311
She hurt me.

115
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,444
It means she did right.

116
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:02,977
Yingying.

117
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:05,411
You have improved.

118
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,344
It means you're a good teacher.

119
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:09,611
Qing.

120
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:13,011
Someone needs to be needled.

121
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,544
I am getting dizzy again.

122
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,944
Maybe the needle was placed wrong.

123
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:19,978
Qing.

124
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:22,378
Qing.

125
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:23,011
Hey.

126
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:24,411
I will check on you.

127
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:29,111
You got a cold
and need to wear more clothes.

128
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:29,878
Hmph.

129
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:30,978
Master.

130
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:34,044
You…

131
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:35,978
Eh?

132
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,244
What are you doing?

133
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:47,311
Mother.

134
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:50,644
Mrs. Jiang.

135
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,777
Liu Yingying is bullying me.

136
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:55,344
Liu Yingying.

137
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:57,244
Aren't you going too far?

138
00:08:57,444 --> 00:08:59,211
Madam, I didn't.

139
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:00,911
Mother.

140
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:02,844
It has nothing to do with her.

141
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,044
I don't want Yan to stay here.

142
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,244
Let me tell you.

143
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,611
Yan saved my life.

144
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,411
None of you can bully her.

145
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:12,911
Mrs. Jiang.

146
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:15,644
Maybe I should just leave.

147
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,611
Qing has said so.

148
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,524
He's been taking care of me

149
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,411
these days.

150
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:24,611
I don't want
to make it difficult for him.

151
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:26,611
Why?

152
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:28,944
Why do you think so?

153
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,644
Oh.

154
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,177
It's Liu Yingying.

155
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,711
You have a bad influence on my son.

156
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:34,844
I will get to you later.

157
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:35,511
Hmph.

158
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:41,011
Yan.

159
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:41,411
Hmm.

160
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:42,378
Don't be afraid.

161
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:43,811
You should not leave.

162
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:44,911
She should leave.

163
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:45,577
Hmm.

164
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:50,611
(To be continued)
Have you fallen for Yan?

165
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:52,178
No.

166
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,144
I'm just worried about my mother.

167
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,111
Aren't you worried about me?

168
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,511
Am I important to you?

169
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,278
Yes.

170
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:00,378
Yingying.

171
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:03,911
