=Episode 16=

2
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,766
What's going on?

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,499
I've set them up.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,400
I should be happy.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,666
Well,

6
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,299
have I fallen for him?

7
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,299
Impossible.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,966
Love is unpredictable.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,733
What's impossible about it?

10
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,366
Yue Lao, are you doing some tricks?

11
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,266
Cheers.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,733
Why did you break up a loving couple

13
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,866
and seize my chance?

14
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:18,144
How should I know about your love

15
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,733
with Miss Muke?

16
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:23,666
It's all my fault.

17
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:24,533
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,666
It's not all your fault.

19
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,133
It's because I've repeatedly failed.

20
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,266
I'm not worthy of Muke.

21
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:35,766
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,166
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,100
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:46,566
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:48,666
Muke.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,500
What would you like to eat?

27
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,066
The West Lake vinegar fish is good.

28
00:01:58,933 --> 00:01:59,799
Do you want to try it?

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,333
All right.

30
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:03,899
West Lake vinegar fish.

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,266
Our marriage?

32
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,166
Well…

33
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,266
I'll follow your decision.

34
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:12,933
Then…

35
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,466
Oh.

36
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:46,933
What a coincidence.

37
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:50,973
Yes.

38
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,466
You must be hungry.

39
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,599
Give it a try.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Right.

41
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,399
Indeed, I am no match for Dr. Jiang.

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,266
He's talented and wealthy.

43
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,466
Compared to him,

44
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,333
all I have is a sincere heart.

45
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm sentimental.

46
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:41,299
It's not about love.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,100
As life comes to an end,

48
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,400
my bitterness is endless.

49
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,333
I love.

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,499
I hate.

51
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,566
I don't deserve it.

52
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,766
Since I met you,

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,966
I've never fallen for other men.

54
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,799
In my whole life,

55
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:22,500
I've always

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,199
only loved you.

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,966
Take me with you.

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,366
Okay.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,666
What are you laughing at?

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,100
Sit.

61
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:48,966
Oh.

62
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,500
West Lake vinegar fish.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Five,

64
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,100
four,

65
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,000
three,

66
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,566
two.

67
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,299
How does it taste?

68
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,733
It's sour.

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,533
Is it just sour?

70
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,133
Hmm.

71
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,500
It's sweet too.

72
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:54,999
Will my father come after me?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No.

74
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,000
My Master is stalling him.

75
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,733
Hurry up, Zhang Sheng is waiting.

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,300
Ghosts.

77
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:05,300
Miss.

78
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:05,999
Hold on.

79
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,166
Don't stop me. Let me die.

80
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,999
I don't want to live anymore.

81
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:11,933
Stop her.

82
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:12,866
Yes.

83
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:16,866
So,

84
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,499
you eloped with someone
and were sold to a brothel.

85
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,199
That's why you attempted suicide.

86
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,666
I sponsored him

87
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,699
to take the imperial examination,

88
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,666
waiting for him to succeed.

89
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,566
To climb the social ladder,

90
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,566
he sold me to a brothel.

91
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,666
I was so stupid,

92
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,999
not listening to my parents' advice.

93
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,133
Now,

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,333
I'm afraid of going back
to face my parents.

95
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,599
I can only end it all with death.

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,000
When will the faithless man arrive?

97
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,233
I hope

98
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,499
I have never met him.

99
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,866
Why is there a faint scent of fox?

100
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:05,733
Some men are unfaithful,

101
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,366
while women are loyal to love.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,433
Yingying.

103
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:14,833
Yes?

104
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,533
Will Zhang Sheng treat me this way too?

105
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,866
Muke.

106
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,800
Zhang Sheng would never do that to you.

107
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Anyway,

108
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,466
he can't succeed.

109
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:27,466
Huh?

110
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:29,200
Muke.

111
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,999
If you believe he can make you happy,

112
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,099
don't look back and move on.

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,666
Hmm.

114
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:41,433
Okay.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Yingying.

116
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,000
I believe in Zhang Sheng.

117
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:55,699
Be happy.

118
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:56,666
Okay.

119
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,333
Who is that heartless man you mentioned?

120
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,366
I must avenge you.

121
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,700
It's in the past.

122
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:16,766
Just let it go.

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,899
But I can't.

124
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,933
You fox demon.

125
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,600
Next time,

126
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:26,366
remember to wash off the fox stench
from your body.

127
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:40,166
(To be continued)

128
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:40,899
Yingying.

129
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,933
Wake up.

130
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,199
