2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,466
Mrs. Jiang.

3
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:13,166
Yan is not a good person.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,766
Don't be fooled by her.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,000
Mother.

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,999
This woman has malicious intentions.

7
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,366
She's not a good person.

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,866
Please don't be tricked.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,533
What did you say?

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,766
Do you think I'm stupid?

11
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,333
How dare you?

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,400
Changqing.

13
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,300
How did you become like this?

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,899
Ah?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,166
You ungrateful child.

16
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:37,766
You…

17
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,166
Kneel down.

18
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:40,800
Mrs. Jiang.

19
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:41,899
Mrs. Jiang.

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,600
Don't blame him.

21
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,133
He used to be obedient.

22
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,133
It must be Liu Yingying.

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,866
She bewitched Qing.

24
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,166
That's why he changed like this.

25
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:53,566
It's all my fault.

26
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,000
I failed to remind him.

27
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:56,766
Get up.

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,900
Get up.

29
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,616
I have heard

30
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:02,166
that you two have a thing.

31
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,066
Turns out it's true.

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,900
As long as I'm alive,

33
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,933
I will never let you two be together.

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
I have asked the fortune teller.

35
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:14,299
Liu Yingying and you do not match.

36
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,766
If you marry Liu Yingying,

37
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,100
our family

38
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,166
will have no descendants.

39
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,666
Qing.

40
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,400
You and Yan

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,400
are a perfect match.

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,966
If you two get married,

43
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,266
our family

44
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,100
will be prosperous

45
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,866
and thriving.

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,966
Mother.

47
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,766
Mrs. Jiang.

48
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,399
I know you don't like me.

49
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,766
But Master and I are truly in love.

50
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:48,066
You…

51
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:49,466
Please give us your blessing.

52
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,066
Mother.

53
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,666
Aside from Yingying,

54
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,000
I wouldn't like someone else.

55
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:56,500
What?

56
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,466
Mrs. Jiang.

57
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:58,499
Look.

58
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,166
It was Liu Yingying who bewitched him.

59
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,766
He even defied you for her.

60
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,633
You shut up.

61
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,600
You shut up.

62
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,333
I'm the head of the Jiang family.

63
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:09,666
Somebody!

64
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,392
Drive Liu Yingying out

65
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,099
of my house.

66
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,200
Mother.

67
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,200
It has nothing to do with Yingying.

68
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:17,966
It was me who liked her first.

69
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:19,966
If you must punish her,

70
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,266
punish me instead.

71
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,333
You…

72
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,100
You unfilial son.

73
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:29,966
I raised you through toil.

74
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:32,399
I never expected

75
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,533
when you grew up,

76
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,599
you would abandon me.

77
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,466
Do you want to infuriate me to death?

78
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:40,333
You…

79
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:41,099
You…

80
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:42,166
Mother.

81
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:45,800
Mrs. Jiang.

82
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,100
Mrs. Jiang, I should leave.

83
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,966
I'm an orphan,

84
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,799
a drifter.

85
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,533
Luckily, I was taken in

86
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,733
by you and Qing.

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,066
I finally found a place to stay.

88
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,066
But now someone can't tolerate me.

89
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,066
I don't understand.

90
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,899
What's wrong with liking Qing?

91
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,299
Please punish me.

92
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,800
Please.

93
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,766
Don't be like this. It's not your fault.
I'm to blame.

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,933
I have an unfilial son.

95
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,566
Changqing.

96
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:21,966
Tell me.

97
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,064
Between me and Liu Yingying,

98
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,999
make your choice.

99
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Mother.

100
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Mother.

101
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,666
My mind is made up.

102
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,499
You unfilial child.

103
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,533
You…

104
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,966
You're driving me crazy.

105
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:52,833
You…

106
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:53,466
You…

107
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,100
Mother.

108
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,900
Mrs. Jiang.

109
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,366
You did a good job.

110
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,666
Thank you.

111
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:07,799
Glad to help you.

112
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:15,533
Mother.

113
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,766
Mother, take the medicine.

114
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,933
I won't take it.

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,733
If you don't break up with Liu Yingying,

116
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,099
I won't take the medicine.

117
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:33,499
I might as well die.

118
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,266
Mother.

119
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:42,266
Yingying.

120
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,900
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,366
I can't be with you anymore.

122
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,933
Didn't you say you love me

123
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,066
and will marry me?

124
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,799
My mother is sick.

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,900
What shall we do then?

126
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,566
Have you fallen for Yan?

127
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,133
No.

128
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,866
I'm worried about my mother.

129
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,100
Aren't you worried about me?

130
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Am I important to you?

131
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,266
Yes.

132
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,299
Yingying.

133
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,000
Do not

134
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:11,866
regret this.

135
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:15,566
Yingying.

136
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,033
I knew it.

137
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,166
Even the strongest relationships
can have cracks.

138
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,920
Finally, I've found an opportunity

139
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,733
to cast the Heartless Curse.

140
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,066
People do change.

141
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,280
Yingying.

142
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,733
I have packed your things for you.

143
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,933
You can leave now.

144
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,030
Jiang Changqing.

145
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,966
I'm asking you one last time.

146
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,733

Though I only like you,

170
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,666
my mother would be angry

171
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
if we did something improper.

Hey.

Your mother listens to me.

181
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,333

182
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:29,199
Now that you knew the truth,

183
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,299
you didn't blame me.

184

Now I like you.

187
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:47,366
Cut.

188
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,133
You…

189
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,266
