=The Little Red Matchmaker=
=Episode 5=

2
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,240
Take her pulse.

3
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,120
Oh, my.

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,560
It's intermittent.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,760
She needs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,640
I can't help.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why not? Saving a life matters.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Changqing.

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,480
You have to take responsibility for me.

10
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:37,344
You're responsible.

11
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,296
What?

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,400
I'll beat you to death.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,360
I'll beat you.

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Reincarnation would be easier than this.

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,080
It's been a month and a half.

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,640
I've done my best.

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,560
Yue Lao.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
I just want to give up.

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,760
You can't.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not easy to change one's fate.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,920
You must work harder.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,760
You'd better get moving.

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,904
Yue Lao.

24
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,840
You also need to take action.

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
Otherwise, no one would

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,200
visit your shabby temple.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
Hey, you...

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,400
Well,

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,040
listen,

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,920
I think very highly of you.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,800
I believe you can do it,

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
alright?

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
If you do this job well,

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,320
you'll enjoy all brocade and silk satin,
Manchu Han Imperial Feast

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
and all kinds of delicacies
from mountains and seas.

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Okay?

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,760
Pie in the sky?

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm already stuffed.

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Well,

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,080
they are

41
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,760
childhood playmates.

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,080
But how come Jiang Changqing

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,280
has no feelings for his cousin?

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,440
Don't always do it alone.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Try to work with others.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
With whom?

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
His cousin?

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
I have a poor relationship with her.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,440
You know it.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,560
I mean Mrs. Jiang.

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,880
She's anxious about her son's marriage.

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,800
You make her more anxious.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
That's right.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,400
Stir up troubles.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,640
It's a different way to solve problems.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
Mr. Zhang got married,
and Mr. Li is engaged.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
Mr. Zhao has a one-month-old son.

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
They are of the same age.

59
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
Only Qing is the one yet to get married.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,880
Mrs. Jiang.

61
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:55,680
You can arrange my Master's marriage.

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
You can't always indulge him.

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,080
I know.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,640
It's all because I've spoiled him.

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
Now,

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
it's time I make a move.

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,640
Yingying.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,760
You buy a soft-shelled turtle.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,920
Make soup for Qing

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,040
to nourish his body.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,320
Yes, Mrs. Jiang.

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,700
(Love potion)
To have a grandson,

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,320
the final step

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
will depend on you.

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Here it is.

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
Soft-shelled turtle soup.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,040
Changqing.

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,400
I've spent four hours on this soup.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,880
I even scalded my hand.

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
She did.

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,440
Changqing.

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Try this.

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
I made this dish.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,760
I got it.

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,080
And the soup.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,920
Eat the soup while it's hot.

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,800
There are more dishes
in the kitchen. I'll go serve.

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,360
Changqing.

89
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:10,880
Try it.

90
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,520
Mother.

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,280
Siyue.

92
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,120
I don't have a good appetite.

93
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,560
How can you be so thoughtless?

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,880
Don't let down Siyue.

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
Eat more while it's hot.

96
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
Mother.

97
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll eat.

98
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Here comes the dish.

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Changqing.

100
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,080
Changqing.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
Master, are you alright?

102
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,440
I feel a bit dizzy.

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
(What's wrong with me?)

104
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
(My heart rate's increasing.)

105
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
(I'm feeling hot all over.)

106
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
(I can't help thinking…)

107
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,480
Yingying.

108
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,040
Hurry.

109
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,600
Help me back to the room.

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
Go with them.

111
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,400
Changqing.

112
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,600
I'll help you.

113
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,000
You…

114
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,800
You get him water.

115
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay.

116
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,120
Changqing.

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Changqing.

118
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Changqing.

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,800
The water.

120
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,640
Give it to me.

121
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
Changqing, drink some water.

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Master, are you all right?

123
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,560
He's fine, but I'm not.

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,720
Well…

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,400
you may leave.

126
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,080
The door is over there. Go.

127
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,880
You take care of him then.

128
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,960
Go.

129
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,640
What is love?

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,280
People can die

131
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
for it.

132
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,960
Oh, my goodness.

133
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,720
Changqing.

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,120
Changqing.

135
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,960
Changqing.

136
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:51,760
