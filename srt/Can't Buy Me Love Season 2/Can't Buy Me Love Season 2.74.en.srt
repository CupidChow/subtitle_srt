Hi, poopie.

366
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:16,133
Yeah, I'm still at home,
but I'm on my way to the bar.

That's the thing, loveybabes.
I can't go right now.

368
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,533
I have to stay
with Grandma Nene.

[IRENE]<i> Why?

<i> What happened?</i>

371
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,467
Did something happen
to Caroline?

[SNOOP] No.

<i>Papi asked me
to keep Grandma Nene company.</i>

375
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,067
Bingo and Ling
are doing fine in Batanes.

379

it's good for them to get away.

380
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,733
Don't tell anyone, okay?

381
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,167
It's top secret.

382
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,833
Of course, poopie,
no one should know.

that everyone's here.

to search for Caroline.

- He's not here.

387
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,433
It's probably why
Auntie Gina is here.

388
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,067
Alright, alright.
Don't tell anyone, okay?

389
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,667
Of course not.

390
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,000
