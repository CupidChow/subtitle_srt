in the autopsy report,

241

this would be your
second piece of evidence.

242

Like what I told Caroline,

245
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,633
you need three

First is Caroline's statement.

if it matches.

Attorney,
if we get him to talk,

252
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,000
can that be
the third statement?

253
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,167
It depends on what
his statement will be.

254
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,900
And if he's willing
to turn state witness.

255

But right now,

256
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,467

to take legal action
and get them to open the case.
