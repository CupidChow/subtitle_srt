00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,767
Is this about
Papi Monching leaving?

356
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:26,667
Are you doing all this so he
won't leave for abroad?

357
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,400
Yes, that's it.

358
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,400
So, are you still going
to stop me?

359
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,567
- [GRUNTS] I said I'm fine.
- Bingo.

360
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,867
- I can manage.
- That's not how it works.

361
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,800
You don't get it, do you?

362
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,367
Believe me, Ling.

363
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,867
That's how it works.

364
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,300
I have
to double my efforts

365
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,233
so Papi won't
need to leave

366
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,567
and we'll still
be complete.

367
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,800
But Bingo, what are you
worrying about?

368
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,533
You'll still be a family
even if Papi is abroad.

369
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,067
You have a close
relationship with each other.

370
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,400
Look at my family.

371
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,633
We live under
the same roof,

372
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,667
but we're not as tight
as you are.

373
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,267
We're not like you,
Grandma, and Papi.

374
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,567
Exactly. You're all
related by blood,

375
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,433
but your family still
feels incomplete.

376
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,467
Imagine what it's like for
adopted children like me.

377
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
You're adopted?
