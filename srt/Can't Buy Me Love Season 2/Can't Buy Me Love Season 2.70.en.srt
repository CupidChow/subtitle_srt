00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,088
Do you think he'll
tell you the truth?

359
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,261
Sometimes,

360
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,098
even the truth can be bought.

361
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,643
Sir, it's done.

00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,802
I need to know who really
killed my mother.

364
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,512
I thought it was the Tius.

365
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,805
I'm not sure anymore.

366
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,309
Papa, it's Auntie Cindy.

367
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,685
She seems bothered.

368
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,812
- Bingo?
- Ling? Why are you here?

369
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,357
Did you like what I sent you?
I want to see you.

370
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,735
I cannot just leave.

371
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,196
Ling's life is in
danger too.

- Ah! What the--?!

00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,824
Hey!

374
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,659
Looks like I need to do
more than digging.
