I've done for you?

360
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,933
I'm sorry, Stephen.

361
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,600
Anyway, are you up
for dinner tonight?

362
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,333
I can't. I'm going to
have dinner with Bingo.

363
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,767
Dinner? Just the two of you?

364
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,933
Like a date?

365
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,600
No.

366
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,733
It's a business meeting.

367
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,167
About your proposal
to get a grant

368
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,933
from Jonathan's company?

369
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,467
Yes.

370
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,400
Okay.

371
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,000
Then I'll join you guys.

372
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:40,633
Why?

373
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,633
Why not? It's just a
business meeting after all.

374
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,700
And, you know,

375
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,467
it's time I get to know
that Bingo.

376
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:47,633
After all, I'm your
best friend, right?

377
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:50,300
- Stephen...
- Come on.

378
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,133
I might have some ideas
that could help.

379
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,800
I'll arrange a place for us.

380
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,433
Let's just meet
another day, okay?

381
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,833
Caroline,

382
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,967
Auntie Cindy asked me
to look out for you.

383
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:04,967
So, I'm here to make sure
that you're safe.

384
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,033
Okay?

385
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,800
Were you able to talk to her?

386
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Actually, Attorney, I only got
to talk to her assistant.

387
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:20,000
But when they found out
that it was you and Miss Cindy

388
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,500
who were asking for a meeting,
she said yes right away.

389
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,867
She had all her meetings
canceled for you.

390
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,500
So, we have a meeting then.

391
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,667
Yes, Miss Cindy.

392
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,533
Attorney, she'll meet you
tomorrow for lunch.

393
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,667
Thank you, Minda.

394
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,400
- Sure.

396
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:47,367
So, this is it.

397
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,367
Yes.

398
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,267
We're going to
meet her tomorrow.
