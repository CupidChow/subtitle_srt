is already yours, Ms. Annie.

362
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,267
So as of now,
you hold forty-three percent

363
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,567
of the whole GLC,

364
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,100
distributed under
different names, of course.

365
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,433
Good.

366
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,067
We only need eight percent
to take full control

367
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
of the company.

368
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,367
Yes.

369
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,433
So, Wilson Tiu holds
twenty percent of the shares.

370
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:25,900
His legal wife, Cindy,
holds seven percent.

371
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,200
And then, there's this
two-percent consolation

372
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,100
for his mistress, Gina.

373
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,400
And the rest of
the twenty-two percent

374
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,600
is evenly distributed
among his five children.

375
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:39,933
So they all hold
4.4 percent each.

376
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,800
So where will we get
the remaining eight percent?

377
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,133
I can get...

378
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:52,033
4.4 percent

379
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,800
