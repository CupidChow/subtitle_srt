357
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,200
What about Ling?
What did she say?

358
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,333
We haven't had the chance
to talk properly.

359
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,900
- It's one thing after another.
- [PHONE RINGING]

360
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,167
[PHONE RINGING]

361
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,367
Papi.

362
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,367
<i> Bingo!</i>

363
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,033
<i> Mama had an accident.</i>

364
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:50,200
What?! Grandma?!

365
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,767
<i> She hit her head.</i>   We'll
take her to the hospital.

366
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,033
What?!

367
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:56,500
Boy, what happened?

368
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,700
Boy! Hey!

369
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,633
<i>Auntie Cindy had a hand
in all of this.</i>

370
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:05,367
<i>What you need is strong
evidence that points to her.</i>

371
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,267
<i>Your mom will use
all of her money</i>

372
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,033
<i> to twist the truth.</i>

373
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,800
<i> I won't let that happen.</i>

374
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,067
<i>Caroline shouldn't
dig up anything further.</i>

375
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,133
<i> I'll handle it.</i>

376
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,500
<i>Give me a
position at GLC.</i>

377
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,233
<i> I want to replace you.</i>

378
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,567
<i> We need to stop her.</i>

379
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,167
<i>The patient has a hematoma
due to trauma.</i>

380
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,267
<i> Let's go home!</i>

381
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:26,467
<i>I don't want
to stay here.</i>

382
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,900
<i>We need to transfer Mama
to a public hospital.</i>

383
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,600
<i>- It's too expensive here.
- I have money.</i>

384
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
<i> I can do this!</i>

385
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,833
<i> I'll succeed!</i>

386
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,700
<i> How? Tell me how.</i>
