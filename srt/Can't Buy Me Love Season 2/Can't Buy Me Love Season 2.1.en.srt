00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,800
<i>He might not be a good
influence to Caroline.</i>

362
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,967
<i>They were in Edward's condo.
I saw them.</i>

363
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,767
I know you have something to do
<i> with Edward's murder.</i>

364
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,000
<i> Ma, I said stop!</i>

365
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,100
<i>- Ah!
- [SLAPS]</i>

366
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,967
<i>A park? Out of all the places,
he went here?</i>

00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,300
<i>You only come here
if you're meeting someone.</i>

368
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,700
<i>Someone whose identity
we don't know yet.</i>
