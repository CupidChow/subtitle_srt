If I make a mistake,
we'll be in trouble.

355
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,433
Don't think about our boss.

356
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,733
I'm the one he transacts with.

357
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,400
I should be the one
to worry about him.

We're being cautious, boss.

362

Don't worry, boss.
