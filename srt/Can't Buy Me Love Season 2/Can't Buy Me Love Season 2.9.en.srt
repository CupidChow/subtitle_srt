00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,333
And that's the best training,
Ling.

356
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,033
To become open,

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,100
and make other people
benefit from it.

358
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,200
If your mom were still alive,

359
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,100
she will say the same thing.

360
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,467
I didn't meet her,
but I know,

361
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,133
as a mother,

362
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,867
she's watching you right now

363
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,133
and she's so proud of you.

364
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,733
Just like I am now.

365
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,967
Thank you, Auntie.

366
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,967
This means a lot to me.

367
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,000
Bingo.

368
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,567
Come here.

369
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,800
Ah...

370
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:44,667
Yes.

371
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,967
You two make a good pair.

372
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,633
You make good partners.

373
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:53,800
But it's a waste,

374
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,233
because this is the end.

375
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,867
Auntie?

376
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,000
You made such a good proposal,
Ling.

377
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,533
I don't have anything left
to teach you.

378
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,667
It's time for you to shine.

379
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,933
You should take your brilliance
in your own company.

380
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,833
Starting now,

381
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,033
your training ends here.

382
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,900
Congrats, Ling.

383
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,600
It's your graduation.

384
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,967
Are you not happy?

385
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,100
Isn't this
what you're waiting for?

386
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,067
To come back to your old life?
