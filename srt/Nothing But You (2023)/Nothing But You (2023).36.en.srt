2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,100
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,980
(- Hi, Mr. Strong.
- What's Wrong, Ms. Smarty?)

4
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,112
(Congratulations, Ms. Liang.)

5
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:00,832
(I've heard about it.)

6
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:03,432
(Song Sanchuan, your first seed,)

7
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,352
(has signed a management contract
with Young Space.)

8
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,032
(Now that you're backed
by such a large group,)

9
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:09,791
(I'm confident that your group
will have a good future.)

10
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,832
(Don't worry about our collaboration.)

11
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,832
(Everything will proceed
according to what we've planned.)

12
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:16,512
That's great.

13
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:18,312
All your problems have been solved now.

14
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:21,352
Don't you regret saying that now?

15
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:33,032
Somehow, I think the contract

16
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,152
is not as simple as it seems.

17
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:35,472
I know what's on your mind.

18
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:38,032
You feel sorry for Song Sanchuan,
seeing how he's getting exploited.

19
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:40,232
You don't want to see him being bullied.

20
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:42,712
But you need to accept the fact too.

21
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,112
If you don't solve the problem
right before you,

22
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:46,272
there won't be any future at all.

23
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,792
I'm just really upset.

24
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,072
It was a huge deal,

25
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,832
and he didn't even discuss it with me.

26
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:54,872
At that moment,

27
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,032
I just failed to control my emotions.

28
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:58,072
But I didn't know
he would actually leave.

29
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:06,792
You would be upset

30
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:07,912
if he brings this up.

31
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,592
So let me ask you something.

32
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:12,192
Are you ready?

33
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,192
Your boyfriend

34
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,032
might soon become
a completely different man

35
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,312
than the man you first knew.

36
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,032
Do you want to take this chance

37
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,272
to prepare yourself?

38
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:29,432
Did you take your mom's words

39
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,232
to heart?

40
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,632
Today, you failed

41
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,032
to handle the situation calmly.

42
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,912
Were you being defensive?

43
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:54,352
You look pretty. Look here.

44
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:55,112
You were right.

45
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:56,592
- It's quite crowded here.
- One. Two. Three.

46
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:59,592
It's a very famous bar in Xiamen.

47
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:00,992
All their patrons
are handsome and pretty.

48
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,872
Here. One. Two.

49
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:03,712
What did you say?

50
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,872
They're all handsome and pretty,

51
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:09,712
but

52
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:11,552
I only have eyes for you, my darling.

53
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,352
- Look here.
- That's good.

54
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:14,992
So pretty.

55
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,752
- Again.
- My wife is so beautiful.

56
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,580
(Liang You'an)

57
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:24,912
You'an, what's the matter?

58
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:26,952
(You should end your vacation earlier
if you've had enough fun.)

59
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,912
(We're bringing forward
Top Love's opening).

60
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,472
Have you solved all the issues?

61
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:33,992
(There's no room for change.)

62
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,192
(Let's start the operation first.)

63
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,232
(Come back and prepare for the opening.)

64
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:37,712
(I intend to make you)

65
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:38,952
(the manager of Top Love.)

66
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,032
Really?

67
00:04:40,352 --> 00:04:42,232
I'll book a flight back home now.

68
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,352
What? You're going back home now?

69
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:44,952
You'an wants me

70
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,752
to be the manager of Top Love.

71
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,232
What's going on?

72
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:49,072
Our vacation isn't ending

73
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,232
for another week.

74
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,552
We can have our honeymoon anytime.

75
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:54,352
But I can't miss
a promotion opportunity.

76
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:55,912
Jiang Jiaojiao.

77
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,072
Soon,

78
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:58,352
you will address me as Ms. Liang.

79
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,352
I'm not going to do that.

80
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:01,592
I'm still playing for Top Smash.

81
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:03,112
Once you become

82
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,392
the manager of Top Love,

83
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,672
we won't be able to
see each other as often.

84
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,112
It's taking a turn for the worse.

85
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:08,592
It sounds great.

86
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,632
Aren't we a good match?

87
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,392
I'm going to be a manager soon.

88
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,072
Shouldn't I buy some new outfits?

89
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:16,392
I guess so.

90
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:18,792
You can make up all sorts of excuses,

91
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,552
so that you can shop for new clothes.

92
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:23,432
Buy all you want.

93
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:24,952
What do you think about this?

94
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:26,272
It's nice.

95
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,952
Everything looks good on you.

96
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,100
Okay.

97
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,112
Let's go.

98
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,472
Let's go back now.
I'm expecting a parcel.

99
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:36,992
Let's go.

100
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:37,552
Wait. We...

101
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:38,472
Are we leaving now?

102
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,672
Let's go.

103
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,472
I'm too excited.

104
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,352
I'm going to be a manager.

105
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:46,872
Song Sanchuan.

106
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:55,872
You can quarrel anytime you want,

107
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,152
but why did you have to do it now?

108
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:58,632
The elder sister is having a fight
with her boyfriend,

109
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,712
so she invited her younger sister
to go all out at work.

110
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,672
I lost half of my honeymoon
because of you,

111
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:03,672
so how are you going to pay me back?

112
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:05,952
Jiaojiao.

113
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:09,032
I have to step in to defend Sanchuan.

114
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,472
We've received the sign-on bonus,

115
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,752
and Top Love has started its operation.

116
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:12,872
Everything went well.

117
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,512
We must not give in this time.

118
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:15,992
You'an only got upset

119
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:16,992
because he was being sold
at a cheap price.

120
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,992
She did that
because she cared about you a lot.

121
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:22,232
Song Sanchuan.

122
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,792
Think from another perspective.

123
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,112
You are a man.

124
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:26,112
Why can't you

125
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,272
let the woman win?

126
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:28,992
She caters to your every whim.

127
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:29,872
Yet, you took it for granted

128
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,432
and picked up a fight with her.

129
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:33,392
Song Sanchuan,
you call yourself a man, huh?

130
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,832
Stop talking.

131
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,432
Stop talking. Please!

132
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,112
Haven't you been in a fight before?

133
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,552
For a quarrel to happen,

134
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:41,792
you have to keep talking back.

135
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,112
And sometimes,

136
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,432
you say something you shouldn't.

137
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,992
I know I was at fault.

138
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,192
What did you say?

139
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:52,392
We'll be your judges.

140
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:53,712
What did you say?

141
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,312
You won't get it anyway.

142
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,552
Get out of my way.

143
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:58,512
Wait. Tell us.

144
00:06:58,512 --> 00:06:58,872
Tell us...

145
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:00,552
Don't come in here. Get out!

146
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:00,992
Tell us what happened.

147
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:01,832
Tell us. Please.

148
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,020
(Linglong Mansion)

149
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:45,832
Chuan.

150
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:47,432
- Wait...
- I got you some local delicacies.

151
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:47,952
Jiaojiao.

152
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:49,152
Why did I only get eight pieces?

153
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,592
Why did he get ten pieces?

154
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,672
My wife bought them. You can ask her.

155
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:54,872
Ms. Liang, you're playing favorites.

156
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,472
The content is all the same.

157
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:58,272
My outfit is here, Jiang Jiaojiao.

158
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,112
It looks good. Try putting it on.

159
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,272
You're all here.

160
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:05,552
What brings you here?

161
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:07,392
I'm here for her.

162
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:09,112
Liang Tao has good news
to share with you.

163
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,032
What's going on?

164
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:11,752
Wait...

165
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,432
No.

166
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,472
It's not what you think.

167
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,552
Let me take this chance

168
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:17,272
to make an official announcement.

169
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,152
Liang Tao

170
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,672
is now the manager of Top Love.

171
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,352
Congratulations.

172
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:23,632
Ms. Liang.

173
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,712
All right.

174
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,272
But before we find the right candidate

175
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,152
to take over my current job,

176
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,152
I will continue

177
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:29,632
to play the marketing role as well.

178
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,752
Little Ms. Liang.

179
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:36,032
You'an, it's lunchtime.

180
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:36,872
You must be hungry.

181
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,872
Let's order food delivery.
We'll have lunch together.

182
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:40,232
It's fine. I'll have instant noodles.

183
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:41,152
Stay there.

184
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:49,152
I'll cook it for you.

185
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,200
Do you want it?

186
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,640
No. No means no.

187
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,280
The noodles are ready.

188
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
What's wrong with you, Sanchuan?

189
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,440
You said you were going
to cook instant noodles for us,

190
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,800
but you served them plain.

191
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Why didn't you put a few eggs in it?

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,920
He's right.

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,200
I like plain instant noodles.

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,880
I like plain instant noodles too.

195
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,320
Darling, let's eat only
plain instant noodles from now on.

196
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
We will skip the seasoning too.

197
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes.

198
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
- I can't take it anymore.
- Let's dig in.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,560
Plain instant noodles are the best.

200
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,480
I'll get some for you.

201
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,960
Aren't you eating?

202
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,840
I...

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,440
I am.

204
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
I can't take it anymore. I'm full.

205
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,320
Do you want soup?

206
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,400
It's fine. I'll just eat the noodles.

207
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,360
All right.

208
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,080
Plain noodles.

209
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,480
Sanchuan, dig in.

210
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,040
Dig in.

211
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
Can't you move over a little?

212
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,600
Listen to me. Add some eggs next time.

213
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,760
It tastes so good.

214
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
You can add some sausages too.

215
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Ms. Liang.

216
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Please don't stay mad at me.

217
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,320
Why are you still mad at me?

218
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,000
It's bad for your liver.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,080
It's not worth it
to ruin your liver for me.

220
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,080
Stop acting.

221
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
If I didn't come here,

222
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
you wouldn't have apologized to me,

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
sent me a text,

224
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,480
or even come home, right?

225
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,400
No. You know

226
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm a timid person, right?

227
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm afraid
that you haven't forgiven me yet.

228
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
What should I do
if you're still mad at me?

229
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
What should I do if you hit me?

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Why did I decide to date a guy
who's younger than me?

231
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,360
You gave me a cold shoulder
when you were mad.

232
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,720
No...

233
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,960
I had to come here to pick you up
and pacify you, huh?

234
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
I'm not mad.

235
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Ms. Liang, please don't stay mad at me.

236
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Do you want me to piggyback you?

237
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
Should I piggyback you home?

238
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,560
Let me piggyback you.

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,240
I'll piggyback you home.

240
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,680
Let me piggyback you.

241
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,640
What happened that day

242
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,080
was my fault.

243
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
I shouldn't have said that.

244
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,800
I was being mean and
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

245
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,280
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,960
Sorry.

247
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,360
You know what.

248
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,400
I stayed up all night after you left.

249
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:00,763
I thought you were home

250
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:02,363
every time I sensed
the slightest movement.

251
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:05,083
I was wrong.

252
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:06,723
I won't leave you again

253
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,163
even if you are to chase me out.

254
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,283
I will unlock the door
and come home myself.

255
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:12,883
I was wrong, okay?

256
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:19,708
Actually,

257
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,748
you were somewhat right.

258
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:24,068
I was oblivious

259
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,748
to some of the issues previously.

260
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:29,828
I heard

261
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:30,868
everything my mom said.

262
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,468
She has been saying the same thing
since I was a kid.

263
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:35,108
I refuse to listen to her

264
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,228
whenever she tries to predict my future.

265
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,148
But she talked about you.

266
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:40,228
Her words

267
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,988
hurt me.

268
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,683
Then, you showed up with the contract.

269
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:51,923
Perhaps

270
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:54,963
it was the moment you showed up.

271
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:57,883
I wasn't ready yet.

272
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:03,203
Do we have to consider all these factors

273
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,643
when we're in a relationship?

274
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,603
Because we love each other.

275
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:14,763
That's why we need
to consider the distance.

276
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:16,683
If a couple

277
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:17,523
can stay together,

278
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:18,963
and move forward together,

279
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:20,363
that would be the best.

280
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,043
But it won't last forever.

281
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:23,163
Besides,

282
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,243
we need to consider the difference

283
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:26,603
in our age and our experience.

284
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,763
It's going to be slightly tougher.

285
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:34,563
If that's the case,

286
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:35,683
I need

287
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,883
to reflect upon myself too.

288
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:38,883
That day,

289
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:39,923
I signed the contract

290
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:41,043
without discussing it
with you beforehand.

291
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,083
I was wrong.

292
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,043
To be honest, it felt like
I was trying to be a hero.

293
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:45,643
Do you get what I'm saying?

294
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:47,203
Everyone was counting on me.

295
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,003
It felt like

296
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,923
I must sign the contract.

297
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:51,763
Simply put, I was full of myself.

298
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:52,923
I got too big-headed.

299
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,203
Anyway, I made a mistake too.

300
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:56,723
I will reflect upon myself.

301
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:03,043
I think

302
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,443
my mom was right.

303
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:05,963
It's true.

304
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:07,563
Think about it.

305
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,123
Since the day we met,

306
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:13,083
we have changed

307
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:14,323
to be better for each other.

308
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,883
I'm nothing

309
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,083
like what she said.

310
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:21,083
I always wish that you can be better.

311
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,923
What's wrong with you running faster?

312
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:26,403
I'll work hard

313
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:27,523
on my end.

314
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:29,963
Let's make sure

315
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:32,283
we're always within a safe distance.

316
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,323
I don't want to hold you back.

317
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,203
Trust me.

318
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:48,363
I will always

319
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:49,643
stay within a safe distance.

320
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,083
I have faith in you.

321
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,159
Look at me.

322
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,319
I talked too much.

323
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,679
My throat is starting to hurt.

324
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,519
To be honest,

325
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,839
I think...

326
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,759
I think I don't mind you
being better than me.

327
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,119
It's true, Mr. Strong.

328
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,359
Can you go and get me

329
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,679
a cold beer from the refrigerator?

330
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,479
I need it to soothe my throat.

331
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,999
Mr. Strong? You are Mr. Strong, not me.

332
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,439
Mr. Strong, if you can

333
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,799
open the bottle

334
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,919
with your mouth,

335
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:21,879
then you'll be even stronger.

336
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:22,479
You're saying this now.

337
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,079
That day, you said,

338
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:23,999
"You know nothing!"

339
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,759
So what are you?

340
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:25,519
Ms. Smarty?

341
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:26,999
Mr. Strong.

342
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,479
Ms. Smarty.

343
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,239
Get me the beer.

344
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:29,959
Mr. Strong.

345
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,679
Ms. Smarty.

346
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,359
Mr. Strong.

347
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,079
Ms. Smarty.

348
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,039
Here's a slap for you.

349
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,190
(Top Love Tennis Club)

350
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:36,599
Yes.

351
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,639
Move this over there too.

352
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,639
Put it right beside it.

353
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,279
(Grand Opening. All the best.)
Be careful not to damage it.

354
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,559
Place the poster on the right higher.

355
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,279
It's slanted.

356
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,599
Align them.

357
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,079
Yes. That's right.

358
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,479
Align them.

359
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,719
Just place it there.

360
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,159
Don't damage the table.

361
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,279
Thanks for coming.

362
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,439
With your signatures

363
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,559
and handprints,

364
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,159
this banner is going
to be very valuable.

365
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:00,919
It will certainly become

366
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,879
our court's treasure in the future.

367
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:03,599
Yes.

368
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,679
The opening ceremony

369
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,399
is at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

370
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,599
Don't be late.

371
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,119
Yes, darling.

372
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,759
Little Ms. Liang

373
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,799
is talking to you.

374
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,079
Why didn't you answer her?

375
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,999
We haven't even started yet,

376
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,639
and you're already acting so bossy

377
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,119
as the manager's husband.

378
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,679
How could you not answer her?

379
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,119
Ms. Liang, help!

380
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:28,959
Don't touch me.

381
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:38,719
Please don't.

382
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,879
Guys.

383
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:42,969
Since it's a happy day,

384
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:43,809
I wish to make an announcement too.

385
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,409
I'm not going abroad anymore.

386
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,329
What changed your mind?

387
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:50,369
Wait.

388
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,169
It's your mom's wish

389
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:51,969
to send you abroad, right?

390
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:54,849
My dad was laid off by his company.

391
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,370
He can no longer afford my tuition fee.

392
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,170
My mom has thought it through as well.

393
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,490
The local system has gotten better.

394
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,090
It's not a must to go abroad.

395
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,610
I can keep her company if I stay here.

396
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,410
So my mom got in touch
with an institute where they allow me

397
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,130
to do the college entrance test
through tennis tests.

398
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,210
I'm taking the exam next month.

399
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,130
Once I pass the exam,

400
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,450
I can join
the online special recruitment.

401
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,290
The only problem is

402
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,490
that I don't have much time left.

403
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,530
I'm afraid

404
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,330
that I'm not preparing enough.

405
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,490
What is the test about?

406
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,770
You can send the questions to us

407
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,490
and we can do the homework for you.

408
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:25,970
Besides,

409
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,130
we have Yan here too.

410
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,650
We're your best supporters.

411
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,010
If you ever need help,

412
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,890
you can always talk to us.

413
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,090
Don't be shy.

414
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,810
Yes. Besides, this court is now open.

415
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,770
I can save you an indoor court

416
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,050
if you need one for training.

417
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,170
For Yi's exclusive use.

418
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,890
Don't worry.

419
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,050
You'll do just fine.

420
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,810
Members of our club are better

421
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,330
than everyone else out there.

422
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,530
Have faith in yourself.

423
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,890
You'll definitely pass the exam.

424
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,370
Yes.

425
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,810
If I manage to get into the school,

426
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,930
I'll have to take down my photo.

427
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,530
What matters

428
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:17,650
is that we can stay together forever.

429
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,530
Jiang Jiaojiao.

430
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:26,489
Come here.

431
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,370
Stop running!

432
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:28,850
He's here!

433
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,800
(Passionate about tennis)

434
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,690
Ms. Liang.

435
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,050
Our endorsement contract

436
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,650
will be effective this month.

437
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,666
We might need you to work with us

438
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,266
in the future

439
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,706
for business events like this.

440
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,426
For Mr. Song Sanchuan,

441
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:48,546
his main task

442
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,066
is to interact

443
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,066
with these ten kids

444
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,146
who have been learning tennis.

445
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,266
These kids

446
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,066
might look young.

447
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:54,746
But

448
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,906
they're all the best player

449
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,226
in their respective age groups.

450
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:58,906
For the final part, we will need

451
00:17:58,906 --> 00:17:59,786
Mr. Sanchuan

452
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,586
to play a game.

453
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,906
A game?

454
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,946
The last time
we went through the rundown,

455
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:06,226
I don't recall you mentioning any match.

456
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,266
It's not a full-scale match.

457
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,346
We only need him

458
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,346
to hit the ball

459
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,666
into the holes of Young Space.

460
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:13,386
For the kids,

461
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,066
all they have to do today

462
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,986
is to hit the ball into the holes.

463
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:17,826
Those who manage to do it

464
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:18,706
will win a photo with Mr. Song Sanchuan.

465
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:21,586
What about this?

466
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:22,826
I'll check with him first.

467
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:23,466
Is that all right?

468
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:24,306
No...

469
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:25,666
Give me a minute.

470
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,106
Do you think I have to
put on the make-up?

471
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:29,946
Make-up?

472
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,306
Actually,

473
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,066
because there will be
a few photoshoots later.

474
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,666
So after you put on the make-up,

475
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,146
we would like you

476
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,426
to put on our latest sportswear.

477
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:38,906
Then, we'll take a few photos
in the court.

478
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,986
Thank you, Mr. Song Sanchuan.

479
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,186
No.

480
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:44,186
Just call me Sanchuan.

481
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,426
Don't have to call me so formally.

482
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:46,386
Thank you.

483
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:46,986
All right.

484
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,666
There's another set of outfit

485
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,426
you'll need to put that on
before the event.

486
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,066
It's almost lunchtime.

487
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:54,506
Mr. Sanchuan,
can I get you anything to eat?

488
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:55,466
We can buy it for you.

489
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,226
Do you want coffee or any other drinks?

490
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:58,346
Do you have a special diet?

491
00:18:58,426 --> 00:18:59,026
It's all right.

492
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:00,106
No, just...

493
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:01,666
Is there anything you want?

494
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:02,946
Don't worry about me.

495
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:04,786
Just get him some fast food.

496
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,346
I can see
that we have a lot to do today.

497
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:06,786
All right.

498
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:08,026
Just get me something simple.

499
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,586
Bring one for Ms. Liang too.

500
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:10,986
- Sure.
- Thank you.

501
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:11,786
Thank you.

502
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,906
Will it come off

503
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:22,826
when I play the game later?

504
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:23,626
Will it get smudged?

505
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,266
Don't worry. It'll be fine as long as
you don't rub it with your hands.

506
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:13,866
Mr. Sanchuan.

507
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:14,986
Can you

508
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:15,586
please lift the racket?

509
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:18,026
Smile.

510
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:20,426
Don't forget

511
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:21,106
the wrist guard.

512
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:22,026
Can you hold the wrist guard too?

513
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,786
Smile broader.

514
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:25,706
The towel too.

515
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,666
And shoes.

516
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:28,786
Change your pose.

517
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,706
It's more tiring
than playing in a real match.

518
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:52,146
Here. Wipe it.

519
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:53,906
What is it?

520
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:55,786
Makeup remover wipes.

521
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,506
Doesn't it feel bad
when your face is all sticky?

522
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:02,826
I would never have expected

523
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:03,666
that I would be removing

524
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:06,266
foundation in a car.

525
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,626
Give it to me. Let me help you.

526
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:08,106
You...

527
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,706
What are you doing?

528
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:20,066
Let me go closer.

529
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,426
I never saw myself

530
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:36,986
removing my boyfriend's make-up too.

531
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:39,066
And my boyfriend is lying in my arms.

532
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,346
Stop mocking me.

533
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:46,466
They even put lipstick on you.

534
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:47,306
Really?

535
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:47,906
Look.

536
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:49,346
It's pink.

537
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:50,746
I thought it was lip balm.

538
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,866
I've been contaminated.

539
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,146
You look so cute with pink lips.

540
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:56,906
Come here.

541
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:57,746
Let me wipe it for you.

542
00:21:58,866 --> 00:21:59,466
They put lipstick on me.

543
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,546
I can't take this anymore.

544
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:01,746
That...

545
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,426
All right.

546
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:05,746
Let's wipe it off.

547
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,826
I'll help you
remove the makeup thoroughly

548
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:09,986
once we reach home.

549
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,226
I'll make sure
your face is squeaky clean.

550
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,106
I'll help you apply a face mask too.

551
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,986
Why don't I drop you home first?

552
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,346
I want to drop by the stadium first.

553
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:19,786
It's six in the evening now.

554
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:20,906
Do you really want to
go to the stadium now?

555
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:22,626
I haven't completed

556
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,386
today's training regime.

557
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:25,386
I want to go there
to practice for a while.

558
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:27,546
All right. I'm not tired.

559
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:28,426
I'll come with you.

560
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:31,626
Sorry, Mr. Shao.

561
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,226
Can you send us to the stadium first?

562
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:33,986
We're not going home yet.

563
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,266
Sure.

564
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,820
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

565
00:22:57,706 --> 00:22:58,666
Thank you, Mr. Li.

566
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:09,586
Now, I'm feeling much better.

567
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:18,146
I've been feeling

568
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:20,506
ineffably frustrated today.

569
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:22,186
I am nothing

570
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:24,626
but a tennis player.

571
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:29,666
In fact,

572
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:31,026
I've been feeling
very conflicted today too.

573
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:33,146
It's true.

574
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:35,866
Back then, it was my job

575
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:36,986
to organize these events.

576
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,746
I understand why they're doing this,

577
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,186
and there's nothing unusual about it.

578
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:41,866
But

579
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:43,546
when I'm seeing things
from your perspective,

580
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:44,626
I don't know

581
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,026
if I should tell you
to just get used to it.

582
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,826
To be honest,

583
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:52,986
today's schedule wasn't that boring.

584
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:56,226
And it wasn't as tiring
as tennis practice too.

585
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:59,106
But I have a feeling
that if I begin to enjoy this,

586
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,106
I'll become a useless person.

587
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,306
As for whether I'll get used to it,

588
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:07,386
I'll try my best.

589
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,066
Not bad.

590
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:12,826
Your mind is really clear.

591
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:13,906
You've thought everything through.

592
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,066
Then, I don't have to worry
about you anymore.

593
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:17,666
Also, one more thing.

594
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:19,546
If you come with me

595
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,066
to any events in the future,

596
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:21,746
can you not act

597
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:23,146
like how you used to act

598
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:24,746
when you were with your boss?

599
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,106
I saw you

600
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,266
running up and down today.

601
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:29,866
You haven't eaten anything today, right?

602
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,106
It reminded me

603
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,186
of the first time

604
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:33,026
I saw you

605
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:33,786
during the marathon.

606
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:34,866
You were exactly like that.

607
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,626
You didn't even have time
to take a sip of water.

608
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:38,386
And I...

609
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:39,866
I felt so sorry for you.

610
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:40,906
Really?

611
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:41,666
Yes.

612
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:43,066
That's what you did.

613
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:44,946
I didn't notice it.

614
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:49,666
Sure. I'll change.

615
00:24:58,586 --> 00:24:59,586
Do you want me

616
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:01,146
to practice with you?

617
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,306
Let's play a game.

618
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:05,386
You?

619
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:08,706
Really?

620
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:09,866
Of course.

621
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:14,026
It's my greatest honor

622
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:15,986
to receive guidance from Ms. Liang.

623
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:17,666
Ms. Liang.

624
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,026
Here's a racket for you.

625
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:24,906
Yan called me

626
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,346
a talented tennis player.

627
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:27,986
Really?

628
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:34,186
Watch out.

629
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:41,346
Ms. Liang, take this.

630
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:45,866
That was close. One more time.

631
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:49,466
- You need to go lower.
- Wait.

632
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,306
I'll serve.

633
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:51,026
Sure.

634
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:02,466
Don't worry.

635
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,306
Again.

636
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,146
Mr. An, are you here
to deliver wigs again?

637
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:12,866
You're on duty.

638
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:13,786
Sorry.

639
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,386
Leave me alone.

640
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,066
I'm fine.

641
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,826
My mom will be here soon.

642
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,786
Just focus on your match.

643
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:26,946
Good luck.

644
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,066
All right. I'll get going.

645
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:31,626
You hang up first.

646
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:32,946
You should hang up first.

647
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,586
All right. I'm hanging up.

648
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,426
Coming.

649
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:51,706
How are you feeling?

650
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,546
Do you want to go to the hospital?

651
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:55,626
It's not that bad.

652
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:56,266
There's no need for that.

653
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:58,626
I made you some soup.

654
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:00,386
Let me have a look.

655
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:04,706
Do you have cold medicine?

656
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:05,866
I do.

657
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:07,266
Song Sanchuan bought it.

658
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:08,226
It's in the first drawer.

659
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:15,906
I could hear that you didn't sound well

660
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,466
over the phone.

661
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:20,106
How did you catch a cold?

662
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:23,106
I was busy with the opening

663
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:25,106
and working on
Sanchuan's endorsement events.

664
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,786
Where's your boyfriend?

665
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,546
He has a game today.

666
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,706
He went to Guangzhou
early in the morning.

667
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,706
Here. Drink it.

668
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:37,866
It's so hot.

669
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:38,946
I'll drink it later.

670
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,106
I made you soup too.

671
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:43,106
Mom.

672
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:44,226
Stop working.

673
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:46,106
I have something to tell you.

674
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:55,306
We had a serious discussion previously.

675
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:56,386
About the issue you mentioned,

676
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,946
we are confident that we can fix it.

677
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:01,026
As long as this relationship

678
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,706
can make us work harder

679
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:04,866
and push us forward,

680
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:07,386
then it's going to be worth it.

681
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,986
If it really can't stand the test,

682
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,066
I'll feel sad,

683
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:16,906
but I won't regret it.

684
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:22,306
After all,

685
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:25,026
you were more courageous
than everyone else when you were little.

686
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,146
Now that you're a grown-up,

687
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:28,266
and you can make your own decision.

688
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:30,986
Nothing I say can convince you.

689
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,466
Before you fall in love,

690
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:37,306
there have to be some prerequisites.

691
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,226
Why should I stop being courageous

692
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:41,186
the moment I get into a relationship?

693
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:42,786
I think

694
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,106
your fever

695
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:45,386
is making you crazy.

696
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:47,346
Let's talk again after you cool down.

697
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:48,306
Have some soup.

698
00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:58,266
- You...
- Aunt.

699
00:28:58,706 --> 00:28:59,306
Hi, Aunt.

700
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:00,106
What brings you here?

701
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:00,826
You'an.

702
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,106
I got a call from my dad just now,

703
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:03,586
saying that he got bad news
for his body check-up.

704
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:05,106
He said that his tumor markers

705
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:06,826
is ten times higher
than the normal range.

706
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:07,706
The doctor did a check

707
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:08,746
and suspected that it was his kidney.

708
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,586
It might be cancer.

709
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:10,586
What do I do now?

710
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:12,866
When did he do the check-up?

711
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:14,186
The report was out today,

712
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:15,026
and they intended to admit him
to the hospital,

713
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,426
saying that they could only confirm it
after they do a histopathology test.

714
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:19,906
Why didn't you bring him
to the hospital?

715
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,706
Why are you here?

716
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:23,506
Aunt.

717
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:24,306
He is

718
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,586
Liang You'an's father too.

719
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:26,946
Shouldn't I inform her about it?

720
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,266
Now, he remembers who Liang You'an is.

721
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:30,746
My daughter has paid him back

722
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:31,826
everything she received from him.

723
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:32,626
Moreover,

724
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:33,506
he has you,

725
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:34,986
his daughter and his son-in-law,
by his side, right?

726
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:36,066
Isn't he getting enough help from you?

727
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:37,786
Liang You'an is having a fever.

728
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,426
She's not feeling well.

729
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,386
Does she really have to go there
to carry out her filial piety now?

730
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:41,866
Mom.

731
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,306
Mom, enough.

732
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:45,266
Liang Tao.

733
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,386
Didn't you say it just now?

734
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:49,546
The result is not final yet.

735
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:50,906
Let me know
once you get the final diagnosis.

736
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,826
You don't have to know
about the final diagnosis.

737
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,546
Did you forget how badly

738
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,466
he used to treat us?

739
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:57,986
A man like him

740
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:00,746
doesn't deserve our concern.

741
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:04,746
Stop crying.

742
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:06,786
Get out,

743
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:07,826
so that I won't say

744
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,106
more mean things to you.

745
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:13,066
You should get going.

746
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:15,746
Mom.

747
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:26,826
How ridiculous.

748
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:30,946
Karma does exist.

749
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:35,706
Liang You'an.

750
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:37,546
I'm warning you.

751
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,106
Don't do anything silly.

752
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,946
Finish your medicine first
before you lie down.

753
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:47,146
I'm sleepy, Mom.

754
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,546
Let me take a nap.

755
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,660
(Normal Ward)

756
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:36,906
We just received the patient's
histopathology report.

757
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:37,746
In general, the result

758
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,146
matches our prediction.

759
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,346
He's diagnosed
with Stage Two Kidney Cancer.

760
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:42,826
Right now,

761
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:43,866
it seems like

762
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:45,226
it's invading the renal capsule.

763
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:46,546
Of course,

764
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,546
we need a consultation

765
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,866
to finalize the treatment plan.

766
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:53,266
We need to determine
if we can do a partial nephrectomy,

767
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:54,626
instead of a complete nephrectomy.

768
00:31:58,826 --> 00:31:59,626
This is

769
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,826
about all we know now.

770
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:02,026
I'm afraid

771
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:02,986
that he won't be able
to get through this.

772
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,946
It sounds all right.

773
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:09,266
He'll be fine as long as the surgery
works out well,

774
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,066
At least,

775
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:11,106
everything can be done at once.

776
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:12,666
Most importantly,

777
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,386
he doesn't need to suffer
from the chemotherapy.

778
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:18,146
Really, Uncle?

779
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:19,266
Boss.

780
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,706
Give me a minute.

781
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,106
Don't worry.

782
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:25,826
Trust me.

783
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,386
Coming.

784
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,626
Since you're already here,

785
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,306
do you want to pay him a visit?

786
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:36,226
His dad was asking us
if you knew about his condition.

787
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,786
He wanted to know if he could see you
before his operation.

788
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,106
He must be feeling very scared now.

789
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,346
He's worried that
he might not survive the operation.

790
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:50,266
When is the operation?

791
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:53,226
He still needs to go through
some preoperative examinations.

792
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,746
Then, they will put him
on the waiting list.

793
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,546
The earliest possible date
is on next week.

794
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,066
I got it.

795
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,026
I'll see how things go.

796
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,506
I will have to

797
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,706
take some days off.

798
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:10,266
About the club...

799
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,546
Just stay at the hospital.

800
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:13,346
I can take care of the club.

801
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:35,906
I was caught off guard.

802
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:41,186
It all happened so suddenly.

803
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,906
Our relationship

804
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:45,186
is quite complicated.

805
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:48,506
I have completely no idea

806
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:49,786
how to react to the current situation.

807
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,986
We are never like
other father and daughter.

808
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:55,786
If you want me to go to him

809
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,426
and act like a good daughter now,

810
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:00,466
I won't be able to do it.

811
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:06,466
You shouldn't go if you don't want to.

812
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:09,746
No one has the rights

813
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:10,585
to lecture you on this.

814
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:22,866
Back then,

815
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:24,226
we were pretty close.

816
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,786
When I was younger,

817
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,386
he was

818
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:31,866
an unreliable man.

819
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,306
He and I were always causing trouble.

820
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:36,826
There's something

821
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,986
I've been keeping from my mom
until today.

822
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,145
Actually,

823
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,386
he often came to my school secretly

824
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,105
to look for me.

825
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,826
After they went separate ways,

826
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:51,386
I was still keeping

827
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:52,946
a little faith.

828
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,626
Then, one day,

829
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,106
he disappeared.

830
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,426
Then, I found out

831
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:06,186
that I had a younger sister.

832
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:10,466
I guess

833
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:11,626
that was when

834
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:12,786
I started to hate him.

835
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:22,666
Why did he get diagnosed

836
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:24,746
with such a serious illness
all of a sudden?

837
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:27,866
It seems like when we're nearing death,

838
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,586
we don't care

839
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:30,906
about everything else.

840
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,786
We shouldn't care about anything else.

841
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:34,746
You should let go
of all your resentment.

842
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:36,906
You should forgive them.

843
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:41,466
But

844
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,426
I'm really not ready yet.

845
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:50,306
It's fine if you're not ready yet.

846
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:52,906
Liang You'an.

847
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:57,386
You should do

848
00:35:57,386 --> 00:35:58,386
only what you want to do.

849
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,506
Can we really do

850
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:01,706
only what we want to do?

851
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,426
You can.

852
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:08,106
You can.

853
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:24,826
Uncle, do you want me

854
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:25,746
to help you flatten the bed?

855
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:26,746
You should lie down and have a rest.

856
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,346
Take a seat.

857
00:36:29,746 --> 00:36:31,026
There's a chance I'll be bed-ridden

858
00:36:31,226 --> 00:36:32,066
in the future.

859
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:34,426
You made it sound worse than it actually was.

860
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:36,746
Tell you what.

861
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,146
I come to this hospital

862
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:39,586
several times

863
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:40,306
every day.

864
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:41,706
Trust me.

865
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:42,906
I'm smarter than doctors.

866
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:45,706
I can tell

867
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:46,746
if the patient will be all right

868
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,066
just by taking a glance at them.

869
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:49,666
Really?

870
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,346
Look at me. Do you think

871
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:54,026
I'll survive the operation?

872
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:55,746
Of course, you will.

873
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:57,226
Think about it.

874
00:36:58,106 --> 00:36:58,866
What is the organ

875
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:01,106
a human

876
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:02,826
never lacks?

877
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:04,826
Kidneys.

878
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:06,746
You have a pair of them.

879
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:08,386
Even if it's worse than what we think

880
00:37:08,386 --> 00:37:09,466
and one of your kidneys is damaged,

881
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:10,666
but you still have a good one, right?

882
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:13,826
That's very funny.

883
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,306
Uncle, have some water.

884
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:17,706
Be careful. It's hot.

885
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:19,506
Tell you what.

886
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:21,346
We live across the street.

887
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:22,546
We only have to cross the road
to come here.

888
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:23,346
Chuan told me

889
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:24,346
that he'll visit you regularly
and spend time with you

890
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:25,546
before your operation.

891
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:26,946
Don't worry.

892
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,146
Thank you.

893
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:33,626
Do you know when would An drop by

894
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,906
and pay me a visit?

895
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:36,986
Uncle,

896
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,426
it's very tiring
to take care of a patient.

897
00:37:39,746 --> 00:37:40,546
I'm apt for the job.

898
00:37:40,906 --> 00:37:42,146
Besides, I live nearby.

899
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,866
You can give me a call
whenever you need.

900
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:44,546
I'll be here right away.

901
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:47,546
She doesn't want to see me,

902
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:48,546
right?

903
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:01,346
I guess

904
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:02,466
it's the karma

905
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,106
that made me sick.

906
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,426
I deserve it.

907
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,586
That's nonsense.

908
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:11,626
All you have now are a few bad cells

909
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,546
in your body.

910
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:14,506
You'll be fine after they do a surgery
to remove them.

911
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:15,226
Isn't it?

912
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,026
Don't think too much.

913
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:20,946
Please drop by whenever you're free.

914
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:22,506
I like to hear you talk.

915
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:25,266
Sure.

916
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,866
An, what brings you here?

917
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:39,986
You should've given him a call.

918
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:42,106
Don't worry. I haven't been here long.

919
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,266
I'll open the door.

920
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:44,986
How long have you been here?

921
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:46,026
Don't worry about me.

922
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:47,906
Yan told me

923
00:38:47,946 --> 00:38:49,066
that you didn't attend
the training today.

924
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:52,186
Did you cross the street?

925
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:53,386
Yes.

926
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:55,746
I stayed with Uncle
while he got his examination done.

927
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:58,146
Come on in.

928
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,746
Let's go.

929
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:04,626
You can talk here.

930
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:05,426
I'm going upstairs.

931
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:09,426
Your dad looks well.

932
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:10,666
Don't worry.

933
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:12,146
Mr. An,

934
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,066
thank you.

935
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,586
Don't mention it.

936
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:16,986
I'll leave you alone.

937
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,226
Not bad.

938
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:24,906
You didn't even inform me
about skipping the training.

939
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:28,506
I don't want to get lectured.

940
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:31,666
You told me

941
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:34,386
that I could do whatever I wanted.

942
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:38,706
Were you planning

943
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:41,626
to help me do everything else

944
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:42,986
that I don't want to do?

945
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:49,946
I thought about my mom.

946
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:55,146
I experienced this

947
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:57,226
first-hand.

948
00:39:58,226 --> 00:39:59,706
If you miss

949
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:01,786
your loved one's final moments,

950
00:40:01,786 --> 00:40:03,066
for whatever reason,

951
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:07,426
you'll surely regret it.

952
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:11,226
And the regret

953
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:12,866
will stay with you for a very long time.

954
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:14,666
I know

955
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:17,266
that you're not ready yet.

956
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:18,906
You don't want to face the truth.

957
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:21,666
I have your back.

958
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:27,906
I'm doing everything I can,

959
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:30,386
so that if you are reminded of this
in the future,

960
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,706
you'll feel slightly better about it.

961
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,066
Give me a hug.

962
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:51,546
Thank you.

963
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,540
(In operation)

964
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,580
(In operation)

965
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:36,546
Mom.

966
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:44,946
Is he gone?

967
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,826
The kidney is gone,
but he's still alive.

968
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,586
Then, I can't party yet.

969
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,746
The doctor said

970
00:41:56,866 --> 00:41:58,586
that he has to do regular check-ups
in the future.

971
00:41:58,786 --> 00:41:59,586
For his condition,

972
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:00,826
once the surgery went well,

973
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:02,666
there won't be too many complications.

974
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:06,986
As long as it doesn't trouble you.

975
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:17,146
You didn't go to the hospital
to take care of him, right?

976
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:19,746
Song Sanchuan went there in my stead.

977
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:20,866
Didn't he know

978
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:22,386
that it was difficult
to please Liang Shu?

979
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:24,986
As I told you,

980
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,946
Song Sanchuan went there in my stead.

981
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:32,186
I had no idea

982
00:42:32,346 --> 00:42:33,626
how he handled

983
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:34,306
this situation

984
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:35,186
so well.

985
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:36,946
Because of him,

986
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:38,106
I don't feel burdened at all.

987
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,106
It sounds like

988
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:49,506
he's a reliable man.

989
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:52,906
After what has happened,

990
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,226
I feel even more confident
about my decision now.

991
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:57,826
Sure.

992
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:00,186
As long as you won't regret it.

993
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:02,946
You're lucky that you met him.

994
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:06,586
I did have a prejudice
