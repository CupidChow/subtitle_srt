00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:00,298
An,

7
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:00,938
what do you think?

8
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,498
You sure look different.

9
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:06,898
I do look a lot younger.

10
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:07,698
Yes, at least 10 years younger.

11
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,578
Yu, listen.

12
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:12,938
For this particular new hairstyle,

13
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:15,017
I especially created

14
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:16,298
this wavy style for you.

15
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:17,818
It's specially made for you,

16
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:18,378
do you know that?

17
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:19,658
Not bad.

18
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:20,018
I'm serious when I say this.

19
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,698
It's much better
than the last one you did.

20
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,498
The last one was too heavy,

21
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:24,098
you know?

22
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,418
They all said I looked like a rock star.

23
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:27,058
That's a different hairstyle.

24
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,418
But this one is perfect for you.

25
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:30,418
All right, I get it.

26
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,818
An, stop beating around the bushes.

27
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,098
I know you all too well.

32
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,898
Mr. An. Mr. An!

33
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:01,658
An?

34
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:03,498
You still remember my name.

35
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,058
Of course, I remember.

36
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,258
We both have

37
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,298
the same character "An" in our names.

38
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,018
So we can be considered
distant relatives.

39
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:12,778
So what are you doing here?

40
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:13,978
Do you work here?

41
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,578
I'm working at Young Space.

42
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:16,618
We recently

43
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:17,978
have a collaboration

44
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:18,698
with the badminton gym.

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,778
That's why I'm here today.

46
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:21,458
I didn't see

47
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,738
Song Sanchuan here today.

48
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:23,898
So why are you here?

49
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,698
I came while he wasn't here.

50
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:29,258
That brat keeps talking

51
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,698
about quitting the team.

52
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,458
He's done it

53
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,178
a few times before.

54
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:35,858
But this time it seems real.

55
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,138
He even submitted
his application to quit.

56
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:38,618
Can you believe it?

57
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:39,978
I took it back

58
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:41,658
and tore it in front of his coach.

59
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:45,418
He can always submit it again
even if you tore it.

60
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:46,698
If you try to convince him to stay

61
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,018
will be like talking to a wall.

62
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:49,538
Mr. An,

63
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,378
you know him better.

64
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:52,778
Do you think

65
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:53,458
he's really

66
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,778
giving up this time?

67
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,138
About the issue

68
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,818
of him hanging on the tie score...

69
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:07,978
Yes, speaking.

70
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,018
Who's this?

71
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,818
Security Department?

72
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,298
Come in.

73
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:25,178
I'm his guardian.

74
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:26,738
So what happened?

75
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:27,937
He

76
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:29,618
was sneaking around

77
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:31,218
trying to steal money from a drawer

78
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,618
while the patient was away
for a checkup.

79
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:34,298
See this 3,000 yuan?

80
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,338
He was caught red-handed.

81
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:36,138
I told you

82
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:37,218
I didn't steal that money.

83
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,138
Hey, don't make a fuss here.

84
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,258
You have no say

85
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:40,178
whether you stole the money or not.

86
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,698
After the patient finishes
with the checkup,

87
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,338
we'll verify if you stole this money.

88
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:44,858
Sit down.

89
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:47,818
Just sit.

90
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,498
He stole money?

91
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:56,378
What are you doing?

92
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:58,298
I just want to take a look.

93
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,100
(Service Fee)

94
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,298
Buddy, listen.

95
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:04,658
I'm his dad.

96
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,218
I know him very well.

97
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,418
He would never steal money.

98
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:10,738
Do you see what's written
on the envelope?

99
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,338
"Service fee."

100
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,698
See?

101
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,178
He earned this money himself

102
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:16,778
and he's giving it to the patient.

103
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,458
Who are you trying to fool here?

104
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,138
Why would I do that?

105
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:23,898
Fine, I'll tell you what.

106
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,818
He also sent money
to the gynecology department

107
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:27,778
last month.

108
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:28,818
The female patient

109
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:29,978
even left her phone number with me.

110
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:30,618
If you don't believe me,

111
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:31,538
I'll give her a call

112
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:33,178
and let her talk to you herself.

113
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:34,218
Call her.

114
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,378
Can you tell me

115
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,298
what did you do with the money

116
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,818
you won from the marathon?

117
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,938
I finished them in an instant

118
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,658
on food, drinks, and entertainment.

119
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,058
I'll go and open up the shop first.

120
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,858
"Spendthrift Sprite."

121
00:05:58,178 --> 00:05:59,298
Mr. An told me

122
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:00,418
that's the nickname

123
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:01,298
the patients gave you.

124
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,698
That sounds quite cute.

125
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,338
I'm sure you see me as a joke.

126
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,458
But I see you

127
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,898
in a different light today.

128
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:16,898
You know how to get back, right?

129
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:18,818
I won't send you, then.

130
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:30,698
An.

131
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:35,858
Thanks, Mr. An.

132
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:37,658
Are you

133
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:39,858
really concerned
about Chuan's situation?

134
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,018
Are you just curious

135
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:43,778
or do you have other motives?

136
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:48,338
Actually, I went to their badminton team

137
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,458
to find a potential spokesperson

138
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,738
for Young Space.

139
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:54,178
I know

140
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,018
he's not the best player

141
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,858
on the team.

142
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,618
But I always have the feeling

143
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,138
that he has the potential.

144
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,098
What do you think?

145
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,658
Chuan's mom

146
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:19,658
is Tong Lu.

147
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,858
She

148
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:23,018
was a badminton athlete too.

149
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:24,658
She had great skills.

150
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,258
But she gave birth to Chuan

151
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,698
after she got pregnant

152
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:30,778
by mistake

153
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,458
while dating a male teammate.

154
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:35,658
After giving birth to Chuan,

155
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:37,138
she retired.

156
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,098
She may have retired.

157
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:40,298
But her passion did not.

158
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:43,818
So

159
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:47,218
she placed all her hopes and dreams

160
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:50,218
of winning championships on Chuan.

161
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:52,898
Yesterday,

162
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:53,498
that last point in the game

163
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:54,778
shouldn't have been a mistake.

164
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:56,938
The problem lies in your footwork.

165
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:58,818
I want you to practice

166
00:07:58,818 --> 00:07:59,738
your footwork approaching the net

167
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,138
one thousand times today.

168
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:04,658
At that time,

169
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,778
I was the stringer for the team.

170
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,298
I always liked Tong Lu.

171
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,698
I also know

172
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,978
that Tong Lu was reluctant

173
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:21,298
to marry me.

174
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,018
When did she leave?

175
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,738
When Chuan was 15,

176
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,178
he had

177
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:37,618
a very important match.

178
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,537
It was tied at 18-18

179
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:41,418
and a deciding game.

180
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,258
Chuan turned around

181
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,058
and looked for his mom in the stands.

182
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,378
But she was already gone.

183
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:50,218
I guess it was at that moment

184
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,218
that the trauma started.

185
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,018
Did she leave for good?

186
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:57,738
She never came back?

187
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:21,738
Did you see Tong Lu?

188
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:23,418
No, I didn't.

189
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,738
(I'm sorry.)

190
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:29,058
(I chickened out.)

191
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,978
(I don't want
the closest two people to me)

192
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,218
(to see me in my worst state.)

193
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,978
(Besides, you knew)

194
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:38,578
(I was never)

195
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,818
(a responsible woman.)

196
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,178
Is Tong Lu not here?

197
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:41,978
No.

198
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,058
(So I gave birth to the child)

199
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,338
(and got married as I wanted.)

200
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:49,698
(Now,)

201
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,018
(I want to use the time I have left)

202
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,258
(to visit the places I wanted to see.)

203
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:56,698
(An Cong,)

204
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:58,898
(if there's one thing)

205
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,218
(I regret the most,)

206
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:03,738
(it's that I delayed you
from playing badminton)

207
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,258
(by making you string my racket)

208
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:07,898
(when you first joined the team.)

209
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,778
(I'll leave the house)

210
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,658
(to you and Chuan.)

211
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:17,938
(I feel sorry the most about this.)

212
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:22,458
(Please raise him
for the next three years)

213
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,938
(until he reaches his adulthood at 18.)

214
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:30,618
(Don't tell him about my disease.)

215
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,258
(It'll affect his training
and tournament.)

216
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:36,818
(I mean if I recover,)

217
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,138
(I'll come back to see you both.)

218
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,778
(If I don't,)

219
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,378
(let him take care of you)

220
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:49,098
(as a way for me to make it up to you.)

221
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:01,698
(During the first two years
after she left,)

222
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,258
I told Chuan

223
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,538
that his mom went abroad

224
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,218
to be a coach.

225
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:10,458
Chuan was young

226
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,618
and naive. He believed it.

227
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:14,138
He thought

228
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:15,898
if he trained hard
and achieved good results,

229
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:17,778
he would be able
to see his mother again.

230
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,298
He worked so hard

231
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:20,938
that he gave all he has

232
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:22,178
to train so well.

233
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:24,538
He was doing so well

234
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:28,818
that we wondered

235
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,978
if he had overcome his grief.

236
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,698
But the truth is, he never let it go.

237
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:44,098
So An...

238
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,378
You see.

239
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,738
If you have the chance,

240
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:52,658
can you

241
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:53,978
talk to him

242
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:55,978
and try to persuade him?

243
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:57,578
Please do this.

244
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,018
(Song Sanchuan!)

245
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,418
(Ancong Wig Shop)
Come down!

246
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:05,738
I'm buying wonton to compensate you.

247
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,098
If you don't come down,

248
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:11,018
I'll have them packed.

249
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,458
They won't taste good
if they are clumped together.

250
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,018
Song San...

251
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,840
(Wang's Wonton)

252
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:38,018
Thank you, mister.

253
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:38,898
Please enjoy your meal.

254
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:46,498
We came to your team

255
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,578
to scout players

256
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:49,938
because of Alex's recommendation.

257
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,578
She's

258
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:52,618
a very famous scout player.

259
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:57,978
She said

260
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,538
your team had a hidden gem.

261
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,058
She was talking about you, right?

262
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,458
If you had told me this
a couple of years ago,

263
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,178
I might have believed you.

264
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:08,978
But now, I can't beat anyone.

265
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,578
I learned

266
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,378
about your mom

267
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,898
from Mr. An.

268
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:30,738
He sure has a big mouth.

269
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:37,018
But what I don't understand

270
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,058
is why everything was fine
with you before.

271
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:41,498
It was only the last two years
when things went downhill.

272
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:54,418
Badminton

273
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,898
was never my dream.

274
00:13:57,298 --> 00:13:58,218
It was Tong Lu's dream.

275
00:13:58,778 --> 00:13:59,538
I remember

276
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,378
the biggest fight we had.

277
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:01,178
I said

278
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:03,098
even if I won

279
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,418
an Olympic gold medal one day,

280
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:06,938
it would be

281
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,018
my name on it,

282
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:09,258
not her name.

283
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:11,858
I said she still had nothing.

284
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,018
She was livid that day.

285
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:21,178
It was also the only time
she ever hit me.

286
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:24,498
Over the years,

287
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,178
I would recall that fight.

288
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:28,538
I feel

289
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:33,578
that argument

290
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:38,538
was the trigger of her illness.

291
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,138
You knew when your mother was sick?

292
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:48,618
It was about two years ago.

293
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,698
I found a letter

294
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:51,698
under An Cong's bed.

295
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:52,818
That's how I figured out

296
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:53,898
why Tong Lu left back then.

297
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:56,858
An Cong never plans to tell me.

298
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:58,858
He really

299
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,538
thought

300
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,138
everyone was as foolish as he was.

301
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,578
I mean who would move across the street

302
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:12,138
from a cancer hospital for no reason?

303
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,018
Then Jin Yi came along.

304
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:24,898
To be honest,

305
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:26,738
I'm certain you won't believe it
even if I told you.

306
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:28,738
Before he joined the team,

307
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:29,538
no one had ever beaten me

308
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:30,538
in 18-18.

309
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:32,618
No one was my match.

310
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,178
But after a few matches with him,

311
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,738
he figured out my weakness.

312
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:38,658
Then I'm sure

313
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,658
you've seen his tactics.

314
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,698
How could he win

315
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:48,618
with such an approach?

316
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,258
It's not his fault.

317
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:52,018
So now,

318
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:53,258
not only I'm losing to him,

319
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:54,578
but I'm also losing to others.

320
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:56,538
I lost more than winning.

321
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:58,538
So

322
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,218
I shouldn't be the hidden gem you said.

323
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,658
I'm just a losing bet.

324
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,618
I lost more than winning.

325
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:11,698
So I'm not the hidden gem.

326
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,300
(Wang's Wonton)

327
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:31,938
Where's Luo Le?

328
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,058
I asked my mom

329
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,458
to take her to stay at the hotel.

330
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,418
What's going on?

331
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,298
I couldn't get  a clear idea
about what you said over the phone.

332
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,898
Why is Chen Yiyang back here?

333
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,978
He suddenly wants to take Luo Le back

334
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:44,818
and custody.

335
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:45,858
What makes him think he could do that?

336
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,498
He hasn't shown up once
in the past three years.

337
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,858
He said they developed

338
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:51,738
some kind of online application

339
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:52,898
these few years

340
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,218
and raised some money from investors.

341
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,098
He said

342
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,738
I don't have a stable job right now.

343
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,058
The child is going
to elementary school soon

344
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:00,978
and she needs a better

345
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,858
and more stable life.

346
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:08,218
What is he doing now?

347
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,938
He said I should find a lawyer

348
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,738
and meet at the law firm

349
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:14,938
in three days.

350
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:16,577
It would be best
if we can reach an agreement.

351
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,418
If not, we'll go
through the legal process.

352
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:20,258
Okay.

353
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:23,738
Stay at my house for these few days.

354
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:25,738
Three days should be enough.

355
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,138
Okay, that's great.

356
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,658
Forward her WeChat to me.

357
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:30,297
I'll add her.

358
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,297
Thank you.

359
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:32,458
Bye.

360
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:36,338
Luo Nian,

361
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:37,938
Nate introduced a well-known lawyer

362
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,178
in the industry

363
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:40,298
who seems to have

364
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:41,098
a good success rate in divorce

365
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,218
and custody cases.

366
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:42,858
Really?

367
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,458
That's great.

368
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:49,658
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

369
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:50,658
Sure.

370
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:56,778
The Nate that you mentioned just now.

371
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,938
Is he the one from the company
who's been giving signals to you?

372
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,858
He asked me out for dinner the other day

373
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:03,978
and suddenly mentioned

374
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:05,298
that he wants me
to go to Singapore with him.

375
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,458
You're not really interested, are you?

376
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,258
How do you consider to be interested?

377
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:13,738
If you're interested,

378
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:14,538
that means this person

379
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,418
is at the top of your mind.

380
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,778
When his WeChat pops up on your screen,

381
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:19,458
you would grin from ear to ear

382
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:21,338
before you even read it.

383
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:22,898
When he calls,

384
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,378
your voice becomes soft and sweet.

385
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,978
When you go on a date with him,

386
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:26,978
you would spend three hours

387
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,138
getting ready

388
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,018
and dress up to the nines.

389
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:32,138
It's not too much to say

390
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:33,618
that one day apart feels like
a very long time.

391
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:35,418
I mean shouldn't these change

392
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,538
after one person is over 30?

393
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:38,658
Here's your coffee.

394
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,458
Thank you.

395
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:40,498
Enjoy your coffee.

396
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:44,618
We're talking about love here.

397
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:46,298
It's the same no matter how old we are.

398
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,458
It's over then.

399
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,938
I never thought of

400
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:49,978
putting him at top of my mind.

401
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:51,858
Impulsive love

402
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:52,938
may be

403
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:53,938
wonderful.

404
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:56,178
But it's difficult

405
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,018
to come across love like that
at this age.

406
00:18:58,298 --> 00:18:59,538
Even though

407
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,698
I haven't known Nate

408
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:01,618
for long,

409
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:02,138
but

410
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,738
I feel comfortable
and at ease around him.

411
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,018
The main thing

412
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:07,618
is he suddenly asked me

413
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:08,938
to go to Singapore with him.

414
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,458
It felt like

415
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,538
things are going pretty fast.

416
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,698
I'll put aside the rest.

417
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,898
Leaving home for love
isn't that appealing.

418
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:21,578
I'm living proof.

419
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Jeez.

420
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,418
Enough sighing already.

421
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:27,818
You distracted me

422
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,618
and I don't remember what I was reading.

423
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,578
(Chen Yiyang,
the biological father of Luo Le,)

424
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:34,898
(had an ambiguous relationship
with a colleague)

425
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,418
(during the lactation period
of Luo Le's biological mother, Luo Nian.)

426
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,138
(This caused their relationship
to break down)

427
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,058
(and separate.)

428
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,978
(In December of the same year,)

429
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:41,978
(they finalized their divorce.)

430
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:43,458
(Since then,)

431
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,178
(Luo Le has been raised solely
by her mother, Luo Nian.)

432
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:47,298
(Child's Total Expenses 96,788 yuan)
Part one

433
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:47,898
(Yinghong Law Firm)
covers all the expenses

434
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,698
from Luo Le's birth

435
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,178
to the separation of the parents.

436
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,058
We have compiled

437
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,138
relevant bills

438
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:54,338
and photos as proof.

439
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,018
(Male party's total transfer 12,000 yuan)
The focus of part two

440
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,178
is on the several transfer records

441
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:58,938
you gave her,

442
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,858
totaling 12,000 yuan.

443
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:01,738
This can be considered

444
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:03,098
as the child support you provided.

445
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,698
(Child support expenses borne by female party)
The most important thing is

446
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:05,978
that Luo Nian,

447
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,018
as a freelancer,

448
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:08,818
sacrificed her job and lost of income

449
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,538
to raise the child alone.

450
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:11,818
Unfortunately, we don't have any material

451
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:13,738
to prove her loss of income.

452
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:15,778
But we estimate it

453
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,178
to be at least 100,000 yuan.

454
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:18,898
Additionally, Luo Nian's parents came

455
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:19,818
from out of town

456
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,378
to support her
in taking care of the child.

457
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,418
We have no relevant materials

458
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:24,938
for their expenses for food, lodging,

459
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:25,698
and transportation.

460
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,618
So we estimated it to be 30,000 yuan.

461
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:29,018
After subtracting

462
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:29,978
the 12,000 yuan you provided,

463
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,018
the remaining total

464
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:33,058
is 555,300 yuan.

465
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:34,738
The presentation includes

466
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,698
detailed expense records,
screenshots, and bills,

467
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,058
which you can take a look at.

468
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,240
(Receipts)

469
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,098
Of course,

470
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:41,658
I can also give you

471
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,818
some time

472
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:44,538
to do the calculations yourself.

473
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,738
It won't be necessary.

474
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:48,418
I get the point.

475
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:50,858
It's far from enough.

476
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:02,698
For you who have been absent

477
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:03,858
for nearly three years,

478
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:06,618
Luo Le

479
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,458
has simply grown taller,

480
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,498
become prettier,

481
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:10,778
and can talk and run.

482
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:12,738
The reason I prepared this presentation

483
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,498
is to tell you

484
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:15,298
that all the time,

485
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:18,058
hard work, and companionship

486
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:20,298
that Luo Nian has put in

487
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,018
to raise the child

488
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,698
cannot be measured by money.

489
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:23,818
And

490
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:24,858
you cannot use

491
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:25,858
the same amount of money

492
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:26,618
to buy

493
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,778
your presence as a father.

494
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:39,618
Luo Le.

495
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:42,738
Mommy!

496
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:44,138
(Ms. Luo, the mother of Luo Le,)

497
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,018
(first proposes)

498
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,338
(that the father should bear half)

499
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,978
(of the expenses incurred
in raising the child so far,)

500
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,738
(and Chen Yiyang should pay)

501
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,298
(a monthly child support fee
of 20,000 yuan.)

502
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:52,978
(This is the supplementary agreement)

503
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,618
(we have drafted.)

504
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:54,458
(You can take it back)

505
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,458
(and discuss it.)

506
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,100
(Shenzhen Xinyi Sports Training Base)

507
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:57,818
Not bad.

508
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,058
It's been a few days since we last met.

509
00:22:59,138 --> 00:22:59,578
Your eye bags are bigger

510
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,698
than your eyes.

511
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:03,138
Why can't it be

512
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,738
that I have the attractive eye bags?

513
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:08,978
It feels like your eye bags

514
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,018
are about to burst out

515
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,418
pretty soon.

516
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,458
Is it that exaggerated?

517
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:17,458
I only stayed up for two nights

518
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:18,578
and I already look this bad?

519
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:20,218
It wasn't like this last year.

520
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:22,698
Anyway, I have to go now.

521
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:23,818
Can you

522
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:25,698
do me a favor?

523
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,618
If someone asks,

524
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:28,338
just say

525
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:29,578
I was at work all day.

526
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,658
Thanks.

527
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:32,658
Are you skipping work like that?

528
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:34,498
I haven't slept much
these couple of days.

529
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,338
I was at the law firm this morning.

530
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:37,498
Why were you there?

531
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:38,818
Did you cause some kind of trouble?

532
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:39,898
No, I didn't.

533
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,178
Trouble came to me.

534
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:42,538
I'm leaving now.

535
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:44,778
Wait.

536
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:46,418
I'll drive you.

537
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:47,538
I can drive.

538
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,698
Also,

539
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,818
driving while you're tired

540
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:52,778
can be dangerous to society.

541
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:03,218
You're really something.

542
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:04,858
Don't you feel dizzy reading
in a moving car?

543
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:09,898
I used to feel dizzy

544
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:11,218
and I would throw up
at the end of the ride.

545
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:12,018
But I had no choice.

546
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,658
My boss has a busy schedule.

547
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:15,938
I even have to work in a moving car.

548
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:17,378
I'm used to it already.

549
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:19,938
Is working more tiring
than playing badminton?

550
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:22,218
Listen.

551
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:23,738
It's hard to win

552
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:24,978
in this world.

553
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:27,538
But it's easy to get by.

554
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:32,298
Don't be sarcastic.

555
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,818
You're not even practicing at this time.

556
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:36,338
Instead, you're out here

557
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:37,658
being my driver, huh?

558
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:39,418
Tell me about it.

559
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,098
You see.

560
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,458
I just applied

561
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,738
for a professional driver's license.

562
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:45,818
I'll use you to practice driving.

563
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,258
Don't tell anyone on the team.

564
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:48,098
It's not allowed.

565
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,458
Why are you doing it then?

566
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:52,178
Are you really going to quit badminton?

567
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:55,098
Athletes will have
to retire sooner or later.

568
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:57,818
Liang You'an,

569
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:00,418
have you ever had a feeling

570
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:01,818
where you actually want

571
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:02,898
to quit something,

572
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,058
but you just can't let go?

573
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,618
It's not that you're reluctant,

574
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:11,858
but you're afraid.

575
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,218
I used to focus on my racket,

576
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:16,938
footwork, physical training,
and recovery.

577
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,858
Even when I slept at night,

578
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:21,338
I dreamed about analyzing
my movements for improvement.

579
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:24,258
But if I were to say

580
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,538
that I'm going to stop practicing
the next day,

581
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:29,098
I'm afraid that when I wake up
the next day,

582
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:30,778
I won't know what to do.

583
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:35,858
Actually, I can feel

584
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:37,858
you think I'm hopeless

585
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:39,178
after you listened to my story, right?

586
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:42,258
But hear me out.

587
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,978
Sometimes giving up

588
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:47,698
is more courageous

589
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:48,698
than holding on.

590
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:07,698
(Is giving up really more courageous)

591
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,298
(than persevering?)

592
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:21,618
(Hello.)

593
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:23,938
I'm here for the physical examination
of Young Space Group.

594
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:25,058
I've already made an appointment.

595
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:25,818
Okay, please wait for a moment.

596
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:26,738
We're together.

597
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:30,658
I specifically asked Mingyu
for your schedule

598
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:32,338
and asked him to schedule
our appointment together.

599
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:33,938
It's so hard to meet you.

600
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,320
(THE WINEBAR)

601
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:39,818
This Italian restaurant is pretty good.

602
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:41,538
It's perfect for us who are famished

603
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:42,698
after the physical examination.

604
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:44,538
It's really a coincidence

605
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:45,898
that this restaurant

606
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:46,738
has been on my to-go list

607
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,618
for a long time.

608
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:48,938
I was too busy to come before.

609
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:50,698
I didn't expect it to be so close
to the hospital.

610
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,658
It looks like I did my homework well.

611
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:54,898
I'm glad you like it.

612
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:57,418
Did the things

613
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,538
I said last time

614
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,658
make you want to avoid me?

615
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:02,298
Not at all.

616
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:03,658
I told you

617
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:05,218
I've been really busy lately.

618
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,178
We did talk on the phone.

619
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:09,218
We had no problem conversing, right?

620
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:10,298
But meeting

621
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:11,298
in person is different.

622
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:13,418
Actually, I just wanted

623
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,978
to explain things to you
in person today.

624
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:16,658
I don't want to scare you off

625
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:17,738
for being too eager.

626
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:20,658
Sure enough,

627
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:21,938
we can't rush these things.

628
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:22,858
Of course,

629
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:23,418
we still have

630
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:24,538
to start from dating.

631
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,098
When the time is right,

632
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:27,378
we can consider the next step.

633
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:31,338
I just think

634
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:32,858
it's better not to be
in a long-distance relationship.

635
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,818
You can come to Singapore.

636
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:36,698
Why can't you

637
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:37,938
be the one in Shenzhen?

638
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:40,418
I'm currently

639
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:42,218
a sales director in Singapore,

640
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,858
while you are only an assistant

641
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,498
to the CEO in Shenzhen.

642
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:47,378
And when you get there,

643
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,658
if you find a suitable job there,

644
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:51,258
you can give it shot.

645
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:52,618
If you can't find anything suitable

646
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:53,578
and would like to stay home,

647
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:54,698
I'm okay with that too.

648
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,138
Just like in recent years,

649
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:59,178
you wanted to be a career-oriented woman

650
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,258
and progress in your career.

651
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:01,298
Maybe after several years

652
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:02,178
and having children,

653
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:04,938
you might want
to be a full-time housewife.

654
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:06,178
Of course,

655
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:07,258
what I mean

656
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:08,658
is with my ability,

657
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:09,778
I can give my partner

658
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:12,338
more freedom to choose.

659
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,978
Hello, Liang You'an speaking.

660
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,480
(Hello, Ms. Liang.)

661
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,240
(You just had a medical examination)

662
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,120
(at our center.)

663
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,200
(There are some issues
with the ultrasound.)

664
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,080
(The doctor hopes you can come back)

665
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
(to discuss it in detail.)

666
00:28:44,578 --> 00:28:46,858
Okay, I'll be right over.

667
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,820
(Ultrasound Room 7)

668
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,020
(OB/GYN Ultrasound Report
Name: Liang You'an)

669
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:55,298
Is your menstrual cycle

670
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,018
usually irregular?

671
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:01,458
It's usually delayed by about a week.

672
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:03,058
If you look at this,

673
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:05,338
this is an endometriotic cyst.

674
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:06,418
We also call it

675
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:07,418
the chocolate cyst.

676
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,698
It can affect your ovulation.

677
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,098
Every menstrual cycle

678
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:11,218
will cause it

679
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:12,738
to grow.

680
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,338
It can also affect your ability

681
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:15,778
to conceive in the future.

682
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,698
Are you married?

683
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,738
Normally at your age,
we would advise you to get pregnant

684
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:21,538
as soon as possible

685
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:23,538
if you're married.

686
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:24,458
If you're pregnant

687
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,658
and your menstrual cycle
will stop for some time,

688
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:27,138
the cyst will slowly shrink.

689
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:28,538
But

690
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:30,418
if you're not married yet,

691
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:31,898
you may want to consider having surgery

692
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:32,818
to remove it.

693
00:29:35,778 --> 00:29:37,258
(Don't worry about it.)

694
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,378
The doctor said

695
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:39,778
this is pretty common.

696
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:42,418
She also said

697
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:44,618
the best solution

698
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,418
is to have a baby.

699
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,898
This isn't an ultrasound.

700
00:29:50,938 --> 00:29:53,418
It's an amulet urging you
to settle down and have children.

701
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,818
Could this be a sign

702
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:57,258
from heaven?

703
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,938
Someone like Nate

704
00:29:58,938 --> 00:30:00,098
suddenly came back from Singapore

705
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,178
who has great qualifications
in all aspects.

706
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,378
Now, you have this small problem

707
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,458
where it can be solved
by having children.

708
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:09,218
Liang You'an,

709
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,298
this year

710
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:13,058
may be your lucky year

711
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:14,738
to have a wedding.

712
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:16,418
Is that so?

713
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,098
I think you

714
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:22,218
should consider Nate carefully.

715
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,218
I happen to be moving to a new place.

716
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:28,018
Why don't you call him over

717
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:29,818
so I can thank him

718
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:31,498
for introducing a lawyer to me?

719
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,418
That's settled then.

720
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,618
Call Nate to come over this weekend.

721
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:37,978
I can help you check him out.

722
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:42,738
Okay.

723
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,600
(Linglong Mansion)

724
00:30:58,618 --> 00:30:59,458
(Come on in.)

725
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:00,418
Something smells great.

726
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:01,738
Change your slippers.

727
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:02,258
Congratulations.

728
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:03,258
Congratulations on moving
to a new place.

729
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:04,658
You didn't have to bring this gift.

730
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:04,978
Thank you.

731
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:05,858
Mommy An.

732
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:07,498
What's the matter?

733
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:08,818
I'll head inside first.

734
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,098
Not bad.

735
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:12,858
What's the matter, Le?

736
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,458
Close your eyes.

737
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:19,858
What are you up to?

738
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,978
What is it that you want to show me?

739
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:24,578
Le, can I open my eyes now?

740
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:25,738
Yes.

741
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:30,498
What is it?

742
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:32,298
You better don't blink.

743
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:35,618
The moment of witnessing
a miracle has come.

744
00:31:35,618 --> 00:31:37,578
Three, two, one.

745
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:40,898
Where did this small biscuit come from?

746
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,738
Mommy An, you can have the bigger one.

747
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:44,058
I'll have the small one.

748
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,378
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

749
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:47,338
Time to eat.

750
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:49,018
Here you go.

751
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:50,498
Be careful not to dirty your clothes.

752
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:52,818
Did you prepare all these?

753
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:53,378
Yes.

754
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:54,458

00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,658
you're a very skilled nutritionist.

756
00:31:58,138 --> 00:31:59,898
I usually help people come up

757
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,458
with weight loss and muscle gain meals.

758
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:02,778
Try them and see if they're too bland.

759
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:04,138
All right. I usually like

760
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:05,978
to eat healthier food.

761
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:12,618
It's delicious.

762
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,018
I'm glad it's to your liking.

763
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,178
Perfect timing.

764
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:15,698
Today, we also want

765
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:17,058
to take this opportunity

766
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:18,058
to thank you

767
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:18,778
for introducing us

768
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:20,178
to such a reliable lawyer.

769
00:32:20,178 --> 00:32:21,098
Nian's demands

770
00:32:21,098 --> 00:32:22,298
were met.

771
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:24,098
So thank you.

772
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:25,418
My pleasure.

773
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,298
But speaking of Ms. Chen,

774
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,378
I think

775
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:34,378
it's necessary to thank her too.

776
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:35,538
Of course.

777
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:36,698
We're also considering

778
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:38,458
whether to send a small gift.

779
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:39,538
So I want to ask you

780
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:40,298
what's the most suitable gift.

781
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,538
You don't have to worry about that.

782
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:43,458
I'll pick it out.

783
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:45,378
After all, I have a closer relationship
with her.

784
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,138
If I give it to her,

785
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:48,618
it's considered a friendship gift.

786
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,258
Please let me know

787
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:51,218
how much the gift cost then.

788
00:32:51,218 --> 00:32:53,018
I can't let you spend the money.

789
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:54,858
Money is not a big deal.

790
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:56,138
But

791
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:59,298
when it comes to the favor of a friend,
we still need to repay the favor.

792
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,658
Am I right, You'an?

793
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:04,538
Are you talking about me?

794
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:11,418
The supplier conference

795
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:13,418
is about to be held in Shanghai.

796
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:14,778
I have a few clients

797
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:15,858
with good qualifications

798
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:18,698
but less experience

799
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:20,538
who are very interested in working
with Young Space.

800
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:21,938
I think you

801
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:24,298
could introduce them to Mr. Jie

802
00:33:24,818 --> 00:33:26,338
or arrange

803
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,538
a similar private dinner

804
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:29,378
like the one we're having today.

805
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:31,338
I'll host

806
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:32,938
and invite everyone and Mr. Jie

807
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:33,858
for dinner.

808
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:35,018
What do you think?

809
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:37,618
Are you turning

810
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:38,418
our dinner today

811
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,338
into a private dinner?

812
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,018
Of course, not.

813
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,298
I was just using it

814
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,418
as an example.

815
00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:46,098
Of course,

816
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:47,738
this is a private gathering.

817
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:03,978
I'm home now.

818
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:05,618
Thank you for sending me home.

819
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:08,898
Aren't you going to invite me in?

820
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:13,018
I had a bit too much to drink
and want to have some water.

821
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:16,098
Sure.

822
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:21,338
Have a seat.

823
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:23,018
I'll go and get you some water.

824
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:29,378
An,

825
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:32,217
I really like you.

826
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:43,498
I'm sorry.

827
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:45,458
I'm feeling a bit tired.

828
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,137
I want to rest for a bit.

829
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,338
What's wrong?

830
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:52,058
We had a great night tonight.

831
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,418
Maybe I drank too much wine

832
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:56,818
and I'm feeling a bit sick.

833
00:34:56,858 --> 00:34:57,858
I feel like throwing up too.

834
00:34:57,978 --> 00:34:59,217
You go ahead.

835
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:09,738
Okay.

836
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:22,138
Sorry.

837
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:23,658
I really need to go to the bathroom.

838
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:24,578
Could you help me close the door

839
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:25,978
when you leave? Thanks.

840
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:00,298
We barely drank any of this wine.

841
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:01,578
Let's have a few more drinks together.

842
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:02,858
Luo Nian,

843
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:03,858
a person's physiological needs
will die out

844
00:36:03,858 --> 00:36:05,578
if it's not the right person.

845
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,298
Let alone getting married.

846
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:11,978
If you ask me, the cyst grows

847
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:13,378
because you lack the nourishment of love.

848
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,138
What do you think I should do now?

849
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:23,818
Yeah.

850
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:26,578
When you reach a certain age,

851
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,458
even your body sends out alarms.

852
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:31,058
When someone proposes to you
out of nowhere,

853
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:32,778
it may seem like a natural fit.

854
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,058
But you need to be cautious

855
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,858
as it could be dangerous or a trap.

856
00:36:36,218 --> 00:36:37,538
But honestly,

857
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:38,818
he

858
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:40,418
openly calculated things

859
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:42,458
at the dinner table

860
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,178
made the situation
a little embarrassing.

861
00:36:44,178 --> 00:36:45,338
You know me.

862
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,778
It makes me feel uncomfortable

863
00:36:46,778 --> 00:36:48,298
by mixing personal feelings

864
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:49,418
with work.

865
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,898
I didn't understand until today

866
00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:53,418
why my good feelings toward Nate

867
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:55,738
could only

868
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:57,138
remain that way.

869
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,858
I thought finding

870
00:36:58,858 --> 00:36:59,898
a partner

871
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:01,778
at this age

872
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:03,578
was like playing on a seesaw.

873
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:04,898
Finding someone of equal weight

874
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:05,778
was the prerequisite.

875
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:07,258
Otherwise,

876
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,178
one would fall to the ground

877
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:10,218
lying motionless,

878
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:12,138
while the other one
would be suspended in mid-air

879
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:13,418
with no sense of security.

880
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:16,618
Are you and Nate considered

881
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,738
equal weight?

882
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:20,418
Which part do you find not suitable?

883
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:21,858
Yes, I admit

884
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,418
he becomes more proactive

885
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:24,498
since he came back.

886
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:25,938
But it's also made me feel like

887
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:28,058
there's more tension between us.

888
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,138
Both of us

889
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:31,378
have to constantly maintain

890
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:32,618
our weight

891
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,458
while occasionally measuring

892
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,778
each other.

893
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:38,738
In other words,

894
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:39,898
no one wants

895
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:40,898
to be completely vulnerable.

896
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,418
The worst thing

897
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,058
about playing on a seesaw

898
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:45,578
is one person being fooled into mid-air

899
00:37:45,578 --> 00:37:47,498
while the other suddenly leaves

900
00:37:47,578 --> 00:37:49,498
and lets you fall hard to the ground.

901
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:51,338
Where did you get

902
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:52,778
all these distorted ideas?

903
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:54,858
Don't you think

904
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:55,618
you're making dating

905
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:56,818
sound too complicated?

906
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:57,698
Okay.

907
00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:59,418
Then tell me what's dating.

908
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:02,218
When you like someone,

909
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:04,458
you're infatuated.

910
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:06,698
Then

911
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,218
dopamine blinds you

912
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:11,938
as you follow it

913
00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:13,498
into a dark room

914
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:14,658
called intimacy.

915
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:19,058
When the lights are turned on,

916
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:22,138
what you see in front of you is reality.

917
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:24,738
No one can tell for sure

918
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:26,058
if it's a surprise or a shock.

919
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,418
But at least

920
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:30,738
in Nate's dark room,

921
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,338
it's covered

922
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:33,698
with bills stacking

923
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:35,098
on each other.

924
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:35,778
I can't stand it.

925
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:36,858
I just lost interest.

926
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:39,978
No longer interested.

927
00:38:42,378 --> 00:38:43,818
But I don't agree

928
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:44,538
with your theory

929
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,538
about the seesaw.

930
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:47,738
You just haven't met the right person.

931
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:50,338
If you do meet the right person,

932
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,978
you won't even think

933
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:53,058
about playing a game like the seesaw

934
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:54,698
where you can't even hold hands.

935
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:56,698
You'll want to throw yourself
at each other.

936
00:38:57,258 --> 00:39:00,378
The kind where you're constantly

937
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:01,458
clinging and rubbing against each other

938
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,938
for 24 hours a day.

939
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:06,938
You've got me

940
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,858
all worked up now.

941
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:09,618
I am right, am I not?

942
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:13,178
Okay, I've made up my mind.

943
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,818
Once I'm done
with these two months of work,

944
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:15,778
I'll take my annual leave

945
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:16,818
and have my surgery done.

946
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,018
If anything goes wrong,

947
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:20,618
I'll leave my inheritance to Luo Le

948
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,898
in return for taking care of me
in my old age and handling my funeral.

949
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:24,018
It's not too much to ask, right?

950
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:25,698
She'll do it even
without any inheritance.

951
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:27,778
Then I have nothing to lose.

952
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:32,818
Let's drink to throw ourselves
at our loved ones.

953
00:39:39,098 --> 00:39:41,058
My neck feels sore.

954
00:39:43,578 --> 00:39:44,978
Did he kiss your neck?

955
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:46,178
What nonsense is that?

956
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:46,738
Let me see where did he kiss.

957
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:47,778
I objected to it

958
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:49,458
and said no, okay?

959
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:50,618
But did he manage to kiss you?

960
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:01,818
What are you doing at my place?

961
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,058
I got your home address from the coach.

962
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:05,098
Why did you submit a letter to quit?

963
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:06,778
Why are you raising your voice at me?

964
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,898
It's not even approved yet.

965
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,058
I'd rather leave on my own terms

966
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:20,138
than have my contract expire
and be terminated.

967
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:28,538
I never liked

968
00:40:28,538 --> 00:40:29,738
playing badminton as a kid.

969
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:31,178
But my mom always dragged me

970
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,898
to practice every weekend.

971
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:34,018
It was until

972
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,418
I saw you play a match.

973
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:37,818
That was when I realized what a gap was

974
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:39,058
and high skills.

975
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,218
In that match,

976
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:42,418
everything about you,
from your smooth movements

977
00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:43,938
to your game tempo

978
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:45,258
and control

979
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:46,538
was impeccable.

980
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:47,378
I'm telling the truth.

981
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:48,738
Since then,

982
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,378
I've never complained

983
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:50,338
about training again.

984
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,298
That's great.

985
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:56,618
You're already better
than me in that regard.

986
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:01,498
Chuan,

987
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:04,538
I understand

988
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,098
why you're quitting.

989
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,098
But can you

990
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,458
at least leave

991
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:12,298
with your head held high?

992
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:21,978
What do you think

993
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:23,818
is in this box?

994
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:26,858
- Good morning, Ms. Liang.
- Good morning.

995
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:28,538
- Good morning guys.
- Good morning.

996
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,498
Nate personally delivered it

997
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:33,738
and put it on your desk.

998
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:36,218
I knew something was up

999
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:37,618
when he asked
about your medical examination that day.

1000
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:38,538
He even wanted me
to schedule it together.

1001
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,698
I knew something is going on
between you both.

1002
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:41,738
Open it up to see if they're flowers.

1003
00:41:58,778 --> 00:41:59,778
Do you like it?

1004
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:04,098
That night at your place,

1005
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:05,298
I saw you using

1006
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:07,018
this brand of aromatherapy.

1007
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:17,258
Let's talk.

1008
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,178
I don't understand

1009
00:42:21,178 --> 00:42:22,098
what you're trying to say

1010
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:22,898
with this gift today.

1011
00:42:23,658 --> 00:42:25,018
I just thought

1012
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:26,178
you would like it.

1013
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:27,098
So I wanted to give it to you.

1014
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:30,058
If that's the case,

1015
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,458
why didn't you just send it to my house

1016
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,698
or give it to me privately?

1017
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,498
It must have been difficult

1018
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:36,458
to bring such a large gift box
into the office.

1019
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:39,018
Okay, I admit.

1020
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:41,178
I did want others to notice

1021
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:43,418
something about our relationship.

1022
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:51,778
Wait.

1023
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:55,978
Do you want coffee?

1024
00:42:58,138 --> 00:42:59,618
Why are you suddenly being nice?

1025
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:01,298
I'll drink it if you buy it for me.

1026
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:02,618
Okay.

1027
00:43:03,378 --> 00:43:04,298
