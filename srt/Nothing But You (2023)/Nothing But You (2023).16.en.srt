(Young Space Tennis Club)

5
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,992
Then is there a tap in a person's heart?

6
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,552
Can my feelings be turned on

7
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,312
and off as I wish?

8
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,472
I can't take back

9
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:14,352
that I love you for now.

10
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:18,952
However, your recent attitude

11
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:19,872
has been quite clear.

12
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:22,512
You're okay with work and training,

13
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:23,672
but anything beyond that is a no-go.

14
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:24,912
I understand what you mean.

15
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,352
I...

16
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:26,912
I will keep myself in check

17
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:28,192
and not burden you.

18
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,392
But can you at least stay the way

19
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,072
you used to be?

20
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:40,112
Just take what I do

21
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:41,912
as something

22
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:44,552
that a player in the club would do

23
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:46,552
to sweeten up the manager.

24
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:47,952
All right?

25
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:54,592
If not,

26
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:55,992
we'll have to be enemies.

27
00:02:57,872 --> 00:02:58,752
Do you want me to leave?

28
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,432
Sit down and eat up.

29
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:08,232
Focus on your training.

30
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,512
Have you got enough candidates

31
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:45,552
for the professional list?

32
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:47,672
It doesn't go on smoothly.

33
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,952
I'm persuading one player.

34
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:51,312
If he joins in,

35
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:52,432
there'll be one more spot left.

36
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,312
That's exactly what I want to ask.

37
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:57,512
Can you spare me some time?

38
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,912
I will try

39
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:03,512
to fill the last spot.

40
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,672
I know how talented you are.

41
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:16,792
But even if you ask for a spot

42
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:18,232
for next year's candidate,

43
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:18,752
you're just

44
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,031
making it hard for yourself.

45
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,992
Only two months left for this batch.

46
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:23,632
Overexerting training

47
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:24,832
is like hastening the shoot

48
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:25,992
to grow.

49
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:27,112
And I won't do that.

50
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,352
I'm already 22.

51
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:30,912
I'm too old to be a shoot.

52
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,312
If I don't push myself to take this challenge,

53
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:33,752
I...

54
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,432
I will be hopeless.

55
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,512
Do you have to be so stubborn?

56
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,552
I'm determined to seize this chance,

57
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:52,432
just like I want to seize your heart.

58
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:30,592
Coach Yan.

59
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,952
Why do you come here?

60
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,032
Come in.

61
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:45,232
What's the matter?

62
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:47,712
Coach Yan,
I will cut right to the chase.

63
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:50,512
I want to earn a spot

64
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,312
on the professional list.

65
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:53,952
Could...

66
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:57,632
Could you help me?

67
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,072
Sure.

68
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:02,672
Sure?

69
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:05,232
You didn't even hesitate.

70
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:07,992
I have three reasons.

71
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:09,912
First,

72
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:11,632
when I first came to the club,

73
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,232
I missed out on the training half a month ago.

74
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:14,752
But Huo told me

75
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,112
that you were the only one

76
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,112
who stuck with the entire training.

77
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:19,432
Second,

78
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:21,152
you managed to return my serve.

79
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,112
Third...

80
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,352
Two reasons are enough.

81
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:31,872
Heaven helps those who help themselves.

82
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,312
I'm the heaven of this club.

83
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,032
Coach Yan, you're saying this

84
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,712
like you're drunk.

85
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:41,432
Do you know that?

86
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:47,472
How did you know this is liquor?

87
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:49,592
Are you serious?

88
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:53,592
First thing in the morning?

89
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:57,792
I'm trying to cut down.

90
00:06:58,872 --> 00:06:59,552
Well...

91
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,232
Filling it in this bottle helps me

92
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:03,512
to ignore its existence.

93
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,032
The liquor...

94
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,472
Take a seat.

95
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,432
Sit.

96
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,152
I need your word.

97
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,072
Can you trust me unreservedly

98
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,992
or do anything I say?

99
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,032
I have thought it over

100
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:21,352
on my way here.

101
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,192
Before,

102
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:24,272
you were prejudiced against me.

103
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:26,072
Besides,

104
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,032
I've embarrassed you in front of the team.

105
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:31,032
Therefore, no matter

106
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:32,592
how you torture me now or in the future,

107
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,032
I will take it all.

108
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,152
As for the professional aspect,

109
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:37,952
through studying your techniques,

110
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,392
I've studied your abilities,
qualities, and experience

111
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,152
like the back of my hand.

112
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,152
I will trust you completely.

113
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,072
Normally,

114
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,392
I won't commit to things

115
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,312
that ruin my own reputation.

116
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,712
But I appreciate

117
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,472
how bold you can be.

118
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:04,392
You can leave now.

119
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:06,072
Give me some time

120
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:07,192
to think about your training plan.

121
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:11,552
Thank you, Coach Yan.

122
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:12,192
No.

123
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:14,552
Thank you, Coach Heaven.

124
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,780
(Men's Single Quarter-final
of French Open)

125
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:37,792
Did you see that?
He plays near the net.

126
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:39,592
Does that make sense to you?

127
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:41,111
Not really.

128
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,751
I only remember

129
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,352
he did the volley near the net

130
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:46,032
to return your serves.

131
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,112
In the past decade,

132
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,592
the mainstream technique

133
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,232
is prone to play at the baseline.

134
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,512
Athletes just lock at the baseline

135
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:57,672
and focus playing on accuracy.

136
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,912
Whoever makes the lesser mistake

137
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,432
gains the winning probability.

138
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,472
No wonder.

139
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:04,352
I've noticed

140
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:05,712
the tennis match recordings
of recent years

141
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:08,512
seem to have more shots played

142
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:09,552
in one round

143
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:11,352
but it became less interesting to watch.

144
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,552
I've read some analysis articles

145
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:16,072
saying that it was because of
the advancement in tennis racket,

146
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:18,232
which allowed players to hit the ball
more easily and farther.

147
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:20,752
Athletes seem to have gotten used
to playing from the baseline.

148
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:24,072
What you mentioned is one of the reasons.

149
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,472
Apart from that,

150
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,792
the current top players in tennis

151
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:28,832
are all baseliners.

152
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,232
Their rigorous training,

153
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:32,312
movement accuracy and playing styles

154
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:34,152
have become a model to be imitated.

155
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:36,192
Consequently,

156
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,232
the training systems
of the youth team

157
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:38,392
have adopted their techniques.

158
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,712
In these years,

159
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,272
players cultivated

160
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:43,272
from the national system

161
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:44,912
are predominantly baseliners.

162
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:46,992
However, in these two years,

163
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,872
two new stars surge.

164
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,272
They're aggressive
and play around the net.

165
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:53,112
Media commented on them

166
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:54,312
as raw and ignorant.

167
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:55,832
I can tell what's happened in there.

168
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,512
They won because they're flexible
and that's all.

169
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,352
Song Sanchuan.

170
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:04,752
Yes, Coach Yan.

171
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:07,952
Do you know to learn net play?

172
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:15,872
I know my problem.

173
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:17,632
When I played badminton,

174
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,912
I used to attack aggressively.

175
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,592
Now that I've switched to a new sport,

176
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:22,592
I tend to go near the net unconsciously.

177
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:24,712
But I know it's not right.

178
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,392
In tennis,

179
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,312
baseliners are always the victors.

180
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,392
But not in your case.

181
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:32,832
You switched to this sport halfway.

182
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,232
You're at a disadvantage

183
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:35,472
to compete with accuracy.

184
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:36,992
Consider this carefully.

185
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,072
You used to be a badminton player

186
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,112
and what's your edge over others?

187
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,312
Agile footwork, quick,

188
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,232
and play near the net unconsciously.

189
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:48,392
Badminton

190
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:49,472
demands a significant amount of running.

191
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:50,832
Apparently, you have the edge

192
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:51,872
that you can run.

193
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,072
He's really good at running.

194
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,232
I saw that before.

195
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,712
I suggest you learn net play.

196
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:05,872
What do you say?

197
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:09,152
Sure.

198
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:10,752
Of course.

199
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:11,872
I'm down for it.

200
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:15,112
Come with me.

201
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:18,472
Chen Zhe, serve the ball.

202
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,432
Your speed will be tested.

203
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,140
(160 km/h)

204
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,312
160 km/h.

205
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,312
Didn't you eat?

206
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:31,912
Next.

207
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,872
161 km/h.

208
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,192
How did you train them?

209
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:39,952
Taking a stroll after dinner?

210
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:41,992
All right.

211
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:42,952
I will give them

212
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,912
fitness enhancement training next month.

213
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,152
Next.

214
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:48,832
183 km/h.

215
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,432
Good, next.

216
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,112
176 km/h.

217
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,552
Jiang Jiaojiao.

218
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,180
(190 km/h)

219
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:12,632
190 km/h.

220
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:15,072
Awesome.

221
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:16,192
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

222
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:17,632
- Well done, Jiang Jiaojiao.
- The fastest ball.

223
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,432
Shut your faces.

224
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:24,672
The world record is 246 km/h.

225
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,632
Professionals can pass 200 km/h easily.

226
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:29,112
What are you happy about?

227
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:31,472
Still, it's the best result I've had.

228
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:32,752
Am I right, Coach Xu?

229
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:33,792
Yes.

230
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,032
It's his first time exceeding 190 km/h.

231
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:40,112
Fine. The sharpest knife in the drawer.

232
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,192
It's you then. Serve from this side.

233
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:43,392
Song Sanchuan.

234
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,112
Go over that side.

235
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:45,712
Yes.

236
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:47,832
No need to bring your racket.

237
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:49,352
Drop it.

238
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:53,832
Stand forward.

239
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,312
Keep going.

240
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:01,912
What's happening now?

241
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:02,832
Is he going to catch
the ball barehanded?

242
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:04,392
Jiang Jiaojiao.

243
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,392
With the speed just now,

244
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,032
hit the ball around him.

245
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:11,672
As close as you can.

246
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:13,512
Coach Yan.

247
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,792
Are you kidding me?

248
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,352
He will get hurt

249
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,832
if a 190 km/h ball

250
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:18,952
hits at him.

251
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,712
It depends on your strength then.

252
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,432
It's bad for him

253
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:23,792
if you miss it.

254
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,352
Don't worry, Jiaojiao.

255
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:28,312
Serve the ball.

256
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,352
I will dodge the ball if you miss.

257
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,632
You can't dodge the ball.

258
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:35,112
Stand right there

259
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,192
and stay put.

260
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,072
Don't even wink your eyes.

261
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,672
Come on.

262
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:44,792
Hit slightly to the side.

263
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:46,152
Chuan.

264
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:48,592
Don't blame me if the ball hits you.

265
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:50,512
I'm forced.

266
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,472
It's fine, Jiaojiao.

267
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:55,472
Let's do this.

268
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,432
Fake it.

269
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:01,712
Don't beat so hard.

270
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,420
(Video)

271
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:20,992
What's wrong with you?

272
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,232
I told you

273
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,912
to aim around him.

274
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,940
(Video)

275
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:17,832
Xu Tan.

276
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,032
See how cowardly you looked.

277
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:36,272
If you want to learn net play,

278
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,752
bear my word in mind deeply.

279
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,192
Get as close to the ball as you can.

280
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,312
Net players are less in amount

281
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,992
because it's dangerous.

282
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,352
If you go close to the net,

283
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,032
the big and unguarded area behind you

284
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,192
is exposed to your opponent.

285
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:52,592
Once they hit it back,
your chance to win is blown.

286
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,232
So, to play at the net,

287
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,072
remember two words,

288
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,872
be bold and accurate.

289
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,872
Overcome your fear boldly

290
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,552
and seize the opportunity accurately.

291
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,112
So, are you down for it?

292
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:07,512
Yes.

293
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:09,312
I'm down for it.

294
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,192
Good.

295
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:15,712
Coach Yan.

296
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:20,192
Isn't this training too dangerous?

297
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,312
I know.

298
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:25,592
Protective gear.

299
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:42,432
This is the training today.

300
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,032
You practice service accuracy,

301
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,112
and you encounter the balls.

302
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,112
Any problem?

303
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,152
Good, let's start.

304
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,232
Leave the court
if you don't use your full force.

305
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:11,712
Let's do this.

306
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,512
Chuan.

307
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,312
Come on.

308
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:32,512
It's fine.

309
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:41,672
Harder.

310
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:57,592
I'm good.

311
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,192
Serve the ball.

312
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,152
I will brace myself.

313
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:07,992
Come on.

314
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,740
(Ancong Wig Shop)

315
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,272
Jeez.

316
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,512
What has happened to you?

317
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,232
Did you go for training

318
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,432
or fight others?

319
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,592
Lift it.

320
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:15,312
Right.

321
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:16,872
Lift it up and then press it.

322
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,152
Lift it up and then press it.

323
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:19,752
Ice my back.

324
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:20,392
Over here.

325
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:21,792
Gosh, you're bruised all over.

326
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:24,152
Well.

327
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:26,392
Take a cold shower.

328
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:27,232
I did.

329
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,152
Put on the ice bag on me.

330
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:28,792
Over here.

331
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,832
Is your coach unconventional?

332
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:35,352
The unconventional method is good

333
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:36,992
and useful.

334
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:38,192
It helps me to break through.

335
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,792
Since Coach Yan taught me,

336
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:41,232
I feel like I'm making progress

337
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:42,512
every day.

338
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:47,312
You know what,

339
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:50,072
a ball passed by me

340
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:50,752
at 180 km/h today.

341
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:51,752
I almost caught it.

342
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,032
Am I strong?

343
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:55,032
Yes, you're the strongest in the world.

344
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:56,352
Over these days,

345
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,352
I noticed

346
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,032
that the speed of the balls

347
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:00,912
coming at me

348
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:01,912
has been decreasing.

349
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:05,152
Besides, I can see the trajectory of the ball

350
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,072
more clearly than before.

351
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:07,592
Try me.

352
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:08,472
I can catch it.

353
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,472
Forget it.

354
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,712
Come on, throw something at me.

355
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,712
Look at yourself now.

356
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,072
Try you?

357
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,552
Look at you.

358
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:29,232
I knew it'd happened.

359
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,232
You're strained, aren't you?

360
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:31,992
Careful.

361
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:35,192
Gosh.

362
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:36,912
I need a cold shower now.

363
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:37,752
Go ahead.

364
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:38,952
Chop-chop.

365
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:51,312
Let me give you a shove.

366
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,512
Hello.

367
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:03,152
Is this Ms. Liang?

368
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,432
I'm An Cong.

369
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:09,432
Here's the thing.

370
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:12,392
I noticed that Chuan's body
was covered in bruises

371
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:14,272
after he took a shower.

372
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:16,072
I'd like to know

373
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,032
if my son got bullied

374
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:20,952
in the club.

375
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:21,832
Mr. An.

376
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,232
I'm so sorry about that.

377
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,352
I didn't expect him

378
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,752
to be so badly hurt.

379
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,472
But please believe

380
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,992
that there's no bully in the club.

381
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:30,872
Coach Yan

382
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,192
actually designed a new training plan

383
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:34,632
based on his technical strength.

384
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:34,992
The thing is

385
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:36,912
the training is just out of line.

386
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:37,312
Don't you think so?

387
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:40,232
Though Chuan never complains

388
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:41,312
about the strenuous training,

389
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:44,272
still, you brought him in.

390
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:46,232
You're responsible for him

391
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:47,032
whether he's working

392
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,872
or training in your place.

393
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:49,632
Am I right?

394
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:50,632
Yes.

395
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:52,272
I'm truly sorry, Mr. An.

396
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:53,432
You've seen the picture.

397
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:54,792
His body is all bruised.

398
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:56,872
I'm heartbroken seeing that.

399
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,872
Please understand me.

400
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:01,632
I will stop here.

401
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:03,992
I'm sorry to make you worry, Mr. An.

402
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:05,352
Bye-bye.

403
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:14,592
I want them all.

407
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:34,552
Come in.

408
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:39,512
The bag on the table

409

00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:52,392
I don't need these.

413
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:53,872
Wait.

414
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,032
Do you think

415
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:00,352
you can carry on

416
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:01,392
with the training plan

417
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:02,592
designed by Coach Yan?

418
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:04,472
Do you need me to talk to him?

419
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:05,192
No.

The current plan

421
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,592
is the most suitable one for me.

422
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:10,712
With this training,

423
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,112
I can get the professional's rating

425
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:19,592
Did you find someone else behind my back?

426
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:20,872
Of course not.

427
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:25,192
Good.

428
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:28,992
Only you would be so happy

429
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:30,792
even after getting hit so badly.

430
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,472
Take this.

431
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:36,432
Don't strain yourself.

432
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:37,792
Put on the ointment

433
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:39,192
and stop getting hurt.

434
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:45,712
What did you get all this stuff?

435
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,872
Did you buy these for me?

436
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,232
I took them from my house.

437
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:54,032
I didn't know you were so naughty

438
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:54,912
and needed so many remedies prepared.

439
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:57,232
Do you often get into fights?

440
00:23:58,512 --> 00:23:59,512
Go training now.

441
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:01,032
You're so talkative.

442
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:02,592
Well.

443
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:04,312
I will take this.

444
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:05,752
Put this on for me.

445
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,632
See, I'm so kind to you.

Here?

447
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,032
No, a little to the right.

Here?

449
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:23,192
Okay.

450
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:31,752
Be gentle, please.

451
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:40,992
Just bear it.

452
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,192
You're a man.

453
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,032
Gosh, stop!

454
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:46,472
Don't massage if you can't.

455

Okay?

456
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:48,272
Please sit, will you?

457
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:48,912
I will do it myself.

458
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:54,632
I can't continue

459
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,152
if I don't help you with the bruises.

460
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,872
You're not afraid of the ball.

461
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:59,352
But I feel much guilty.

462
00:24:59,352 --> 00:24:59,832
Do you know?

463
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:01,232
Save it.

You're the best training mate ever.

465
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:04,712
Shut up.

467
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:09,032
Stop stretching.

00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:16,512
Do you think Zhang Yan

469
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:17,472
is doing this on a purpose?

470
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:19,872
The training is just brutal.

471
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:22,632
Why don't we quit today?

472
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:24,872

Are you serious?

478
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:46,472
Does he want to catch the ball?

479
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:49,192

480
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:52,032
Come on.

481
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:35,472
Nice, Chuan.

482
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,512
I got this.

483
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:41,992
It has reached up to 195 km/h.

484
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:42,752
It's 195 km/h.

485
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,032
Well done.

We've reviewed

the results from last year.

491
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:02,792
In most matches, you got knocked out
in the first round at most competitions.

492
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:03,752
When you were in tip-top condition,

493
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,592
you could proceed
to semi-finals and finals sometimes.

494
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:07,192
You earned points for the entire year

495
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:08,512
with just one or two games.

496
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:09,392
But the problem is

497
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:10,912
that you were participating

498
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,672
in as many matches as possible

499
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,232

In fact,

501
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:16,672
it didn't help much

502
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:18,152
to your ranking.

503
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:21,152

to achieve the top 100.

505

After a discussion,
both Coach Yan and I

506
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:27,472

in highly cost-effective matches.

than last year.

518
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:43,072
After that,

519
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:45,512

after participating
in the competitions you chose?

523
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:51,632
Yes, as long as you play well

524

and stay focused.

541
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:48,992
I will try.

542
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:51,192
Maybe twenty to thirty thousand.

543

I'll lose 90 percent of the investment.

547
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:00,992
Do you still support him

548

And besides,

552
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,232
the more money he loses playing sports,

553
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,992
the more it highlights your perfect image

573
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
I must catch up on it.

574
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:41,752
The child's mother
is coming back tomorrow.

575
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:46,752
Le.

576
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,352
You're back.

577
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:51,392
Ms. Luo.

578
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:53,272
Why are you back today?

579
00:30:58,472 --> 00:30:59,632
What's in the bowl?

580
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,392
The rice and fried vegetables.

581
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:05,552
I've cooked too much for lunch.

582
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,992
I think it's a waste

583
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:09,872
and save it for dinner.

584
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:12,512
Le.

585
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:14,232
Stay in your room

586
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:14,912
and play with yourself.

587
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:15,512
All right?

588
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:18,352
Li, come out with me.

589
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,032
Is she asleep?

590
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,232
She's asleep, right?

591
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:47,632
Very good.

592
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:49,912
I called her many times

593
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:51,072
and she didn't answer me.

594
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:52,392
She sleeps like a piggy.

595
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:53,192
Is she?

596
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:57,752
Today,

597
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,792
when I pushed open the door

598
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:00,992
and saw my girl

599
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:03,392
playing alone
with some toy cars on the floor

600
00:32:04,112 --> 00:32:05,992
and the leftover food
simply left beside her,

601
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:09,232
it reminded me

602
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:10,632
of what she told me
during the parent-teacher meeting.

603
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:13,752
Her classmates were talking about

604
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:16,912
their parents took them on a trip

605
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,832
or some kind of lesson.

606
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,832
I never let these things bother me.

607
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:21,872
Because I didn't care about that.

608
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:24,592
I used to think

609
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:25,672
that I could make my daughter
be proud of me

610
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:26,912
without those things.

611
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:29,672
Hence, I never joined group chats
with other mothers

612
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:31,752
as I wanted to block them away.

613
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:33,632
But the scene

614
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:37,312
hurt my heart.

615
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:39,872
All my guilt

616
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:40,992
just hit me at once,

617
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:41,872
do you know?

618
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,632
I wasn't blocking them away,

619
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:49,752
instead, I was evading them.

620
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:00,472
It's not a big deal.

621
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,672
I decided not

622
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,792
to go on business trips anymore.

623
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,752
I'm a single mother.

624
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:09,352
I need more time

625
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:10,152
to accompany her.

626
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:18,992
Give me a hand.

627
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:20,312
Let's move the furniture away.

628
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:20,952
Come on.

629
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,752
I come at the wrong time.

630
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:29,512
I thought

631
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,752
you installed a monitor at home.

632
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:32,752
Don't mention that.

633
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,632
Previously, Li told me

634
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:36,752
it wasn't safe to install the monitor.

635
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:39,192
It could be easily hacked
and watched by others.

636
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,872
I thought she got a point.

637
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:42,592
Because only Luo Le and I are in the house

638
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:43,872
and no man is with us.

639
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,512
It's scarier if someone watches us.

640
00:33:46,632 --> 00:33:47,152
Right?

641
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:48,832
When I recall this,

642
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:50,592
I was so dense to believe her.

643
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:52,472
She was worried about being monitored.

644
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,152
Initially,

645
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:55,872
she acted like she was trustable

646
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,992
and that clouded my judgment.

647
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:01,072
Luckily, things didn't end on a bad note.

648
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:02,032
As long as she left.

649
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:03,952
What do you do next?

650
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:04,992
Get a new babysitter?

651
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,752
Of course.

652
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:08,872
I've requested the agency

653
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:09,992
for new recommendations.

654
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:11,271
Look.

655
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:12,672
I've mistrusted

656
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,192
an "honest" person like Li.

657
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:15,711
I need time to consider it.

658
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:17,952
Let's move this to the corridor.

659
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:22,832
The workout is enough for today.

660
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:27,592
(Young Space Tennis Club)
(Are you off for work, aren't you?)

661
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,711
(I'm calling to tell you)

662
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:31,192
(I won't hire a babysitter.)

663
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:32,832
(My mother promised)

664
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:34,112
(to help me out.)

665
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:36,472
Well, don't be anxious.

666
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:39,192
(I was busy and
forgot to ask you something.)

667
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:40,952
(How are you and that young boy?)

668
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:47,152
He acts as if nothing happened.

669
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,832
He works even harder on the training

670
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,392
and works more diligently.

671
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:52,152
(I'm not asking that.)

672
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:53,231
Let me tell you this.

673
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,231
Youngsters

674
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:56,512
never confuse themselves

675
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:57,712
(and separate love relationship)

676
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,752
(and work clearly.)

677
00:34:58,832 --> 00:34:59,872
(As for someone)

678
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:00,952
(who has been confessed to,)

679
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,712
don't lose your cool.

680
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:04,272
Who knows

681
00:35:05,112 --> 00:35:06,232
you put more attention on him.

682
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,552
Act naturally like he does.

683
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:11,872
Luo Nian.

684
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:12,752
I realized

685
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:14,432
that you have gotten over it

686
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,392
and have the energy to tease me now.

687
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:18,432
(Well, I won't bother you then.)

688
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:19,192
(Ms. Liang.)

689
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:20,512
Why are you standing here?

690
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:21,432
Feeding the mosquitoes?

691
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:23,032
No mosquitoes here.

692
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,232
Besides,

693
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:25,432
I won't be bitten.

694
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,832
Mosquitoes prefer those who sweat a lot like you.

695
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:29,632
I'm not moving and I don't sweat.

696
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,752
Do you continue to exercise

697
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:34,392
after the jogging last time?

698
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:35,592
I don't have to walk the dogs now.

699
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:36,592
Why would I need to exercise?

700
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:39,192
You're the manager of a tennis club.

701
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,192
All players are training hard every day

702
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:43,072
to achieve A-rank.

703
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,272
As our leader,

704
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,152
shouldn't you set yourself

705
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:47,072
an example for us?

706
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:51,112
What you're saying is superficial.

707
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,392
As a manager,

708
00:35:52,512 --> 00:35:53,672
I don't need to physically demonstrate

709
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,192
to manage the club effectively.

710
00:35:58,872 --> 00:35:59,592
Speak plainly.

711
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:04,192
Fine, I admit

712
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,112
that I'm lazy and clumsy.

713
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:06,952
In the past 30 years,

714
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:08,512
I have more gym membership cards
than credit cards

715
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,072
and I've never attended
more than five classes.

716
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:10,832
What's the problem with it?

717
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:12,552
I'm doing good now.

718
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,192
But you're in the sports field.

719
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:17,032
If you can't even appreciate

720
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:18,432
how charming sports is,

721
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,952
how can do your job well?

722
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,552
It's late.

723
00:36:25,632 --> 00:36:26,592
Are you not going for training today

724
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:28,392
and chatting here?

725
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:29,832
You seem to enjoy talking so much.

726
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,232
202.

727
00:37:45,312 --> 00:37:47,592
Pick a fitness class that fits me.

728
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,432
The target is detected
in poor physical fitness.

729
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:52,992
Children mode is activated.

730
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,312
Children?

731
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:17,752
It's quite a workout today.

732
00:38:29,712 --> 00:38:31,112
Why are you here at this hour?

733
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,552
I'm doing extra training.

734
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:33,992
I come here every day at this hour.

735
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:38,512
So, you've been standing here
since just now?

736
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:41,832
It's really quite a workout for you.

737
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:43,872
I feel tired just looking at you.

738
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:48,992
Yes, it's enough for today.

739
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:49,952
I'm leaving.

740
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:51,712
Bye-bye.

741
00:38:52,552 --> 00:38:53,712
You don't have basic.

742
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:55,512
Working out without a proper guide
is less effective

743
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:56,952
and you may get hurt easily.

744
00:38:57,992 --> 00:38:59,272
Now that our time for jogging

745
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:00,232
can't be matched.

746
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:01,632
If you're serious about this,

747
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:03,472
I will tell you

748
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,032
which of the equipment
is suitable for you

749
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:06,312
and easy to handle.

750
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:07,792
Come with me.

751
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:16,352
No.

752
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:17,392
The angle of your knee is wrong.

753
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:17,992
Your knee will hurt.

754
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:18,552
Look.

755
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,472
Keep your knee perpendicular
to the ground,

756
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,552
forming a 90-degree angle.

757
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:22,432
Move your leg slightly forward.

758
00:39:22,512 --> 00:39:23,632
Yes. Then shift your weight backward.

759
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:24,272
Lean slightly backward. Good.

760
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:25,312
Squat down.

761
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:26,672
Yes, you're almost there.

762
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:27,512
Look at me.

763
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:28,792
Keep your body upright

764
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:31,152
with your knees perpendicular to the ground.

765
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:31,952
Let's do it together.

766
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,432
One, two, three, go.

767
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:40,272
Slowly.

768
00:40:26,392 --> 00:40:27,792
My vision is a blur.

769
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:29,952
Let me be honest with you,

770
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:31,112
this is more difficult than jogging.

771
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:32,512
I give up.

772
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:33,352
Calling it quits?

773
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,352
Look at that.

774
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:51,152
Well, this is known as the belly.

775
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:53,632
An outward sign of blessed people.

776
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,352
I always look at it

777
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:56,912
to judge if I consume enough food.

778
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,472
I skip two meals to make it disappear

779
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:02,512
and it does.

780
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,752
If you lose weight by skipping meals,

781
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:08,672
you will have hair loss and become ugly

782
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:09,792
and hormonal,

783
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:11,192
which can be pernicious to your body.

784
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:12,432
Keep this in mind.

785
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:13,552
The purpose of training

786
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,512
is to keep your body healthy,

787
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:17,032
not to become slimmer.

788
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:20,072
Well.

789
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,632
Let's call it a day.

790
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:25,312
I will keep on exercising.

791
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:28,072
Sure, let's continue tomorrow.

792
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:33,352
The cap.

793
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,552
Thank you.

794
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:37,112
Bye.

795
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:58,032
Belly is just something normal.

796
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,672
Hmph.

797
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:08,952
No.

798
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:10,472
It's because the working duration

799
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:11,952
is long.

800
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:12,592
All right?

801
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:13,912
That's why I turned it down.

802
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:16,952
But I'm all right with working around Shenzhen.

803
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:19,632
Yes, I will give commitments
about the working hours.

804
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,392
All right.

805
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:23,872
Got it. Thank you so much.

806
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:26,912
Now?

807
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:28,512
Sure.

808
00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:30,432
I will send it to you via e-mail.

809
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:31,192
Give me a second.

810
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:46,712
Luo Le, what have you done?

811
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:49,592
The rice spilled
and I'm picking them up.

812
00:42:49,592 --> 00:42:52,112
What's the problem with you?

813
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,432
I just stepped out for two minutes.

814
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:54,952
Why did you mess this up?

815
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:56,752
Why are you crying?

816
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,512
I don't even have anyone to cry to.

817
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:03,432
