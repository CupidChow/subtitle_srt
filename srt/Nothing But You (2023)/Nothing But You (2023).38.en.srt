(Termination Agreement)

One, two. One, two.

00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:16,583
Test. Test.

9
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:18,103
Can you hear me?

10
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:21,623
Copy.

11
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:25,863
Stay on this channel.

12
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:27,703
Don't tune it.

13
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,863
And you can't tune it to
other people's channel.

14
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:35,503
Why?

15
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:38,183
Because the maximum range

16
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:39,423
for this walkie-talkie
is only 800 meters.

17
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:42,823
We each have one.

18
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,303
When it buzzes again,

19
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,343
that means I'm back.

20
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:14,343
Copy.

21
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,060
(Three months later, Spain)

22
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:40,663
(Liang You'an, )

23
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,423
(It's 9:30 a.m.)

24
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,383
(in Spain.)

25
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,263
(The weather has been
really nice lately.)

26
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:47,903
(It's sunny)

27
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,103
(and warm.)

28
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:50,023
Hi.

29
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:50,623
Hi.

30
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,663
(If it weren't for the fact
that I have to learn their language)

31
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:55,583
(as quickly as I can,)

32
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,383
(I'd love to go out more)

33
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,983
(and shoot more films for you.)

34
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,303
(By the way, remember)

35
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,023
(the hotpot soup base you sent me?)

36
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,703
(My two new roommates)

37
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:09,903
(crave for hotpot everyday now.)

38
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,223
(Cheese and other stuff
don't smell as good anymore.)

39
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,063
(I should thank you for them.)

40
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:17,743
(Liang You'an,)

41
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,223
(There is)

42
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:21,143
(a 7-hour time difference between us.)

43
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:23,303
(I think)

44
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,663
(I have adapted to the life here,)

45
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:27,143
(but I often feel like)

46
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,943
(I'm so far away from you.)

47
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,863
(I wish you were here)

48
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,183
(with me.)

49
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:34,903
Liang You'an,

50
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:36,823
I just finished a match.

51
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:37,783
I finally won.

52
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,303
This is

53
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:40,743
my first win of the month.

54
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,263
After I came here, I realized that

55
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,743
there is always someone
who is stronger than me.

56
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:47,343
I didn't even

57
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,943
get any praise from my professor
for my homework.

58
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:51,743
Liang You'an,

59
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,023
I miss you so much.

60
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,303
This weekend,

61
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,063
our coach took us off the island.

62
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:02,983
And then,

63
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,623
I passed by the zoo here.

64
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:07,823
It reminded me of

65
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,703
the first time we went to the zoo.

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,743
That night

67
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,263
was the first time
I confessed my love to you.

68
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,943
And you turned me down!

69
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:18,863
I was so sad and upset

70
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:19,823
that night.

71
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:22,463
(Why do I still feel upset
when I think about it now?)

72
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:24,223
(Song Sanchuan,)

73
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,983
(you do hold grudges.)

74
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,663
(But)

75
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:28,783
(I've been thinking a lot)

76
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:29,783
(about our time together in the past.)

77
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:32,703
(Someone kept staring at my tummy,)

78
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:33,823
(saying that I had flab.)

79
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,503
(I never forget it.)

80
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,263
(I'm going settle scores with you
when you come back.)

81
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,983
I was lying down with my eyes closed,

82
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,463
and now I'm wide awake
because of your photo.

83
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:50,703
This is too much.

84
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,463
I was fooling you.

85
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:55,903
That wasn't my photo.

86
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,783
I found it online.

87
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:03,143
You really think

88
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:04,583
I can't recognize your waist?

89
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:09,743
Go to sleep now.
You can do anything in your dream.

90
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:10,503
Good night.

91
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:13,663
That was so hot.

92
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,383
He told me that

93
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:18,503
since we can't be

94
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,583
with each other now,

95
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:20,383
we should

96
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:21,583
send more audio messages
to each other.

97
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,543
This way,

98
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,503
we can hear each other's voice.

99
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,263
You two are
the happiest long-distance couple

100
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:28,023
I've ever seen.

101
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,463
I didn't believe it before.

102
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:31,103
You are so happy

103
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:32,863
even though you can't see each other.

104
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:43,063
You took screenshots everyday.

105
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,143
So sweet.

106
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,543
Yes.

107
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:57,223
It's precisely because
we can't see each other

108
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,823
that I treasure

109
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,743
every video call we've had.

110
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:02,223
He knows

111
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,983
all about the new players, new coach,

112
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:07,663
and even the new brand of balls

113
00:07:07,663 --> 00:07:08,623
our club has.

114
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,463
He does the same for me.

115
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,863
The lessons he attended everyday,

116
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,263
the classrooms he went to,

117
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,623
and his roommates

118
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,703
who have long names,

119
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,663
I know all about it.

120
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,503
I really don't think

121
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:21,463
we're separated.

122
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:26,143
It's okay.

123
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,263
I'll save up all my leave

124
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:29,343
and go visit him.

125
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:30,983
Oh, right.

126
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:32,783
When our

127
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:34,583
first tennis school opens in Zhuhai,

128
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,063
you will be able
to take a vacation, right?

129
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:47,263
What does this mean?

130
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,903
Why are you calling at this hour?

131
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:57,223
You...

132
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:58,463
It must be early there.

133
00:07:58,543 --> 00:07:59,063
What time is it there?

134
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:01,863
6:00 a.m..

135
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,103
What's wrong?

136
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:06,943
Nothing.

137
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,343
I just missed you.

138
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:12,103
Did you have a nightmare?

139
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,663
What are you doing?

140
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:16,743
Are you doing homework?

141
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:18,263
Yes, I am.

142
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:19,663
How about this?

143
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:21,223
I'll stay with you
until you fall asleep.

144
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,823
Then, I'll go back to my homework.

145
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,223
I don't want to sleep anymore.

146
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:26,503
Give me a minute.
I'm going to freshen up.

147
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,503
How about I help you with your homework?

148
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,503
You can help,

149
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:46,823
but never mind.

150
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,663
I can manage.

151
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:49,383
You didn't fall for it.

152
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:50,303
I was going to say,

153
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,543
you should do it yourself.

154
00:08:54,463 --> 00:08:55,823
I have a pursuit.

155
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,063
I might not be as smart as you,

156
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:58,063
or has a good foundation like you,

157
00:08:58,263 --> 00:08:59,983
but I have set a simple goal.

158
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,703
By the time I leave this island,

159
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:03,623
I have

160
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,343
to be able to speak English fluently.

161
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,903
Your school

162
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:08,863
is pretty educational.

163
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:10,663
Of course.

164
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,103
Listen,

165
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:14,063
When I was in the sports team,

166
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:15,823
there was little time for me

167
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:16,823
to really study

168
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:17,743
and learn.

169
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:19,823
Now I feel that everyday

170
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:20,823
has become quite interesting.

171
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:22,063
I feel like I'm getting better each day,

172
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:24,503
like I've become smarter too.

173
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,463
My brain also works better

174
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:26,383
when I play.

175
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:27,103
Okay.

176
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:29,663
I feel like my boyfriend, who is already

177
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:31,423
younger than me,
has turned into a child now.

178
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:32,783
You are enjoying this secretly.

179
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:33,503
Don't be smug.

180
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:43,383
Remember to send me
the homework by email.

181
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:44,263
Okay?

182
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,303
And I will see you all next week.

183
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,103
See you.

184
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,943
My class just ended.

185
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,063
Let me show you around.

186
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:02,223
Today's class went pretty well.

187
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,543
I understood most of the things.

188
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,703
Seriously, Liang You'an,

189
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:06,823
you haven't video-called me

190
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:07,783
for almost three days now.

191
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,383
Have you been busy

192
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:11,143
with the opening

193
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:11,783
of the tennis school?

194
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:13,743
I understand that,

195
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:14,863
but no matter how busy you are,

196
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:15,903
you couldn't just ignore me
for three days.

197
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,023
It's been three days.

198
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:28,583
Hello?

199
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:29,903
Hello?

200
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,303
Hello?

201
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:33,383
I was singing karaoke

202
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:34,743
with my wife upstairs just now.

203
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,663
I got bad reception there.
I couldn't hear you.

204
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:37,903
I have something to ask you.

205
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:39,983
What has Liang You'an been up to?

206
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:41,103
Has she been really busy?

207
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:41,743
She hasn't

208
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:42,823
talked to me for three days,

209
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:43,383
you know?

210
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,343
She is in Zhuhai now.

211
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:46,583
The tennis school is opening.

212
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:47,543
She must be busy.

213
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:48,143
Has she

214
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:49,423
been acting

215
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:50,063
a little

216
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:52,063
unusual lately?

217
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,623
Oh, yes, yes.

218
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,063
Now that you mention it,

219
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,463
she does seem a little different lately,

220
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:00,863
which I can't put my finger on it.

221
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,343
Anyway,

222
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:06,223
I think she looks
even prettier these days.

223
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:07,863
Like really lively.

224
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,023
She looks even better than
when you were around.

225
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:11,823
She looks better than when I was around?

226
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,823
This doesn't make any sense.

227
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,103
She is doing so well in her career now.

228
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:20,503
The tennis school

229
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,303
has recruited

230
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,103
many new handsome coaches,

231
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,623
teachers and team leaders.

232
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,143
Right.

233
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:26,183
Even our club

234
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:26,943
has a lot of

235
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,343
new players who are younger than you.

236
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,343
Anyone would've become

237
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:31,183
lively and energetic,

238
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:31,863
right?

239
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:37,183
(Liang You'an, on our 100th day)

240
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:37,823
(apart,)

241
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,023
(hearing that
you've gotten even better,)

242
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:42,263
(I can't believe)

243
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:44,583
(I'm feeling a little insecure.)

244
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:46,863
We are still

245
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:48,183
only accepting high school students

246
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:49,263
who are enrolled in junior high school.

247
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,823
The first batch of founding students

248
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:51,703
are still mainly for those

249
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,423
who are pursuing further domestic
and international tennis education.

250
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:54,943
We have very good

251
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:55,703
coaching staff.

252
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:56,663
Coach Zhang Yan

253
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,463
is still mainly based in Shenzhen,

254
00:11:58,463 --> 00:11:59,223
but we have several coaches

255
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,223
from other cities

256
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:00,783
who have coached

257
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,183
tennis players
who are in the top 100 list.

258
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,103
You may take a look around yourself.

259
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:11,183
One, two.

260
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:13,503
One, two. One, two.

261
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:15,823
Test. Test.

262
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:17,783
Ms. Liang?

263
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,423
Ms. Liang, do you copy?

264
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,623
What's going on with you?

265
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:03,143
You didn't even tell me
you were coming back.

266
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:06,263
It wouldn't be a surprise then.

267
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,423
There are two matches to choose from.

268
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,543
One of them is in Zhuhai.

269
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,063
Of course I would choose Zhuhai.

270
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:14,463
How did you know I was here?

271
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:15,783
I asked Mingyu.

272
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,063
Oh, no.

273
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:19,383
I was going

274
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,383
to surprise you too.

275
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:20,903
I've been saving

276
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:21,983
all my leave lately.

277
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,063
I even bought the flight ticket.

278
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:23,943
I was going to visit you.

279
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:26,943
That explains

280
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,103
why you haven't been
video-calling me lately.

281
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,383
You've been working overtime.

282
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,223
It's true that I've been really busy.

283
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:31,983
I kept missing

284
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,063
our calling time.

285
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:34,463
So, are you

286
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,463
going back to school after the match?

287
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:38,263
But I have another match

288
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:39,383
as soon as I get back to school.

289
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:40,783
So,

290
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:43,103
I don't think I can keep you company

291
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:43,983
while you are on vacation.

292
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,143
How long are you staying?

293
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,143
After the game,

294
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,103
I would take two days off.

295
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,503
My teammates and coach
will go back first.

296
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,583
I'll take the red-eye flight back.

297
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:56,303
I'll go to class right after I land.

298
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,063
We can

299
00:13:58,383 --> 00:13:59,503
stay together

300
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:01,023
for two days.

301
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,343
Then, later...

302
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,943
I'll take them to check in first.

303
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:07,303
Then when you're done,

304
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:07,863
I'll come to you.

305
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:08,583
Okay.

306
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:10,223
Go on.

307
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,063
You smell super nice.

308
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,063
Are you Song Sanchuan?

309
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:30,983
Yes.

310
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:32,143
Can I take a picture with you?

311
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:32,663
I'm your caddy

312
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,503
for your match tomorrow.

313
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:34,743
Sure, let's...

314
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,583
We want a photo too!

315
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:37,983
Okay, let's go in and take a picture.

316
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:38,663
- Together.
- Okay!

317
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:39,423
Come on.

318
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:41,343
Sure, sure.

319
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:42,463
I got it. I got it.

320
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,503
- Going back. Okay?
- I got it.

321
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,023
You guys ready?

322
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,143
Here we go.

323
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:48,023
Smile.

324
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,063
Three, two...

325
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,303
Top Smash!

326
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,103
I want an autograph!
I want an autograph!

327
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,103
Song Sanchuan,

328
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,663
I just realized

329
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,823
that reuniting after a long separation

330
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:07,343
isn't like in the movies,

331
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,903
where lovers rush to each other

332
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:10,863
and tightly embrace.

333
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,103
Over the past days, when I've been
working hard to save my leave,

334
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:15,903
I've imagined countless times

335
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:16,943
how I'll feel when I see you.

336
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,543
I didn't expect that
when I actually met you,

337
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:21,783
you've become a little unfamiliar.

338
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:23,863
You are shining.

339
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:25,143
I'm even

340
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,703
a little afraid to go near you.

341
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:28,343
What should I do?

342
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,423
It seems that you were right.

343
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,343
I've fallen in love with someone else.

344
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,263
I've fallen in love
with the present you.

345
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,703
How did you find this place?

346
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,623
I saw it on the plane.

347
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:19,383
And, I kept it in mind.

348
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:22,583
You know,

349
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:23,783
when I saw you in the court just now,

350
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,223
I thought you had grown taller.

351
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:26,183
That is possible.

352
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:26,863
People say you can still grow taller

353
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:27,583
even at 23.

354
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,823
I might be 25 now,

355
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:29,863
but I think I still have a chance.

356
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,543
My informant told me

357
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,263
that you've become prettier.

358
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,503
Now that I look at you,

359
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:35,103
he was right.

360
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:36,943
That's why you bought a flight ticket

361
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:37,903
to come all the way back.

362
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:39,023
You didn't come
for the match, didn't you?

363
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:40,223
You came for me.

364
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:40,823
You want to check in on me?

365
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:43,903
I heard that

366
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:44,583
someone's life

367
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,583
has been exciting.

368
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:46,943
She's meeting

369
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:47,943
batch after batch of underdogs.

370
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:49,863
I wonder who motivated you

371
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,063
when you worked out to get your abs.

372
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,503
Who else?

373
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,743
You, of course.

374
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:55,223
My boyfriend is a tennis star.

375
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:56,263
A tennis star.

376
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:00,503
Do you really think I've changed?

377
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:02,543
You've gotten so much better

378
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:03,863
that I've started getting worried.

379
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:06,062
Actually, I feel the same way.

380
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:07,822
When I was looking at you
at the court today,

381
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,863
I was a little in a daze.

382
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,223
Don't be in a daze.

383
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,822
Why would you be in a daze?

384
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,783
What's wrong with you?

385
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,743
Don't fall out of love
with me, Ms. Liang!

386
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,143
I like you! I like you!

387
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,623
I like you!

388
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:42,143
What's wrong?

389
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:44,903
I don't know.

390
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:46,663
This just feels

391
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,623
so unreal.

392
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:51,583
How did you

393
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:53,783
just show up here like that?

394
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,823
Is this better?

395
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:13,903
Is there any place

396
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:14,863
you want to visit?

397
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:16,343
I'll go with you.

398
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:18,823
You're going back

399
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,423
after a few days.

400
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,343
How about this?

401
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,423
After the game,

402
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,503
I'll send you back first

403
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,463
before I go back.

404
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,103
It's okay.

405
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:42,303
I'm really screwed.

406
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:43,423
I'm in trouble.

407
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,303
What trouble?

408
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:47,383
You know,

409
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,463
I realized

410
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:50,983
that even if today was

411
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,143
the first time I met you,

412
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,343
I would still fall in love

413
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,263
with you.

414
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,863
Didn't you save all your annual leave?

415
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:45,503
When

416
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,583
the game season is over,

417
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:47,823
you can come and visit me.

418
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,783
I can take you

419
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,983
to try all kinds of cheese and ham

420
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,343
around my school.

421
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:55,183
The chili sauce I bought for you

422
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:56,423
hasn't arrived yet.

423
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:57,023
I haven't even put it

424
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,463
into your luggage.

425
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,503
And you're already leaving.

426
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:00,743
What should I do?

427
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:01,903
You're going back to eating

428
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:02,663
those stupid cheese.

429
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,263
It doesn't taste good at all.

430
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:04,823
All right now.

431
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,063
It's okay. Come.

432
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:07,383
Come here and give me a hug.

433
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,423
Cheese may taste a little bad,

434
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:12,943
but it...

435
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:14,383
It builds muscle,

436
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:14,703
right?

437
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,223
Did you say

438
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,383
you felt that I had grown taller?

439
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:20,503
You can go

440
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,583
to the airport by yourself later.

441
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:23,983
Call the cab yourself.

442
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,663
I don't want to go with you.

443
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,423
I don't want to cry in the airport.

444
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:30,543
Okay, okay.

445
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,223
You are not going.

446
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:33,863
At least tell me

447
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,743
where you hid my razor.

448
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:47,743
What else did you hide?

449
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:57,623
Is there anything else?

450
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:00,743
Take it, take it.

451
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,103
Take it all away.

452
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,943
Just go.

453
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:05,263
If I didn't give them to you,

454
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:05,863
if you couldn't leave today,

455
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:06,703
you would

456
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:07,783
still buy another ticket.

457
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:08,983
You still have to go back.

458
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:11,143
Being together with you,

459
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:12,463
I never thought

460
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:13,463
that one day

461
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:14,303
I would have the chance

462
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,703
to say that you are childish.

463
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,343
I'm childish? Fine.

464
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:23,303
You should go.

465
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:24,663
I mean it. You can go now.

466
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:25,463
There is no way

467
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,503
I will take you to the airport.

468
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,063
Okay.

469
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:32,863
(Someone here)

470
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,743
(kept saying)

471
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:35,983
(she wouldn't see me off.)

472
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,840
(Terminal 2)
(In the end)

473
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,263
(she still soaked my shirt
with her tears)

474
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,143
(in front of the airport.)

475
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:43,943
(Long distance love)

476
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,023
(is a little hard sometimes.)

477
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:48,703
(Looking at your sad face,)

478
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,903
(it really breaks my heart.)

479
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:57,103
When I come back next time,

480
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:00,703
let's not

481
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:01,343
separate again,

482
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:03,383
okay?

483
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,103
I have to go.

484
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:25,063
(By the time my plane takes off,)

485
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:26,663
(you're probably already)

486
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:27,783
(back home in Shenzhen.)

487
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,543
(And you will find)

488
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:31,143
(the little surprise I got you.)

489
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,703
(I wonder)

490
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:34,983
(if it can make you feel less sad.)

491
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:43,943
Eel-san?

492
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:47,103
Am I hallucinating things?

493
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:49,703
How...

494
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:51,703
Did you get it back for me?

495
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,903
Song Sanchuan did.

496
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:58,343
Hi, Miss. It's me again.

497
00:22:58,463 --> 00:22:59,263
Song Sanchuan.

498
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,263
I saw that Eel-san's information

499
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:02,583
was still on the website.

500
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:03,823
So I decided

501
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:05,143
to give it one last try.

502
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:05,663
So,

503
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,223
although I am now abroad,

504
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,503
my girlfriend still

505
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,343
lives in Shenzhen.

506
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:10,383
And,

507
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:11,463
in order to increase her

508
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:12,303
dog raising skills,

509
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:13,143
she even went

510
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,383
to work as a dog walker
for a while before.

511
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:16,983
She really has been waiting

512
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:17,983
for Eel-san all this time.

513
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:19,263
So if you can,

514
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:20,543
I would really like

515
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:22,223
to ask you

516
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:23,263
to please

517
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:24,303
entrust Eel-san to us.

518
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:25,823
When I get back,

519
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,143
we will take good care

520
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:28,343
of Eel-san together.

521
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:29,983
We definitely will

522
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:31,343
take responsibility for Eel-san.

523
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,823
Just trust Eel-san

524
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:33,783
with us!

525
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:35,623
Take care of your kids, Miss!

526
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,440
(Song Sanchuan)
(I've landed.)

527
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,983
I'm a little jealous,

528
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:57,703
but before I go back,

529
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,383
let it stay with you first.

530
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:02,703
Okay.

531
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:04,383
We're waiting for you to come home.

532
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:11,823
(Song Sanchuan,)

533
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,223
(without me realizing it,)

534
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,183
(the regrets in my life)

535
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:17,823
(have been made up one by one.)

536
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:19,943
(Tell me,)

537
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:21,303
(is it true that being in love)

538
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,103
(makes people childish?)

539
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,783
(Why do I feel that)

540
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:27,063
(everything around me,)

541
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:28,983
(be it people or things,)

542
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,743
(has become more interesting)

543
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,023
(and lovely?)

544
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,140
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

545
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,140
(Chen Ke)

546
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,143
Let's shake hands, Mr. Jiang.

547
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:08,303
Thank you.

548
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,623
Looking forward to our cooperation

549
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:14,103
In the past few months,

550
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,063
I've been researching.

551
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:15,983
I have also referred

552
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,423
to the tennis schools in Spain.

553
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,143
All the curriculum

554
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:21,103
and professional skills training

555
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:22,783
can be completed in our school

556
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:23,903
in one stop.

557
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:26,823
If this model can be successful,

558
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:27,583
I'm sure

559
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:29,503
we can nurture more children

560
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:30,903
for China's tennis.

561
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,623
All right. You've got
your retirement fund now.

562
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,463
What's next for you?

563
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:40,023
What's next for me?

564
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:42,303
I'll just do whatever I want.

565
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:44,263
I have such a good manager to make money

566
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:45,223
for me, anyway.

567
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,463
I have nothing to worry about.

(Top Smash Tennis Club)

569
00:25:56,143 --> 00:25:57,223
Get in the car first.

570
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:02,103
Chen Ke,

571
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:05,063
do you have time tomorrow?

572
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,103
Would you like to have lunch together?

573
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:08,543
I bought a ticket

574
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,423
to Jingdezhen tomorrow.

575
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:11,583
I'm staying there for a while.

576
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:13,503
Jingdezhen?

577
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:14,743
That's good.

578
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:16,223
Making pottery?

579
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:17,463
Yes.

580
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:18,423
A friend of mine

581
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:19,303
opened a workshop there.

582
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:20,743
He invited me there to check it out.

583
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:24,143
It's a guy?

584
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:27,143
My boyfriend.

585
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:31,103
That's good.

586
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,023
How old is he? Is he reliable?

587
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:36,943
He's okay.

588
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:38,903
He's two years younger than me.

589
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,383
We met at a pottery exhibition.

590
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:46,143
You met him at a pottery exhibition?

591
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:48,303
Do you know him well?

592
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:51,543
What is your address at Jingdezhen?

593
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:52,383
Give it to me.

594
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,863
You don't know the place.

595
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,503
What if he sells you
to human trafficker?

596
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:56,823
I don't think

597
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,703
there is a need to give you my address.

598
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:00,423
Fine.

599
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,263
I was being nosy.

600
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:05,343
Anyway, safety comes first.

601
00:27:05,343 --> 00:27:06,743
Don't be too naive.

602
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:08,463
If you need help,

603
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:10,383
just give me a call.

604
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:13,103
Or give Jiang Jiaojiao a call.

605
00:27:14,823 --> 00:27:15,463
I got it.

606
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:17,503
You too.

607
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:19,063
Take care of yourself.

608
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:22,223
Bye bye.

609
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:23,183
Bye bye.

610
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,583
Jiang Jiaojiao?

611
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:51,063
Jiang Jiaojiao!

612
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,103
What's wrong?

613
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,143
I've had enough with hotels.

614
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:55,143
Let's rent a place.

615
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:56,423
What? Had enough with hotels?

616
00:27:57,623 --> 00:27:59,183
I want to have a home with you now.

617
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,063
What does that mean?

618
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:06,063
You said before that it wasn't
cost-effective to rent a place.

619
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,183
You said staying in a hotel
was more convenient.

620
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:08,263
You didn't mean those things, did you?

621
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:11,223
Is this a trial marriage to you?

622
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:15,223
I was afraid that
you didn't think things through.

623
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,063
I was also afraid
that I would regret it.

624
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:18,783
Having a place together is a big deal.

625
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,503
We would move

626
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:20,903
your stuff and my stuff in there.

627
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:22,823
If things didn't work out for us,

628
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:23,743
we would have to move out.

629
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:25,383
Just thinking about it
breaks my heart.

630
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:33,983
I'm sorry.

631
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,663
I didn't think it through before.

632
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,103
I will apologize to you.

633
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:46,663
When my dad fell ill,

634
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,783
I watched you turn down so many matches.

635
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:51,263
You went with him for his treatment,
check-up and follow-up examination.

636
00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:53,223
And you helped us out a lot.

637
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:54,863
I don't know

638
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:55,583
if I could

639
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,783
have come this far without you.

640
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:00,343
I will never hesitate or hold back again

641
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:01,743
from now on.

642
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:08,783
I'm really mad at you.

643
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:12,663
Do you not trust me that much?

644
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,903
I trust you 100% now.

645
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,223
I'm scared to think about it now.

646
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,823
I'm glad I didn't do anything wrong.

647
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,703
Otherwise, I'd have no idea how I failed

648
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:27,463
my trial.

649
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:29,903
You want to rent a place, right?

650
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:30,663
Okay!

651
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:32,223
We will rent a place now.

652
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:34,903
Let's start a family for real now,

653
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:35,903
okay?

654
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:48,423
I heard that

655
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:50,983
the tennis school

656
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,263
is going to open next month.

657
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:54,503
Yes.

658
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:56,143
Are you happy?

659
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:58,503
The weather is great over there.

660
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,263
Do you want to go?

661
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,343
I'll pay for your ticket.

662
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,143
I can pay for my own ticket.

663
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:06,223
I say,

664
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:08,823
about Song Sanchuan,

665
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:09,903
if it was me,

666
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:11,983
I wouldn't have let him pass easily.

667
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:14,103
Da Li,

668
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,423
be more open-minded.

669
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:19,103
You just have to take advantage

670
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,023
of everything, don't you?

671
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:21,863
I suspect that

672
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:25,383
Liang You'an leaving
Young Space back then

673
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,543
was the first step of your plan.

674
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:29,663
Have you been scheming against me?

675
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:30,863
Look at you,

676
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,063
you look so petty-minded right now.

677
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:34,663
That's dark.

678
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:37,623
Something is odd though.

679
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:39,863
Those who have worked for me,

680
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:41,943
no matter where they go,

681
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:44,103
they are always
psychologically dependent on me.

682
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:45,583
Have you noticed it?

683
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,463
Those who have made it,

684
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:50,383
in the end, his achievement
isn't his connections or strength,

685
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:51,783
but his character.

686
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:53,063
Da Li,

687
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:54,903
try harder.

688
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:56,943
I say, Mr. Jiang,

689
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:58,303
can you be any more shameless?

690
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,943
It's about time.

691
00:31:02,263 --> 00:31:04,903
I have to check out
Jiaojiao's new house.

692
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:06,703
I mean,

693
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,383
my son is doing so well,
don't you think?

694
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,063
Not only is he a good tennis player,

695
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:11,143
he is also a married man now.

696
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:12,343
Doesn't it annoy you?

697
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,343
Hello.

698
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:20,983
Oh, honey.

699
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,503
What did you say?

700
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:25,903
Oh, Saturday?

701
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:28,103
Da Li, you're going too far.

702
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,383
We're having a family dinner
on Saturday?

703
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,263
I have to inform everyone
in the company about this.

704
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:33,903
I'm going to tell them

705
00:31:33,903 --> 00:31:35,183
that no matter what happens,

706
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:36,423
no one is allowed to disturb
our family dinner.

707
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:38,663
I'm going to kill you!

708
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,783
We will have family dinner everyday!

709
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:40,383
I'm going to kill you!

710
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:41,903
From Monday to Friday!

711
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:42,983
You're dead!

(Top Smash Tennis Club)

714
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:57,303
Morning,

715
00:31:57,343 --> 00:31:57,783
Chuan.

716
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,343
Chuan.

717
00:31:58,703 --> 00:32:00,823
When you win the first game in China,

718
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:01,943
I must get the title of honor.

719
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,423
For the sake of the sense of ceremony.

720
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:04,703
Very well said.

721
00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:06,663
You instantly made me
feel that nothing has changed.

722
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:08,183
You are still so pompous.

723
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:08,623
Things have changed.

724
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:09,983
Yi has got his third girlfriend now.

725
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:10,743
Really?

726
00:32:10,783 --> 00:32:11,943
Hola!

727
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:13,743
Amigo!

728
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:16,623
It's a good thing that
you came back two months early,

729
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:17,703
or you would have missed

730
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,983
the birth of my baby.

731
00:32:20,423 --> 00:32:21,223
Impressive.

732
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:22,703
Your photo did not hang on
the first spot for nothing.

733
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,880
(Top Smash Tennis Club ranking)
You're really fast.

734
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,463
It's just right. We've been
married for two years.

735
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:28,383
If we didn't have a child soon,
we would have gotten sick of this.

736
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:29,823
Did you just say

737
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:30,583
what's on your mind?

738
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:31,503
That's right.

739
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,143
We are bored with just the two of us.

740
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:34,623
It's time to raise the stake

741
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:35,543
and move to the next level.

742
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:36,743
Where is Mr. Yan?

743
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:37,983
How come I didn't see him?

744
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:38,783
Word of advice,

745
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:40,103
don't follow his speed.

00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,863
Luo Le is about to win the championship.

747
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:43,423
And he hasn't managed
to get Ms. Luo to say yes.

748
00:32:52,383 --> 00:32:53,943
Why did you drink mine?

749
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:56,783
I didn't check my luck today
before I left home.

750
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:57,983
I don't know
if it is appropriate to say this

751
00:32:57,983 --> 00:32:58,543
to you today.

752
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,743
But anyway, I've been wanting to
tell you this

753
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:00,343
for a long time.

754
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:01,423
It's not liquor you drank.

755
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:03,863
Don't talk nonsense.

756
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:06,343
I mean...

757
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:14,943
So, I...

758
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:19,823
Did you send

759
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,063
your car for service today?

760
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:21,463
May I

761
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:22,703
give you and your daughter
a ride home later?

762
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:51,783
I'll have one more sip.

763
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:53,823
Your sparkling water tastes better.

764
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:10,662
Look how great

765
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:12,463
this automatic door is.

766
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,543
Slowly, slowly. There is no hurry.

767
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:15,182
All right.

768
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:15,662
Listen,

769
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,023
I didn't turn up
the air-conditioning for you.

770
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:17,702
I was worried you would catch a cold.

771
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,863
It's a new car.

772
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,263
My son bought it for me.
What do you think of it?

773
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:21,583
The car is great.

774
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:23,023
It's just that we've been troubling you.

775
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,103
I'm embarrassed
that we've been troubling you

776
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,023
to take us to my chemo treatment.

777
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:26,903
This is nothing.

778
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:28,622
You guys also chatted with me
on the way here.

779
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:29,903
It's cool. It's okay.

780
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:30,983
I will still give you a ride tomorrow.

781
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,142
As for the time,

782
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:33,263
we'll talk about it
in the group chat tonight.

783
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,543
It's settled then.

784
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:35,743
Okay. Thanks, Mr. An.

785
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:36,702
No need for that.

786
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:37,863
We are neighbors.

787
00:34:37,983 --> 00:34:38,783
Thank you.

788
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:39,903
Okay.

789
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,543
This automatic door is so great.

790
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:48,783
Are you really not going
to close your wig store?

791
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,263
Let's keep it open.

792
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:52,903
It's nice.

793
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:55,463
So many shops

794
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:56,543
opened and closed

795
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:58,903
in our street.

796
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,463
Ours is the only shop
that lasts until now.

797
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:02,343
Leave it open.

798
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:04,383
Okay. We will leave it open then.

799
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:13,783
This is for you.

800
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:14,983
What is this?

801
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:17,143
I went on a dating site

802
00:35:17,143 --> 00:35:18,583
and got you a VIP membership card.

803
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,340
(VIP)

804
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,103
It's paid.

805
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:24,423
Hang on...

806
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:25,503
You know what I mean.

807
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:27,583
You're no longer young.

808
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:29,383
You can't waste any more time.

809
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:32,423
Why are you wasting money?

810
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,903
I'm fine on my own.

811
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:35,983
I'm serious.

812
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:38,063
They are all high quality

813

middle-aged women looking for a date.

814
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:40,903
They might not even
show interest in you.

815
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:45,303
It's been so many years.

816
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:47,423
Stop saving yourself for her.

817
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,983
All right. Let's buy you
some new clothes.

818
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:06,823
Let's go.

819
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:21,263
Get in.

820
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:24,343
I have somewhere else

821
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:25,263
to be after that.

822
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:29,143
Forget about the clothes.

823
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,460
(Top Love Tennis Club)

824
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,783
Song Sanchuan?

825
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:45,103
Song Sanchuan, I'm here.

826
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:50,503
Song Sanchuan, can you hear me?

827
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:51,343
Hello?

828
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,063
I'm here, Song Sanchuan.

829
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,743
Where are you?

830
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:03,423
Song Sanchuan?

831
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:04,663
Liang You'an.

832
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:06,423
Turn around.

inspirational quote about love?)

836
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:25,903
(I know.)

837
00:37:26,263 --> 00:37:28,743
(It is love that
makes better of who I am.)

838
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:31,263

Song Sanchuan?

844
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,823
That's a special name.

845
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:44,223
(Why would it change)

846
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,343
(just because of the appearance)

848
00:37:46,863 --> 00:37:47,783

850
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,103
but for the sake of the
2,000 yuan yesterday,

851
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,383
I'm returning the favor.

852
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,223
I don't like to owe people.

853
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:56,743

854
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,423

to make peace with myself)

856
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:02,063

Walk out with your head up.

858
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,023

I never had before.)

865
00:38:20,143 --> 00:38:21,143
and I get to stay in the team,

866
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:22,023

to become your backbone,

00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:29,943
That's right.

940
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:31,423
You are cautious.

941
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:32,583
I'm cautious.

942
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,263
You push ahead with courage.

943
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:35,063
I push ahead with courage.

944
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,223
You are reckless.

945
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:44,783
It's okay.

946
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,023
I need to see it.

947
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,543
Wait, wait. Don't go.

948
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:49,183
There is hair in your eyes.

949
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:49,703
Relax.

950
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:50,343
Let me get it out for you.

951
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:52,503
It's good. It's good.

952
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:54,703
Don't look at me like that.

953
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:55,423
You're making me

954
00:41:55,543 --> 00:41:57,303
stressed and nervous.

955
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:58,223
How about this? Wait here.

956
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,343
I figured out a way
that would be good for both of us.

957
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:08,143
Yes, this is much better.

958
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:09,423
We both feel safe this way.

959
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:10,663
It's a bit stuffy.

960
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:11,903
Let me adjust it for you.

961
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:12,703
It's fine.

962
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:13,783
Feeling better?

963
00:42:13,943 --> 00:42:14,423
Yes.

964
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:15,703
I'll start now.

965
00:42:18,543 --> 00:42:19,583
I don't know why,

966
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:20,343
but I can't catch my breath.

967
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:21,383
It's okay.

968
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:22,983
You will be able to catch your breath
when I'm done.

969
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,623
Really?

970
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:24,823
Really. Trust me.

971
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:26,143
How much longer?

972
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:27,463
Be patient.

973
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:28,423
I'm refining this.

974
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:29,423
We just started.

975
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:30,823
I want to see it.

976
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:32,263
I'm almost done.

977
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:32,863
Does it look good?

978
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:33,983
Is it pretty?

979
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:35,103
It looks great. It's super pretty.

980
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,383
Give me a minute. Almost done.

981
00:42:37,063 --> 00:42:37,783
How much longer?

982
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:38,703
15 seconds. 15 seconds.

983
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:39,703
- Almost done.
- I want to see it.

984
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:40,583
Just a few more cuts.

985
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,303
I can't wait anymore! No!

986
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,143
It's okay, babe.

987
00:42:47,223 --> 00:42:48,783
We will find you the best hairdresser.

988
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:50,023
He will make miracles.

989
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:50,823
Come, come.

990
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:52,103
I told you to stop.

991
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,303
It's my bad. It's all my fault.

992
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:54,423
Where's the sunglasses?

993
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:55,583
Here. Let's put it on.

994
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:56,303
Come.

995
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:58,023
Here you go.

996
00:42:58,223 --> 00:42:59,943
So, no one can recognize me now?

997
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:00,543
No one can, no one.

998
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,543
You're the prettiest girl, babe.

999
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:02,823
You're the prettiest girl.

1000
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:03,943
Let's go.

1001
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,623
Sometimes, we have frictions.

1002
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:07,943
Little frictions.

1003
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:10,623
Our life is still happy and wonderful
most of the time.

1004
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:12,663
We hope

1005
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:14,423
you can also embrace sweet love.
