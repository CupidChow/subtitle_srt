97

193
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,880
I'll set up a meeting with him.

194
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,640
(East China Pegasus Club)

195
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:16,040
(Ye's Private Kitchen)

196
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,320
Sir, your salt and pepper
nine-banded trevally.

197
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,400
Please enjoy.

198
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,960
Thanks.

199
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,280
What's that bird on the plate?

200
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,960
Bring these to the kitchen.

201
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

202
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,520
Is this the life that is

203
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
full of flavour and

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,400
excitement that you yearn for?

205
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
What are you trying to say?

206
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,360
It's impossible that you

207
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
want a divorce out of the blue.

208
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,920
Tell me,

209
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,240
how long have you known

210
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,200
this guy?

211
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,600
You told me earlier

212
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,720
you needed some time

213
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,400
to think things through.

214
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
So this is what you have been up to,

215
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,120
to investigate me.

216
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,120
Why are you so hypocritical?

217
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,520
Chen Ke,

218
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,800
I am reminding you that

219
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,400
this is considered infidelity.

220
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,200
If you insist on getting a divorce,

221
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,560
you have no advantage

222
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,080
in the division of property.

223
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,480
I thought

224
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,040
I knew you well enough,

225
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,560
but you have once again
exceeded my expectations.

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,160
Don't change the subject with me.

227
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,320
We were talking about this guy.

228
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
The family lunch on Saturday

229
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,840
is a total joke.

230
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,920
Just makes it easy
for you to go see others.

231
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Bet you hooked up with this fella

232
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,480
at the market.

233
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,320
Tell me,

234
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
how many of our lunch dishes

235
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,680
were learnt from him?

236
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
I even feel like throwing up now.

237
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Stop cracking your head.

238
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,880
In fact, you can't remember the taste

239
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,280
of the dishes that I cooked even.

240
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,960
What you said was delicious last week,

241
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
the braised sea cucumber,

242
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,720
I have been

243
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
making it for four weeks.

244
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,960
You got promoted that day,

245
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
so you probably were in the mood,

246
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,360
and your taste buds
were finally working.

247
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,440
You even asked me,

248
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
was that a new dish?

249
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,200
Right.

250
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,600
You must have learnt it from him.

251
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Do you ever

252
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
listen to others?

253
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Can you just stop

254
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,320
talking to yourself?

255
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
On top of that,

256
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,760
don't you bring up

257
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
the Saturday family lunch anymore.

258
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
It's just a day

259
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,240
where you engage in a

260
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,920
performance of having a happy family.

261
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,840
Every week, you'll post Moments

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,180
to curate your hypocritical image

263
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,760
as a family man.

264
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
I'd rather you didn't

265
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
care so much about appearance,

266
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,800
at least when we divorce,

267
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
you wouldn't label me

268
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
as someone ungrateful.

269
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,320
Also, I really hate

270
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,640
going to those

271
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,240
so-called family gatherings with you,

272
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,320
where you have to talk about nothing

273
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
with absolute strangers.

274
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
I hear them call me

275
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,320
Mrs. Jiang, Mrs. Jiang,

276
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,360
and they tell me

277
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
how I have landed a good husband

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,560
who is dedicated to his work

279
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,960
and to his family.

280
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,520
Dedicated to his family?

281
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
How funny.

282
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,120
So you then sought out a cook?

283
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,320
Aren't you funny?

284
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
Jiang Jie,

285
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
I'm solemnly telling you this.

286
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,360
One,

287
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,040
I didn't cheat on you.

288
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,320
Two,

289
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I am definitely

290
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,720
leaving this marriage.

291
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,920
Regarding the division of property,

292
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,280
I'm making readjustments.

293
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,920
Before that, I thought,

294
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,080
I just needed enough
to sustain a living.

295
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
After all, you worked hard to earn all these.

296
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,160
Not anymore.

297
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
I am going to be

298
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,200
that calculative with you.

299
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,200
That includes several of our properties

300
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,120
that we own due to my
good investment sense,

301
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,280
they will all be mine.

302
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
You'an.

303
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,880
You'an, you know,

304
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,760
it was difficult for me to

305
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,960
secure this spot on the campus.

306
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,880
No.

307
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,920
You wouldn't understand,

308
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,000
for this is where your home is.

309
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,400
You were born here,

310
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
you have a registered household.

311
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
Not for me.

312
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,440
I need this.

313
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,280
So you were saying that
the two years of

314
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,720
our romantic relationship

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
was all just a plot against you?

316
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,560
I don't expect you to

317
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,280
understand my situation.

318
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
I do understand.

319
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
We were both on a lifeboat,

320
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,320
and now that it's sinking,

321
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,960
without hesitation,

322
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,800
you pushed me out into the sea

323
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,000
and sailed away.

324
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,680
That's how it is, right?

325
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,320
I know,

326
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
I know that I owe you for this.

327
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,120
I am sad that you were expelled too.

328
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,680
However, I can't even help myself,

329
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
let alone help you.

330
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,440
A breakup reveals one's true character.

331
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,840
This saying is so right.

332
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
I can understand you
for being realistic,

333
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
but I can't accept that

334
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,640
as a man, you are so

335
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,040
cowardly and irresponsible.

336
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,680
I don't need your help at all.

337
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
From now on,

338
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
we have nothing to do with
each other anymore.

339
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Say,

340
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,360
it has been ten years
since we last saw each other.

341
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,760
You haven't changed much.

342
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,760
You have changed quite a bit.

343
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Fortunately you waved just now.

344
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,160
That can't be.

345
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,600
You can't even recognise me?

346
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,320
By the way, I heard from Luo Nian that

347
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,000
both of you were in a tennis club

348
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,120
that will be closed down soon.

349
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
So,

350
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
I wanted to

351
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
ask for your help

352
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,840
to take my players in

353
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,560
so that they can join the circuit tournament.

354
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,360
Let's not talk about that first.

355
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,480
We haven't seen each other for so long,

356
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,480
we should chat for a bit.

357
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
How are you?

358
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,920
Are you still single?

359
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,240
In fact, You'an,

360
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,440
all these years,

361
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,000
whenever there's a class reunion,

362
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,400
I will ask Luo Nian

363
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,200
how are you doing?

364
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,760
I want to know that you're well

365
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,400
and that puts me at ease.

366
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,440
I believe that.

367
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,160
So if you can

368
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
do me this favor,

369
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll be well,

370
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
and you will be at ease.

371
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
I see.

372
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,520
Thanks.

373
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,200
You're welcome.

374
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,000
You can leave my glass there.

375
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,400
Please enjoy.

376
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,440
Take in your players, right?

377
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,720
In fact, it's not difficult for me to

378
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,640
take them in.

379
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,700
Sorry that

380
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm late.

381
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,000
You'an, this is...

382
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Song Sanchuan,

383
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,920
a player of her club.

384
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Player.

385
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
I am the dean of the
Faculty of Economics and Management.

386
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,480
I am also

387
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,960
the manager of Pegasus,

388
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,720
Yang Kaiqi.

389
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm her boyfriend as well.

390
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,360
You two go on.

391
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm just here

392
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
to pick up my girlfriend.

393
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,400
Take in...

394
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,520
To take your players in,

395
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
I personally have no problem with that.

396
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,200
However, some of

397
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,040
my players may not be too happy about it.

398
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,560
What would they?

399
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,000
There is no registration limit
for the game.

400
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,480
Anyone capable can play.

401
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,560
We won't affect your team.

402
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
So this is the attitude of your players.

403
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,880
Yes.

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
He is quite frank.

405
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes.

406
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,760
But I think

407
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,680
he makes perfect sense.

408
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,840
You earn points too with more players,

409
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,360
so you have nothing to lose.

410
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,600
Right.

411
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,120
There's no limit on
the number of players,

412
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,120
but those kids, right,

413
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,800
they have a reputation to uphold.

414
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,920
After all, you'll be

415
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,080
competing under

416
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,080
the name of our club.

417
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Weak players affect our reputation.

418
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,360
If we think about it this way,

419
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
there's nothing in this

420
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,280
for our club.

421
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
Dean Yang.

422
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,400
Oh sorry,

423
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,280
you have yet to go through the
public announcement period,

424
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,680
so I've used this title too early.

425
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,080
Recently,

426
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,720
I've frequently dreamt about you.

427
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,080
What a coincidence.

428
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,400
I dreamt of

429
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,480
how you got me expelled from school.

430
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,080
People always say that dreams

431
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,680
are one's emotional baggage.

432
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,280
Maybe I have been bearing this

433
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,280
burden without given justice
for too long,

434
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
and I can't carry it anymore,

435
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,960
and it's time to talk about it.

436
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,880
Alright.

437
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't say that I'm
not giving you a chance.

438
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
Tomorrow at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

439
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,440
SSU tennis hall.

440
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,920
Your players, and mine.

441
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,360
We'll play one match.

442
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
Convince us,

443
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
and this will get settled.

444
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,560
Sure.

445
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
Tomorrow, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, right?

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,600
Right.

447
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,600
You just wait.

448
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,280
You can get a car from...

449
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
How far are you two apart?

450
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,360
Ten years.

451
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,000
Ten...

452
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,680
Ten years.

453
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,280
It's been ten years,

454
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
her taste still hasn't changed.

455
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,120
Song Sanchuan.

456
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,360
Song Sanchuan!

457
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Stop right there.

458
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,040
I haven't even started on

459
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,560
your rotten trick of
saying you're my boyfriend,

460
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
yet you dare to be angry.

461
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,800
Liang You'an,

462
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,040
if I didn't ask Ms. Luo about it,

463
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,920
I will never know that

464
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
you're asking him for this favour.

465
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,160
Out of all the clubs,

466
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,480
why do you have to

467
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
ask your horrid ex-boyfriend?

468
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,280
Don't I know

469
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,360
the number of clubs out there?

470
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,720
I just figured that he felt guilty,

471
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
so I wanted to give him a chance

472
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,600
to get it off his chest.

473
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,760
Then why,

474
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,000
why are you putting on

475
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
such pretty makeup?

476
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,440
And your clothes,

477
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,320
you better button it up.

478
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
You better put that collar down.

479
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,360
Today,

480
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
I did spend a long time
putting on makeup.

481
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,680
You won't know this,

482
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,640
but all these while,

483
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
I've only put on good makeup twice.

484
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,080
Once at a funeral,

485
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,240
once to meet with my ex-boyfriend.

486
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,720
Let me tell you,

487
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,400
you have really bad taste in men.

488
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
Liang You'an,

489
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,600
that guy over there,

490
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
you've spent so much time
brooding over him

491
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,080
and even left the country for him.

492
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,400
If I had known you then,

493
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,560
I would've stopped you
doing that at all costs.

494
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,080
If you knew me back then,

495
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,880
you'd still be in primary school.

496
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,280
I can't even see you
from my level of vision.

497
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
I have to look down and search around

498
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,760
saying,

499
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,000
who is looking for me?

500
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
Whose child is this?

501
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,960
You'd just be at knee height.

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,640
That won't happen.

503
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,520
I was born tall.

504
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:05,920
Let me tell you,

505
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
I was already at knee height
when I was born.

506
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,840
Let's go.

507
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,640
Let's go.

508
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,240
Are you confident about tomorrow's battle?

509
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,280
You don't have to bother.

510
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,200
It's a battle between us men.

511
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,920
Don't get involved.

512
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't want to get blood all over you.

513
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,400
How childish.

514
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,200
Did you see him?

515
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,000
I saw him.

516
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,760
What does he look like?

517
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,160
Looks like he deserves a whopping.

518
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
Then do it.

519
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Do it.

520
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Tomorrow, no matter what,

521
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,360
we must take them down.

522
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,160
They are the university team,

523
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,120
and among the top ones too.

524
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,280
Can we do it?

525
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,240
What are you afraid of?

526
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,120
We'll just use

527
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
the Tian Ji horse-racing strategy

528
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,840
and give it a go,

529
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,560
then we should stand a chance.

530
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,520
If so,

531
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,240
hand the best to me.

532
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
I'll promise to get you a point.

533
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,480
No.

534
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,160
For your level,

535
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,600
say,

536
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
you should go against someone decent.

537
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
You're not wrong.

538
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,600
The essence of Tian Ji's strategy

539
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
lies in using the weakest

540
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,480
to face the strongest opponent.

541
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,560
I won't be shy now bros,

542
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
I'll eliminate their strongest for you.

543
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,280
There's no pressure on me,

544
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,680
and who knows, there might be miracles.

545
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,280
I'll follow your plans.

546
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,640
I'll be sure to accomplish my task.

547
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay.

548
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,680
Let's now talk about

549
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,360
who gets who.

550
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,320
Chuan,

551
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,760
bring us the player profiles,

552
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
so that we can have a look.

553
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,280
Their profiles...

554
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,080
I don't have.

555
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,080
What did you say?

556
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,040
I don't know them.

557
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
You have nothing and we spent our time

558
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,800
planning for nothing?

559
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,560
Let's have popsicles. My treat.

560
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,480
Talk about Tian Ji and horse racing.

561
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,200
Bring me some spicy strips.

562
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
You have no idea who the enemy is even.

563
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,800
I didn't think this through.

564
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,600
Why didn't I ask for any information?

565
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,740
(Convenience store)

566
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,720
Boss, we'll take these.

567
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,120
What else?

568
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,320
Boss, some popsicles.

569
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
These kids...

570
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
There's no water.
[* Sounds like ridiculous.]

571
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,800
What's with the rackets?

572
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,240
Thought you wanted a match?

573
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,320
I said to play a match,

574
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
but I didn't specify what.

575
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm not afraid of playing anything.

576
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,240
Good.

577
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,560
Let's take the difficulty
up a notch today.

578
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,520
At this tennis hall, we'll play

579
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,800
football, volleyball-style.

580
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,000
The rules are simple.

581
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,240
The ball cannot go out of bounds,

582
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,440
it can't touch the ground.

583
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,320
Whichever team gets 11 points first

584
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,440
will win.

585
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
Beat us,

586
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,680
and you can join our team to play.

587
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,920
Can you play football?

588
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Junior high school.

589
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,960
School team.

590
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,160
Substitute player.

591
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,240
I've only played in
one street football game.

592
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,640
How can we compete against them?

593
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,040
Why?

594
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Are you scared?

595
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,120
You can leave if you are.

596
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,040
We'll do it.

597
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,360
We don't even know

598
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,000
what 'scared' means.

599
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,640
You've been an adult
for just three days.

600
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,920
That's a little too arrogant.

601
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,320
I know my stuff. Give me the ball.

602
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
Leave it all to me.

603
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,800
Okay.

604
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,160
Come.

605
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
Come.

606
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Dai Yi,

607
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
you were on the school team before?

608
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,760
No.

609
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,520
I played at the youth activity centre.

610
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,760
Great.

611
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,000
It's okay, it's okay.

612
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,640
Bro.

613
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Are you okay?

614
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,280
I'm fine.

615
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,840
Football's pretty easy.

616
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Attack the backcourt.

617
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,280
Alright.

618
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,760
- Bro!
- Bro.

619
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,520
Are you alright?

620
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,920
I'm fine.

621
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,560
Come here, come.

622
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,160
We can't play like this.

623
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,960
We're too disorganized.

624
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Now, Dai Yi,

625
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
you have good footwork.

626
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,040
Double Jiao, you are physically strong.

627
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
Can you two take the frontcourt?

628
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,160
No problem.

629
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,640
Sure.

630
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,160
Assess and judge
the ball's landing spot.

631
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,440
Do a volley whenever you can.

632
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,360
Chen Zhe,

633
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,400
we'll stay in the backcourt.

634
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,880
We'll attack from a distance

635
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,920
and support the frontcourt.

636
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,960
Most importantly, we work together.

637
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,200
Tennis is all about

638
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,760
facing the battle alone.

639
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
Today we are together,

640
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,880
we'll battle as a team.

641
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,160
Come, come, come.

642
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,680
Come, come.

643
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,800
Let's go!

644
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,760
Don't slack off there!

645
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,200
Didn't you see that?

646
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,920
I still feel a little uneasy.

647
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,760
I'd better go and take a look.

648
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,520
I'm almost there.

649
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Talk to you later.

650
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,880
Bye.

651
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,000
Come on!

652
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,640
Come on!

653
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,800
Pay attention to our defense!

654
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,680
Dai Yi.

655
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,880
Go back into defense!

656
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,040
Hit them with a lob shot!

657
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,840
Don't get happy too soon.

658
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,120
Why?

659
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,480
Not accepting defeat?

660
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,480
What else is there?

661
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,720
I'm...

662
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,840
a man of my word.

663
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
First of all, congratulations.

664
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,120
You've won the game.

665
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,880
You can join Pegasus and play.

666
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,240
However,

667
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,280
every club

668
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
has its own customs.

669
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,880
When you join Pegasus,

670
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,040
there is this welcoming ceremony.

671
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,600
This bottle.

672
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,520
Finish it,

673
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,720
and you can then

674
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,840
play under Pegasus's name.

675
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,080
Why?

676
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,760
Are you scared?

677
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,560
You don't have to drink if you are.

678
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,600
You can just go.

679
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,600
We'll drink. Nothing to be afraid of.

680
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
(Dai Yi)
I'm 18 now.

681
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,280
This would be my day.

682
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
A welcoming ceremony, huh?

683
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
Since Mr. Yang is so eager,

684
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,040
we have no reason to refuse.

685
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,460
Right.

686
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,840
Jiao,

687
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,560
that's enough.

688
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,360
Stop pouring.

689
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,000
Come.

690
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
Give me the rest.

691
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,160
Coincidentally,

692
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,600
I've not been drinking much.

693
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,600
I'm in a great condition to drink.

694
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Great.

695
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,040
Let's see

696
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
how eager our new members

697
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,040
are to join us.

698
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,480
Come, come, come.

699
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,240
Come.

700
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,920
Cheers.

701
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,800
What's this all about?

702
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,680
Ms. You'an.

703
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,960
What are you guys doing?

704
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,640
Ms. You'an.

705
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,640
We played a match with them and

706
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,280
we won.

707
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,240
We can play in the tournament now.

708
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,720
(Hong Feng dry red wine)

709
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,760
What about the wine then?

710
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,360
It's the welcoming ceremony.

711
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,920
Yang Kaiqi,

712
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,400
why are you doing this?

713
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,880
It's been ten years and

714
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,360
you're still playing dirty tricks.

715
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,560
If you don't want my players
joining your club,

716
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,960
you could've just told us.

717
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,120
What's up with all this nonsense?

718
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,320
You'an,

719
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,040
each club

720
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,040
has its own customs.

721
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,760
Customs?

722
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,520
Come.

723
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,800
Come.

724
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,600
Ms. You'an.

725
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,120
Fill my glass.

726
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,440
Fill it all the way up.

727
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
The customs of our club are

728
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,200
we go through thick and thin together.

729
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,880
Yang Kaiqi,

730
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,040
I hope that this time

731
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,320
you can really become

732
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,680
a man of your word.

733
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,440
Let's leave.

734
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,920
To be honest,

735
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,400
your wine is substandard.

736
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,600
Get a better one next time.

737
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,840
Don't forget your bags.

738
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,360
I can't.

739
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,920
I need the toilet. I'm bursting.

740
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,400
Careful.

741
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Wait for me.

742
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,560
Careful.

743
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,120
Where's the toilet?

744
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,080
Up front, up front.

745
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,160
This jerk Yang Kaiqi

746
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,040
stooped so low to play this trick.

747
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,720
He was making things difficult
for you

748
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,400
and you all fell for it.

749
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,280
We wanted to avenge you.

750
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,720
You missed it.

751
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,680
Our last ball

752
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,160
hit him right in the face.

753
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,440
It felt so satisfying.

754
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,360
Avenge me?

755
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,520
Do I seem like I needed you kids

756
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,640
to avenge me?

757
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,480
You could kill yourselves drinking that.

758
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,780
What would I do

759
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,080
if something goes wrong?

760
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,280
I wanted you to leave winning.

761
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,000
You told me last time that

762
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,760
you had to leave because you lost.

763
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,560
I thought about it for today that

764
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
I'm going to win

765
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,200
so you can leave with
your head held high

767
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,280
What are you doing?

768
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,640
Did you bring your lipstick?

769
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,840
Let me use it.

770
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,600

00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,560
Well,

808
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,760
last night,

809
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,480
that couldn't be your first, right?

810
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,240
I think my learning capabilities are

811
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,280
pretty strong.

812
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,360
I have to say,

813
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,480
I was too impulsive.

814
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,920
I let myself go.

815
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,960
I don't have to be responsible for this, I think.

816
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,400
Are you trying to say,

817
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,800
what happened between us yesterday,

818
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,960
meant nothing?

819
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,520
Is that so?

820
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
Yes, that's it.

822
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,080
your understanding is right.

823
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,920
You are quite mature.

824
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,560
It's like we went to a bar,

825
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,120
and two people got drinking,

826
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:07,960
they were happy, this normally happens.

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,960
Liang You'an,

828
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,880
do you really

829
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,800
have no feelings for me at all?

830
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You are wrong then.

831
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,240
I'm not that mature.

832
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
Since the club disbanded,

833
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,680
I'm out of this.

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,120
