Mr. Jin Yi!

23
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:50,861
You lost the match.

24
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,181
Do you have anything to say about that?

25
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,861
Actually, during my previous
training sessions,

26
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,541
I realized that I kept skidding

27
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,301
and almost sprained my feet.

28
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,061
However, I neglected it.

29
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:04,941
But today, I can confirm this.

30
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,861
This only happened

31
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,541
after I started

32
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,901
wearing

33
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:11,541
Young Space's sports shoes.

34
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,941
I regret that I chose
to be the spokesperson

35
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,701
of Young Space, which designed

36
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:17,381
flawed shoes like these.

37
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,501
This video

38
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,461
has been spreading

39
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,380
like wildfire

40
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,301
among our peers.

41
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,741
Now, the media

42
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,500
is waiting for our explanation.

43
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,021
Is there an issue

44
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,701
with the sports shoes or not?

45
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,941
Mr. Jiang, your department was the one

46
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,501
that chose Jin Yi as our spokesperson,

47
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,061
right?

48
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:36,461
Yes.

49
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:37,941
That's right.

50
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,701
But this should be an accident.

51
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,181
If so, why is he raising doubts

52
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,461
about our product in public then?

53
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,061
Didn't you guys monitor him?

54
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:47,741
Mr. Gao,

55
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:48,661
right now,

56
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,101
we've already told
the technical department

57
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:51,381
to come up with a test report.

58
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,581
If the sports shoes are the issue here,

59
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,141
the sales department
and technical department

60
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:56,061
won't shirk our responsibilities.

61
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:57,501
However,

62
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:01,301
if the athlete is trying to use us
as his scapegoat,

63
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,581
Mr. Jiang,

64
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:03,541
I assume

65
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,061
you have to take full responsibility
for this issue.

66
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,341
No matter if it's an issue with
the sports shoes

67
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,621
or the athlete,

68
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,941
we have to give them
an explanation by today.

69
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:17,301
Come in.

70
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:19,821
Leaders,

71
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:20,701
this is the test report

72
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:21,581
I just received.

73
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,540
(Test Report)

74
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,061
There's no issue

75
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:33,421
with the sports shoes' design.

76
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:35,621
And, there aren't any issues

77
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,741
or flaws with

78
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:37,621
the current batch too.

79
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,381
Therefore, it's not an issue

80
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,701
with our products.

81
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,421
Through my observation

82
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,821
and understanding of Jin Yi,

83
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,021
I definitely believe

84
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,421
that he said so today

85
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:57,901
in order to find an excuse

86
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:58,901
for his loss.

87
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,381
These are the things
that Jin Yi had done

88
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:03,061
prior to our signing.

89
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,020
(Jin Yi was suspected of
practicing violence)

90
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,780
(Clash of words between Jin Yi
and his opponent)

91
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,021
Regarding the choices I made

92
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,221
for this project and
the potential spokesperson,

93
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,861
I pushed the blame

94
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,021
to Mr. Jie of my own initiatives.

95
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,461
Regarding the negative influence

96
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:29,141
received by the company
due to my negligence,

97
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,821
I'm willing to shoulder
all of the responsibility

98
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:34,781
and resign from my job.

99
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:50,301
Liang You'an,

100
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:52,181
I was the one

101
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,101
who taught you everything.

102
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:54,941
Since when did I teach you

103
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,301
to betray your maker?

104
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,901
You want to resign? You want to leave?

105
00:06:58,901 --> 00:06:59,781
I'm fine with that.

106
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:02,421
But why are you dragging
the entire marketing department

107
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,341
down with you?

108
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,101
Gao Teng brought us into

109
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,101
Young Space three years ago.

110
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,901
I thought we were going
to turn the tides.

111
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:11,061
I thought it was time

112
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,501
for us to shine.

113
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,461
But now,

114
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,301
everything seemed like a joke.

115
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,861
I don't care who betrays me

116
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,381
in Young Space.

117
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,341
Everyone but you.

118
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,421
I treat you

119
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,981
as my closest comrade.

120
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,701
You're the person I trust the most.

121
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,941
Why did you

122
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,901
stab me in the back?

123
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,381
I'm heartbroken, you know?

124
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,181
Why?

125
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,261
Give me a reason.

126
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,021
Speak!

127
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,261
Do you have nothing to say?

128
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,261
No, I don't.

129
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:06,901
Regarding

130
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,501
the statement we need to
remove Jin Yi's negative influence,

131
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,061
I've already sent it to...

132
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,821
Who do you think you are?

133
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,421
Remove negative influence?

134
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:15,981
Do you think the marketing department
can't function without you?

135
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,781
You're the negative influence here!

136
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:18,501
You know that?

137
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,421
Once you leave,

138
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:21,261
there'll be no negative influence here!

139
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,700
Pack your things and get out!

140
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,460
Get out!

141
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,061
I've already

142
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,140
sent the email password to you guys.

143
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,701
Regarding the rest of my work,

144
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:41,821
I'll do a handover

145
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,941
after I finish organizing them.

146
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,341
Ms. You'an.

147
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,020
Nobody helps her!

148
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,181
If you're that free,

149
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,181
you should leave together with her!

150
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,261
Liang You'an,

151
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,021
check closely.

152
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,301
Only take what belongs to you.

153
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,301
Do not take anything

154
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:02,501
that belongs to the company!

155

(Innovative Solution of The Year)
(Top Employee, Liang You'an)

156
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:16,181
(Manager's Office)
That's fine.

157
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,261
I'll pack my things and leave right now.

158
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:19,701
I won't

159
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,021
even take a single paper
from the company.

160
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,661
Mr. Jiang is pretty hot-blooded,
isn't he?

161
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:23,421
No one in the company

162
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:25,381
dares to overturn Mr. Gao's decision.

163
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,741
After all, he belongs to the Gao family.

164
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,861
Does he really think

165
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,541
that he can bring about a major change
together with us?

166
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:31,741
But I do think

167
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,141
the proposals he brought up

168
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,861
are effective and correct.

169
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,421
But he's affecting Mr. Gao's interests.

170
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,301
Now, he lost the fight.

171
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:38,901
He has been transferred
to a second-tier company.

172
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:39,981
He's demoted.

173
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:40,821
I know the rules.

174
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,021
I don't need you to remind me.

175
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,181
Leave!

176
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,141
I just want to ask you guys something.

177
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:51,581
Is there anyone in
the marketing department

who agrees

179
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,261
with what I'd done?

180
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:56,301
Is anyone willing to leave with me?

181
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,221
Mr. Jiang,

182
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,901
I'm willing to leave with you.

183
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:57,541
Give it to me.

184
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,101

to his every will,

00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:01,541
including you faking your injury,

375
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:03,661
it's not that karma doesn't exist.

376
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,781
It's just that it isn't time yet.

377
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,781
Who are you trying to trick?

378
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,661
Song Sanchuan, listen up.

379
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:13,821
You better stay away

380
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:14,781
from the badminton team in the future!

381
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,421
This

382
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,141
isn't over yet!

383
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:18,781
Sure. I was waiting for you to say that.

384
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,741
You still wish to play badminton, right?

385
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,541
Anyway, I'm a jobless person

386
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,141
right now.

387
00:24:23,141 --> 00:24:24,341
I'll come and visit you

388
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:25,461
whenever I'm in a bad mood.

389
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,781
I'll see how you can

390
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:28,821
deal with me.

391
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,901
You're a mad dog!

392
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:34,221
I'm glad you know that.

393
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,101
I'm a mad dog.

394
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,381
I won't let go after I bite.

395
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,141
By the way,

396
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,341
regarding Jiang Chenglin,

397
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:39,981
if you dare

398
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,141
to make things difficult for him,

399
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,621
I'll visit you every day.

400
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,021
Initially, I thought
you'd returned to normal.

401
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:18,621
I didn't expect you
to leave the team anyway.

402
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:20,181
Take this.

403
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:24,501
The manager of this club

404
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,741
is my buddy.

405
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:27,581
If you play for him,

406
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,261
you'll get a good wage.

407
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,061
You've been performing well

408
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:35,221
lately.

409
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,061
Remember, calm your mind.

410
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,341
You'll achieve great results
in the future.

411
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,981
I've been playing badminton
for so many years.

412
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,661
But I had never watched the court

413
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:51,701
from this angle.

414
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,141
So, the court

415
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:55,021
is actually tiny.

416
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:56,981
The court feels enormous

417
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:58,061
when I'm stepping on it.

418
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:01,341
Two players vying for one shuttlecock.

419
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,821
Even half a court was hard enough
for us to defend it.

420
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:05,621
Rushing from the back to the front

421
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,661
felt like crossing the Pacific Ocean.

422
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:12,101
That's why those who never
step onto the court

423
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:15,141
will never understand

424
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,381
why we work so hard.

425
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,261
Yu,

426
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:22,581
thank you

427
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,021
for bringing me into the team.

428
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:31,621
I won't take your recommendation letter.

429
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:33,621
I wish to try something new.

430
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,541
I want to see if I can survive elsewhere

431
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:37,501
outside of the court.

432
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,301
What do you mean by that?

433
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,341
Are you quitting sports?

434
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,141
I have to give it a try somehow.

435
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:46,821
Maybe

436
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,461
I was a chef

437
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:49,581
that was hindered by
my badminton career.

438
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:51,581
From holding a racket
to holding a ladle,

439
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,861
that sounds pretty good to me.

440
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:54,501
See you.

441
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:25,621
(Liang You'an, what about some wontons?)

442
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:37,261
(Liang You'an, I retired from the team.)

443
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:48,941
(Getting rid of my burden,
time to travel light.)

444
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:03,581
What's wrong with you?

445
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:04,661
Are you sick?

446
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,941
(I need to go for
a minor surgery tomorrow.)

447
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:10,861
(It's nothing major.)

448
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:14,421
Which hospital are you staying?

449
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:23,141
(I don't mean anything else.)

450
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:24,981
(If it's convenient,)

451
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:26,981
(I would like to visit you.)

452
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,741
(The hospital in front of your house.)

453
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:38,341
Wait.

454
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,701
You mean the oncology hospital?

455
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,341
You said it was nothing major?

456
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,741
You're staying in an oncology hospital,
you know?

457
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,341
(You mean the oncology hospital?)

458
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:47,781
(You said it was nothing major?)

459
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:49,141
(You're staying in an oncology hospital,
you know?)

460
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:52,541
(It's benign.)

461
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:53,781
(I'll be discharged soon.)

462
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,541
(Don't worry.)

463
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,221
If you could

464
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,181
chat with me

465
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:03,341
like how you chat
with your online friends,

466
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,941
we wouldn't need to
stay quiet all the time.

467
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,181
I was just replying
to my friend's texts.

468
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,461
You don't need to be that sentimental.

469
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:13,301
Is it your boyfriend?

470
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:15,781
It's a male friend.

471
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,901
Have you made up your mind?

472
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:26,301
Are you sure you want to
go for the surgery?

473
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,221
What if

474
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:28,861
there are side effects,

475
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:30,101
just like what the doctor had said?

476
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,061
There's a certain risk to it.

477
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:33,701
What if you cannot
get pregnant in the future?

478
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:34,421
What should we do then?

479
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:37,781
Didn't you keep telling me

480
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:38,461
not to have

481
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:39,781
a child?

482
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:41,581
If I can't get pregnant,

483
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,981
doesn't that give us peace of mind?

484
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:43,741
Stop spouting nonsense.

485
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:45,701
Not giving birth and cannot give birth

486
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,981
are two different things.

487
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:49,661
What if, one day,

488
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:51,461
you meet someone

489
00:29:51,781 --> 00:29:53,781
who's perfect for you?

490
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:54,981
And,

491
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:56,381
you just need a kid

492
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:57,581
to complete your life.

493
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:58,621
You...

494
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,661
What will you do by then?

495
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:04,301
What kind of viewpoint was that?

496
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:05,981
Many people nowadays

497
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:07,261
don't want to have children.

498
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:09,461
What's wrong with that? Does that mean
we're one class lower than the others?

499
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,181
That's not it.

500
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,941
However, people will gossip about you

501
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,501
if you cannot give birth.

502
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:16,621
I don't want anyone else

503
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:17,781
to dislike my daughter.

504
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:18,781
Fine.

505
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:20,421
I understand what
you're trying to get here.

506
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:21,941
What should we do then?

507
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,221
Let's get changed

508
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:24,901
and head back home then.

509
00:30:24,901 --> 00:30:26,021
Forget about the surgery.

510
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:27,461
Just leave it to fate then.

511
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:28,301
That hurts!

512
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,941
We have to listen to the doctor.

513
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:33,301
I don't know what's your condition.

514
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:34,821
And, I don't know what to do.

515
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,701
That's why I'm hesitating.

516
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:48,421
I know my condition.

517
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:51,781
Right now,

518
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,141
I just want to remove

519
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:54,821
the bad thing inside my body.

520
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,301
As for

521
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:58,821
the perfect person you'd said,

522
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:01,061
I don't know when he'll appear.

523
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:03,701
That's why I'm not willing to bet on

524
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,421
this uncertainty

525
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:07,381
with another uncertainty.

526
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:09,221
Besides,

527
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,341
if I do encounter someone like him,

528
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:14,061
and he dislikes me

529
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:15,021
because I cannot give birth,

530
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:16,501
I don't think

531
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,781
he's perfect for me then.

532
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,301
As a woman,

533
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,141
giving birth shouldn't be
the only reason

534
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:24,381
he's loving me.

535
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:27,701
Fine.

536
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,821
Since you've made up your mind,

537
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:32,981
I won't say much.

538
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:55,781
What are you doing?

539
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:57,741
You've been standing there
the entire day.

540
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,061
Are you on guard duty?

541
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,981
Do you know any gynecologists

542
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:04,301
from the hospital in front of our house?

543
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:06,701
What's wrong?

544
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,021
Which girl did you harm again?

545
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,501
What do you mean by again?

546
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:10,901
What's wrong then?

547
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:13,261
Liang You'an

548
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,621
is going through surgery
in that hospital right now.

549
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:17,501
What's wrong with her?

550
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:18,701
I don't know either.

551
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,381
She said it was a minor surgery,

552
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:21,181
but I don't know

553
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:22,061
the details.

554
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:23,501
Minor surgery?

555
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,181
If so, she should be fine then.

556
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,941
Is complete anesthesia required
for minor surgery?

557
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:31,661
If that's the case,

558
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,701
doesn't it mean that it's kind of risky?

559
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,221
There must be
complications to it, right?

560
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,141
Minor surgery?

561
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,901
Complete anesthesia
might damage the brain

562
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:40,861
and cause one to lose their memories.

563
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:41,741
Really?

564
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,621
Especially their recent memories.

565
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:48,141
It's likely that she won't

566
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:48,981
remember who you are.

567
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,621
You must be kidding me.

568
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:58,101
Seems like some things damage the brain

569
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,701
more than complete anesthesia.

570
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:02,381
That's not what I mean.

571
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,821
She has helped me out a lot.

572
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:08,941
Now, she's sick and hospitalized.

573
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,941
Even if she's just an ordinary friend,

574
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:13,101
I should show some concern for her.

575
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:15,061
Yeah, yeah.

576
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:17,141
You have to show some concern.

577
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:19,061
You have to stand here

578
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:20,341
for at least 24 hours.

579
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:21,821
And, you better don't move.

580
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,501
It's best if you pray too.

581
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,060
(Nangang Oncology Hospital)

582
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,461
Her surgery

583
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:00,861
was quite successful.

584
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:02,301
The tumor was removed successfully.

585
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,221
However, the cyst

586
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,461
was larger

587
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,261
than we predicted.

588
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,341
The affected tissues

589
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,261
occupy a large area too.

590
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:09,581
It might affect her chances

591
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,101
of getting pregnant in the future.

592
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:12,861
But you don't need to worry.

593
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,341
She's still young.

594
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:15,501
As long as she rests

595
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:16,381
and recuperates well,

596
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:18,220
anything is possible.

597
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,061
What do we need

598
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:20,461
to take note of for the next few days?

599
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:21,700
The first two days

600
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,861
will be tough on her.

601
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,461
However,

602
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,101
you need to tell her to leave the bed

603
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:26,021
and walk around.

604
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:27,021
This way, it can accelerate

605
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,301
her recovery.

606
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:30,180
Thank you, doctor.

607
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,901
Don't mention it.

608
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:50,781
It must be painful.

609
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,101
No, I'm just hungry.

610
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,021
It's not time yet.

611
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:57,021
Bear with it a little longer.

612
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,661
Do you want to scroll your phone

613
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:07,781
and distract yourself from your hunger?

614
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:08,901
Go ahead.

(Song Sanchuan)
(Have you entered the surgical theater?)

616
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,341
(Was the surgery successful?)

617
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:21,421
(Are you awake?)

618
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:23,581
(I can visit you just by
crossing the road.)

619
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,701
(When are you free?)

620
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:34,261
Is it hurting again?

621
00:35:45,461 --> 00:35:46,821
Don't do that.

622
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:48,421
I'm fine.

623
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:50,421
Here.

624
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:55,341
Help me reply to his text.

625
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:59,381
This way, you won't overthink things.

626
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:00,221
That's not true.

627
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:01,981
I'll speak. You'll type.

628
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,341
What should I type?

629
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:06,141
Write this.

630
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:09,261
The surgery was successful.

631
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:12,261
I feel terrible these few days.

632
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:14,421
You can visit me

633
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,261
when I feel better.

634
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,741
I'll read his text for you.

Boss

637
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:26,701
had a terrible time in the meeting.

638
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:29,461
Yoyo and I are having a rough time.

639
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:30,541
Ms. You'an,

640
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,181
we miss you so much.

641
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:35,661
What is he saying?

642
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:36,821
Who is this?

643
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:50,701
What are you filming?

644
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,101
Bottled peach?

645
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,701
Which era are you from?

646
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:00,021
You actually bought
something like that to visit me?

647
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:01,221
An Cong said

648
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,421
I shouldn't visit people empty-handed.

649
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,061
That's why I...

650
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:08,341
Thank you.

651
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:18,941
Thank you.

652
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:20,941
You didn't get any on your shirt, right?

653
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:21,901
Nope.

654
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:25,621
Delicious.

655
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,261
Have you tried this before?

656
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:32,221
We do have an age gap indeed.

657
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:34,621
Try it.

658
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:35,981
Come.

659
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,021
So...

660
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,541
It's so sweet.

661
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:50,461
Is this artificial sweetener?

662
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:52,261
Nope.

663
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:53,541
It's all-natural.

664
00:37:58,581 --> 00:37:59,941
Judging from your expression,

665
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:01,381
I think you're doing pretty well.

666
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:02,621
The doctor was amazing.

667
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,021
I can be discharged tomorrow.

668
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,181
What time? I'll pick you up.

669
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:07,821
No need.

670
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:09,541
My family has
arranged everything for me.

671
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:17,221
By the way,

672
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,781
how did the competition go?

673
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,421
It was pretty good.

674
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,501
It went pretty smoothly.

675
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:22,581
Great.

676
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,261
Do you feel much better

677
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:26,621
after overcoming that trauma?

678
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:28,541
I assume you can
perform well in the future.

679
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:32,461
Liang You'an.

680
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:39,461
You're no longer
working for Young Space.

681
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:42,861
Does that mean

682
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,021
we have no chance
to see each other again?

683
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,301
I don't think
we'll see each other again.

684
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:10,421
I can call Mingyu if you wish

685
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,781
to sign a contract with Young Space.

686
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,781
No need for that.

687
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:20,221
I was able to win that match

688
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,261
only because you were standing
in front of the scoring board.

689
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,501
Does that mean I need

690
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,261
to find someone to stand there

691
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:30,421
during every match I play?

692
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,461
The trauma

693
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:34,501
no longer matters.

694
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,861
It's fine as long as
someone is picking you up tomorrow.

695
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:42,981
If so,

696
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:46,341
I guess this is farewell.

697
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:53,181
See you.

698
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:54,861
Okay.

699
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:32,981
I'm fine. You don't
need to hold my hand.

700
00:40:40,781 --> 00:40:42,021
What are you doing here?

701
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:44,941
You're back?

702
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:47,701
My daughter just had surgery.

703
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:48,821
Of course I need to visit her.

704
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,221
I thought it might be inconvenient

705
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:52,621
for me to head to the O&G department.

706
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,541
I'll go and buy some ingredients.

707
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:55,381
Alright.

708
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:56,541
You can leave when you're done.

709
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:57,661
Don't disturb her rest.

710
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:03,781
I bought some fruits for you.

711
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:06,421
Why don't we head inside?

712
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,461
I'll cut an apple for you.

713
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:11,141
I don't eat apples.

714
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:15,181
I'm fine.

715
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:17,261
Just leave.

716
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,301
If you don't,

717
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,541
Mom will spend the entire day outside.

718
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:25,101
An,

719
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,141
you've been

720
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:28,621
providing financial aid to me

721
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:29,621
and Liang Tao from time to time.

722
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,261
I thought our relationship

723
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:33,541
was getting better.

724
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:36,061
Back then, you were still young.

725
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,741
There were things

726
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:38,941
we couldn't explain back then.

727
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:41,461
The issue between your mother and I

728
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,661
cannot be explained

729
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:43,541
with a few words.

730
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:44,581
There's no right or wrong.

731
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:45,261
My relationship with Wang Xuerong

732
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,701
was definitely not what
your mother had presumed.

733
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:47,821
It wasn't an extramarital affair.

734
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,141
Must you

735
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:50,661
tell me all of these now?

736
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:52,701
Ever since

737
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:53,741
you divorced Mom,

738
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:56,621
Mom raised me by herself.

739
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:00,421
In my life,

740
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:03,661
I don't have a father.

741
00:42:03,661 --> 00:42:05,221
And, I'm doing fine too.

742
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:09,141
That's right.

743
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:10,261
You did borrow me some money

744
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,661
when I studied overseas.

745
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:13,701
That's why you guys

746
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:14,821
thought

747
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:15,741
you guys

748
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:17,221
never

749
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:18,261
owed us anything.

750
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,501
You guys even thought

751
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:23,301
that I was the reason
you guys weren't doing good in life.

752
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:24,141
That's not true.

753
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:26,221
That won't do.

754
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:28,101
An...

755
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:29,781
Liang Shu,

756
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:32,061
although I accepted the fact,
that doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

757
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,341
No matter how many years pass,

758
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,101
the only fact I can accept

759
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,701
is

760
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:42,261
that a warm and happy family

761
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:43,821
has nothing to do with me.

762
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,541
But don't ever think that
I'll forgive you.
