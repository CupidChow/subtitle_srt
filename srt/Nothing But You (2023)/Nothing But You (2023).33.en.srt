00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:55,640
(We're All Passionate Fools.)

00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,380
(Ancong Wig Shop)

5
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:59,283
(I'm back.)

6
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,603
I've tidied up the sports bag that you like.

7
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:05,563
You can put whatever you want inside.

8
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:06,363
Here you go.

9
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,483
Why do I feel like
you're more nervous than I am?

10
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:09,883
Of course, I'm nervous.

11
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,363
I'm also excited.

12
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,043
This is your first game

13
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,123
after your leg healed.

14
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:16,963
Training is one thing,

15
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,003
but this game is different.

16
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,763
Are these lucky charms?

17
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:23,443
Well, they're for luck

18
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,043
for you to be safe and secure victory.

19
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:27,643
I wanted to put a pear inside

20
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:28,723
for good luck and a smooth outcome.

21
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:29,883
But after giving it a thought,

22
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:31,363
what if it creates pressure for you?
[*Pear and pressure are homonyms.]

23
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:32,083
So I left it out.

24
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,403
If you put it that way,

25
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:35,523
should I perform a ritual

26
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:36,723
or hold a ceremony?

27
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,323
That's actually a good idea.

28
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,723
Listen.

29
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,243
After you arrive at the field tomorrow,

30
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:46,083
do a secret ritual and bless the field.

31
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:59,323
So did you send your girlfriend back?

32
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,003
No.

33
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,283
She's been busy lately.

34
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,283
We can't even meet each other
outside the club.

35
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,123
I'll talk to you about something serious.

36
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:12,403
Now that you're getting along well,

37
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,803
why don't I vacate your mother's house

38
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,523
for you both?

39
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,603
Are you saying
that we should live together?

40
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,283
Why don't you ask her about it?

41
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:26,203
You'an is renting her current place anyway.

42
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:27,643
Isn't it better to save money
than to rent?

43
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,803
Let's wait a little longer.

44
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,563
I feel like it's hard to ask her now.

45
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,483
Is it too soon?

46
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:42,203
I'll ask her

47
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:43,683
after I reclaim my spot

48
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,483
as a welfare player

49
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:46,363
and I've won a few games.

50
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,123
She'll be more likely to agree

51
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:49,963
if I ask her then.

52
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,963
It seems like we didn't waste
our time talking about this last time.

53
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,563
I'm on your side.

54
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:01,283
Okay, I'll go back to my room now.

55
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:03,483
Give me the bag.

56
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:04,243
I've cleaned it up for you.

57
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:04,963
No need.

58
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,523
Just go do your own thing.

59
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:07,723
I'll clean it for you.

60
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,300
(Top Smash)

61
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:13,163
Okay, get up.

62
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:16,922
How's your knee feeling?

63
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:19,683
It's okay.

64
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:21,362
Good. One last one.

65
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:23,843
We're almost there.

66
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,363
We've analyzed
the challenger's techniques,

67
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:27,643
the one you'll be up against.

68
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:29,683
He's pretty smart
when it comes to playing the game.

69
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:32,363
When you're on the field, stay calm,
improvise according to the situation,

70
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,083
and you'll be fine.

71
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:33,603
Okay.

72
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:34,163
I'll keep that in mind.

73
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:37,963
Also, make sure to protect your knees.

74
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,643
The coach from rehab has emphasized

75
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:40,923
that we should monitor his knee closely

76
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:41,763
for the next six months.

77
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:42,163
Okay.

78
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:44,163
Sure, I'll keep detailed records
for every game

79
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,883
and give you a summary every two weeks.

80
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:47,243
Good luck.

81
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:48,323
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

82
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:49,843
I'll head to the court then.

83
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:50,603
All right.

84
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,323
Your scar looks pretty bad.

85
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,083
It must be a pretty bad injury.

86
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:57,643
No wonder

87
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,323
Zhang Yan has been
so busy these past few months.

88
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,083
So he's been focusing on you.

89
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:02,523
Have a good game.

90
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:03,483
Don't let him down.

91
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,123
If you...

92
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,043
Ms. Luo,

93
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,723
are you the team nutritionist?

94
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:13,723
If you have nothing to do,

95
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:14,843
why don't you go shopping or something?

96
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:15,723
Everyone's busy

97
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:16,443
with the game today.

98
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:17,963
You must be really nervous right now.

99
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:20,203
Ms. Luo,

100
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:23,203
Zhang Yan used to train a highly talented kid.

101
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,683
Do you know about that?

102
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,883
He ended up playing worse and worse

103
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,083
and eventually retired.

104
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,683
He started drinking then.

105
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,763
Luckily,

106
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,883
Zhang Yan picked someone
like Song Sanchuan.

107
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:36,763
Not everyone can be as lucky as him.

108
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:39,283
Song Sanchuan
wasn't picked up off the street.

109
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:41,683
Everyone today sees him as a legend.

110
00:05:42,763 --> 00:05:44,643
The stands are packed
with people watching him.

111
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:47,403
But only those at Top Smash know

112
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,123
how he got here today

113
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:50,643
and how everyone here accompanied him

114
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:51,603
to achieve what he has today.

115
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:54,603
Outsiders have no right to say anything.

116
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,203
What's the matter?

117
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:05,963
I talked to the rehab specialist.

118
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:07,443
He recommended this brand.

119
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,243
If you feel any tension in your knee

120
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,483
(Medical Ice Pack)
during halftime,

121
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:11,843
just ice it.

122
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:14,403
Okay.

123
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:20,443
I'll get going then.

124
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:21,003
Good luck.

125
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,620

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,140

(the cost at the rehab center.)

130

(Liang You'an paid for it.)

131
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,363
After I'm back in the game

132
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,120
(IOU)

133
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:15,243
(IOU)
and win the games.

134
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,923
After earning enough prize money,
I'll pay you back immediately.

135
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,123
You can't lose, man.

136
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:19,683
You have to count us in too.

137
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,483
(The results are good
and they meet the requirements.)

138
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:23,763
(Congratulations)

139
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,523
(on returning to the field!)

140
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,283
Don't be nervous

141
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:28,843
at tomorrow's game.

142
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:30,523
I'll go and watch your match.

143
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:47,923
He hasn't competed for a long time.

144
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,123
He'll be fine after he readjusts
his physical and mental state.

145
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:01,643
Are you okay?

146
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:03,443
How's your knee?

147
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:07,083
I feel quite sorry for everyone

148
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:08,603
that I lost.

149
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:10,883
What are you saying?

150
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,283
I watched the whole match.

151
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,723
You already gave your all.

152
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,083
Besides, you haven't competed for so long.

153
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,123
Coach Yan said

154
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:18,683
your body's various functions need

155
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:20,763
to readjust and recover.

156
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,763
He said it's normal for you

157
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:24,843
to lose continuously.

158
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:26,003
You can take it as warming up.

159
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:28,003
These are just excuses.

160
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:30,163
It wasn't good enough.

161
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,043
It's all right. Just take the call.

162
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:35,843
Hello?

163
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,723
I'm at the club.

164
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:40,883
Today?

165
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,243
Tomorrow afternoon...

166
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:42,963
It's okay. Just go.

167
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,283
All right. I'll see you later.

168
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:48,443
Okay, see you.

169
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:50,603
That was Alex.

170
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:51,403
She made an appointment

171
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:52,803
to discuss the venue expansion
with someone.

172
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,843
Just go. I'm okay.

173
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:56,643
Okay, how about this?

174
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:58,643
I'll order takeout tonight.

175
00:10:58,683 --> 00:10:59,963
Come over to my place for dinner, okay?

176
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,363
Sure, see you tonight.

177
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,683
Don't overthink it.

178
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,083
What happened back there?

179
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,243
What's the problem?

180
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,203
You made a good start.

181
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:15,363
Coach Yan,

182
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,283
can you accompany me to the hospital?

183
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,020
(Orthopedic Surgery)

184
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,763
Does the spot
where I touched still hurt?

185
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:25,563
It doesn't hurt.

186
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,883
Then there's no problem.

187
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,323
Based on the scan,

188
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,483
there's nothing wrong either.

189
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:30,643
You recover pretty well.

190
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,443
But when I'm on the court,

191
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,523
that kind of pain feels so real and accurate,

192
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,363
especially in the injured part.

193
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,003
When I made a sudden run
and abrupt stop,

194
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:39,603
I feel like this leg can't handle it.

195
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:42,963
We've dealt with many sports injuries before.

196
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:43,923
I'll just put it this way.

197
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,283
When any part of your body

198
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,523
experiences severe trauma,

199
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,163
phantom pain can occur

200
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:51,683
when you return to the field.

201
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:52,923
It's a normal phenomenon.

202
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:54,203
Phantom pain?

203
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,163
Are you saying

204
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:58,763
that his current pain is psychological?

205
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:00,323
Theoretically,

206
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,883
it's not a physical problem.

207
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:04,163
But for athletes,

208
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,683
this kind of psychological pain

209
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,163
is as bad as physical pain.

210
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:08,603
The most crucial thing

211
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,363
is the innate fear in your body.

212
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,803
You're afraid
your leg will get hurt again.

213
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,403
So when you're doing movements

214
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,763
or doing resistance training,

215
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:16,683
you always feel

216
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:18,203
that it's different from the good leg.

217
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:18,723
Am I right?

218
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:19,283
Yes.

219
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,203
This kind of psychological pain

220
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,043
is indeed distracting.

221
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:26,363
Moreover, competitive sports rely heavily on focus.

222
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:31,843
It's okay.

223
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,323
Well,

224
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,443
I had the check-up done.

225
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:36,563
It's enough as long as you say

226
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:37,643
there's nothing wrong with the knee.

227
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,643
I'll work on overcoming the rest myself.

228
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:43,283
The most important thing
is the psychological aspect, right?

229
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,803
Yes, that's how it is.

230
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,523
Oh, and you guys too.

231
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,563
Stop reminding him about his injury.

232
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,963
You can do this too. During the game,

233
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,723
covering the scar with a bandage

234
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:53,843
will make you feel a lot better.

235
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,443
It'll help you focus on the game

236
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:56,483
and forget about it.

237
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,083
Sometimes when you subconsciously
look down,

238
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,403
you'll start feeling the pain again.

239
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:05,563
Coach Yan,

240
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,043
can you not tell everyone

241
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:08,963
about my knee for now?

242
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:10,803
I understand.

243
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,803
We can't emphasize it.

244
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:14,563
The more we stress about it,

245
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,443
the more attention we'll get.

246
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:16,603
The more emotional and mental burden
it'll become.

247
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:18,883
The guys may not have said anything.

248
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:21,523
But I'm sure it stresses you out.
Am I right?

249
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:22,963
I get it.

250
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:26,883
The doctor gave some solutions.

251
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:29,003
I'll adjust my state

252
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,083
when I get back.

253
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,443
Maybe if I play

254
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,243
a few more games and adapt,

255
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:36,123
it won't hurt anymore.

256
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:37,603
Sanchuan.

257
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,483
You'll win this, okay?

258
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:56,163
Did you guys

259
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,403
help him recover afterward?

260
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:59,363
Did you check his knee again?

261
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,483
(Don't worry, we did all that.)

262
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,860
(Nian)
(There's no problem.)

263
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:04,963
(Do you want to ask him)

264
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,323
(if there's any other reason?)

265
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:07,563
Never mind.

266
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:08,763
I don't really want to talk to him

267
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:10,243
about the match anymore.

268
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:13,043
He's already feeling bad about losing.

269
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:15,963
All right. Then stop talking about it.

270
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,363
Let him relax a bit.

271
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:21,043
I think he's here now.

272
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:21,883
I'll talk to you later.

273
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:22,523
Bye.

274
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,483
Coming!

275
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:29,763
Come in.

276
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:36,683
Every time

277
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:38,083
I see this puzzle,

278
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:39,363
I think of the days

279
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:41,243
we spent at the apartment in Chengdu.

280
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:44,003
I miss it so much.

281
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:46,283
It'll be nice

282
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:47,083
if only we could relive those days

283
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,043
without the bad knee version.

284
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:54,843
You know what?

285
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,043
Ever since we got together,

286
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,883
there's been one thing
I've been wanting to do.

287
00:14:59,043 --> 00:14:59,843
What's that?

288
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:01,443
I could let it go

289
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,363
if you only painted my toenails.

290
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,603
Why do you have
to paint my fingernails too?

291
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:05,723
How can I play tennis like this?

292
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,843
It only takes two minutes to remove it.

293
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:12,083
I've been thinking for a very long time

294
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,203
to do something with you

295
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,763
that you've never done before.

296
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:18,603
Usually, if I put on nice nail polish

297
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,563
or wear pretty lipstick,

298
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,563
I feel really happy.

299
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,123
How is life so vibrant

300
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,243
and adorable?

301
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,003
They look pretty.

302
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,003
Okay.

303
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,003
Let me take a photo of them.

304
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:36,443
Show them.

305
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,803
Don't ruin the polish.

306
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:39,403
Wait.

307
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:40,883
My mom is calling.

308
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:44,003
Yes, mom?

309
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:45,723
I'm outside of the lift

310
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,003
and now outside your place.
Open the door for me.

311
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:49,523
My...

312
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:51,803
My place?

313
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,163
Are you not home?

314
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,163
I'm at home.

315
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:57,723
Open the door then.

316
00:15:58,483 --> 00:15:59,003
I...

317
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,843
What do we do now?

318
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:06,243
Why are you nervous?
Let her come and meet my boyfriend.

319
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:07,203
No, how can I meet her now?

320
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:08,443
I'm not prepared.

321
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:09,563
You don't have to prepare anything.

322
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:10,443
Wait. Look at these.

323
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:12,003
How can I meet your mom like this?

324
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:12,843
I forgot.

325
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:13,963
Your mom would think I'm weird.

326
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,043
Hide in the room, then.

327
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:16,483
No.

328
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:19,203
Wait.

329
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:22,843
Wait for a moment.

330
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:36,563
What took you so long?

331
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,123
I was in the toilet.

332
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:39,883
Why are you here

333
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:41,443
at this late hour?

334
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:43,603
Oh,

335
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,683
I went to pick some bayberries
with my old classmates.

336
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:48,843
I dropped by because I was passing by.

337
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:49,643
Okay.

338
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,523
Heavens!

339
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:53,603
That's a huge watermelon.

340
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,083
Can you finish all of this yourself?

341
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:57,123
I...

342
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,843
I've been craving it lately.

343
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:04,963
Don't just stand there.

344
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,083
Go and wash the bayberries.

345
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,123
It's your favorite.

346
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:14,363
Mom, take a seat.

347
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,220
(Song Sanchuan)

348
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,363
Mom, the bayberries are washed.

349
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,883
Are they clean?

350
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,843
Did you get rid of the bugs?

351
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,363
What do you mean by bugs?

352
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:28,923
There are no bugs.

353
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:32,363
Just eat them without worries.

354
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:33,483
I'm not eating.

355
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,163
My teeth hurt eating these at night.

356
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:38,763
All right. I'm leaving now.

357
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,003
What a huge watermelon.

358
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:44,803
Mom,

359
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:45,643
I should send you the password

360
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:47,003
to my place.

361
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,723
If you come when I'm not there,

362
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,603
then the trip you made won't be a waste.

363
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:53,083
I don't want your password.

364
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:55,003
This will be the last time
I come without notice.

365
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,403
I won't come before telling you in advance.

366
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:01,723
Mom, let me know when you reach home.

367
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:09,803
My mom left.

368
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:10,683
Guess what?

369
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,203
I think my mom noticed something.

370
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:13,003
She waited

371
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:14,643
until I finished washing the bayberries
before she left.

372
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:15,643
Were we found out?

373
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:17,963
No.

374
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:24,683
What's wrong?

375
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,363
Why do I feel

376
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:27,523
you're a little down

377
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,443
after we separated for a while?

378
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,763
It's nothing.

379
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,123
I just feel

380
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:40,003
other than removing this polish,

381
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,043
I need to recover quickly to compete,

382
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,283
recover my ranks,

383
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,523
and pay off my medical bills.

384
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:48,043
Then I can formally

385
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,003
meet your mom soon.

386
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,963
It'll happen soon.

387
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:00,883
Really.

388
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,483
Your leg has recovered.

389
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:05,283
Winning the game is just a matter of time.

390
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:13,363
Enough, stop overthinking.

391
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:14,283
Come here.

392
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,483
Lean on me.

393
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:27,203
How does it feel?

394
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:29,043
Do you feel safe?

395
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:30,723
How broad.

396
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:02,363
He must be under a lot of pressure right now.

397
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,883
If he loses this match,

398
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,643
someone else's photo will be hung up.

399
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:11,803
Before the match,
he applied the knee tape and relax.

400
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:14,683
I hope he can make it
through this match.

401
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:25,083
Sometimes, we have to admit

402
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:27,923
that failure is part
of competitive sports

403
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,523
which is hard to ignore.

404
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:30,883
You guys put

405
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,563
so much effort into managing him.

406
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:34,323
But in the end,

407
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:35,643
it still failed.

408
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:40,683
You still destroyed him.

409
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,803
We don't call it managing.

410
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:45,843
You'll never understand.

411
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:48,043
Yes, I don't.

412
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:49,683
But I know you.

413
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,083
Ambitious but easily lost.

414
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:53,883
How many talented individuals

415
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,523
have you encountered over the years?

416
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:56,643
But what happened?

417
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,123
They were all wasted by you.

418
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:01,243
Don't you think

419
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,803
the problem lies with yourself?

420
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:11,763
Out!

421
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,180
(Wang Shuai 40, Song Sanchuan 15)

422
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:35,763
How long has your knee been hurting?

423
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:40,683
Since the first game.

424
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:44,683
I didn't even know

425
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,003
you were in pain for that long.

426
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:52,723
Did you go to the hospital yourself?

427
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,963
Coach Yan accompanied me.

428
00:23:58,643 --> 00:23:59,843
What did the doctor say?

429
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:02,683
How serious is

430
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,083
phantom pain?

431
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,283
It not only hurts when playing tennis.

432
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:15,523
Sometimes,

433
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,083
it'll hurt when I'm asleep.

434
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:23,243
The doctor said
it was not physical pain.

435
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:26,683
Maybe it'll get better by the next game,

436
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:29,763
or maybe next month,

437
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,923
or maybe next year.

438
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:38,803
Liang You'an,

439
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:43,923
I promised to return your money
in nine months.

440
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:48,843
I don't think I could fulfill it.

441
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:56,843
Song Sanchuan,

442
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,523
we just received a notice

443
00:24:58,603 --> 00:25:00,003
that your urine test was abnormal.

444
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,683
So we need you to do another test.

445
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:09,243
Doctor,

446
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:10,363
I was reading a book

447
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:11,563
on sports injuries

448
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:13,483
and it mentioned something
about the placebo effect.

449
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,283
Is that also a solution?

450
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,403
Yeah, you can say that.

451
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:18,043
I can prescribe it

452
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:18,883
if you need it.

453
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:19,603
Yes.

454
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,323
Can you prescribe some for me?

455
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:21,843
Sure.

456
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:22,883
By the way,

457
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:24,083
I want to confirm

458
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:24,923
if the placebo you're prescribing

459
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:26,363
to him doesn't contain

460
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,483
any ingredients

461
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:28,643
that athletes can't take.

462
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:29,883
Of course.

463
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:31,603
We're informed about this.

464
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:32,643
That's great.

465
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,483
You'll be fine.

466
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,603
Song Sanchuan, your turn is up.

467
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:31,803
Okay.

468
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:49,643
As a precaution,

469
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,283
we need you to fill out this form.

470
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:52,283
After that,

471
00:26:52,363 --> 00:26:53,723
(Athlete Status Survey Form)
we'll upload it to the testing website.

472
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:54,843
This is mainly

473
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:56,083
to track the athletes' daily routines.

474
00:26:56,603 --> 00:26:57,323
We'll need you

475
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:59,883
to record your daily routines and activities.

476
00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:03,523
Based on our conversations earlier,

477
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:04,403
we suspect

478
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:05,363
it may be the medication you took

479
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:06,123
before the competition

480
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,283
that caused the abnormal test results.

481
00:27:08,763 --> 00:27:10,003
The deviation shouldn't be a problem.

482
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,123
After the results come out,

483
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:12,683
we'll issue an official notice.

484
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:13,923
Okay.

485
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,443
No matter what the retest results are,

486
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,483
I'll stand by your side.

487
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,523
You're worried
the phantom pain won't go away

488
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:41,523
and wouldn't be able to play again.

489
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:44,643
Those fears
are making you anxious, right?

490
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,763
I just wanted to tell you

491
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:59,523
that you can be more patient
with yourself.

492
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:08,123
We may not be able

493
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,883
to play on the court
in this pouring rain.

494
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,043
But I always remember you talking

495
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,643
about every moment

496
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:17,963
with the tennis balls

497
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,323
in the sunshine and under the night sky.

498
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,443
It's nice to have such thoughts.

499
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,283
Song Sanchuan,

500
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:30,243
it's okay.

501
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,643
It's really okay.

502
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:34,083
I thought about what the doctor said.

503
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:37,803
Phantom pain is caused
by the fear of getting hurt again.

504
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,003
But even if we're not on this court,

505
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:42,603
nobody knows

506
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:43,923
what kind of accidents and injuries

507
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,883
might happen in the next moment.

508
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,203
Who doesn't live

509
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:51,163
with a little bit of fear?

510
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:05,443
Actually, it was only after I met you

511
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:07,243
that I truly understood

512
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:08,323
the meaning of sports.

513
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:10,963
It gives people

514
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,363
the courage to face setbacks.

515
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:15,443
Day after day of training,

516
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:17,363
encountering problems,

517
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,123
and then solving them.

518
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,763
It's a willpower that only those

519
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:26,803
who persist in a sport can possess.

520
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:02,723
(Liang You'an,)

521
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,020
(Top Smash)

522
00:30:04,043 --> 00:30:04,963
(I'm ready.)

523
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,763
(No matter the results of the retest,)

524
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:10,243
(I can handle it.)

525
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:12,803
(I'll accept it)

526
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:13,483
(with a positive attitude,)

527
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,523
(and then face it.)

528
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,883
(We'll face it together.)

529
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:42,483
What's wrong with you?

530
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:54,563
Drinking again?

531
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,723
Is this the time to be drinking?

532
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,643
I was there when the medicine
was prescribed to him.

533
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:08,843
It's my responsibility
now that something goes wrong.

534
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:10,963
We don't know

535
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,003
the reason or the results yet.

536
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,363
Now it's time to do something

537
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:16,403
and investigate as much as possible.

538
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,243
It's all my fault.

539
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,163
I have a really bad feeling.

540
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,003
Xu Lexi was right.

541
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:31,043
I'm the kind of person

542
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,643
who only implicates others.

543
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,523
Whoever is around me will be unlucky.

544
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:38,243
Sanchuan is a good kid.

545
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:40,883
But look at what I did to him.

546
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:44,843
I've reached my limit.

547
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,563
I need to move on.

548
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:48,643
What?

549
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:51,883
What are you talking about?

550
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,563
Your ex-wife is unbelievable.

551
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:54,723
Does she know you?

552
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:56,283
Does she know sports?

553
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:01,963
This is obviously
psychological manipulation.

554
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:07,723
I'm also divorced but I never thought

555
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:10,443
a failure in marriage could ruin a person.

556
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:11,363
Now that I see you in this state,

557
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:12,523
I see it now.

558
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,483
A bad partner will constantly invalidate
and drain you.

559
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:19,803
You're such a great coach.

560
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:22,083
You've led everyone this far.

561
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,203
At the moment

562
00:32:23,203 --> 00:32:24,243
when Song Sanchuan needs you the most,

563
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,603
you're here drowning your sorrows
in alcohol.

564
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:29,883
Drink all you want.

565
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:31,963
You can drink until you die.

566
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:45,923
They just sent over
a case investigation form

567
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,243
that needs to be completed as additional material.

568
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:49,603
Let's fill it out.

569
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:54,563
I'll pick several pictures for you.

570
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,603
Shenzhen Anheng Hospital.

571
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,403
Uncle An sent these pictures to me.

572
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:02,483
Attach these to the form later.

573
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:03,123
Okay.

574
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:08,603
Can you tell me

575
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:09,443
what song you were listening to

576
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:10,563
after the surgery?

577
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:13,963
I think it was upbeat music.

578
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,563
The kind you can dance to.

579
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:17,723
Listening to upbeat music
while in a wheelchair.

580
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,523
That's pretty ambitious.

581
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:24,123
Seriously?

582
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:25,843
You even took a picture of me
when I was lining up

583
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:26,843
to buy cream puffs for you in a wheelchair?

584
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:28,483
Wait. What's this?

585
00:33:28,763 --> 00:33:29,803
You even took a picture of me sleeping?

586
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,963
Do you really like me that much?

587
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:35,043
I liked you the most

588
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:36,323
when you were a fool.

589
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:37,723
Foolish?

590
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:38,843
You're the fool.

591
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:41,003
I'm serious.

592
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,043
Coach Yan told me,

593
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:45,083
"Song Sanchuan will definitely

594
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,323
be the best athlete."

595
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:48,003
It's because you're smart enough.

596
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,523
You use strategy to play.

597
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:51,003
I thought the same in the beginning.

598
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:52,763
But

599
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,123
being too smart

600
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:56,243
can be a burden sometimes.

601
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,923
We tend to be cautious
and become more sensitive,

602
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,163
and defensive.

603
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:01,803
I've found

604
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:03,083
that every time I like you more,

605
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,723
it was when you're being a fool.

606
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:06,523
Especially

607
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,843
those brave and foolish moments
when you charge ahead.

608
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:10,802
Just think about it.

609
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:13,762
You practiced volleys at the net,
broke serves,

610
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:15,603
played against the wind,
and even competed in wild card matches.

611
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:16,643
I'm serious.

612
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:17,322
Every time you behave

613
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,483
like a reckless, fearless idiot,

614
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:20,123
it makes my heart swoon.

615
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,443
If that's the case,

616
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:26,443
you're also a reckless person.

617
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:28,282
You're a passionate fool too.

618
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:30,923
I wonder

619
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:31,603
why I like you so much?

620
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:32,883
I guess fools attract each other.

621
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:34,203
Yeah,

622
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:35,643
that's right.

623
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:37,523
There are too many smart people
in the world.

624
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:39,563
It's nice to be a fool.

625
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:40,603
It's so adorable.

626
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:42,683
Besides,

627
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:44,403
idiots have flaws.

628
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:49,843
You can trust it.

629
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:53,762
You know what?

630
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,923
I've been feeling anxious

631
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:58,523
all this time.

632
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:00,203
As a result,

633
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,483
I lost my pace.

634
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:04,923
As you said,

635
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,923
the future is unknown.

636
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:09,443
Even if you're scared,
you still have to move forward.

637
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:14,043
You can't lose the spirit
of being a fearless idiot.

638
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:15,803
Now I feel like

639
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:18,963
there's nothing I can't get through.

640
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:21,243
My mind is really

641
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,763
at ease now.

642
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:43,003
Coach Yan,

643
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,043
Ms. Luo said you're leaving.

644
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:47,883
Is that true?

645
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:52,123
Wait.

646
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:53,523
Don't tell me you really think

647
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:54,883
everything that happened to me
was your fault.

648
00:35:55,643 --> 00:35:56,683
Besides, Liang You'an has found

649
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:57,643
a therapist for me.

650
00:35:58,283 --> 00:35:59,683
I'll cooperate actively
with the treatment.

651
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:07,043
Actually, I've never

652
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,603
formally thanked you before.

653
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:14,203
Coach Yan,

654
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,203
I'm really thankful to you

655
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:17,563
from the bottom of my heart.

656
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,403
If it weren't for you,

657
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:23,563
I wouldn't have achieved
what I have today.

658
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:29,403
Even if without me,

659
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,723
you would still have achieved
what you have today.

660
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:37,483
These past few days,

661
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:38,923
I've been thinking in my room.

662
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,563
Why do I always fail?

663
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:45,443
It was

664
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:47,483
because I chose to give up

665
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:48,563
every time things got the toughest

666
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:50,603
over the years.

667
00:36:52,763 --> 00:36:57,203
But when everyone wants to give up,

668
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,163
you'd grit your teeth

669
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:02,483
and never give up.

670
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,523
At that very moment,

671
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:10,123
I find you're shining brightly.

672
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:18,083
This is

673
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:20,923
the first time you complimented me.

674
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:25,123
You can't leave.

675
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:27,723
The club won't do without...

676
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:29,603
This family cannot be without you.

677
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:31,483
Really!

678
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:35,683
Are you...

679
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:38,843
Are you really so reluctant
to see me go?

680
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:40,963
In any case,

681
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,523
I grit my teeth, right?

682
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:45,803
I'm not letting go.

683
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:47,483
I'll keep shining.

684
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:49,603
How about this?

685
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:51,403
Show how sincere you are.

686
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:54,443
Take this and drink it all.

687
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:55,803
I won't leave if you drink it.

688
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:58,123
What?

689
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,083
You want me to drink alcohol
early in the morning?

690
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,443
See? You're not sincere at all.

691
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:10,243
If there's nothing wrong with my taste bud,

692
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:13,043
this is probably a bottle of mineral water.

693
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,083
Yes, your taste bud is fine.

694
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:15,323
Congratulations on being normal.

695
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:16,323
That's precisely a bottle of water.

696
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:17,283
What did you think it was?

697
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:19,683
I'm not leaving.

698
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:24,963
If you're not leaving,

699
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:26,163
why are you packing?

700
00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:28,003
The room is a mess.

701
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:29,203
Can't I throw out things I don't need?

702
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:32,523
Coach Luo is right.

703
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:34,763
A failed marriage

704
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:36,443
doesn't mean a failed life, right?

705
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,803
People need to keep improving themselves

706
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,043
now and then.

707
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:43,163
That's

708
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:44,483
what I learned from you.

709
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:46,243
I've decided

710
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,283
to train and learn with you guys

711
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:50,203
to push myself to the limit.

712
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,123
From now on,

713
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,643
I won't back down anymore.

714
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:57,803
Okay.

715
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,363
Let's not wait until later.

716
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,243
Let's start right now.

717
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:03,123
- Start what?
- Let's go.

718
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:03,643
Where are we going?

719
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:05,243
I found a set of exercises

720
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,043
specifically for my left knee rehab.

721
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:07,683
Wait.

722
00:39:07,683 --> 00:39:08,963
But my left leg is fine.

723
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:11,763
(Song Sanchuan,)

724
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:13,723

725

780
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:32,643
is his dad doesn't approve

were so keen on getting married.

00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:17,003
In my opinion,

marriage

798
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:23,203
