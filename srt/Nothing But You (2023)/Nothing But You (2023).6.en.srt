=Episode 6=

3
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,980
(Can you buy me a cup of coffee?)

4
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:57,268
Okay, I admit.

5
00:01:57,348 --> 00:01:58,748
I did want others to notice

6
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,908
something about our relationship.

7
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:02,188
We were not

8
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,188
in the same department,

9
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,188
the same office,

10
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:05,668
or even in the scope

11
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,548
of the office's no-dating policy.

12
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:07,908
How is it a problem?

13
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:09,948
Besides, don't you girls

14
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:11,348
like the sense of security

15
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,028
that comes with making
the relationship public?

16
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:13,948
Wait.

17
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,907
Since when we were exclusive?

18
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:17,068
I don't recall us

19
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,668
being in a relationship yet.

20
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:22,588
For now,

21
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,068
but you know

22
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,188
I'm pursuing you.

23
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,628
There's no need to hide it.

24
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,148
I don't like the feeling

25
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,428
of being marked.

26
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,268
I'll make myself clear today.

27
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:35,108
I reject your pursuit.

28
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:36,948
Singapore's hot weather

29
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:37,988
is not suitable for me.

30
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:38,948
I'm certainly not going there.

31
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,668
So you don't need to consider me

32
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:41,828
as a potential partner,

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,148
whether for dating or marriage.

34
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:44,588
We're not a good match.

35
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,268
If there's anything

36
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:54,668
I need to do better,

37
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:56,428
I can change myself

38
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:57,988
to your liking.

39
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:58,868
You don't have to say

40
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:00,148
these out of fit.

41
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,868
I thought you were mature.

42
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,748
I am mature.

43
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:05,988
I am a 32-year-old woman

44
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,868
who is independent in my personal life

45
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,068
and capable of handling things
on my own in my professional life.

46
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:09,748
I have a clear understanding

47
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:11,228
of myself.

48
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,708
So when someone I don't like

49
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,668
expresses interest in me,

50
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:14,668
it's a burden

51
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:15,868
and troublesome matter to me.

52
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:19,388
I'd rather
have zero emotional intelligence

53
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:20,388
and reject them outright

54
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,548
than deal with any complications.

55
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:24,948
Additionally,

56
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,828
you have indeed done well in your career

57
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,068
for the past two years.

58
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:30,508
From convincing me to quit my job

59
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:30,948
to

60
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:31,668
the various arrangements

61
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:32,388
you've made between us,

62
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:32,988
you have a conspicuous air

63
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:34,308
of superiority

64
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,228
that you think

65
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,028
I'll happily accept.

66
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,068
Unfortunately,

67
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:38,428
I'll have to say no.

68
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,628
My maturity has allowed me

69
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,788
to see through things

70
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,188
and things I don't like.

71
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,428
I hope

72
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,668
I made myself clear.

73
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:54,388
Crystal clear.

74
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,148
Simply put,

75
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:59,428
it's hard to satisfy

76
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:00,988
older women.

77
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:02,908
When the man is excellent,

78
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,228
she wants to be on an equal footing
than depending on him.

79
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:05,628
When the man is incompetent,

80
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,908
she doesn't want to associate with him.

81
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,228
I'm curious to know

82
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:11,588
for a woman like you,

83
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:13,268
who doesn't like to be marked,

84
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,188
what kind

85
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,188
of partner would you

86
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,148
ultimately end up with?

87
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,548
What is it, kid?

88
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:29,868
What are you looking at?

89
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:31,748
Just looking

90
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,308
at what a repulsive person looks like.

91
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:37,748
So I'd stay away from people like these.

92
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,148
What did you say?

93
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:39,588
Do you know me?

94
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:40,868
I'm craving coffee.

95
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,788
Can you buy me a cup of coffee?

96
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,228
Sure, get whatever you want.

97
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,028
Do you know me?

98
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:53,948
What do you want to drink?

99
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,948
Jin Yi is upstairs.

100
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:58,988
I'll have two iced Americanos.

101
00:04:58,988 --> 00:04:59,948
What about you?

102
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,148
Four iced Americanos.

103
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:02,508
One of them with extra ice.

104
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:02,948
Thank you.

105
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:03,828
Okay.

106
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,308
That will be a total of 72 yuan.

107
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:07,348
Okay.

108
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,108
Please wait a moment.

109
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,948
Was that guy your colleague?

110
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,788
Were you rejecting him?

111
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,028
It's not good to eavesdrop
on other people's conversations.

112
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,468
Why did Jin Yi suddenly come today?

113
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:33,628
What is it?

114
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,748
Just be prepared.

115
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:37,268
He's looking for trouble again.

116
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:38,948
He even dragged me along.

117
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,308
This is the racket.

118
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:46,628
German made.

119
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,548
It has officially been discontinued.

120
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,668
It's the brand and model

121
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:50,828
I've been using all along.

122
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,348
Are you using the same one too?

123
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:56,468
Yes, besides us two,

124
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:58,028
the other four team members

125
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:59,468
also use

126
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:00,308
this model.

127
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:01,948
The coach counted the inventory

128
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,388
and there is still

129
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,068
about 20 left.

130
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,188
I've been using this racket
since I turned pro

131
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,028
and have never used any other brand.

132
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:09,268
I'm not used

133
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:10,508
to using other brands.

134
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,028
How long does it usually take you
to wear out a racket?

135
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:14,428
It depends on the intensity
of the training.

136
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,908
Wearing two or three rackets a week
is common.

137
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:18,148
During the game,

138
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:19,348
I usually bring five rackets.

139
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,548
You used two to three in a week?

140
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,468
Yes.

141
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:25,828
Is there a problem?

142
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,108
No problem.

143
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:36,268
I can make some arrangements.

144
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,428
We will use

145
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:38,468
all our resources

146
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,188
to help you collect
the remaining rackets,

147
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:41,708
giving you priority to use them.

148
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,228
Priority?

149
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:47,508
I think they should be exclusively

150
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,348
for my use, no matter what.

151
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,148
Do you have any objections?

152
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:56,788
You can have them all.

153
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:59,108
But the problem
is the discontinued racket

154
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,548
will eventually run out.

155
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,468
What will you do then?

156
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,188
Retire on the spot?

157
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,908
That depends on her ability.

158
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:08,868
If she can find

159
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:09,788
around ten or eight thousand,

160
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:11,348
that will be enough
for me to use until I retire.

161
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:14,148
Okay.

162
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,628
You can leave that racket here

163
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:17,588
for us to refer to.

164
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:18,948
Sure, no problem.

165
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:21,988
I'll wait for your news then.

166
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,268
Song Sanchuan,

167
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,748
why don't you stay for a while?

168
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:27,788
Young Space also

169
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:28,588
manufactures

170
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,548
its badminton rackets.

171
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,388
From materials to technology,

172
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,188
they're not inferior to foreign brands.

173
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,068
Didn't you say

174
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,148
there are other players on your team

175
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:37,628
also using this racket?

176
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:39,068
Why don't you pick

177
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:40,228
a replacement option?

178
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,388
That's a good idea.

179
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:46,508
Matching defective products
with a substitute player.

180
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,308
You should thank my sponsor
for being generous.

181
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,668
Yoyo, send Jin Yi downstairs

182
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,708
and call for an e-hailing taxi for him.

183
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:54,028
Okay, Ms. Liang.

184
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,868
I want a private car.

185
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:03,348
Young Space

186
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:04,828
has its own product line.

187
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:06,228
Over the past few years, Mr. Jiang Jie

188
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,788
has been trying to establish the company

189
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:08,508
as a professional in the field.

190
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:10,308
So our R&D department

191
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:11,348
has developed many products

192
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:12,708
for professional athletes to use.

193
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,908
Basically, rackets are divided

194
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:15,948
into offensive at the top

195
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,388
and defensive types at the bottom.

196
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,588
Previously, you used

197
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:21,148
an offensive round-headed racket.

198
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:22,028
Am I right?

199
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,348
You can try these few ones on top.

200
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:30,788
We use

201
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:31,828
the latest nickel-titanium alloy fiber

202
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,428
as our material.

203
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,508
But our technical department

204
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:36,588
made a bold attempt

205
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,027
this time.

206
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:40,588
It feels a bit heavier

207
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:42,147
than the average offensive racket.

208
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,147
It puts a little pressure on the hand.

209
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,027
We studied the mainstream trend

210
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:46,988
of the evolution of racket types

211
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,308
over the past few years,

212
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,108
which is to reduce the weight

213
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,348
of the racket.

214
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,988
But pursuing weight reduction blindly

215
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:54,188
may not be a good thing.

216
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,428
Sometimes,
too much technological innovation

217
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:57,908
will reduce the requirements

218
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:58,788
for the physical fitness of the athlete.

219
00:08:58,948 --> 00:08:59,948
The racket

220
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:00,988
you're holding now

221
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:03,428
requires athletes
to have higher upper limb skills

222
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:04,828
and strength.

223
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:05,588
In other words,

224
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,988
it's more rigorous

225
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:07,828
and refined training.

226
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:08,828
It's not as easy

227
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:09,428
as it sounds.

228
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,588
There are harder ones.

229
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:12,548
As for the sweet spot,

230
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:13,628
we have reduced its size

231
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:14,628
within a reasonable range.

232
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:15,948
Expanding the sweet spot

233
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:17,028
may make hitting

234
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,268
the shuttlecock appears easier,

235
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,908
but the best technique

236
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,708
will always be hitting the bull's eye.

237
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,268
Our technical director believes

238
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:26,588
that whoever can break
through this comfort zone,

239
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:28,068
this racket

240
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,028
will become a powerful tool.

241
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:33,228
So are you saying

242
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,428
I can put this racket to good use?

243
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,628
Young Space chose Jin Yi,

244
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,628
but I still want to choose you.

245
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,108
You know what my psychology issues are.

246
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:55,748
I'm about to retire.

247
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:57,308
Do you really want to retire?

248
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:00,708
Then why are you submitting

249
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,628
your retirement application

250
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,868
while donating money to the hospital?

251
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:07,228
Aren't you also hoping

252
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:08,428
that perhaps by helping

253
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,028
one more person

254
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,148
or maybe this is the day

255
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,068
or this once,

256
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:17,428
you would recover?

257
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:19,028
Am I right?

258
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:32,228
Of course,

259
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,068
sometimes treatment

260
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,108
for the psychological disorder

261
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,148
is very mysterious.

262
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:36,748
Maybe you can go

263
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:37,988
and ask for a talisman, burn incense,

264
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,508
and find a master to change your name.

265
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,868
Don't call yourself
Song Sanchuan anymore.

266
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,148
Call yourself Song Eighteen.

267
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:43,988
How about this?

268
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,468
When you go home tomorrow,

269
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,188
stay home and copy the number eighteen

270
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,508
a hundred times

271
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:49,228
and post it all over your house.

272
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,588
You can look at them every day.

273
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,588
Stimulating therapy
can be very effective.

274
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,548
Do you think
what you're saying makes sense?

275
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,308
Song Sanchuan,

276
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:03,908
hold on to this racket

277
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,308
and train with it for two months.

278
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,468
Win against Jin Yi

279
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,548
at the championship in two months.

280
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,068
You can do it.

281
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,188
What if I really beat him?

282
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:24,548
Will you admit that you messed up

283
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:25,828
in choosing people for the job?

284
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:28,988
If you beat him,

285
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:29,908
promise me that you'll sign

286
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,348
with Young Space.

287
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,068
I'll have two potential underdogs

288
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,388
inside and outside.

289
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:33,908
I don't lose anything.

290
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,628
I almost believed what you said.

291
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,388
It's hard for a merchant to change, huh?

292
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:44,108
I'm not going to practice.

293
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,788
You can give me a new one.

294
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:15,908
Mr. Jie,

295
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:16,868
I've reserved a private room

296
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,268
under Ms. Liang for two people.

297
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:19,268
Do you want me to tell Mr. Zhang

298
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,308
to wait for you nearby?

299
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:21,028
No need.

300
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:22,068
You both can go back after this.

301
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:23,748
Okay.

302
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:26,108
I've picked a necklace

303
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,308
as the gift within the budget

304
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:28,628
of 20,000 yuan you've required.

305
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,788
Don't get reimbursement
from the company.

306
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:31,988
I'll pay for it personally.

307
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:33,628
Okay.

308
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:39,228
Are you okay lately?

309
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:40,868
What about me?

310
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:45,708
Did you try

311
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:47,708
to pursue Nate

312
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:49,228
because you wanted to go to Singapore

313
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:50,948
but were rejected by him?

314
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:52,748
That was a bad sight.

315
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,148
Did he tell you that?

316
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:57,788
No, it wasn't him.

317
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,828
But the whole company is spreading it.

318
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:02,388
It looks like his way of doing things.

319
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,028
Nipping it in the bud

320
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,388
before it becomes a problem for himself.

321
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:09,948
I'll get going then.

322
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:10,788
You can go home now.

323
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:11,788
Okay.

324
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,640
(Young Space chose Jin Yi,)

325
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,680
(but I still want to choose you.)

326
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,640
(Win against Jin Yi)

327
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,760
(at the championship in two months.)

328
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,680
(You can do it.)

329
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:41,868
Is it that nice to touch?

330
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,908
You've been staring at this sweet spot

331
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,268
for half an hour.

332
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:49,868
Do you want to switch to this racket?

333
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,988
The string tension is clearly lighter.

334
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,748
It's heavier

335
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,108
and the sweet spot is smaller.

336
00:13:58,908 --> 00:13:59,628
If I use it,

337
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:00,668
all physical abilities and techniques

338
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:01,628
must be adjusted accordingly.

339
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,068
It's different from the one

340
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:04,708
you used to like.

341
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:06,708
It's challenging to switch.

342
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,148
But I think

343
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,508
you can handle it.

344
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,428
Why?

345
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,560
(Y-SPACE)
Isn't this the Young Space logo?

346
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:15,988
I can probably guess

347
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,468
who gave it to you.

348
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,748
But let's not talk
about the racket's durability yet.

349
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,028
The person will definitely work.

350
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,468
Stop trying

351
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,548
to imply something.

352
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,468
I'm talking about this racket,
not the person.

353
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,708
I meant you'll definitely work it out.

354
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,148
Who were you thinking about?

355
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:36,908
Don't touch my racket.

356
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:39,308
Who are you meeting?

357
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,468
Just mind your own business.

358
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:45,468
How can someone like him exist?

359
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:46,868
He turned the tables on me,

360
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,588
saying I clung to him

361
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,588
because I wanted to go to Singapore.

362
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:51,348
Now

363
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,268
even my boss knows about it.

364
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,068
Today,

365
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:54,348
he was clearly judging me

366
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,668
not to think
about transferring elsewhere

367
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,268
to the point everyone knew about it.

368
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,668
It was as if he mistreated me.

369
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:00,308
Listen.

370
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,868
I'm being serious here.

371
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,228
Compared to Nate,

372
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,708
even Chen Yiyang looks decent now.

373
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,148
I feel sick

374
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:06,108
to my stomach

375
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,468
as if I've eaten a fly.

376
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:08,708
When it comes to relationships,

377
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,548
it's more important to choose someone
with good character.

378
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:11,028
At least,

379
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:11,908
he won't maliciously attack you

380
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:13,228
when the relationship ended.

381
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,748
My head hurts at the thought of it.

382
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,668
I feel ashamed

383
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:16,708
of my fleeting thought

384
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,668
of wanting to have

385
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,548
a child with him.

386
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:19,868
I am deeply ashamed.

387
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:21,428
That's unnecessary.

388
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,508
You were forced into it
by circumstances.

389
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:26,548
Tomorrow.

390
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,508
I'll finish this job tomorrow.

391
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:30,588
I made good money this time.

392
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,868
I'll treat you to a night out

393
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:33,948
and we'll get drunk

394
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,800
(and forget about everything.)

395
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,068
Okay, let's get drunk.

396
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:37,868
You go ahead and do your work first.

397
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:38,788
See you.

398
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,988
This guy is so unbelievable.

399
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,308
Where did you come from?

400
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,428
I came to eat.

401
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:54,548
I saw you

402
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:55,308
busy making gestures

403
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,148
over the phone from a distance.

404
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,668
I wanted to listen
to what you were talking about.

405
00:15:58,668 --> 00:15:59,268
But

406
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:00,708
I was afraid of being accused

407
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:02,308
of eavesdropping.

408
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:03,468
So, I waited
until you finished your call

409
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:04,068
before coming over.

410
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,388
It's not good for a kid
to bear grudges too.

411
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:09,468
Thank you.

412
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:10,548
Here's your wonton.

413
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,508
Please enjoy.

414
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:27,228
I've already canceled

415
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:28,188
my qualifications
as a private car driver.

416
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:29,508
I'm also

417
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,388
going to stop working

418
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:30,988
other odd jobs either.

419
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,988
I'm going to train hard
for the next two months.

420
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,348
Do you have enough

421
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:39,028
new rackets?

422
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,388
Yes.

423
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,748
Thank you.

424
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:53,908
Why are you suddenly being so polite?

425
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,908
It's making me uncomfortable.

426
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,348
I've been thanking you

427
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,028
since I met you.

428
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:02,868
Most of the memories

429
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:03,788
about another person

430
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,388
in the mind are warm.

431
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,588
Actually, I'm not used to it either.

432
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:14,668
Mister!

433
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,668
I'll order one for you.

434
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,307
Mister!

435
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,188
Give me a bowl of wonton.

436
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:32,988
Thank you

437
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,628
for sending me home.

438
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,628
Seesaw.

439
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,788
Are you brave enough to play?

440
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,028
What's scary about it?

441
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,108
Wait!

442
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:51,148
Wait! Hold it!

443
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,748
Who plays see-saw like this?

444
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,708
We're turning in a different direction.

445
00:17:57,788 --> 00:17:58,508
Slow down! Not too fast.

446
00:17:58,628 --> 00:17:59,388
Please!

447
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:00,148
Slow down! You're going too fast.

448
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,068
Hold on tight.

449
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:03,028

we could find

478
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:50,068
that Jin Yi uses.

479
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,508
There's still one more box in Thailand.

480
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,428
How many do we have here?

481
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:55,708
Sixty-two.

482
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,548
Production has been slowing down
since they stopped making them.

483
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:58,628
We put a lot of effort

484
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,028
to get these here.

485
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,468
We still have to persuade him

486
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:02,548
to use our rackets.

487
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,708
If he gets good results

488
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,628
and gets more exposure,

489
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:05,508
he'll definitely

490
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:06,308
our products.

491
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:08,028
Let's put these into the box.

492
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:08,748
Okay.

493
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,308
Hello, Ms. Chen.

494
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:22,268
Yes.

495
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,708
Sure, I'll go and see you
at the law firm.

496
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,428
I'll see you later.

497
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,708
Did the boss's wife want to see you?

498
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:32,588
Chen Ke

499
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:33,948
wants to have lunch with me.

500
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:35,588
How about

501
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:36,868
you pack up all these rackets first?

502
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:37,628
When I come back,

503
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,228
I'll send these rackets with you
to the badminton team.

504
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,308
Aren't you taking me along?

505
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,260
(Enjoy Wealth)

506
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,628
According to your needs,

507
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:47,468
this plan is very suitable for you.

508
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:49,268
You can change

509
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:50,388
the list of the insured individual

510
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:51,708
at any time.

511
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,508
This way,

512
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:52,988
you don't need

513
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:53,748
to create

514
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:55,028
a separate account for your son.

515
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,268
I will look into the details later.

516
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:57,708
Okay.

517
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:59,388
Thank you, Zhang.

518
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:00,108
You're welcome.

519
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:03,548
Excuse me, Ms. Liang is here.

520
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,428
I'll get going, then.

521
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:06,348
Call me if you need anything.

522
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:06,948
Okay.

523
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:08,108
You'an,

524
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:09,508
thank you for coming.

525
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:10,828
Sorry to call you out

526
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:12,068
when your lunch time is limited.

527
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,388
It's okay. I'm not that busy today.

528
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,428
The food is served.

529
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:15,788
I won't take too much of your time.

530
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:18,828
I happened to shop around in the area

531
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:20,508
and saw a set of skin care products.

532
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:21,948
Take it and try it out.

533
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,148
But this is

534
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:23,908
too expensive.

535
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:24,788
You must have spent a fortune on this.

536
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:26,268
Not at all, you're being modest.

537
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:27,748
You work overtime every day

538
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:28,628
and often stay up late.

539
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:30,708
Consider this as compensation.

540
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,348
All right, I'll take it.

541
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:34,308
Thank you, Ke.

542
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,308
Last night,

543
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:39,628
he came home pretty late.

544
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:40,908
He was out socializing again.

545
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:42,948
Thank you.

546
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,308
Yes, he has a private dinner yesterday.

547
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:47,588
Mr. Zhang and I went with him.

548
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:49,948
But he took a taxi home.

549
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:52,348
Ke,

550
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:55,188
Mr. Jie did meet a client

551
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,228
to express his thanks.

552
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:56,868
Think about it.

553
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,068
Since Mr. Zhang and I

554
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:58,828
went there with him,

555
00:21:58,828 --> 00:21:59,628
it's definitely

556
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,788
his schedule is definitely transparent.

557
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:06,548
I'm just having a casual chat with you.

558
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:07,948
Don't be too nervous.

559
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,908
Eat something.

560
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:10,948
Okay.

561
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,788
You don't have to reimburse
from the company.

562
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:25,068
I'll pay for it personally.

563
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:26,868
Consider it my gratitude

564
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,228
to Alex.

565
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:30,308
Do you need a ride home?

566
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,068
Okay, thank you.

567
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:31,748
Okay.

568
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:33,268
To Linglong Mansion.

569
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:01,388
By the way,

570
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:02,908
you suggested last time

571
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:04,828
that Mr. Jie should go
and watch Jiao Jiao's game.

572
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:05,988
I thought about it.

573
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:06,788
If it's on a Saturday,

574
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:08,188
Mr. Jie should be able to make it.

575
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:09,628
After all, every Saturday afternoon

576
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:11,268
is your family day.

577
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:13,148
If Mr. Jie has something urgent,

578
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:14,988
he'll definitely reschedule.

579
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:16,708
Next time, you can let me know
in advance.

580
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,668
I'll make sure
to keep Mr. Jie's schedule open.

581
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,308
It doesn't matter.

582
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,920
We can talk about it later.

583
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,188
Anyway,

584
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,548
I'm actually quite glad

585
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:25,708
that

586
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,188
you're his executive assistant.

587

(Shenzhen Xinyi Sports Training Base)

588
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:36,628
Is this all the rackets?

589
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,508
It's just enough
for this year's tournament.

590
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:43,668
We have a lot of Young Space rackets.

591
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:45,028
If you have time,

592
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:46,068
you can come and pick some out.

593
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:48,388
I remember when I signed the contract,

594
00:23:49,348 --> 00:23:51,868
rackets were excluded, right?

595
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,228
Yes.

596
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,988
But as a long-term partner,

597
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,028
you'll definitely endorse

598
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:02,268
our entire product line in the future.

599
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:04,468
Why not take advantage
of this objective condition?

600
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:05,508
I'd still suggest you

601
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:06,508
choose

602
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:07,348
our rackets first.

603
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:08,428
Song Sanchuan,

604
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,868
these are your rackets.

605
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:10,908
Please sign here.

606
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,588
This box is from Young Space.

607
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,388
Song Sanchuan chose
this one last time.

608
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:34,748
Please check.

609
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,228
It's your latest material

610
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:40,948
and technology?

611
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,948
These look crude.

612
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,508
Are you trying to give up?

613
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:56,988
Would you dare to have a match with me

614
00:24:58,348 --> 00:24:59,708
during the tournament
two months from now?

615
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,308
Why are you trying to show off?

616
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:05,468
I'm not scared of you.

617
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:06,708
Okay.

618
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:10,348
Don't chicken out and do anything funny.

619
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:12,868
I'll ask the coach

620
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:14,388
to let us be in the same group.

621
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:16,108
We'll watch and see.

649
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:35,668
and help your mom serve the dishes.

650
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,228
All you do is talk

651
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,428
without lifting a finger.

652
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:44,948
You're right.

653
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:46,708
It's because you make the money.

654

00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:49,308
No problem, Mr. Jiang.

656
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,228
I'll go and get some work done, okay?

657
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:52,428
I'll get my assistant
to register for a course

658
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:53,348
for you

659
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:54,748
to learn how to speak with manners.

660
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:56,428
I guess you won't be able to live

661
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:57,628
without your assistant.

662
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,748
You can even find a bottle opener.

663
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,868
You're the mighty boss,

664
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:05,068
how come you can't find
the bottle opener?

665
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:06,228
You can't take care of yourself.

666
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:07,428
What else can you do?

667
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,468
Say that again.

668
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,628
Enough you two.

669
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:12,388
This is the only day

670
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:14,108
we get to eat together.

671
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:14,988
Can't we have

672
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,428
a more pleasant atmosphere?

673
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,068
Besides,

674
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,308
my cooking isn't that bad.

675
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:19,108
You don't need
to spray your saliva on it

676
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:19,908
as you bicker.

677
00:27:23,828 --> 00:27:25,668
Mom, let me help you out.

678
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:33,708
Dad,

679
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:35,868
your three ways of pleasing mom

680
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:36,988
are so fake.

681
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:39,508
First, the fake hug.

682
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,428
Second, picking food for her.

683
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:42,708
Third, paying with your credit card.

684
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,828
If mom isn't tired of it, but I am.

685
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:47,148
Do you even know what it is to support
each other without any romance

686
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:49,828
when you don't have a girlfriend?

687
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,668
Even food can't keep you from talking.

688
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,508
I had lunch with Liang You'an

689
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:55,108
the other day.

690
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,308
She told me

691
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,028
the progress

692
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:02,668
of the Underdog project

693
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:03,908
is going smoothly.

694
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,108
Yes,

695
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:08,988
it's easier with her keeping

696
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:10,348
an eye on things.

697
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,400
(Chen Zhe)
Do you want to come out? I'll pick you up.

698
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,148
I'm done eating.

699
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:25,868
Mom, Dad, I have plans.

700
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:26,908
So I'm going out for a bit.

701
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:28,788
Must you go out today?

702
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,668
I'm giving you guys
some alone time together.

703
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:33,148
See how considerate I am of you.

704
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,468
Mom, I need to use your car.

705
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:16,988
This place is not bad.

706
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,668
The card was definitely worth it.

707
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:21,388
No matter how great it is,

708
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:23,148
I'm the only one accompanying you.

709
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:25,588
A good meal is worth the wait.

710
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:27,108
What's the rush?

711
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:32,028
Hello.

712
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:33,548
Do you want to play games?

713
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:34,908
Sure.

714
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:35,748
Come.

715
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:36,908
Take a seat.

716
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:37,908
Please scoot over.

717
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:42,588
What are we playing?

718
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:43,708
Shake the dice.

719
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:44,828
Losers will drink the beer.

720
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,628
I'm good at this game.

721
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:49,548
Are you pretending not to know me?

722
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,148
What a tacky pickup line.

723
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:55,428
No WeChat, no phone number.

724
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:56,628
A meeting like this must be fate.

725
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,028
Let's have fun tonight.

726
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,588
See how clear-headed she is.

727
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:01,868
Come on, let's drink.

728
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:04,228
What do you want to drink?

729
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:05,628
Anything is fine.

730
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:06,908
It's harder to get drunk
on expensive drinks.

731
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:11,908
Bring out your full set
of Dragon God Champagne.

732
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:12,708
Okay.

733
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:13,948
Here.

734
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:23,628
Let's open it.

735
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:25,308
Wait a minute.

736
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:27,308
Can you help me take a video, please?

737
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:29,388
Sure.

738
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,708
Hello...

739
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:35,468
Sorry.

740
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:36,508
But can you move a bit?

741
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:38,228
Thank you.

742
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:43,028
Thank you very much.

743
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,148
Let's do it again.

744
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:49,668
Hello, everyone.

745
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,148
I'm Tao, your only Tao.

746
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:51,748
Today,

747
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:52,708
I'm going to show you

748
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,308
the legendary Dragon God Champagne set.

749
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:09,268
Do you really not recognize me?

750
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,108
I didn't recognize you.

751
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:16,468
But I do recognize your watch.

752
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:17,268
I find you

753
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:18,068
very interesting.

754
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:20,348
You really think highly

755
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:22,108
of yourself.

756
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:26,908
I'm not like

757
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:28,428
the girls

758
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:29,828
you met here.

759
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:31,868
I'm here to develop my career.

760
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:33,668
I have no interest in people.

761
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:34,748
Don't think too much.

762
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:35,908
I'm even less interested in you.

763
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:37,188
That's perfect.

764
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:37,908
A second-generation rich kid

765
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:39,108
is not worth my time.

766
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,828
Please excuse me.

767
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,720
(Hello, everyone.)

768
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
(I'm Tao, your only Tao.)

769
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,760
(Today,)

770
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
(I'm going to show you)

771
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,360
(the legendary
Dragon God Champagne set.)

772
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:58,628
What is she doing?

773
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,988
She never does anything decent all day.

774
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,040
(So let's keep the momentum going.)

775
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,760
(Which flavor)

776
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,440
(do you like to drink?)

777
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,740
(Liang Shu)

778
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
(Hello)

779
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:23,628
An.

780
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:24,308
What do you want?

781
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,520
(You're the most reliable one.)

782
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,200
(You always have your phone with you.)

783
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,308
I'm having breakfast at the eatery.

784
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,308
You see.

785
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,228
I don't have enough money

786
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:35,028
to pay for breakfast.

787
00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:36,588
Can you transfer some money to me?

788
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,880
(How much?)

789
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,028
I need 50 yuan.

790
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:40,588
Just 50 yuan.

791
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,420
(Transfer 50 yuan to Liang Shu)

792
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:47,628
Okay, done.

793
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:49,828
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

794
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,948
I haven't talked
about the main thing yet.

795
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,680
(After Liang Tao resigned)

796
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,440
(from her previous job,)

797
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,680
(it's been three months ever since.)

798
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,880
(She still hasn't found)

799
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,840
(a decent job.)

800
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,600
(You're holding a high position
at your company, right?)

801
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:04,308
Executive Assistant to the CEO.

802
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
(Please lend a hand and arrange a job)

803
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,200
(for your sister there.)

804
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,028
Sister?

805
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:10,708
My mom only gave birth to me.

806
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,388
I'm the only daughter.

807
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:12,468
When did I have a sister?

808
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,400
(You're both)

809
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,040
(my daughters.)

810
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:18,748
At least find her a stable job

811
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,628
with insurance and housing fund.

812
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,520
(That would be enough for me.)

813
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:25,828
An,

814
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,668
can you do this

815
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:29,348
for me considering

816
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,320
(how I helped you before?)

817
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,388
Stop right there.

818
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:33,868
I can't arrange it.

819
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:34,868
What's wrong with you?

820
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:35,668
It's already bright outside.

821
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:36,388
You've had breakfast

822
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:37,588
and you're still talking in your sleep?

823
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,820
(National Badminton Championships)

824
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:24,508
(The match is over.)

825
00:34:24,508 --> 00:34:25,468
(Song Sanchuan won.)

826
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:26,588
A score of 21-15

827
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:27,627
and 21-10.

828
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:29,147
Okay.

829
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,227
He won in straight sets.

830
00:34:31,227 --> 00:34:31,948
So he won.

831
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:54,948
The match is over.

832
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,468
Jin Yi won.

833
00:34:57,588 --> 00:34:59,667
They'll face each other

834
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:00,868
in the quarterfinals tomorrow.

835
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:02,748
Mr. Jie will also come
to watch the game tomorrow.

836
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:04,308
Remember to arrange his schedule.

837
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:05,188
Okay.

838
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:07,068
Is Jin Yi steady?

839
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:08,868
Can he beat Song Sanchuan?

840
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:10,748
I've already arranged

841
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:11,668
the media press release.

842
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:13,588
Jin Yi is the most-watched player

843
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:14,868
in this tournament.

844
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:16,468
It's not that Jin Yi
can't afford to lose.

845
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:18,828
It's that our marketing department
that can't afford to lose.

846
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:24,068
Tomorrow,

847
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,548
we'll have the results.

848
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,660
(National Badminton Championships)

849
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
(Men Singles First Match)

850
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,460
(Song Sanchuan 1: Jin Yi 0)

851
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,140
(Song Sanchuan 2: Jin Yi 0)

852
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,380
(National Badminton Championships)

853
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,460
(Song Sanchuan 14: Jin Yi 10)

854
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:09,428
Is Song Sanchuan

855
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,068
clueless about the situation?

856
00:37:11,468 --> 00:37:12,948
Aren't they on the same team?

857
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:14,748
Mr. Jie,

858
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,308
they are teammates and also opponents.

859
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:20,908
Did you not inform them in advance?

860
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:22,668
Jin Yi cannot afford

861
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:24,148
to lose this match.

862
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:28,028
Mr. Jie, didn't you say

863
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:29,588
skills and mental strength

864
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:30,588
are all that matter

865
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:31,468
in a match?

866
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:33,388
We can't control

867
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,388
the outcome of the match, can we?

868
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:37,388
But what I can do is

869
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,828
have a plan and a publicity strategy

870
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:40,988
regardless of
whether Jin Yi wins or loses.

871
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:42,508
That's enough talking.

872
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,028
What I want is results.

873
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:45,908
There must be

874
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:47,388
no mistakes in this match.

875
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:49,628
Keep an eye on the situation here.

876
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:50,508
I'm leaving now.

877
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:51,148
Okay.

878
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:53,548
Please send the boss off.

879
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,420
(Song Sanchuan 17: Jin Yi 12)

880
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,380
(Song Sanchuan 18: Jin Yi 12)

881
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,140
(Song Sanchuan 18: Jin Yi 12)

882
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,940
(Song Sanchuan 18: Jin Yi 14)

883
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,540
(Song Sanchuan 18: Jin Yi 16)

884
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,300
(Song Sanchuan 18: Jin Yi 17)

885
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,520
(I don't want to play anymore.)

886
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
(It's pointless.)

887
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,600
(You've always been the benchmark)

888
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,000
(of my youth training team.)

889
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,320
(But I didn't expect you)

890
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,200
(to end up like this.)

891
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,760
(Stop trying to act tough!)

892
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,000
(If you're really capable,)

893
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,800
(why did Liang You'an sign me)

894
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,600
(instead of you?)

895
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,160
(My highest record
in the past two years)

896
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,680
(was 21 consecutive losses.)

897
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,640
(At that time, there was only)

898
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,440
(one thing on my mind.)

899
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,640
(That I'm absolutely a piece of trash.)

900
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
(Why am I still standing here?)

901
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
(Song Sanchuan.)

902
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,360
(Song Sanchuan.)

903
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,400
(She said your team had a hidden gem.)

904
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:35,108
She was talking about you, right?

905
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,640
(Aren't you also hoping)

906
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,680
(that maybe this is the day)

907
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,000
(or this once)

908
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,280
(when you would recover?)

909
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:46,708
Young Space chose Jin Yi,

910
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:48,988
but I still want to choose you.

911
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,988
Win against Jin Yi with dignity.

912
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:53,668
You can definitely do it.
