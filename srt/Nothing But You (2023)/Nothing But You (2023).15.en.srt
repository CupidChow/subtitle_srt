(I Can't Take Back
The Fact That I Love You For Now)

4
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
Serving near the centre line.

5
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,720
This kid learns very quickly.

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
He learns and applies it immediately.

7
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:49,352
Service break from Song Sanchuan!

8
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Good one!

9
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,160
In the last two months,

10
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
I've been thinking about

11
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
your serving habits,

12
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
the course of the ball,
and your techniques

13
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
as you teach.

14
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,240
I even asked your ex-teammates

15
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,000
for clips of your games

16
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
just to counter you

17
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,000
and study you.

18
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
I admit.

19
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,480
I only managed to understand

20
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,400
how to break you.

21
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,840
If I can't score in 3 strokes,

22
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,440
I'll surely lose on the baseline.

23
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,360
But if I can learn this,

24
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
I can learn other skills too.

25
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
This is my strength

26
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,960
and my determination
to transition to tennis.

27
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
I always keep my promise.

28
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,120
You're the captain.

29
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Coach Yan.

30
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,840
I know

31
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,840
you might have

32
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
some misunderstanding about me.

33
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,720
But what you said about Ms. Liang

34
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,640
was rude and wrong.

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
I hope you can

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
take back what you said.

37
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,320
Liang You'an!

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,080
You're good.

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
You've got someone gutsy on your team.

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm impressed.

41
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Train with me tomorrow.

42
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
Thank you, Coach Yan.

43
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
Good.

44
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
Good!

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
Sanchuan!

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,120
Hello, Captain.

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,320
Captain Sanchuan!

48
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
Captain Sanchuan!

49
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,120
Sanchuan!

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,600
Everyone, cheers!

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,320
Come.

52
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,920
Come on.

53
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
Cheers.

54
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,560
Everyone, I have a few words.

55
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,640
Today is a celebration for my dear buddy

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,960
who successfully transitioned
from badminton to tennis.

57
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
From now on, he will be staying

58
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,520
in the club.

59
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
Tonight,

60
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,280
the bill is on me!

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,080
Order anything you want!

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,760
Good!

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Shame on you.

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,840
What is wrong with you?

65
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,560
Can't you keep a low profile?

66
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,760
I'm happy.

67
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Chuan.

68
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,360
Based on the stroke

69
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
that broke Zhang Yan...

70
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,960
Seriously.

71
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm willing to pay
for him to be trending

72
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,040
as a celebration.

73
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
All right. Keep it down.

74
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,520
You're exaggerating.

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,360
There's nothing wrong.

76
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
You avenged us.

77
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
That was amazing!

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,280
Song Sanchuan.

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
Before this,

80
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,440
I had doubts about you.

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
From today onwards,

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
I'll call you my brother.

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,360
I was wrong
about what happened in the past.

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll drink this.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Dai Yi.

86
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
You have to drink with Chuan

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,280
today.

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,640
I can only drink after 3 months.

89
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,960
Chen Zhe. That's too much.

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,920
Ignore him.

91
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,600
Thank you.

92
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,280
All of you

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,040
have been fooled

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,480
by his innocent looks.

95
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,960
I saw it the other day.

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,160
Yi has a girlfriend.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,680
Right?

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
No. That was just a friend.

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
It's true?

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
No way. Is it true?

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,120
A friend?

102
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,760
A friend.

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,240
Are we failures or what?

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,440
We're even older than him.

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,360
Jiang Jiaojiao, forever alone.

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,080
Me, I've always been around women.

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,960
Chuan.

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,680
What about you?

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
I have someone I like.

110
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Who is it?

111
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Let us help you.

112
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,720
I should rely on myself

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,400
for something like this.

114
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,360
What a party pooper.

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,360
Party pooper!

116
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
Drink!

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,920
Come on. Drink.

118
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,200
You're not even going to tell us...

119
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,640
Let's drink.

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,560
Drink!

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,880
I'll drink.

122
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
Drink!

123
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,880
Fish. Fish is served.

124
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Our fish.

125
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,160
Nonsense.

126
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,840
No, I didn't.

127
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,080
Ask Dai Yi if you don't believe it.

128
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,920
You're not pure. You're perverted.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,680
You know?

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
No. It's not true.

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,360
No. How is that...

132
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,760
Don't talk nonsense.

133
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,040
Listen to me.

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm very happy today.

135
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,960
This is the happiest day

136
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,120
of my life.

137
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,960
This is something

138
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,640
I've never experienced before
in a company.

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:50,960
I'm serious.

140
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,080
It's not about the money in sports.

141
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,880
It's the passion for sports.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,080
Today,

143
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,400
under the influence of alcohol,

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I just want to

145
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,320
tell everyone

146
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
our goal in the next phase today.

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,520
Cheers.

148
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,040
Come. Cheers.

149
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,760
Drink!

150
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Bottoms up.

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,880
Bottoms up?

152
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,440
Of course.

153
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,520
Come.

154
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Here.

155
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,560
Don't sleep, Jiao.

156
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
How is that possible?

157
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,360
No way!

158
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,760
Look.

159
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,720
Not asleep.

160
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,480
What are we looking at?

161
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,520
Come back.

162
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,520
We must take turns.

163
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,280
(Final Goal)
I know

164
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
(Final Goal)
our club is now

165
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,520
(Final Goal)
a semi-professional

166
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,030
and semi-commercial club

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,790
but I want

168
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,240
to turn it into a professional club

169
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
in one year.

170
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,760
We will have the best players

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
playing in the best tournaments.

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,160
I want the

173
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,320
A-rank for our club.

174
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,720
Can you hear her?

175
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,280
A-ranked club, everyone.

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
Stop laughing.

177
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm telling you.

178
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
All of you have KPI.

179
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:58,960
Do you know that?

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,720
Jiang Jiaojiao.

181
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Yes!

182
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,560
I want you

183
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,120
to play in the KPT.

184
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
Ms. Liang.

ATP.

187
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
ATP.

188
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,200
The main tournament of the ATP.

189
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,640
I swear to complete my mission!

190
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,520
Are you sure?

191
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Chen Zhe.

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,080
You'll play the corporate tournaments

193
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,080
and become a champion.

194
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,200
Dai Yi.

195
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
You don't have to say anything.

206
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,240
Exactly.

No. I just think

210
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,840
that Ms. Liang is being too ambitious.

211

Okay.

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,960
Of course, we have to be ambitious.

You'll go on a date with me

298
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,760
When I was young,

299

310
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,000
You're the expert.

311
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,160
When I played with Zhang Yan,

312
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
I heard you counting the scores.

313
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,240

314
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,680
That was professional.

315
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,960
You knew zero is called "love".

316
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,360
When you were having extra training,

317
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
I wasn't just hanging around, all right?

318
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,160
I was working overtime and doing homework too.

319
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I also know

320
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,520
that zero in tennis

321
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,800
actually originated from the word "egg" in French.

322
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
In French, it's L'oeuf.

323
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,600
When it came to
English-speaking countries,

324
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
a closer pronunciation for it was needed,

325
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,760
so it turned into love.

326
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,720
Saying zero as love...

327
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,200
Those who play tennis are indeed romantic.

328
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
I've decided.

329
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,880
At every start of the game

330
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,520
I'll do my best to win every set

331
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
and shut out my opponent

332
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,520
because you sound amazing

333
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,520
when you pronounce the word "love".

334
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
Do you know that?

335
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,200

One last chance.

387
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,440
One last chance.

388
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,960
If I don't get it this time,

389
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,840
we'll leave.

390
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,960
Sure. One last chance.

391
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,840
Don't get addicted.

392
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,080
One last chance.

393
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll surely get it.

394
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,320

Ten steps.

427
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,320
I don't need ten steps.

428
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,520
One, two, three.

429
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,880

430
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
How was that? Am I good?

431
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,160
What is wrong?

432
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,400
Exhaling.

433
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,520
Liang You'an.

434
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
I've always wanted to ask you.

435
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,760
You're always calling me Liang You'an.

436
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,520
I'm so much older than you.

437
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,560
That's rude.

438
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,840
Why are you calling my full name just like that.

439
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,600
Liang You'an.

440
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,560
I've always wanted to tell you something

441
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,520
for a long time.

442
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,000
But I think I had to save it

443
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
until I can remain in the club

444
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,120
to say it.

445
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,680
It was quite tough to transition
from badminton to tennis

446
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
in the past three months.

447
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,200
The biggest difference

448
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,040
is that the shuttlecock

449
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,080
is not supposed to touch the ground.

450
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,160
You lose if it does.

451
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,640
However, the ball has to hit the ground

452
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
every single time in tennis.

453
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I spent a long time getting used to it.

454
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,440
Later, I thought about it
and it turns out

455
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,520
to be very much like me.

456
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,960
Ever since I met you,

457
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,960
my heart started falling.

458
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,120
I feel like

459
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm about to bounce up from the ground.

460
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,360
Leaving the badminton team

461
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
was the darkest moment in my life,

462
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,680
but you were like a bright light

463
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,760
shining through.

464
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,800
I didn't want
to be kicked out of the club

465
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
and I didn't want to disappoint you too.

466
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,080
I want to stand next to you with pride.

467
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
That day when everyone was talking...

468
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,120
Talking about
why we wanted to play tennis.

469
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,520
You said you wanted a champion.

470
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,840
I'll win it for you then.

471
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,160
Liang You'an.

472
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,520
I like you.

473
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,600
I really like you.

474
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,720
Liang You'an.

475
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,920
I like you.

476
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,440
I really like you.

477
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
What are you doing?

478
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,560
Didn't you

479
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,680
just prove to everyone with your ability

480
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,040
that we're not having that kind of relationship?

481
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,680
And now you're telling me

482
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,680
that you like me.

483
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,720
What are you trying to do?

484
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,680
I can't afford to accept your affection.

485
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,440
If I was ten years younger,

486
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,040
your confession

487
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,800
would have touched me

488
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,400
but this is the difference in time

489
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,480
between us.

490
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
Playing tennis,

491
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
winning against your opponent,

492
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
and becoming a champion

493
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,040
is all for yourself.

494
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,720
Don't associate it with me.

495
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,040
I can't afford to be responsible
for another person's life.

496
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,080
So,

497
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,000
are you rejecting me?

498
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,280
Yes.

499
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,560
I just want to focus on

500
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
making the best out of my club.

501
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,440
I have no time and energy

502
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,560
to think about other things.

503
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,480
In terms of playing tennis,

504
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,880
everything that I did for you

505
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,280
was the responsibility of a manager of the club

506
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,240
towards a player.

507
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,320
Please don't misunderstand.

508
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,080
You should also focus on

509
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,200
playing tennis

510
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
well.

511
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Take this.

512
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Shutting out your opponent

513
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,160

We went on a date today.

Did you give this or receive this?

557
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,000
I understand.

558
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,880

559
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,840

I was rejected.

561

You are

562

too young.

563
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,600
You can't even hide your feelings.

564
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,800
Confessing is like playing cards.

565
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
You have to play a few rounds

566
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,112
to roughly know

567
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,400

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,120

Confessions between adults

570
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,600
are implied

571
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,087
and they happen naturally.

572
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Unlike you.

573
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,880
You knew nothing

574
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
about your opponent's hand

575
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,280
and showed your cards.

576
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,920
It's prone to failure.

577
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
What do you mean by failure?

578
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,280
Even my seat at the table

579
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,000
was exchanged
from transitioning to tennis.

580
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
Do you think I'm hoping

581
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,920
for us to get together

582
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,760
from just one date?

583
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,680
But you are right.

584
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,680
I can't hide the fact

585
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,160
that I like her

586
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,720
and I don't want to.

587
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
So what if I failed?

588
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,280
If I'm rejected,

589
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,520
I will try harder.

590
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
There's no big deal.

591
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,520
Deliver the lightboard.

592
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:26,888
You just

593
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,840
rejected him completely?

594
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,000
Actually, you do have feelings for him.

595
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Right?

596
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,560
It's not necessary.

597
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,680
Are you still thinking about that jerk,

598
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,560
Yang Kaiqi?

599
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,320
You don't have to

600
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,440
miss out on

601
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,000
your beautiful future
for someone in the past.

602
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,600
It really has nothing to do with them.

603
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,320
It's exactly because

604
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,960
I've seen love like that

605
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,560
which made me believe

606
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
there's true love in this world.

607
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,680
I just don't think

608
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,680
true love will come to me.

609
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,360
I admit.

610
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,240
When Song Sanchuan confessed to me today,

611
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,640
he was very serious.

612
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
I was shocked.

613
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,680
But he's a kid.

614
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,640
How can a child's love be stable?

615
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,480
Even if it is passionate

616
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,600
and beautiful,

617
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,360
what if it is short and hurting?

618
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,240
I'd rather not start one.

619
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,520
Besides, you know that

620
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm out of energy lately.

621
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
One, the club hasn't made a profit.

622
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,920
Two, we are not an A-ranked club yet.

623
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,400
In less than two months,

624
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
I have been struggling with

625
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,480
more than a hundred things

626
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,280
and none of them

627
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,680
is related to falling in love
with a younger boy.

628
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,360
When do you think Liang You'an's

629
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,960
career-minded steel heart

630
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,000
will be melted?

631
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,630
Am I wrong?

632
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,040
It's not just for me,

633
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,440
the same goes for him.

634
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,150
He is

635
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,630
talented and has good conditions.

636
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,670
He already failed in badminton once

637
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,120
and finally transitioned
to tennis successfully.

638
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,710
Do you know how hard he worked for it?

639
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,400
Now that he's at this point,

640
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,230
what is he thinking?

641
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,710
He should focus on playing tennis.

642
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,630
You're just overthinking.

643
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,600
Can't you be

644
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,120
more straightforward
when it comes to relationships?

645
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,120
I admit it.

646
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm guilty.

647
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,920
His eyes when he confessed to me

648
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,670
and got rejected.

649
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,630
Do you know

650
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,760
how guilty I feel after seeing them?

651
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Why did I simply promise

652
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,360
to go to the zoo with him?

653
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,320
It was my fault.

654
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,120
I disagree.

655
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,080
You...

656
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,040
You shouldn't give yourself

657
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,640
too much moral pressure, all right?

658
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Look at you.

659
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,040
One, you didn't do anything
to misuse your powers.

660
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,680
Two, you thought about it well

661
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,480
and rejected him.

662
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,000
Forget it.

663
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,600
I'll think about

664
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
how I should interact with him

665
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,120
in the future.

666
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,840
Don't think about the future.

667
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,960
Think about tomorrow.

668
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,320
Meeting again

669
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,840
after being rejected.

670
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,960
Perhaps he will ignore you.

671
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
I don't think it's straight.

672
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,620
(Young Space Tennis Club)

673
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,040
You're here.

674
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,320
Take a look at this for me.

675
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,000
Is this word slanted?

676
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,600
To the right.

677
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,320
This way?

678
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,840
Is it okay?

679
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,160
Yes. It's good.

680
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,640
I booked this lightboard

681
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,920
half a month ago

682
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,240
and it's finally here today.

683
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,800
We don't have to

684
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,520
ask for other people's help anymore.

685
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,750
(Young Space Tennis Club)

686
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,440
Previously,

687
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
we talked about

688
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,040
our priority of getting

689
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
the A rank for our club.

690
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,240
These are the four criteria

691
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,320
the association came up.

692
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,080
(A-ranked Tennis Club Evaluation Standards)
First,

693
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
(A-ranked Tennis Club Evaluation Standards)
we need a complete

694
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,408
(A-ranked Tennis Club Evaluation Standards)

695
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:12,248
(A-ranked Tennis Club Evaluation Standards)
organizational structure

696
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,520
and possess
a certain number of training spaces.

697
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,400
In terms of training space,

698
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
it has always been

699
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,680
four indoor courts

700
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
and three outdoor courts.

701
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,520
Clay and sand courts

702
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,720
are bonus points.

703
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,840
We've achieved it

704
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
in terms of the training space

705
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,160
but the organizational structure

706
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
is not good enough now.

707
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,160
Regarding this,

708
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,120
I'll discuss it with you all

709
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,440
when the time comes.

710
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,080
The next one is the commercial requirement.

711
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,320
The number of commercial members

712
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,440
has to exceed 800 members.

713
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,520
When I took over Young Space Club,

714
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,160
there were about 200 commercial members

715
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,920
and we have about 500 members today.

716
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,680
We don't have much time.

717
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,600
I'll think of a way
to bring in more members.

718
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,640
The third criterion...

719
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,440
Having more than
ten professional players.

720
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
What is the evaluation standard?

721
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,160
Players with a CTN grade above intermediate

722
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,080
who can play professional games.

723
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,680
At the same time,
there can be no less than ten players

724
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,800
who have accumulated points.

725
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,960
We also need to make sure

726
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,160
three of the players

727
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,360
are in the top 100 in the country.

728
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,880
In our team,

729
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,400
the number of players
who can really play

730
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,800
is around five people?

731
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,720
Chen Zhe.

732
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,080
Work harder.

733
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,080
Then, we'll have six.

734
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,200
So far,

735
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,560
there are two female players

736
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,880
in the top 100

737
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,480
that are interested to join our club.

738
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,360
Jiang Jiaojiao. Work harder.

739
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,080
Make it to the men's top 100.

740
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,120
No problem.

741
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
You got this.

742
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,160
That means we still need

743
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,640
two more professional players
no matter what.

744
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,360
I'll recruit at the
Beijing Sport University tomorrow.

745
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,720
These three criteria are

746
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,840
basically considered achievable.

747
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,640
We can achieve this through various ways

748
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,760
and even solve it with money.

749
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,680
However,

750
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,200
the last criterion

751
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,440
is the most important.

752
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,480
Next year,

753
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,640
the association will organize

754
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,400
the National Club Tour.

755
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,600
Everyone's results

756
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,440
will be recorded and ranked.

757
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
Only the top ten clubs

758
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,920
(A-ranked Tennis Club Evaluation Standards)
will get the A-rank.

759
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,800
This most important item

760
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,440
will depend on everyone here and the coaches.

761
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,200
Coach Yan. Do you have anything

762
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,040
you wish to add?

763
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,000
Nothing.

764
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,640
Then, all the best.

765
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,280
Okay.

766
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,430
(Southern Sports University)

767
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,400
No matter what, I'm a dropout.

768
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,760
Standing at the school entrance

769
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,120
does cause some traumatic stress.

770
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,200
Competitive sport is really cruel.

771
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,520
In our school,

772
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,120
there are very few
who can make it to the top.

773
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,680
No one can make fun of others.

774
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,200
Regardless, sad memories were created here.

775
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,160
If it isn't for recruiting,

776
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
I won't want to step foot here.

777
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
I contacted a junior

778
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,720
who's in charge of student affairs.

779
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
I'll deal with her.

780
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
You just stay and watch.

781
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,200
I won't tell her

782
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,600
you were a dropout of this school.

783
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,480
Let's go.

784
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:14,871
The university's tennis stadium

785
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,599
is quite decent.

786
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,280
It is.

787
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,360
In the past two years,

788
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,480
many amazing talents were recruited.

789
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,440
They have very good results

790
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,160
and very good ranks.

791
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,200
Some of them even have their fan club.

792
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,960
Really?

793
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm back.

794
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,240
How was it?

795
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,760
(Campus Bulletin Board)
I spoke to the junior about recruitment.

796
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,800
She was

797
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,800
interested and passionate

798
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,000
but

799
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,800
do you know
who is in charge of the tennis team?

800
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,920
Who?

801
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,040
Yang Kaiqi.

802
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,120
He's now the dean of

803
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
School of Economics and Management.

804
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,760
Every dean

805
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,240
is in charge of one sport activity.

806
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,000
Tennis is under his watch.

807
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,040
They say

808
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,760
you are bound to meet your enemy.

809
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,920
It's real

810
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and true to its name.

811
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,280
Someone like him is even a dean now?

812
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,560
I never told you this before

813
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,320
but he used to ask me

814
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,280
if you would
attend the school celebration.

815
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,360
Of course, I told him
you were too lazy to attend.

816
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
He immediately
breathed a sigh of relief.

817
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:18,808
It meant

818
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,600
he was guilty of something.

819
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,240
Forget it.

820
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,680
Just consider it bad luck.

821
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,800
I'll think of other ways.

822
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,800
No.

823
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,240
Why don't we meddle with him

824
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,360
and teach him a lesson this time?

825
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,840
Something intense such as revenge

826
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,680
is not suited for some unrelated person.

827
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's go.

828
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,320
Alex recommended

829
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,440
a backup candidate for me anyway.

830
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,980
(Young Space Tennis Club)

831
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:48,660
(Office)

832
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,760
Did you have dinner?

833
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,560
I'm not hungry.

834
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm on a diet.

835
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,560
Anyway, this is your favourite

836
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,560
pork chop rice.

837
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,320
When I ordered,

838
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,440
I specified

839
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,040
to leave the cover open.

840
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,600
Otherwise, the pork chop won't be crispy.

841
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,480
Song Sanchuan.

842
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,200
Was I not clear enough?

843
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,520
You don't have to

844
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,240
spend effort and time

845
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,560
or remember my habits anymore.

846
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,360
It's a waste of time.

847
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,880
I stay back for extra training.

848
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,280
I ordered takeaway because I was hungry

849
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,840
and I wanted to eat.

850
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,600
I got the second meal at half price.

851
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,680
It was a good deal.

852
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,600
If you think

853
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,640
you can't eat with me around,

854
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,640
I can eat outside.

855
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
This is not what I meant.

856
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,120
You know what I mean.

857
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,800
Then is there a tap in a person's heart?

858
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,360
Can my feelings be turned on

859
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,120
and off as I wish?

860
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,280
I can't take back

861
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
