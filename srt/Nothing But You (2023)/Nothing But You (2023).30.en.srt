=Episode 30=

3
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,980
(- Do You Want To Be My Boyfriend?
- Yes, Yes, Yes.)

4
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,863
If I can't even play,

5
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,343
I'm worthless to you!

6
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,182
Is this what you really think of me?

7
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:13,783
If I can't play,

8
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,023
my photo will be taken down

9
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:22,663
and I'll be eliminated.

10
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:23,423
Isn't it?

11
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,900
(Authorized Relative Signature:
Liang You'an)

12
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,903
If your knee is damaged,

13
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:55,343
I'm willing to sign

14
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,983
and take responsibility
for you for the rest of your life.

15
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:01,623
So go for the surgery.

16
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:25,780
(In Operation)

17
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,383
It's consistent with my diagnosis.

18
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:47,823
The medial meniscus is damaged,

19
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:50,103
and the medial collateral ligament
is also affected.

20
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,543
Fortunately,

21
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,263
the anterior crucial ligament is fine.

22
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:54,703
Otherwise,

23
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,063
he can say goodbye to sports.

24
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,303
The surgery went well.

25
00:03:58,663 --> 00:03:59,703
But the recovery process

26
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,583
will be long and arduous.

27
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:03,143
Whether he can return

28
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,103
to his previous athletic level

29
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,383
depends on

30
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,463
his physical condition and willpower.

31
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:10,583
Thank you, doctor.

32
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:12,823
Take care and rest well.

33
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:13,623
It'll be difficult

34
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:15,063
for the first few days
after the surgery.

35
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,023
So hang in there

36
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:17,023
and don't get off the bed.

37
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:18,663
Until the pain subsides,

38
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:19,863
you can try and start walking.

39
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:22,823
The family members
must take good care of him.

40
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:24,263
Thank you.

41
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,063
You can go back now.

42
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:42,423
I'm sure there's a lot of work waiting

43
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:43,463
for you at the club.

44
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:47,023
I want to sleep for a while.

45
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:49,703
I'm not going.

46
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:51,863
It's okay.

47
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,023
I brought my tablet with me.

48
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:54,743
If anything happens,

49
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,303
so I can handle the issues online.

50
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,063
If you're thirsty or hungry,

51
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:58,543
just let me know.

52
00:04:58,543 --> 00:04:59,703
Can you find a male caregiver for me?

53
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,103
I don't want you here.

54
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:11,223
It's inconvenient.

55
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:19,823
All right.

56
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,303
I'll get going now.

57
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,983
Get some rest.

58
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:27,183
Just so you know.

59
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:28,983
Sleeping can improve a person's mood.

60
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:34,183
If you need anything, call me.

61
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:13,943
Why are you still awake?

62
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,903
I told you to go back.

63
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:21,303
Why did you come back?

64
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,903
I've finished my work.

65
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:26,103
I wanted to hire a male caregiver for you.

66
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:27,943
But Uncle An wants to come over
to keep you company.

67
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:29,303
So he went home to pack

68
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:30,263
some change of clothes.

69
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:32,383
He'll come and stay with you tonight.

70
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,023
I just wanted to come over
and see you first.

71
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:44,903
Does it still hurt?

72
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:46,623
Yes.

73
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:51,503
I just bought this downstairs.

74
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,303
It seems to be useful.

75
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:54,063
You can try it.

76
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,903
When it hurts, just grab it.

77
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:02,623
Does it work?

78
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,023
It doesn't do much.

79
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,383
Liang You'an,

80
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,743
can you stop coming

81
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,583
starting tomorrow?

82
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,463
Go back to the club.

83
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:25,503
When I lie on this bed,

84
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:31,903
I suddenly understood

85
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,463
the reason my mother left back then.

86
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:38,463
I don't want you

87
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:42,703
to see me like this.

88
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:47,783
Every time I see a glimmer of hope,

89
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,183
I just get slammed harder
into the ground.

90
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,623
If my leg doesn't recover this time,

91
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,023
I really want to stop struggling.

92
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:18,583
Song Sanchuan,

93
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,703
you know what?

94
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:24,263
When you were undergoing the surgery,

95
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,663
it didn't really take that long.

96
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,263
It was two hours.

97
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,703
But it felt like an eternity to me.

98
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,063
I almost asked the nurse
for an oxygen tank

99
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:40,263
because I couldn't catch my breath.

100
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,303
Before today, I always believed

101
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:46,343
when two people are in a relationship,

102
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:48,823
they must at least put in
an equal amount of effort,

103
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,583
like 50-50.

104
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:54,183
But today, I realized
I was wrong about that.

105
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:55,983
I realized

106
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,263
during certain critical moments in life,

107
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:00,463
even if

108
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,863
the other person
can only contribute one percent,

109
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:08,703
you would still give the rest of the 99%

110
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,343
without hesitation.

111
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:23,943
Song Sanchuan,

112
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,183
do you want to be my boyfriend?

113
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:35,503
Is it because you feel sorry
for my limp leg?

114
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,743
How long do I have to wait for you

115
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:40,063
to win those ten championship trophies?

116
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:42,943
I'm so impatient.

117
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,863
I can't wait anymore.

118
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,543
I like who you are,

119
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:48,903
and I can't wait any longer.

120
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:54,863
Do you want

121
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,983
to be with me or not?

122
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:07,743
Yes,

123
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:11,903
yes,

124
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:15,943
yes.

125
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:34,103
All right.

126
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:36,303
I'll get going now.

127
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:38,143
Make sure you rest well

128
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,983
and follow the doctor's advice

129
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:41,543
for rehabilitation.

130
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:43,903
Only then you can recover soon.

131
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,663
Understand?

132
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:48,423
I'll pick you up the day
you're discharged from the hospital.

133
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:50,103
Okay.

134
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,263
Bye.

135
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,583

to fetch the coach you told me to scout.

Yes! This is awesome!

without any exercise.)

(Changing the dressing today still hurts,)

161
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:43,543

and holding the pain.)

163
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:06,423
(He can go to the toilet himself.)

164
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:07,743
(His mood has also improved)

165
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:09,863
(and downloaded several happy songs)

166
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:10,583
(to listen to.)

167
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,263
(Thank you for your hard work, Uncle An.)

168
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:42,063
(Sanchuan, if you don't back anytime soon,)

169
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,383
(I'll call the sculpture factory)

170
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,823
(and make a real sizeof your injured leg)

171
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:49,663
(and sell it to your fans
at a high price.)

172
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,023
(Chuan, please get well soon.)

173

180
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,463
(Stop being ridiculous.)

181
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,503
(Come back and accompany me.)

182
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:07,303
(Yesterday,)

183
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:08,263
(I prepared something special for you.)

184
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,543
"Chuan, it's tough
to recover from surgery

185
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,343
but stay positive
while you're in the hospital.

186
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:16,183
We all understand
what you're going through now.

187
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:18,143
So stay calm and don't be agitated.

188
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,543
The bed in the dormitory

189
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,303
is always reserved for you.

190
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,423
For you!

191
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,223
For you."

192
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:14,903
Is my leg not going to get better?

193
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:21,623
Wait.

194
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,223
Have you been telling me the truth?

195
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,263
Did the doctor say

196
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:27,223
my leg won't heal?

197
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:30,063
Did you just agree with what I said?

198
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:34,343
Chuan!

199
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:37,503
Chuan, what are you doing?

200
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:39,543
You could've told me

201
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,463
if you want something.

202
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,143
Don't push yourself. Let me help you up.

203
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,583
Be careful.

204
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,103
I...

205
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,423
Okay. One, two, three.

206
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:48,903
Hang in there! Hang in there.

207
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:50,823
Slowly now.

208
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:52,303
I'll do it.

209
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,783
Be gentle.

210
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:53,663
Okay, I'll be gentle.

211
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,063
Is this okay?

212
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:57,823
- Is this okay?
- Gentle.

213
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,703
What were you doing?

214
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:03,023
An Cong, tell me the truth.

215
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,063
I just asked you

216
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,943
if my leg is never going to recover.

217
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:07,583
You...

218
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,383
What did you ask me?

219
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:10,023
I just asked you

220
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:11,263
if my leg is beyond recovery.

221
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:12,063
You said, yes.

222
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,743
I answered yes

223
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,343
to your question?

224
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:19,863
You asked...

225
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:21,583
I was asleep.

226
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:23,743
How can I answer your question?

227
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,903
You scared me to death.

228
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:29,623
Stop overthinking.

229
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:31,983
You saw the progress yourself.

230
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,303
Isn't it better than before?

231
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,343
You can definitely walk after this.

232
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:36,223
How is walking

233
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:37,943
the same as playing tennis?

234
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:46,863
I can't believe this.

(First Place Song Sanchuan)

254
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:33,503
I've selected a rehabilitation center

255
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,263
that's considered the best in our area

256
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,543
and have made arrangements.

257
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,743
They can assign
an expert in rehabilitation

258
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,303
to take over his recovery treatment.

259
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:41,103
Take a look at it.

260
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:41,743
Thanks.

261
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,820
(Shenzhen Nanshan District
Orthopedic Rehabilitation Center)

262
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:49,743
There's one more thing.

263
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,663
We might need to take his photo down.

264
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:55,903
His injury

265
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,183
wouldn't recover anytime soon.

266
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:00,303
The previous player Yu Zhiyuan

267
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:02,063
also participated
in the match this time.

268
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:04,943
Based on his skills,
he has the highest chance of winning.

269
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:07,623
So the position of a welfare player...

270
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:08,503
He earned it.

271
00:21:09,863 --> 00:21:11,543
Players have injury insurance.

272
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:13,103
So they can pay

273
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:14,303
for a large amount of medical expenses.

274
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:15,943
But he won't be able

275
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,943
to participate
in the later training and matches.

276
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,303
So it's only right
to let others take the spot.

277
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:24,583
I'll think
about the rehabilitation center.

278
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,303
I still want to find

279
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:28,423
a center that's not in Shenzhen.

280
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:33,263
Somewhere far away
from his familiar living environment.

281
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,783
Maybe his psychological burden

282
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:36,503
will lessen during his recovery.

283
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,223
You can't be too anxious too.

284
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:41,143
This is a long-term fight.

285
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,183
Both of you must be mentally prepared.

286
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,423
I know it's a long-term fight.

287
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:48,663
But we can't look at it
as something negative.

288
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,103
Don't worry.

289
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:52,903
I'm sure he'll recover.

290
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:54,983
He can definitely do it.

What is this?

296
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:57,183
Is our first bouquet of flowers

297
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,303
as a couple going to be from you?

298
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,903
Don't people usually give flowers

299
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,543
to celebrate patient being discharged
from the hospital?

300
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:04,063
You don't like it?

301
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:04,783
I like it.

302
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,463
You can put the flowers there.

303
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:15,183
I'll say this first.

304
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,543
These flowers don't count.

305
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:21,183
I should be the one
buying flowers for you.

306
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:23,343
Childish.

307
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:28,143
You can get off bed now?

308
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:30,023
Yes, I could do it some time ago.

309
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:31,463
If I still can't get off the bed
after so long,

310
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:32,303
that would be...

311
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:51,503
Don't you think you were too much?

312
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,503
You said you won't be visiting.

313
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:57,863
I actually didn't hear from you at all.

314
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:00,943
I thought

315
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:02,703
I was hallucinating from the anesthesia

316
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:03,703
when you said

317
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:06,943
you wanted to be with me.

318
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:08,863

00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,303
I finished my work

320
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:12,863
at the club one month in advance

321
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:14,543
and found

322
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,343
the best-certified rehabilitation center

323
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:17,703
in the country for you.

After you're discharged tomorrow,

325
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:23,143
we'll fly directly to Chengdu.

326
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,623
We must go all the way there?

327
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:34,103
We need a change of environment,
different spaces,

328
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:35,863
and temperature.

329
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,503
It'll be like taking a break,

330
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,383
and working on your leg while at it.

331
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:43,263
Don't keep standing.
You should sit down.

332
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:45,343
Are you afraid

333
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:48,823
I might be sad

334
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,303
when I see the rest training
for the competition?

335
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:54,463
Of course, not.

336
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:56,383
Why would I think that way?

337
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,503
I admit I have some selfish motives.

338
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,183
I just want to have you

339
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,423
all to myself during this time.

340
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:08,503
You know something?

341
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:09,703
When I forward your medical record

342
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:11,623
to the rehabilitation center,

343
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,663
they said your current injury

344
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:15,383
is better than 60%

345
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:16,183
of injured athletes.

346
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:18,103
So as long as you actively cooperate
with treatment,

347
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:19,543
there will be hope.

348
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,103
I have confidence,

349
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,063
and you should too.

350
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:24,983
Understand?

351
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,463
Okay, nurse. You can come anytime.

352
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,423
I'll wait for you at the shop!

353
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,063
Oh...

354
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,743
I didn't know

355
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:02,703
there was someone else here.

356
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:06,303
An, didn't you want me

357
00:26:06,383 --> 00:26:07,623
to pack his luggage?

358
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,223
So you can go

359
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:10,343
to Chengdu directly tomorrow.

360
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:10,823
Right?

361
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,983
I've packed his luggage.

362
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:14,343
The road wasn't congested too.

363
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:14,863
So

364
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:15,983
why don't I...

365
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:17,543
No, stay. I'm about to go home

366
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:19,103
to pack my luggage too.

367
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:20,423
I'll have to trouble you again

368
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:21,703
to watch him for another night.

369
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:22,583
Don't worry.

370
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:26,343
I'll hand him over to you in one piece.

371
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:27,983
Why don't you stay and talk more?

372
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:28,823
It's okay.

373
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:29,983
I really have to go now.

374
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:31,303
Bye, Uncle An.

375
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:31,783
You're leaving?

376
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:33,743
Be careful.

377
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:40,223
Well,

378
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,343
I packed ten pairs of underwear for you.

379
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,623
Would that be enough?

380
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,140
Jeez, just leave.

381
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,663
What are you thinking?

382
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:54,583
Of course, they're enough. Wait.

383
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:55,143
Not enough?

384
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:55,823
- Enough.
- Not enough?

385
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:57,863
No, it's enough.

386
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,263
I'll make it 14 pairs of underwear.

387
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:00,023
What?

388
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:01,903
So you don't have

389
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:02,743
to wash any for two weeks.

390
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:03,183
It's decided, then.

391
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:04,463
I'll pack more for you.

392
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,343
Two tickets to Chengdu, please.

393
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:17,903
We'll be there for more than a month.

394
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,383
Is this your only bag?

395
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,623
Isn't the weather hot over there?

396
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:23,583
Short sleeves shirts don't take
too much space.

397
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,463
So one bag is already enough.

398
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:26,663
What are you bringing

399
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:27,663
that you need two huge luggage cases?

400
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:30,663
Home.

401
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:37,023
Hi, do you need to check your luggage?

402
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:37,823
Yes, please.

403
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:45,783
Can you give me a hand? Thanks.

404
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,023
Does this bag need to be checked?

405
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:53,863
Yes.

406
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,383
Please put it up here.

407
00:27:59,183 --> 00:27:59,823
Here.

408
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:05,143
Could you please help me attach
a fragile sticker to this bag?

409
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:05,743
Sure.

410
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,503
Excuse me, ma'am.

411
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,823
Since you have
a disabled person with you,

412
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,343
if you have any inconvenience,

413
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:17,263
feel free to ask our ground staff for help.

414
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:19,303
Okay, thank you.

415
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:21,423
By the way,

416
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:22,863
can I bring my boyfriend's wheelchair

417
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:23,903
on the plane?

418
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:25,823
Your wheelchair needs to be checked in

419
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:27,023
at the oversized luggage
check-in counter.

420
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:29,263
After you checked it in at the counter,

421
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,223
our airport staff will provide him

422
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:33,383
with an airport wheelchair to board the plane.

423
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:34,703
Okay, thank you.

424
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:37,663
Let's go.

425
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:39,663
Let me do it.

426
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:42,703
When I carried your luggage,

427
00:28:42,703 --> 00:28:44,303
it was too light.

428
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:45,703
Are you sure you brought enough things?

429
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,823
I'm already your burden.

430
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:52,823
I really don't want

431
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:54,423
to add more burden on you.

432
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:55,583
You should've said that earlier

433
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:57,143
I should have asked

434
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:58,023
the ground attendant earlier

435
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,223
if they have stickers for valuable items.

436
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,303
I want stickers for my exclusive items.

437
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:02,783
Then I'll stick them

438
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,063
all over your body.

439
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:07,143
So no one else will take it by mistake.

440
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:08,423
Then put one here too.

441
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,823
Did you see the flight attendant
was looking at you earlier?

442
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:16,823
Really?

443
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:17,343
Yes.

444
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:19,343
It's all because you

445
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,103
have such a handsome face.

446
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:23,263
Cover yourself with this hoodie.

447
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:24,223
Don't let others see you.

448
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,743
Keep your head down and let's go. Set off!

449
00:29:26,983 --> 00:29:27,903
Mr. Song, hello.

450
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:29,063
We know your leg is injured.

451
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:30,183
So we've prepared

452
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,463
an ice water bottle for you.

453
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:32,543
You can use it to ice your leg.

454
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:33,663
Thank you.

455
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:35,783
If you need anything throughout the journey,

456
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:36,783
you can call me anytime.

457
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:37,343
Okay.

458
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:38,023
All right, then.

459
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:38,983
Thank you for your hard work.

460
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:39,503
You're welcome.

461
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:41,023
I thought the reason

462
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:42,463
we had a smooth ride earlier was

463
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:43,743
that I was in a wheelchair.

464
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,383
We don't need to buy such expensive tickets.

465
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:47,903
It's only a little over two hours.

466
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:50,103
We can't help it
because of our long legs.

467
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:51,703
It's fine under normal circumstances.

468
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,183
But your leg is injured.

469
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,583
I can't let you be in such
an uncomfortable state for three hours.

470
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:57,303
Besides,

471
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,783
I didn't spend any money
on the tickets.

472
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,063
How is that possible?

473
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:03,343
I used my points to upgrade the cabin.

474
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:04,783
You can do that?

475
00:30:05,023 --> 00:30:05,943
Why would I lie to you?

476
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,263
You look happy.

477
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,023
Oh, well.

478
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:22,303
You called me

479
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:24,623
as your boyfriend just now.

480
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,543
Did I?

481
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:30,263
When you were checking in your luggage,

482
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:31,783
you said, "My boyfriend's wheelchair."

483
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:32,743
You said boyfriend.

484
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:42,503
Did I really say such difficult words like that?

485
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:44,903
They're not difficult to say.

486
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:46,543
That's because you're not used to it.

487
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:48,943
You should practice
by calling me that more often.

488
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,383
Boyfriend.

489
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,463
Girlfriend.

490
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:11,263
You know what?

491
00:31:11,943 --> 00:31:14,143
This word hasn't appeared in my life

492
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:15,423
for a long time.

493
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:16,663
I'm not used to it.

494
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:20,503
Then we should add
this together with it.

495
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:22,143
It should be able

496
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,583
to help you get used to it faster.

497
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:38,383
This is the closest homestay

498
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:39,303
to the rehabilitation center.

499
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:40,823
There's even an elevator.

500
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:42,543
You can stay upstairs
for a quieter environment.

501
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:43,583
I'll stay downstairs.

502
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:45,583
If you need anything, just call me.

503
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,463
What do you think?
This place looks great, right?

504
00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:52,903
The view from this window

505
00:31:53,063 --> 00:31:54,303
is quite beautiful.

506
00:31:58,703 --> 00:31:59,583
Are we going to stay here

507
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:00,423
for a month?

508
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:03,503
Yeah, until you finish your rehabilitation.

509
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:05,343
Just the two of us?

510
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:07,063
Yeah.

511
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,383
Then

512
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:13,823
why should we live separately?

513
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:16,223
It's inconvenient

514
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:17,463
staying on different floors.

515
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,983
(Come on. Let's sleep together.)

516
00:32:28,223 --> 00:32:29,743
(What if I accidentally
put pressure on your leg?)

517
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:31,743
(No.)

518
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:37,863
(It's okay.)

519
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:39,663
(I'm not afraid
of you pressing down on me.)

520
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,383
(That's not okay either.)

521
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:47,223
(Really?)

522
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:54,503
No!

523
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:02,423
Are you feeling hot?

524
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:03,983
Do you want to take a shower?

525
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:05,823
I asked the landlord

526
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,423
to put a chair in the bathroom for you.

527
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:08,103
It'll be more convenient

528
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:09,543
for you to shower that way.

529
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,503
You can change into this after a shower.

530
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:14,943
I bought it for you.

531
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,343
What's this? Is this my shirt?

532
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:19,343
What kind of picture is this?

533
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:20,743
Why is it...

534
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:21,903
Very comfortable.

535
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:23,343
I have one too.

536
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,743
I was wondering why it smells nice.

Why did you purposely lower your voice?

544

Are you trying to sound sexy?

545
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,503
There's water on the bedside table.
Drink some if you're thirsty.

546
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,503
You should get some sleep now.

I can't sleep either.

554
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:33,583
Liang You'an.

00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:36,503
I miss you.

00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:05,783
during this period of time.

559
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:06,863
He must be thinking

560
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:08,543
about his leg again when he's alone.

561
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,823
(Liang You'an, I never knew)

562
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:12,463
(you were a thoughtful person.)

563
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:14,223
It's not that.

564
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:15,983
I can just feel

565
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,863
his concern for his leg injury.

566
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:18,823
(I see it now.)

567
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,663
(You two are practically conjoined twins.)

568
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:23,423
(How could you bear not seeing
each other for one night?)

569
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:25,983
I didn't expect that either.

570
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:27,183
Say,

571
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:29,823
how is it possible
that I don't need to get use it

572
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:31,543
when there's suddenly
one more person around?

573
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:32,543
Boyfriends

574
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,303
are better than any sleeping pill.

575
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,783
(Okay, that's enough.)

576
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:37,823
(Humans eat breakfast in the morning,)

577
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:39,143
(not dog food.)
[*Dog food: Public display of affection.]

578
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:45,743
I'm hanging up now.

579
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:49,663
Why did you finish showering so quickly?

580
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:53,623
Come here

581
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:54,823
and have some dog food.

582
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:58,823
I mean, breakfast.

583
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:02,663
Be careful.

584
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:18,543
Liang You'an,

585
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:22,223
I want to seriously criticize you about your behavior.

586
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:23,903
About your behavior

587
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:26,263
of hiding under the blanket.

588
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,903
Then I won't come tonight.

589
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:28,743
That's not necessary.

590
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:30,903
I just want to tell you

591
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,583
that you were taking advantage of me.

592
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,463
After my leg recovers,

593
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:36,823
I'll return this favor.

594
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:38,983
I can't even imagine it.

595
00:38:39,103 --> 00:38:40,743
Thinking about it makes me
a little happy though.

596
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:50,663
Is dating an older woman

597
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:51,663
always this exciting?

598
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:54,863
There are many things
that you don't know about older women.

599
00:39:00,143 --> 00:39:01,343
You can look at this.

600
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:07,183
Generally speaking,

601
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,743
it takes 24 weeks to recover

602
00:39:09,903 --> 00:39:11,663
and return to court after surgery.

603
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:15,543
Your meniscus repair isn't too severe.

604
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,543
So conservatively,

605
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:20,063
it'll take about 16 weeks.

606
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:21,743
Since you're rehabilitating
at our center,

607
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:23,063
we'll mainly focus on

608
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,703
restoring muscle strength

609
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,863
and joint mobility,

610
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:30,023
as well as overall knee function.

611
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:32,223
Once you've reached
a certain level of recovery,

612
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:34,423
you can return to your club

613
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,703
and do specific tennis training.

614
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:39,223
That's the overall process.

615
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:40,423
Do you have any questions?

616
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:42,543
If I cooperate fully
for the rehabilitation,

617
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:43,823
does that mean
I can join the tournaments

618
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:44,903
after 16 weeks?

619
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:46,303
That's the ideal scenario.

620
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:48,103
Before returning to the court,

621
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:49,863
we'll evaluate you professionally

622
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,143
and use more intuitive indicators

623
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,063
to determine if you're ready to play.

624
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,583
I have a question.

625
00:39:58,743 --> 00:39:59,663
As a family member,

626
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:01,703
is there anything we can do to help?

627
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:03,823
For example, during this time,

628
00:40:03,823 --> 00:40:05,503
they can buy
some rehabilitation equipment

629
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,903
that can be used at home.

630
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:08,543
This is a very good question.

631
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:11,343
Don't buy anything.

632
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,183
He's an athlete.

633
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,303
All functions

634
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,463
need to be calibrated more accurately

635
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:19,383
in order to recover more ideally.

636
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:20,783
Okay, got it.

637
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:22,223
The most important thing for you

638
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:23,263
is to relax

639
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:25,783
and trust us.

640
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,343
Professional matters

641
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:29,023
should be handled
by professional people.

642
00:40:29,903 --> 00:40:34,023
Or else what's the point

643
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:36,183
of spending so much money
on rehabilitation, right?

644
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,983
By the way, there's one thing you can do,

645
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,263
which is to make bone soup.

646
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,543
In our rehabilitation system,

647
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,703
bone soup is the best

648
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:45,063
and most nutritious essential need.

649
00:40:45,263 --> 00:40:46,103
Bone soup?

650
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:47,423
I can do that.

651
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:48,943
I'll make bone soup for you
when we go back.

652
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:51,783
Okay, please stay seated.

653
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,143
I'll meet the doctor
to make the arrangement.

654
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,303
Okay, thank you very much.

655
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:58,423
Is the club

656
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:01,823
covering for the rehabilitation fees?

657
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:03,103
No.

658
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:05,423
It's covered by the insurance.

659
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:07,623
I'm very professional.

660
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:09,023
When I sign everyone under the club,

661
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:10,023
I bought sports insurance for everyone

662
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:11,823
where surgeries and rehabilitation

663
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:13,143
are all included.

664
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:16,703
He said it was pretty expensive.

665
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:18,263
How expensive it is?

666
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,543
I don't know either.

667
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,663
If you want to know,

668
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:22,623
we'll look at the receipt

669
00:41:22,623 --> 00:41:24,063
after this session is over.

670
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,463
Okay.

671
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:29,103
Don't think too much.
Just focus on your treatment.

672
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:31,343
Sorry to keep you waiting.

673
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:33,303
We can go now since it's our turn.

674
00:41:33,303 --> 00:41:33,823
Okay.

675
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:34,983
Don't forget your bag.

676
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:39,703
Go.

677
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:41,183
What about you?

678
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,703
I have a conference meeting.

679
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:43,183
Okay.

680
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:43,943
Thank you.

681
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:45,663
If you're hungry,
remember to eat something.

682
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,903
(I talked to the insurance company again.)

683
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:00,743
(They said this rehab center)

684
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:03,023
(is beyond the coverage
of the insurance.)

685
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:04,143
(They can)

686
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:05,583
(only cover 30% of the rehab fee,)

687
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,823
(and we need to pay the rest.)

688
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,540
(Jiang Mingyu)

689
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:25,903
How did it go?

690
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:26,903
(You'an.)

691
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,543
(After the wild card tournament,)

692
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:30,583
(our club has gained a lot of attention,)

693
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:32,983
(including our previous ten-player system,)

694
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:34,543
(which has also garnered a lot of attention.)

695
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:37,223
(We've received more than ten résumés)

696
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,983
(from professional players)

697
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,583
(who applied to transfer here.)

698
00:42:40,663 --> 00:42:41,543
(As of this morning,)

699
00:42:41,543 --> 00:42:42,503
(there are thirteen,)

700
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,023
(where they're targeting Song Sanchuan's)

701
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,183
(welfare player position.)

702
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,023
(I've summarized the résumés)

703
00:42:47,103 --> 00:42:47,943
(and sent them to your email.)

704
00:42:49,663 --> 00:42:50,583
(How is he doing?)

705
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:52,663
(How long is his rehabilitation?)

706
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,863
It may take four to five months.

707
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:58,983
Okay, thanks for the information.

708
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,063
Someone should really fill in his spot.

709
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:03,943
He'll get it back after he recovers.

710
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:06,103
Okay.

711
00:43:08,863 --> 00:43:10,383
(The club's official account
has gained 50,000 followers.)

712
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:12,263
(To be honest, I'm a bit nervous.)

713
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:13,703
(Many people are just here)

714
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:15,063
