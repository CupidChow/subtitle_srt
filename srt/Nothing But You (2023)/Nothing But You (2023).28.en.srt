00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,060
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,980
(Happy Birthday, Song Sanchuan.)

4
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,860
Pass it to me.

5
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,820
Over here.

6
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:03,740
Defend.

7
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,100
Hey, you kept missing the balls.

8
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,300
Why do you zone out?

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,900
You guys play.

10
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,780
I take a rest.

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,060
Dong, fill his spot.

12
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
Over here.

13
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,860
Here.

14
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,500
(Song Sanchuan)
(When will you finish your work?)

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,020
(We're still at the place
playing frisbee.)

16
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,820
Happy birthday.

17
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,700
Don't you feel hot
bundling up like this?

18
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,700
Better than you.

19
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,340
You're sweating all over.

20
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,860
It seems you enjoy this very much.

21
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,980
Is this really fun?

22
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,660
Yes, it's pretty fun.

23
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,020
I can teach you. Let's play together.

24
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,020
Ms. Liang, you're here.

25
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,380
Why don't we have a round between us?

26
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,460
Count me off.

27
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,900
It's a sport for you youngsters.

28
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,140
I will cut the cake for you.

29
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,780
Ms. Liang, are you afraid
of losing to me?

30
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,220
Are you always so aggressive?

31
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,620
Now that humans don't have to compete

32
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,540
for food and shelter,

33
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,860
we may devolve
if we don't fight aggressively

34
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,980
for someone we like.

35
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,900
All right.

36
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,500
Let's play.

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,460
But running around the field

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,380
doesn't suit me,

39
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,820
I'm weak.

40
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,020
Let's play something else.

41
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,700
Sure.

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,260
How about frisbee golf?

43
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,260
Throw at the target twenty meters away.

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,860
With three frisbees,

45
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,660
the winner is the one
who hits the target first.

46
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,220
I go first.

47
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,420
That was close.

48
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,500
Still, she missed it.

49
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,500
I don't think she can make it.

50
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,100
She's awesome.

51
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,340
Can Ms. Liang play this?

52
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,380
No idea.

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,780
Have you ever seen her exercising?

54
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,580
She hit it at the first throw.

55
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,420
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,940
I'm quite good at this.

57
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,940
I used to play this a lot

58
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,940
when I was abroad.

59
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,380
However, this is the only sport I play.

60
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,140
Please enjoy yourselves. I'm off.

61
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,180
I didn't expect that. Good for her.

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm off.

63
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,740
Enjoy your day.

64
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,180
Clear your mind of worries.

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,340
I will head back to the club

66
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,660
for some work affairs.

67
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,820
I will go with you.

68
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,500
No.

69
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,620
Today is your birthday. Enjoy your time.

70
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,940
Remember to eat the cake.

71
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,820
See you, Ms. Liang.

72
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,980
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

73
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,660
Song Sanchuan.

74
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,460
I have something for you.

75
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,460
Hope that you like it.

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,500
What's that?

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,900
What's this?

78
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,740
A prepaid lesson card?

79
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,780
I heard

80
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,860
that the club adopts a knockout system.

81
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,180
Hence, you always do extra training

82
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,620
because you stress out.

83
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
You can use this lesson card

84
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,180
to sign up for a private instructor

85
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,220
and attend lessons that suit your time.

86
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,580
It will lighten your burden too.

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,660
It's a small deal for me.

88
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,740
Don't feel bad.

89
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,340
I hope that you can
have a better performance.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,220
Just now, everyone was around us

91
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,740
and

92
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,020
I didn't want to embarrass you.

93
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,260
Please

94
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,340
get a refund on this card.

95
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,140
You don't know much about me.

96
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,220
I enjoy myself

97
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,180
in the training and
competition very much.

98
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I never feel pressured about that.

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,980
I don't need this card.

100
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,900
As for what you meant,

101
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
I can't accept it.

102
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,540
You knew

103
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,740
that I like you, right?

104
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,540
I just found out.

105
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,820
I'm in love with someone.

107
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,580
I don't have feelings for you.

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,740
Please take tennis lessons
from other instructors.

109
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,780
(Top Smash)

110
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,340
A prepaid lesson card?

111
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,660
How generous she is.

112
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,820
It's good that he can
have extra training, anyway.

113
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,060
It's a sweet deal.

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,300
Youngsters nowadays are indeed aggressive.

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,940
Something's wrong

116
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,060
with this competition schedule.

117
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Wu Zhiguang of Guangzhou

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,380
is good at backhand.

119
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,860
Still, he stands a chance to win.

120
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,740
He can do this.

121
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,380
After competing with these two,

122
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,820
isn't he going

123
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,660
to encounter the second seed?

124
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,580
This player is strong though.

125
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,740
Only if he could join our club.

126
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,340
Why do you come here?

127
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,700
Today's your birthday

128
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
and you're the man of honor.

129
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,260
How could you leave them?

130
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,700
No.

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,500
I treated them to a meal.

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,860
Besides,

133
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,220
you bought me this cake.

134
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,780
I don't want to share with others.

135
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,860
Come on.

136
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,780
I want to blow out the candle

137
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,420
before twelve.

138
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm one year older.

139
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,260
I don't like having birthdays.

140
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,220
♪Happy birthday to you♪

141
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,275
♪Happy birthday to you♪

142
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,979
♪Happy birthday to you♪

143
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,900
♪Happy birthday to you♪

144
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,500
Oh, right.

145
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,020
If Huang Yike comes to get a refund,

146
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,180
do it for her.

147
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,540
Don't take advantage of her.

148
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,180
Didn't you accept the card?

149
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,700
I don't need anyone

150
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,460
to ease my burden by doing this.

151
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
Ms. Luo told me

152
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,500
that you came back to work.

153
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,700
I thought you were mad at me.

154
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,100
So, I rushed back here.

155
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,700
Yet, I see you

156
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,620
racking your brain in this room alone

157
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,860
to arrange the schedule

158
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,620
for me to win the competition
that's in my favor.

159
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,900
There's no present

160
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,060
better than this in the world.

161
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,540
These candles are great.

162
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,500
We can share them.

163
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,660
The thing what I like about you

164
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,580
is given by the time gap between us.

165
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,340
Whether we're nine or ten steps apart,

166
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,660
I have a feeling

167
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,220
that this is a really sweet deal

168
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,420
in my life.

169
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,580
Honestly, I did consider

170
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,380
the age gap between us seriously.

171
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,340
Think about this.

172
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,740
Now you're 20 and I'm 30.

173
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,700
You like me

174
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,180
because I'm ten steps ahead of you

175
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,220
that I seem mature, rational,
and well-organized.

176
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,020
Because you're

177
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,300
right at the age to expose to the world.

178
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,900
But, imagine

179
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,340
that when you're 30 and I'm 40

180
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,580
or when you're 40 and I'm 50,

181
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,420
perhaps you wouldn't need

182
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,660
someone in the lead.

183
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,500
Instead, you need admiration
and someone to look up to you.

184
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,740
Why do we have to look up or down at each other?

185
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,100
Shouldn't the best love be

186
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,660
when we're at eye level?

187
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,660
I have been striving day after day

188
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,260
so that I can look you in the eye

189
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,260
like now.

190
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,660
Till the day

191
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,620
you want to toss your heart out,

192
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,380
I will firmly catch you.

193
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,940
Why did you bring this back?

194
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,500
I bought it.

195
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,740
This is the frisbee you hit the target.

196
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
It's a good omen.

197
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,780
Song Sanchuan.

198
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,860
I want to tell you...

199
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,460
Answer the call first.

200
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,060
Hello, Alex.

201
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,260
(An inside information.)

202
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,460
(Young Space received the naming rights)

203
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,140
(for the biggest touring tournament
in Shenzhen.)

204
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,980
(They will have)

205
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,300
(the wild card for sponsors.)

206
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,180
(You shall work your magic
to get the card.)

207
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,980
All right, got it.

208
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,940
Thank you.

209
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,020
Okay, bye-bye.

210
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,580
Liang You'an.

211
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,580
We're only nine years apart.

212
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,860
Can I get a discount for one less trophy?

213
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
Song Sanchuan.

214
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,260
Let's join a competition

215
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
that can write off
nine trophies altogether,

216
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,220
all right?

217
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,860
Well.

218
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,940
Since we're talking

219
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,660
about the wild card of the tour,

220
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,580
why don't we decide

221
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,620
on who can take the card now?

222
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,580
Speaking of the wild card,

223
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,260
I shall reward

224
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,100
the members of the marketing department.

225
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,100
They've been staying up
all night for days

226
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,900
and they have panda eyes now.

227
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,660
Finally, we managed to secure the name rights.

228
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,220
Otherwise, the wild card

229
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,820
wouldn't have fallen into our hands now.

230
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,940
Mr. Jiang.

231
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,540
It has been some years

232
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,020
and I think you should

233
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,300
be more broad-minded now.

234
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,460
You shouldn't seek adulation
on this matter.

235
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,700
We're here

236
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,100
to discuss how to maximize the benefit

237
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,580
for Young Space

238
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,020
by using this wild card.

239
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,180
To maximize the benefit for Young Space,

240
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,300
I have a plan.

241
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,340
There's a player, Zheng Luoyi

242
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,500
who has been on a hiatus

243
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,060
due to his injury last year.

244
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,660
His credit isn't enough
to participate in the competition.

245
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
However, his strength is undoubtedly strong.

246
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,180
It will be a godsend for him

247
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,820
if we give him the card.

248
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,580
Besides, if he performs well
in the tournament,

249
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,140
we can discuss
a tennis endorsement with him.

250
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,820
It's better to let me have the card.

251
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,100
Teng.

252
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,140
There's one distributor in Beijing

253
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,820
I always wanted to collaborate.

254
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,780
He likes tennis too

255
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,420
and his son is a professional tennis.

256
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm requesting this card for working purposes.

257
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,780
Gao Li.

258
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,060
From what I know,

259
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,500
you're tying up loose ends

260
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,860
on the partnership with him, right?

261
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,140
Besides,

262
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,500
you're so much more capable.

263
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,980
Do you need a wild card to pull some strings?

264
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,420
Still, it's better

265
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,100
than getting a spokesperson with it.

266
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,380
All right, everyone.

267
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,460
Anyway,

268
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,420
I caught your point.

269
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,820
You're not using this card

270
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,220
on something that really matters.

271
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,460
It's better to hold it

272
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,900
than never let it fall into other's hands.

273
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,460
Did I get that right?

274
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,180
No.

275
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,820
I didn't mean that.

276
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,500
See, if we're throwing pebbles
at each other

277
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,180
while fishing at the same pond,

278
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
no one is going to catch a fish.

279
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,820
Eventually, the one who gets hurt
will only be Young Space.

280
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
How about this?

281
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,620
I can resolve this for you.

282
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,860
I have a much fair idea.

283
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,300
From now on,

284
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
the first one who catches the fish

285
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
can get the wild card.

286
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Good idea.

287
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,140
Good.

288
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,100
Sure, it's fairly just.

289
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,140
I'm down.

290
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
(Top Smash)

291
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,900
Liang You'an.

292
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,580
I heard that you're sending Chuan

293
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,700
to the wildcard tournament.

294
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:07,460
Yes.

295
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,700
How did know about that?

296
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,100
It's good for our club, anyway.

297
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,059
I will get it for you.

298
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,259
Ms. Wang.

299
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,700
Ms. Wang.

300
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,340
Where's she?

301
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,100
Why are you back here?

302
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,460
Gosh.

303
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,460
Why are you lying here?

304
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,300
Where's Ms. Wang?

305
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,180
She has left.

306
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,860
Did you dismiss her too?

307
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,300
I didn't.

308
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,980
Your mother has left

309
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,060
and you don't come back often.

310
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,460
It's not convenient

311
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,620
to stay with Ms. Wang

312
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,660
at the house alone.

313
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,580
Gosh.

314
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,820
I went out fishing with my boss

315
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,620
right after back from the trip.

316
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,220
I've been sitting under the sun.

317
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,620
I feel ill.

318
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,620
Dad.

319
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,100
Do you know what I think of

320
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,220
when I look at you now?

321
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,020
You feel rapturous?

322
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,900
You look lonely.

323
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,740
Jiang Jiaojiao.

324
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,780
Let's make a bet.

325
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,980
If I write a post on the Moment,

326
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,420
people who care will be in a long queue

327
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,660
that stretches from here to Paris.

328
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,460
Do you believe this?

329
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,820
Many people wanted
to invite me for a meal.

330
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,220
If I weren't feeling ill,

331
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,500
it would have been
a great pleasure for them

332
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,860
to welcome my arrival.

333
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,300
That's a business function.

334
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,780
None of your relatives and friends

335
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
will invite you for a meal.

336
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,100
When you're rich,

337
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
there'll be loads of people
who want to approach you.

338
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,340
And I have many friends
that will come to me.

339
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,860
As one ascends to higher status

340
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,140
and position,

341
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,340
naturally, many friends
will be filtered out.

342
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,020
Only one or two friends

343
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,620
that is useful

344
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,580
should stay around you

345
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,460
and that's enough.

346
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,860
This is how society works.

347
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,260
Get it, brat?

348
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,100
I'm speaking from experience.

349
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,420
Listening to my advice

350
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,740
will only do you good.

351
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,660
Investing in your career

352
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,300
is way better than anything else.

353
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,060
Point taken.

354
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,740
So, you don't feel bad

355
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,460
when you lost Chen Ke.

356
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,060
Am I right?

357
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,460
I just poured, it's hot.

358
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,780
Mother used to remind you

359
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,860
to take medicine.

360
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,580
Look at you now.

361
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,180
You're all alone here

362
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,380
without anyone to concern you.

363
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,820
You're a full grown-up now.

364
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,580
Can you speak politely?

365
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,300
I take that after you.

366
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,700
You...

367
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,300
Where's your manner?

368
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,460
You have a snappy attitude.

369
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,740
You know what,

370
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,380
you can do nothing better

371
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,580
than bring trouble to me.

372
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,500
Fire away.

373
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,740
What do you want?

374
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,060
Tell me and get out of my sight, okay?

375
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,140
I have something important.

376
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,580
Young Space gets the naming rights

377
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,060
for the tour this year, right?

378
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,100
You're so quick.

379
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,140
What's up?

380
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,580
You're my father

381
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,500
and I will be real with you.

382
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,940
Top Smash wants this card.

383
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,940
Give it to me.

384
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,860
Such audacity.

385
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,060
Give it to you?

386
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,020
Do you think it's a credit card

387
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
that you can use it as you wish?

388
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,820
You're the marketing president.

389
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,980
Don't you have the right to this?

390
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,140
Does it concern you

391
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,820
when I have the rights?

392
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,340
Forget it.

393
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,660
You're not up to that mark.

394
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,780
I know my own strength.

395
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,220
Give me the card.

396
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,660
Our club will choose

397
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
according to the ranking.

398
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,220
So, your club wants this?

399
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,540
Fine.

400
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
Ask your boss

401
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,140
to talk to me.

402
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,860
So, this is your motive.

403
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,740
You want to meet my mom.

404
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,620
Why could you say it straightaway?

405
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,580
Fine.

406
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,860
I will set this up for you.

407
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
You give her the card.

408
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,940
I didn't mean to meet with her.

409
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,820
No need to set up the meeting.

410
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,540
If you really want the card,

411
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,300
it's simple.

412
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,980
Do you still remember

413
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,420
why I cut you off last time?

414
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,620
You haven't admitted your fault.

415
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,580
Jiang Jiaojiao.

416
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,100
Come on.

417
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,020
Today,

418
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,580
you're going to admit

419
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,220
your fault.

420
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,300
If you do,

421
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,340
I will give you the card.

422
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,420
No, I won't admit it.

423
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,220
It's not wrong to help my friends.

424
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,060
If you want to help your friend,

425
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,780
do it by yourself.

426
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,300
Just like the wild card.

427
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,820
If you can obtain

428
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,380
this wild card by yourself one day,

429
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,340
good for you.

430
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,220
You have my respect.

431
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,740
But it's useless

432
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
if you need your dad's help.

433
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
Stop shaking your head.

434
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,500
Don't get fresh with me.

435
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,700
Fine.

436
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
I will ask my mom

437
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,140
to talk to you.

438
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,140
Remember to take the medicine.

439
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,260
(Tea House)

440
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,660
Jiaojiao told me

441
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,580
that the club needs this wild card.

442
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Also, he said

443
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,140
you would only

444
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,740
give him the card

445
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,380
if I made this request myself.

446
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,260
Mr. Jiang.

447
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,820
Can we, Top Smash have this card?

448
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
How have you been lately?

449
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,020
Pretty well.

450
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,620
Where do you live?

451
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,180
It seems

452
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,700
you're not at the old place.

453
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,700
You went there?

454
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,660
I passed by the place.

455
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,340
The management officer told me
that the place is put up for lease.

456
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,860
Jiang Jie.

457
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,460
We've divorced already.

458
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,740
It's not a sham.

459
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,780
I think you must

460
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,060
know the line between us.

461
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,140
Do you still think

462
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,740
that you have the right
to pry into my affairs?

463
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,620
Yes, we've divorced.

464
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,500
Still,

465
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
we're friends.

466
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,940
Is there any problem

467
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,300
to show concern

468
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,940
for you as an old friend?

469
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,300
It's too late.

470
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,100
It sounds to me

471
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,740
like you're fishing out
something from me.

472
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,180
I didn't know

473
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,500
you can be so spiky.

474
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,620
Every word from you is sharp.

475
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,020
You seem not to know me much.

476
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,820
If you're not here

477
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,180
to talk about the wild card,

478
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,180
let's not waste our time here.

479
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,660
See you. I'm not seeing you off, then.

480
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,860
You'an.

481
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,580
I think

482
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,620
he won't give me the card

483
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,460
even if I talk nicely to him.

484
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,900
The club incident and our divorce

485
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,020
have made him feel outcasted.

486
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,580
I think he's not giving us the card

487
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,060
until he can seek enough attention.

488
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
When does Mr. Jiang become so childish?

489
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,740
Men tend

490
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,940
to act childishly.

491
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,540
He has given

492
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,780
both Jiaojiao and me an earful.

493
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,900
I guess

494
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,580
you're his next target.

495
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,500
All right, I get you.

496
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,780
Sure.

497
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,780
What's going on now?
Did they get the card?

498
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
I'm willing to bow down to him.

499
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,860
As long as he gives us the card,

500
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,780
I can do anything for him.

501
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,100
We have something to do now.

502
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,100
Let's go and buy a fine wine.

503
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,460
Song Sanchuan.

504
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
Song Sanchuan.

505
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,380
What's up?

506
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,860
You can't go with me

507
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,380
if you keep showing this face.

508
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,020
No.

509
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,420
I want to go.

510
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Today,

511
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,140
we're seeking help from him

512
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,500
and it may be an unpleasant scenario.

513
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,620
However, I've gotten used

514
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,980
to dealing with this.

515
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,540
It operates under different rules

516
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,780
compared to sports games,

517
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,100
which are won by defeating opponents.

518
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,540
I know.

519
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,900
I'm curious about

520
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,100
who Mr. Jiang is

521
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,740
that has been torturing you for years.

522
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,260
It's work, not torment.

523
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,020
All right, then.

524
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,100
Don't worry.

525
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,020
I won't do anything to him

526
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,340
as he's Jiaojiao's father.

527
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,420
Don't you drink some?

528
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Athletes aren't allowed to drink

529
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,140
during the training before tournaments.

530
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,180
Besides,

531
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,500
I have to drive Ms. Liang home later.

532
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,100
Well, eat some dishes.

533
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,540
Sure.

534
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,180
So, you're using the wild card on him?

535
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,140
Yes.

536
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,620
Song Sanchuan

537
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,940
ranks at the top and
scores the highest credits

538
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,500
among players in the club.

539
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,020
Hence, this competition is crucial to him.

540
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,660
Lately, I've heard about you a lot.

541
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,060
I only came to realize

542
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,620
that it was you

543
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,340
who brought him from the badminton team.

544
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,420
Honestly, I always have faith in Song Sanchuan.

545
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,300
I believe

546
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,860
he's one of the very few talented athletes.

547
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,300
During this period,

548
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
he has proven himself.

549
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,020
After switching
into a tennis player successfully,

550
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,580
his ranking and credits have been on the rise.

551
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,220
He's really diligent.

552
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,900
As for now,

553
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,900
he needs an international tournament.

554
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,300
So, this wild card

555
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,020
means a lot to us.

556
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,700
I don't know what resources you trade

557
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,140
for this card.

558
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,300
But if you give it to us,

559
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,500
I will try my very best

560
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,700
to obtain what you aim for.

561
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,900
You'an.

562
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,660
To be honest, I feel upset deep inside.

563
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,700
We've been working together

564
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,260
in Young Space for years.

565
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,380
Did I always protect you at work?

566
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,020
We had a meal last time

567
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,220
and it ended on a bad note.

568
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,820
I have become someone obnoxious

569
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,620
in front of everyone.

570
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,580
They couldn't understand

571
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,500
why I dismissed the club

572
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,860
and I didn't care about that.

573
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
But I feel pathetic

574
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,660
when you're not on my side.

575
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,540
Now, be calm and objective,

576
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,740
tell me

577
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,660
if my decision is wrong.

578
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,500
Mr. Jie.

579
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,860
If

580
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,460
you're upset

581
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,660
because I didn't take your side

582
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,620
when the club was dismissed

583
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,460
and I turned down your offer,

584
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,620
and now you want

585
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,380
an apology from me,

586
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,060
I will say it.

587
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,740
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,180
I'm truly sorry.

589
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,060
Over that period, our club has finally

590
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,580
made some progress.

591
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,460
And I believe

592
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,900
the current performance of Top Smash

593
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,420
has proven this to you too.

594
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,220
Hence, back at that time,

595
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,980
I really hope

596
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,980
that you could trust us.

597
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,220
However, you refused to take the risk

598
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,460
or to shelter us from the risk as well.

599
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,220
Truth be told,

600
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,420
even today,

601
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,060
I couldn't understand why you did that.

602
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,620
You've been with them for too long

603
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,820
and you're as childish as them now.

604
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,900
Yes, I've spent

605
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,700
quite a long while with them.

606
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,860
But I've learned

607
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,860
to be bold and responsible.

608
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,460
Are you serious?

609
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,300
People tend

610
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,500
to be affected by their surroundings.

611
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,300
To my surprise,

612
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,900
you've changed so quickly.

613
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,220
When you're my age...

614
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,420
Mr. Jiang.

615
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,180
I really don't understand

616
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,140
what those vague things
you're talking about.

617
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,300
There's a principle for athletes,

618
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
that's when we're young, confident

619
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,140
and in tip-top condition,

620
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,260
we attack aggressively.

621
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,940
But when do we slack off?

622
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,700
It's when we realized
that we're not young anymore

623
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,380
and our skills and
physical condition have declined,

624
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,660
we turn to defenses.

625
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,540
Hence, age is nothing worth
bragging about to us.

626
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,220
Especially someone older
and more experienced

627
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,300
taunts another person for being childish

628
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,700
and ignorant,

629
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,060
that surely shows that they are old.

630
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,180
Pretty good.

631
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,660
Well-said.

632
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,220
Young man, I praise you for your courage.

633
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,780
You can wait for another year.

634
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,780
Why do you ask for the wild card instead?

635
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,860
Besides,

636
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,900
the card isn't with me,

637
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,940
Gao Li has it.

638
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,220
(From now on,)

639
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,860
(the first one who catches the fish)

640
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,300
(can get the wild card.)

641
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,060
Got it.

642
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,180
What do you mean?

643
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,460
Are you fooling us?

644
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,980
I have never seen someone like you

645
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,580
who wants attention so much

646
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,700
when you have nothing in hand.

647
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,940
Does that card belong to you?

648
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,540
As an "old" man,

649
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,620
I will you give some advice.

650
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,500
Begging Gao Li for it

651
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,420
is seeking embarrassment for yourself.

652
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Let's say I have the card.

653
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,780
If I were to give it to you,

654
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,300
will it be helpful to you?

655
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,060
Do you know what that tournament means?

656
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,900
Can you win?

657
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,260
Liang You'an, you made a mistake too.

658
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,140
How can you let an athlete

659
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,620
to participate in a competition

660
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,540
that he has zero chance to win.

661
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,020
You're destroying him.

662
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,260
I've had enough of your patronizing.

663
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,060
Can you please

664
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,700
face yourself honestly?

665
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,340
Over the years,

666
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,940
you have been a pure selfish jerk

667
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,700
to your family and colleagues.

668
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,580
Yet, you always pretend

669
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,740
that you're kind and generous.

670
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
How dare a selfish man like you

671
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,740
request an eternal loyalty for you?

672
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,940
You see,

673
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,620
you've fooled every one of us.

674
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,300
Listen up,

675
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,300
you will suffer for this.

676
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,660
You definitely will.

677
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,460
No.

678
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
You're suffering now.

679
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,420
Be careful of the escalator.

680
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,340
Well done.

681
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,500
You said you were going
to bow down though

682
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,300
and talked senses to me.

683
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,300
Yet you're the one who flared up first.

684
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,540
I'm so furious. This is infuriating.

685
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,580
We staked everything we have,

686
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,620
but our destiny is decided

687
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,940
by such a silly game they played.

688
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,820
Why?

689
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,980
It's fine
if they don't give us the card.

690
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,260
Why are they fooling us?

691
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,660
This is indeed an eye-opener.

692
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:52,900
What's wrong?

693
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,500
I have something
more provocative to say.

694
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,020
Geez, I missed it.

695
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,380
That's not my best.

696
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,020
Well, calm down.

697
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,900
Mr. Jiang would be crying

698
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,860
if you lash out just now.

699
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,940
Save it for next time.

700
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,620
I'm angry that I have a headache now.

701
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,820
Though he's at fault this time,

702
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,380
there's something he said

703
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,620
that's right.

704
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,660
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

705
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,220
I should've told you

706
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,140
about the rules in advance.

707
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,340
It's great if you win.

708
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,660
But even if you don't,
you will still earn credits.

709
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,980
With one point more,

710
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,260
you will be acknowledged internationally.

711
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,780
Besides, your promotion

712
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,620
will bring boons to the club too.

713
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,740
However,

714
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,380
it's also likely

715
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,700
that I might lead you to face a huge failure.

716
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,580
Hold on.

717
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,420
You might lead me to...

718
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:40,980
Gosh.

719
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Stop taking the blame, all right?

720
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,700
Liang You'an.

721
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,620
That's a wildcard tournament.

722
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,660
Not everyone has the chance to lose there.

723
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,940
If we can get the card this year,

724
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,900
I must give it a shot no matter what.

725
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,780
I'm so excited just thinking about that.

726
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,900
If we can't get it,

727
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,940
as what Jiaojiao's dad said,

728
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,460
I will earn the eligibility myself

729
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,140
for the tournament next year.

730
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
I will get that point sooner or later.

731
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Don't lose your nerve.

732
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,740
Yes, you're right.

733
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,980
I shouldn't give up even
when the competition hasn't started.

734
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,740
I guess you didn't eat much just now.

735
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,659
Come on, let's have supper.

736
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,260
Thank you so much
for taking out your time

737
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,860
to visit our club, Mr. Gao.

738
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:49,940
Liang You'an.

739
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,980
Isn't this too grand?

740
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,099
You deserve this, Mr. Gao.

741
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,619
Mr. Gao, being a busy man as you're,

742
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,659
we should give you a grand reception

743
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,980
to welcome your arrival.

744
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,700
Oh?

745
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,020
Hasn't Jiang Jie been here before?

746
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,300
No.

747
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,900
Is this exhibition done now?

748
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,660
We need to go for training now.

749
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,100
Jiaojiao.

750
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,380
Why is your photo in second place?

751
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,980
(First place, Song Sanchuan)
(Second place, Jiang Jiaojiao)

752
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,300
(Second place, Jiang Jiaojiao)
You ought to work harder.

753
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,980
Don't learn from your dad

754
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,700
who's always been in second place.

755
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,340
Sure.

756
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,060
If there's nothing else,

757
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,460
we shall get back to training.

758
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,300
Let's go.

759
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,900
Let's go.

760
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,540
Liang You'an.

761
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,020
I shall meet

762
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,260
the athlete who's using the card.

763
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,700
We know

764
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,820
you must be eager to play.

765
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,940
He has already warmed up

766
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,220
and is waiting for you on the court.

767
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,620
Sir.

768
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,780
What would you like to play?

769
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,020
Just normal playing.

770
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,180
I've been playing as an amateur
for four to five years.

771
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,940
I have some basics.

772
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,500
Sure.

773
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,500
Furthermore,

774
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:32,980
I've prepared you

775
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,020
some delicious

776
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,860
high-calcium gummy.

777
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,780
Why do you dress up like this?

778
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,180
I don't have many followers lately.

779
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,580
So, I'm trying

780
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,780
to come out with something new.

781
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,060
You need to spend money
to advertise yourself.

782
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,820
Do you think it will help
attract many followers?

783
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,740
You believe in solving problems with money.

784
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,660
But to me,

785
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,900
I must find a solution
that doesn't need money.

786
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,860
Look.

787
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,220
Our values are polar opposites.

788
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,700
Why can't a polar bear

789
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
and a penguin get along?

790
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,780
Because

791
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,620
one is at the North Pole
and the other is at the South Pole.

792
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,300
Not really.

793
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
There's a chance

794
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,700
that they can get along.

795
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,540
Image this.

796
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,500
If they are brought to the same zoo

797
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,540
and housed in the Polar Animal Region,

798
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,340
they could be neighbors

799
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,580
and perform shows together.

800
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,300
How about you perform

801
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,180
as a polar bear?

802
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,060
Polar...

803
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,140
I think

804
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,340
I will perform as a penguin.

805
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
Sure.

806
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,820
Begins.

807
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,340
This is awesome.

808
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,940
That was really a nice game.

809
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,220
You could feed every ball so accurately.

810
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,580
Liang You'an.

811
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,300
I didn't know

812
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,540
having a fitting training mate

813
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,420
is such a great experience.

814
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,780
Every ball is returned just well.

815
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,700
It makes me feel like I'm an expert.

816
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,340
You sure are.

817
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:22,700
Mr. Gao.

818
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,260
You can play very well.

819
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,460
Yes, I know.

820
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,460
Your skills deserve that wild card.

821
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,460
Thank you, sir.

822
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,620
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

823
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,860
I have learned about

824
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,900
how important this card is

825
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,820
to your club.

826
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,460
After completing this tournament,

827
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,340
the club's professional status

828
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,700
will be greatly improved.

829
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,020
Also, the ten-player system you adopted

830
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,420
will be more convincing, right?

831
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,220
Exactly so.

832
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,660
Mr. Gao.

833
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,820
I'm really grateful to you

834
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,740
as you're willing

835
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,980
to offer the wild card to our player.

836
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,820
To be honest,

837
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,500
I've always remembered
that you helped me before.

838
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,220
During the incident with Jin Yi,

839
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,260
you stood up for me

840
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,740
to point out the athlete,

841
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,380
it was actually a great support for me.

842
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,100
Now,

843
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,780
I'm returning the favor.

844
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,980
Still,

845
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,140
I'm a businessman

846
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,860
and I don't do business
without benefits.

847
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,980
You understand that, right?

848
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,580
Certainly.

849
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,060
Please tell me what you need.

850
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,420
Not only can I give you the wild card,

851
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,100
but also give you money.

852
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,380
Even Young Space will buy Top Smash.

853
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,260
I've read your proposal.

854
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,380
You're planning on seeking a better investor

855
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,580
to take over the club

856
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,380
when it has a reputation.

857
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,620
According to your plan,

858
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,380
after this wildcard tournament,

859
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,780
both Song Sanchuan

860
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,340
and the club will earn a big reputation.

861
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,260
Isn't it a good choice

862
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,260
to come back to your old home?

863
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,980
Mr. Gao.

864
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,300
Back then,

865
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,820
this club was abandoned by you,

866
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,820
why are you buying it now again?

867
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,500
I abandoned the club before

868
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,860
because it was worthless.

869
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,460
But it's not the same case now,

870
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,060
this club is obviously a potential project.

871
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,660
Most importantly,

872
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,660
I want it back to my hand.

873
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,180
Is this the condition
for the wild card you offer?

874
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,700
Think about this carefully.

875
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,500
This is a great deal for you.

876
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,380
I don't need to think about it.

877
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,380
I can answer you right now,

878
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,260
no way.

879
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,100
Yes,

880
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,740
maybe this club will be sold one day,

881
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,980
but not now.

882
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,660
We still have a load of unfinished business.

883
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,740
Most importantly,

884
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,020
I will choose an investor

885
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,020
that shares unanimous values with me.

886
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,580
This club will never be a pawn

887
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,100
in the corporate power struggles

888
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,020
nor a short-term tool of making profits.

889
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,500
So, you're turning me down now.

890
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,340
We're off then.

891
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,340
Now only I come to know

892
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,860
what kind of devious foxes

893
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,780
you were dealing with.

894
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,220
All of them are just sly.

895
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,340
I was rather surprised

896
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,100
that you could make
such a good training mate for him.

897
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,940
You would have to face their harsh words
if I don't satisfy them.

898
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,700
I know how things work.

899
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,860
Such a devious fox like Mr. Gao

900
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,260
was actually requesting to buy our club,

901
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,860
which means

902
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,020
we're on the right track now.

903
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,620
Now is the best opportunity for us.

904
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,380
We have no reason to give up easily.

905
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,620
It's Jiang Jiaojiao.

906
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,980
Take the call.

907
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,620
Sure.

908
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,620
(Jiang Jiaojiao)

909
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,340
What's up?

910
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,420
(Where's Liang You'an?)

911
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,860
She's with me now.

912
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,300
Seriously?

913
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,660
You talk to her.

914
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,500
Put him on speaker.

915
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,300
What's the matter?

916
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,180
Liang You'an.

917
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,300
(My dad called me this morning)

918
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,220
(out of a sudden)

919
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,740
(and said something
about the wild card.)

920
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,300
(He said the card isn't with him,)

921
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,540
(but he knew)

922
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,340
(Mr. Gao is using it for someone else)

923
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
(for something minor.)

924
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,140
(We should try to get the card again.)

925
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,500
Really? That's great.

926
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,620
Can you find out what resource

927
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,940
Mr. Gao is trading it for

928
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,020
and send it to me?

929
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,740
I will take care of it.

930
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,700
Well done.

931
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,700
Mr. Jiang seems to have taken
your words to heart.

932
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,980
He even reaches out to you.

933
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,500
Anyway,

934
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,340
I won't give up till the last minute.

935
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,460
I must give it a shot, right?

936
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,460
That's right. Go for it.

937
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,740
Play some music.

938
00:43:25,156 --> 00:43:28,276
♪If we don't talk about worldly logic♪

939
00:43:28,436 --> 00:43:32,556
♪If we let our feelings go
and not escape them♪

940
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:37,876
♪Should we continue
