=Episode 13=

3
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:56,040
(Song Sanchuan Likes Me?)

4
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,172
The new coach will come soon.

5
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,372
I will forge ahead.

6
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,532
Whether you will follow me or not,

7
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,052
it's up to you.

8
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,012
Liang You'an,

9
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:37,972
I'll work hard

10
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:41,812
to be your strength,

11
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,772
so that you can be yourself.

12
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:42,292
Luo Nian,

13
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:45,612
Song Sanchuan likes me?

14
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,212
Right?

15
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,572
We're not devout men and women.

16
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:51,300
If he has any thoughts,
you would've known by now.

17
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:55,652
Well, I can't stress enough

18
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:56,412
that I have no prejudice

19
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,692
towards age gap relationships.

20
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,052
However, speaking rationally,

21
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,532
we are ten years apart.

22
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:01,172
Nine years.

23
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,292
Doesn't matter.

24
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,532
Who would assume first impressions

25
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:05,932
for potential partners?

26
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:06,612
Maybe you won't,

27
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:08,252
but it doesn't mean that he wouldn't.

28
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,612
No, no.

29
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,052
I thought about it,

30
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:14,852
we were just two people at work.

31
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,772
It's a work connection.

32
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:17,852
I don't think anyone would

33
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,492
think of the other as anything.

34
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,992
If there wasn't love at first sight,

35
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:24,852
was there love at subsequent sights?

36
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:28,732
Do you feel like

37
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,652
getting a second wind in life?

38
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:30,972
Is your old soul falling in love?

39
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:35,412
Fine. I'll admit that

40
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,212
I take a liking to him.

41
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:39,972
He is clean-looking,

42
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:41,972
pure, with boyish charm.

43
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,292
When he's on the pitch,

44
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:45,492
he's courageous, tenacious, persistent.

45
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,692
He's good-looking, well-built even.

46
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:50,572
Are you trying to show off now?

47
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,492
I just admire him for these qualities,

48
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,452
but I don't really think much about it.

49
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,172
Well I think

50
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,372
it's not that you don't have thoughts,

51
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:02,972
but you just dare not think about it.

52
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,732
If he is for real, he really likes you,

53
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:06,692
would you consider?

54
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:15,212
I feel that

55
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,852
things were just starting to get better

56
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:17,972
for the club and for Song Sanchuan.

57
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,492
As the club manager,

58
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:20,212
I can't,

59
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:21,612
and I won't let this kind of thing

60
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,612
mess everything up for the club.

61
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,852
Pass me my book.

62
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:28,292
I won't let it.

63
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:30,452
I would never let that happen.

64
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:40,292
Turn the TV down for a bit.

65
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:41,732
I'd like to read.

66
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,972
If I can transition successfully
from badminton to tennis

67
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:53,252
and stay in the team,

68
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,012
we'll go on a date.

69
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:00,892
Liang You'an,

70
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,252
I'll work hard

71
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,012
to be your strength,

72
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,652
so that you can be yourself.

73
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,900
(Weekly training schedule)

74
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,452
Hello everyone,

75
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,492
I'm the teaching assistant
from Coach Zhang's team.

76
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:34,332
My name is Xu Tan.

77
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:35,252
Hello everyone,

78
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,932
I'm the fitness coach
from Coach Zhang's team.

79
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,572
You can call me Huo.

80
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,052
Starting this week

81
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,732
we'll be the ones training you guys.

82
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,652
The training content

83
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,612
has been handed out to you.

84
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:48,932
What kind of training plan is this?

85
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:50,972
The whole week is just fitness training.

86
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,412
Because we want to

87
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:53,452
quickly understand where

88
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:54,572
your fitness level stands.

89
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:56,052
That's why this week

90
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:57,492
focuses on fitness training.

91
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,572
What about Coach Zhang Yan?

92
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:01,532
He won't be here?

93
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:02,252
He won't be coming.

94
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:03,292
He has jet lag.

95
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:04,492
Time zone difference?

96
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:05,532
Jet lag?

97
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,572
From Beijing to Shenzhen,

98
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,932
where is the time zone difference?

99
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,812
It's the Wimbledon,

100
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:14,332
and the coach is keeping up with

101
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:15,732
the latest techniques,

102
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:17,852
so he stayed up to watch the show live.

103
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,772
When would he be coming over then?

104
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:20,892
That's all for small talk.

105
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:21,572
The more we chat,

106
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:22,532
the less time we have.

107
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:23,412
Come,

108
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:24,932
follow me outdoors.

109
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:29,692
Put down your bags.

110
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:31,612
You won't need it.

111
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:48,532
Faster.

112
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:50,812
That's right.

113
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:52,012
During the games,

114
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:52,852
it's all about endurance.

115
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:53,732
Keep going.

116
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:58,012
Who's shaky here?

117
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:58,732
Stand firm.

118
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:00,772
Rotate your body thoroughly.

119
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:01,932
Straighten your arm.

120
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:04,012
Yes, tuck your shoulders back.

121
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,772
Squat jump then turn.

122
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:13,892
Go.

123
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:14,772
Back.

124
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,572
Don't hunch, don't hunch.

125
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,292
Alright, next.

126
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:26,652
Down with the hips.

127
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:28,412
Keep up, Chen Zhe.

128
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:33,372
Lower your centre of gravity.

129
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:34,652
Keep your bottoms down.

130
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:35,812
You're almost there.

131
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:36,732
Alternate the use of your hands.

132
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:39,332
Straighten your arms.

133
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:41,252
Yes, tuck your shoulders in.

134
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:41,852
Speed up.

135
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,172
Faster, faster.

136
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:49,972
Take one.

137
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,572
After that,

138
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,492
prepare for hurdle turns.

139
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:58,852
Turns?

140
00:09:58,852 --> 00:09:59,492
Every day, you ask us

141
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,612
to carry that stupid rod.

142
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:02,532
Twist and turn, twist and turn,

143
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,452
are you making fun of us?

144
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:05,332
If I wanted to scratch myself,

145
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:06,412
this is all I can do now.

146
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:10,332
It has been a week,

147
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,852
we spent all day on fitness training.

148
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:14,972
I haven't seen a tennis ball,

149
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,892
let alone a racket.

150
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:19,852
I'm so sorry, coach,

151
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:22,092
I'm taking leave.

152
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,452
My back hurts.

153
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,172
When Zhang Yan's back,

154
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:29,732
my back will be fine by then.

155
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:49,732
You're not leaving?

156
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,092
Alright, get ready.

157
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,692
Raise your leg to 90 degrees.

158
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,340
It's nuts.

159
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:49,092
This was the wine you wanted.

160
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,692
Delivering it by hand?

161
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,492
Thanks.

162
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,572
It's just so difficult to meet you.

163
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,052
A lot of things couldn't be

164
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,652
communicated well through WeChat.

165
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:06,732
I felt that it would be better

166
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,012
to come and see you directly.

167
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,892
If you're not happy with

168
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,012
our payment methods,

169
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,172
we can talk that through.

170
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:20,852
But not showing up for two weeks

171
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:22,492
after signing the contract?

172
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:27,052
Everyone has a lot to say about that.

173
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,012
I told them that

174
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,452
I hired a really great trainer for them.

175
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:30,652
They looked forward to you.

176
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,092
It's been two weeks however,

177
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,212
and they haven't even seen your face.

178
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:35,532
The kids at the club undergo

179
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:37,652
fitness training every day,

180
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,692
and have yet to learn any techniques.

181
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:42,012
I owe them an explanation for this.

182
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:53,252
You were the one to invite me,

183
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:56,812
so you should have faith in my expertise.

184
00:12:58,452 --> 00:12:59,652
On top of that,

185
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,332
I'm not really here

186
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,572
just for the money, am I?

187
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,132
You know the reason I left

188
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,012
my previous club.

189
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:07,972
In my team,

190
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,772
we don't sell classes and recruit members.

191
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,612
You're in charge of the business,

192
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:13,692
and I'm in charge of the technical aspects.

193
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:14,852
Think we agreed upon that.

194
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:17,452
That's why I'm not talking to you

195
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,492
about commercial members.

196
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:19,852
I'm referring to professional players,

197
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:20,932
their training plan.

198
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,572
That's even less within your purview.

199
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,092
Because you are not a professional.

200
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,172
I've seen a lot of unprofessional managers

201
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,172
who are like you.

202
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:31,452
They all share the same trait,

203
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:32,652
they don't stick around.

204
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,932
They're either demoted,

205
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:36,372
or temporarily transferred.

206
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,212
When you're working on something

207
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,252
without a long-term plan,

208
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,452
you can only see immediate gains.

209
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,892
Just like how you are now,

210
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,732
keep on pressuring me.

211
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:59,772
I'm not the kind of manager as you said.

212
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,372
You're not wrong.

213
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:02,932
You are even less professional,

214
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,372
for getting a badminton player into the team.

215
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:06,772
If our peers know about this,

216
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,132
it would become a great joke.

217
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:09,812
Please leave.

218
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:11,652
I'm going to take a shower.

219
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,492
Everyone can't stand it anymore.

220
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,252
It's not just them,

221
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:25,532
I'm starting to want to give up too.

222
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:27,212
I don't really blame them this time.

223
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:28,212
Have you met any coach

224
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:29,132
this arrogant?

225
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,012
No.

226
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,612
When new coaches join the team,

227
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:33,892
they usually just try to impress you

228
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:34,692
with their skills.

229
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,612
This guy just doesn't care,

230
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:37,852
really outrageous.

231
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,092
Is he trying to just stay and

232
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,012
squander our money away?

233
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:43,452
Why don't you

234
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:44,852
pick a tournament?

235
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,332
If we're going to play,

236
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,692
he's got to come and lead us.

237
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:48,812
That makes sense.

238
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:49,732
That's a great reminder.

239
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,332
I'll look into tournaments now.

240
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:52,172
Where are you going?

241
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:53,292
Thanks.

242
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:08,092
(I realise that)

243
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,732
(if I were to pick public places,)

244
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:10,452
(then you'll come.)

245
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,052
(Are you scared of me?)

246
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:13,692
I'm not stupid.

247
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,252
If you pay,

248
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,932
I'll spend time to play your game.

249
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,612
I know what you're thinking,

250
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,492
you spend a couple hundred to
feel that you're in control.

251
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:21,972
Well honestly, that kind of money

252
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,052
is nothing to you guys.

253
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,852
Neither of us is at loss,

254
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,132
let's not take advantage of
each other too.

255
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:29,492
When this is over, we'll still be cool.

256
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:30,492
What do you think?

257
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:33,812
Black Angus sirloin.

258
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:35,372
Grilled black tiger prawns over rice.

259
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:39,372
What a sumptuous feast!

260
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:40,972
You've ordered our most expensive course.

261
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:41,892
Now everything has been served.

262
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:42,772
I hope you enjoy your meal.

263
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:43,852
Okay, thank you.

264
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:45,652
Miss,

265
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:47,212
we would like our customers to feel

266
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:47,972
comfortable dining here,

267
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:49,212
so we don't allow live or

268
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,372
video recordings to be made when dining.

269
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,372
Can I take pictures then?

270
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,252
Yes, you can.

271
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,412
If you're not too loud,

272
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:56,492
you can still take a few videos.

273
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:57,572
Thank you.

274
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:58,772
This is your wine,

275
00:15:58,772 --> 00:15:59,332
I'll fill your glass.

276
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,012
Thank you.

277
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,012
Enjoy your meal.

278
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:50,852
Miss,

279
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:52,572
you don't have to go to the front desk,

280
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,812
I'll go get your bill for you.

281
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:54,732
What do you mean?

282
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:56,972
The reservation wasn't paid?

283
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:00,452
Can you double-check to make sure?

284
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:02,172
Sure, please hold on.

285
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:14,211
Miss,

286
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:15,092
your bill tonight

287
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,292
hasn't been paid yet.

288
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:29,452
(Let me see how you beg me now.)

289
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,692
Please charge 1,000 on this card,

290
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,052
2,000 on this card,

291
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,732
and the remaining on this card.

292
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,332
Alright, I'll be right back.

293
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:09,812
Miss.

294
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,172
(ILovePeaches)
(Reasonable price to pay for a lesson.)

295
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:48,892
(Don't be so vain next time.)

296
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:50,892
(If it doesn't belong to you,)

297
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,532
(don't try to pretend like it does.)

298
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:54,230
(Peachy Peach: Yes, I knew I ate stuff...)

299
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:55,572
Yes.

300
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:57,412
I knew I ate stuff that wasn't meant for me.

301
00:19:57,452 --> 00:19:58,532
I spat it all out.

302
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,052
I worked so hard.

303
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:01,452
I do live broadcasts four hours a day.

304
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:02,212
As vain as I can be,

305
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,772
I'm making a living on my own.

306
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:04,972
Do people like you

307
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,292
even own anything that was

308
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,212
earned through your efforts?

309
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:08,852
Think you're qualified to educate me?

310
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:09,772
You're not.

311
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,212
You're here.

312
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:28,732
Any drinks for you?

313
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:29,612
Anything.

314
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,212
Hello,

315
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,372
can I have another

316
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:33,372
peach-flavored alcohol drink?

317
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:33,980
OK.

318
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,252
Out of all the flavours,

319
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:38,412
you had to choose peaches?

320
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:40,412
I like the peach-flavoured one,

321
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,652
and that's none of your business.

322
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,292
You're terrible.

323
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:45,052
Who's bothering you?

324
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:49,452
I just don't understand.

325
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,172
People these days

326
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,332
earn their sense of pride through lying.

327
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:54,332
She's just tougher than
the other content creators.

328
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:55,972
She doesn't depend on men.

329
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,252
This is new.

330
00:20:58,692 --> 00:20:59,892
So who is this girl

331
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:00,612
going against you?

332
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:07,732
(Peachy Peach)
Isn't this girl the one

333
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:08,812
who framed you last time?

334
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,172
(It's an upscale dining restaurant,)

335
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:11,252
(and I especially liked)

336
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:11,932
(one of their dishes,)

337
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:14,612
(the French caramalised apples
with foie gras.)

338
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:15,732
No way.

339
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:18,452
You, and she?

340
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:22,852
Wait.

341
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,252
(Peachy Peach.)
(Thank you, Zhezhe.)

342
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:25,372
(Thank you.)

343
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,420
(WeChat Pay)

344
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:37,652
What are you up to?

345
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:38,652
I don't understand.

346
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:40,692
This is called "I'm buying

347
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,252
my moral high ground back".

348
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,060
(Ms. Kk)

349
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,212
Hello.

350
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:53,972
(Liang Tao.)

351
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,852
(I just watched your live show.)

352
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:56,572
(You did well.)

353
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:58,452
(Does that Zhezhe)

354
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,452
(send you gifts often?)

355
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:01,612
It's his first time doing so.

356
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:03,132
(Really?)

357
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:04,412
(I saw your recent)

358
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:05,052
(stats on live,)

359
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,252
(it's pretty good.)

360
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:07,092
(In this industry,)

361
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,332
(you must know how to seize the moment,)

362
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:10,332
(be a little more proactive,)

363
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,892
(add him as a friend,)

364
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,652
(and work on your relationship with fans.)

365
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,212
(Don't forget)

366
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,132
(your end-of the-month
performance review.)

367
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,700
(Zhezhe: I am your fan Zhezhe)

368
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,380
(Approved "Zhezhe" as a WeChat friend)

369
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,860
(Young Space Tennis Club)

370
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,540
(Zhang Yan)

371
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:45,172
Well this place

372
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:48,092
is still bigger than what we had at D3.

373
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:49,532
It's much bigger.

374
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,692
I heard you're here, Coach Yan.

375
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:59,612
We're having dinner
with the team tonight, right?

376
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,092
Yes.

377
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:03,732
I wanted to show you this.

378
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:04,412
Recently,

379
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:05,852
I've looked up some

380
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:07,332
tournaments and player information

381
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,252
and chose this

382
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,292
corporate tennis tournament in Shenzhen.

383
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:10,972
Maybe through this, you could

384
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,572
see what our players are made of.

385
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:13,932
No need for that.

386
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:15,652
I picked one already.

387
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,092
Which game do you think

388
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:19,092
would suit them?

389
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:21,652
Next week, Shanghai. Friendly match.

390
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:23,332
Shanghai...

391
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:26,972
What's wrong?

392
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:28,612
Nothing.

393
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:30,372
Will you be leading the team?

394
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:31,212
How funny.

395
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:32,652
If not me, who? You?

396
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:37,652
Alright.

397
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:39,372
Then I don't...

398
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:40,012
Xu Tan,

399
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:42,172
didn't I ask you to get protein bars?

400
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:42,812
I did.

401
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:43,852
Huo ate it all.

402
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:44,852
Ate it all?

403
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:46,292
Buy more then.

404
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:47,732
He'll finish them all.

405
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:48,412
Then don't buy anymore.

406
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,132
I'll see you at the restaurant later.

407
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,052
I paid you guys...

408
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:53,332
Bye-bye, Coach Xu.

409
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:14,852
Why don't we,

410
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:17,412
Yan, and the rest of the

411
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:18,812
coaching team,

412
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:20,332
drink together?

413
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,892
Maybe Coach Yan should take this time

414
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:44,652
to talk to them about

415
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:45,892
the game in Shanghai?

416
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:53,972
I found a club from Beijing.

417
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:56,292
They will be training in Shanghai.

418
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:57,852
We'll go over and

419
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:58,892
play a friendly match.

420
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:00,012
You're all likely to lose,

421
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:01,292
so don't take it too personally.

422
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:04,892
Coach Zhang Yan,

423
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,572
that's really a nice way of putting it.

424
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,852
If we are travelling to play,

425
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:16,932
we need travelling expenses.

426
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,212
Yes, and I would like to talk to

427
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:23,492
everyone about this.

428
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,732
Money is pretty tight

429
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,652
for our club recently,

430
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,292
so can we try to

431
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:31,292
prioritize playing locally first?

432
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:37,412
Do you think our club is a community centre?

433
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:39,212
You just go downstairs,

434
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:39,852
play with your neighbours,

435
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:41,212
then emerge a champion, right?

436
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:44,772
A tennis club goes all over the country.

437
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:47,092
If you stay in Shenzhen,

438
00:25:47,452 --> 00:25:48,412
when the season begins,

439
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:49,692
how could that help you get points?

440
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:52,692
I don't like these talks about money.

441
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:54,732
Ms. Liang,

442
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:55,692
regarding money,

443
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:56,812
you don't have to worry about it.

444
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,612
If we were to compete,

445
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:00,452
we are all able to
pay for this on our own, right?

446
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,132
Let's just go to Shanghai then.

447
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:03,892
The airfare, the hotels, it's all on me.

448
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:05,532
If I stay at a 5-star hotel,

449
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,492
my bros will get the same.

450
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:09,172
Great.

451
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:10,532
Come on guys.

452
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:10,932
Come.

453
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:12,012
Let's raise our glasses

454
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:12,932
to our brothers over here.

455
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:14,292
Come.

456
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,132
Whether you're paying or not,

457
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:17,292
I don't care.

458
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:19,652
However, you can only stay at

459
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:20,812
this hotel that I've sent you.

460
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,140
(Fashion Palahotel, Minhang, Shanghai
Price: 180 yuan)

461
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,210
This.

462
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:35,372
180 for a night.

463
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:37,652
From now on, on game days,

464
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:40,332
everyone will have to strictly follow

465
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:42,292
the system standards for

466
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,212
food, accommodation and travel.

467
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:46,052
No one is allowed to leave on their own.

468
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:47,772
There will be no exceptions.

469
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:54,052
We have to thank Sanchuan

470
00:26:54,132 --> 00:26:55,132
for leading us to the baggage claim.

471
00:26:55,172 --> 00:26:56,692
Else you can't even find your luggage.

472
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:57,972
Wow, you spoke like

473
00:26:57,972 --> 00:26:58,892
you could do that on your own.

474
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,852
What were you loitering around?

475
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,252
I just didn't put my heart into it.

476
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:02,972
If I wanted to,

477
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:03,612
I am sure to find that place.

478
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:04,092
Believe it or not.

479
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,812
Yeah, go on with your lies.

480
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:10,252
Coach Yan,

481
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:11,692
where's our ride?

482
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,172
Over there.

483
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:14,932
Come with me.

484
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,572
What about Huo and the others?

485
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:17,572
We'll keep in touch later,

486
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:18,612
both of them left already.

487
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:19,412
Hurry up.

488
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:21,932
Come, let's go.

489
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:25,892
My legs are not mine anymore.

490
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:28,532
I think we've walked miles.

491
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:29,972
Where is our ride?

492
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,132
We're here.

493
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:41,172
Our ride is the bus?

494
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:42,772
As far as I can remember,

495
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:44,172
I've never taken the bus.

496
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:44,892
I'm not getting on that.

497
00:27:45,012 --> 00:27:46,412
If you never took the bus before,

498
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,212
how would you win a game even?

499
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:49,692
How are these two things

500
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:51,292
related at all?

501
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:52,892
Do you know how to buy a ticket?

502
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:56,132
I don't have any money.

503
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:57,412
I don't have any change.

504
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:58,332
Do you have change?

505
00:27:58,412 --> 00:27:59,012
No.

506
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,132
All my stuff for the game

507
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:01,452
was packed by my mom.

508
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:02,612
I have no idea

509
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:03,572
how to buy tickets in Shanghai.

510
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,612
Just go onto this app

511
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:06,852
and look for this travel card.

512
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:07,812
Pick 'Shanghai',

513
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:08,532
then you'll get the ticket.

514
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:09,332
Wait, hold on, what?

515
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:09,932
I didn't catch you.

516
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:10,452
So in this app,

517
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:11,172
just scroll down.

518
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,252
What app?

519
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:13,532
Then...

520
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:14,212
Let me have a look.

521
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:16,892
They're not usually that stupid.

522
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,372
Do you know why tennis is special?

523
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,412
It's because out of all the ball sports,

524
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,292
it's the only kind of sport where

525
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,852
athletes are on their own for the game.

526
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,212
After one match,

527
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:29,892
you can take a break,

528
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:30,652
you can rest,

529
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:32,052
but your coach won't guide you,

530
00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:33,092
and there's no team to support you.

531
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:35,252
You have to solve all your problems alone.

532
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:37,852
Right now, they don't even know

533
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:38,452
how to buy a ticket,

534
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,692
can they even tackle an opponent?

535
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:44,852
There were many opportunities in life

536
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,492
where they can practice problem-solving,

537
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:48,812
yet we are the ones who block them from doing so.

538
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:52,372
When you are on the pitch,

539
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:56,052
if you don't believe in problem-solving,

540
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,252
you will be crushed by your problems.

541
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:00,372
Take a good look at them,

542
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,092
this is what your team looks like.

543
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:06,252
Which one?

544
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:07,572
I got it, I got it.

545
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:08,372
Tap on this.

546
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,012
Right, right there.

547
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,932
You see, travel card, pick 'Shanghai'.

548
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:11,652
Yeah.

549
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:12,412
Done.

550
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:12,972
You just need this code.

551
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:13,812
Just this code.

552
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,372
Shanghai.

553
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,292
I'm almost done.

554
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,772
Select the travel card.

555
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,412
Is it this bus?

556
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:22,212
Should be it.

557
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:23,252
Get on, get on.

558
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:24,612
This is the bus.

559
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:25,772
Get on, guys.

560
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:26,532
Go.

561
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:38,132
You stepped on my shoes.

562
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:38,812
Don't hold onto my clothes.

563
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:39,812
Look bro,

564
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:40,612
give me some space, bro.

565
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,932
Jiao, can you move over a little?

566
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:46,812
Don't push, thank you very much.

567
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,012
Be careful.

568
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,732
Bro, could you stop pushing?

569
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:53,332
Someone else pushed me.

570
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:56,052
There's no more space!

571
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:57,412
Careful.

572
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:32,580
(Fashion Palahotel)

573
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:34,092
Coach,

574
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:35,012
this place

575
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,332
looks nothing like its photos online.

576
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:37,972
It looks much worse in real life.

577
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:39,092
Is it even safe to stay here?

578
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,252
Of course it's fine.

579
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,332
It's in very high demand.

580
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,412
Let's just go and have a look first.

581
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:46,252
Although we booked all standard rooms,

582
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:47,492
fortunately,

583
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:49,452
we still have our own room.

584
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:50,372
What standard room?

585
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:51,772
I don't even want it if it's a suite.

586
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,532
That said,

587
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:54,052
I don't think that they have a suite even.

588
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,412
If you want to stay, stay.

589
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:56,372
I am leaving.

590
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:57,492
Hold on.

591
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,332
Coach Yan picked this place.

592
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:00,212
No one can leave.

593
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:01,452
This is the first time

594
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,132
our club is taking part in

595
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:04,492
a game for team building.

596
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:06,612
Should anyone leave without permission,

597
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:08,532
I'll take it that they voluntarily quit.

598
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,532
When we get back, come to me

599
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:10,492
to fill in the forms.

600
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:12,492
We don't have enough time today,

601
00:31:12,572 --> 00:31:13,932
so for meals, you're on your own.

602
00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:15,052
The departing time for tomorrow,

603
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:15,812
I will send it to the group.

604
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:17,532
Whoever's late, you'll be forfeited.

605
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:18,412
Do you understand?

606
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,732
Now, we'll check in to the hotel. Follow me.

607
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:22,032
Let's go.

608
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:23,612
Let's go.

609
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:24,652
Go.

610
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,052
Come.

611
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:36,412
Come to my room later.

612
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:36,932
Sure, sure.

613
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:37,852
I'll come and find you later.

614
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:38,372
Okay.

615
00:31:58,732 --> 00:31:59,532
Liang You'an,

616
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,492
switch rooms with me.

617
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:02,612
This is near the elevator.

618
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:03,692
If you stay among us,

619
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:04,252
it's safer for you.

620
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:05,332
No. It's too noisy,

621
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:06,372
it'll affect your rest.

622
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,012
What are you thinking?

623
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:09,012
Coach would never let me

624
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,012
play tomorrow.

625
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,332
Here, 8711.

626
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:14,052
Go, go.

627
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,640
(Song Sanchuan)
(Liang You'an,)

628
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,692
(do you want to have pan-fried bun?)

629
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:54,052
(Liang You'an)
(Is it far? I'm a little tired.)

630
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:55,932
(Song Sanchuan)
(It's just 500 metres from here.)

631
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:57,332
(It seems quite famous.)

632
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:00,692
(Liang You'an)
(Then we can go.)

633
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:01,972
(Send me the address.)

634
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:04,132
(Liang You'an)
(I'll ask Jiao if they want to go.)

635
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,480
(Song Sanchuan)
(OK.)

636
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,572
I'm sorry.

637
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,052
The second and third floor

638
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:33,372
are all rented out
to commercial retailers.

639
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,492
It's not within our purview.

640
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:36,771
What about the sixth floor up?

641
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:38,052
That belongs to the hotel, right?

642
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:39,811
Is it the hotel's responsibility to

643
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:41,331
care for the safety of their customers?

644
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:44,771
Your fire exits are all locked.

645
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,052
In the case of a fire,

646
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,532
that will cost lives.

647
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,572
Don't worry,

648
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:49,972
this building hasn't caught fire before.

649
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,212
How funny.

650
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:53,532
If there is a fire, will we be

651
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:54,771
standing around talking still?

652
00:34:58,812 --> 00:34:59,572
How about this?

653
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:00,732
Either you call

654
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:01,772
the owner of the property

655
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,212
and get this sorted,

656
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:04,532
or I'll call the fire department.

657
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,172
Wait.

658
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:06,732
I'm free anyway,

659
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,332
I have the time.

660
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:07,932
Wait, don't.

661
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:09,292
I'll let my manager know.

662
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:12,892
Coach Yan,

663
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,572
is this a habit of yours?

664
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:20,732
Whether you're a coach,

665
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:21,852
or you're leading a team,

666
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:22,892
when managing a team,

667
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:24,732
what most important, apart from results,

668
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:26,972
is the safety of your team.

669
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:31,452
A few years ago, this happened

670
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:32,532
to a club in Japan.

671
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:34,092
In an old building like this,

672
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:35,412
things are piled at the fire exit,

673
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:36,372
and the doors are locked.

674
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:37,252
It's just normal.

675
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,652
This was supposed to be your job.

676
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:41,892
Yet since you are not professional enough,

677
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:43,452
so I'm doing your job for you.

678
00:35:45,732 --> 00:35:47,892
I might not be professional enough,

679
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,172
but I'm lucky enough to find someone

680
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:51,172
who is very professional.

681
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:55,772
All these sweet talks

682
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:57,412
won't get to me.

683
00:35:58,892 --> 00:35:59,332
Coach Yan,

684
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:00,052
we are heading out to eat.

685
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:01,092
Do you want to come with us?

686
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,292
Do you need an umbrella?

687
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:21,772
Hurry up.

688
00:36:21,892 --> 00:36:23,532
I'm starving.

689
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,732
I should've gone on my own.

690
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:28,412
I'm done soon.

691
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,252
Check my phone for me.

692
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:31,092
Did someone reply to my WeChat messages?

693
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:31,620
Help me send a reply.

694
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:43,532
(Hello, pretty.)

695
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:44,852
(Hello.)

696
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:46,012
(Peachy Peach)
(Let's have dinner together sometime.)

697
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:47,372
(What would you like to eat?)

698
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:48,332
(No need for that.)

699
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,172
(Thank you for supporting
my live broadcast.)

700
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:51,012
(You're welcome.)

701
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,572
(I'll be sure to invite you again.)

702
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:54,852
Chen Zhe!

703
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:55,692
Why are you yelling?

704
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:56,932
I'm not done yet.

705
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:58,692
How did you start chatting with

706
00:36:58,772 --> 00:36:59,532
Peachy Peach?

707
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:00,612
On WeChat even!

708
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:03,132
That day,

709
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:03,932
didn't you use my account

710
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,172
to send her gifts during the broadcast?

711
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:06,092
I thought,

712
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:06,932
I've spent this money,

713
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:08,492
I'll get something out of it.

714
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:09,452
Then,

715
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:10,412
I just sent her a request.

716
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:11,292
She approved me.

717
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,812
I just had time on my hands,

718
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:13,692
so we just made small talk.

719
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:15,292
You call this small talk?

720
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:16,612
Do you have any self-respect?

721
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:18,652
You're shameless, disrespectful.

722
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:19,692
Look at you.

723
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,092
Why are you yelling?

724
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:22,132
Your concerns are about the money,

725
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:23,332
or the girl?

726
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:27,652
Block her.

727
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:29,012
Let's see how this could go on.

728
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:30,492
(Delete contact)
This is my WeChat,

729
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:31,692
how is it you're blocking her?

730
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:35,572
Fine, just delete it.

731
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:36,652
Don't you want to eat?

732
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:37,372
Let's go.

733
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:38,172
I'll change.

734
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:39,612
Eat?

735
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:40,612
I'm not going.

736
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,052
I'll starve.

737
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:44,052
I hope you starve too.

738
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:50,532
This temper is so big,

739
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,892
guess he'll be full from that.

740
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,772
Where's everyone else?

741
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:56,892
Dai Yi is asleep.

742
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:58,332
Jiang Jiaojiao and Chen Zhe said

743
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,772
they didn't want pan-fried bun.

744
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:01,452
These two are really spoiled brats.

745
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:02,732
They better not sneak out

746
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:03,812
in the middle of the night

747
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:04,972
and affect tomorrow's game.

748
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:05,972
Have a look at the menu.

749
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,852
I don't think they will.

750
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:10,252
Jiao said he wants to
beat the opponent so bad,

751
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:11,332
that Zhang Yan

752
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,212
would be then humbled a little.

753
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:15,092
I'll order for you?

754
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:31,452
That's too juicy.

755
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:32,612
Did you burn yourself?

756
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:33,772
I'm fine.

757
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:35,532
When you're eating pan-fried bun,

758
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:36,852
we usually follow this little verse.

759
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:37,692
Have you heard of it?

760
00:38:37,812 --> 00:38:39,772
Take a bite, drink the juice,
put the whole thing in your mouth.

761
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:42,132
First, take a pan-fried bun.

762
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:44,132
Take a bite.

763
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:47,172
Then,

764
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:49,332
drink up all the juice.

765
00:38:53,092 --> 00:38:54,412
Dip it in some chili,

766
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,252
put the whole thing in your mouth.

767
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:04,412
Here, tissue.

768
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,052
You should finish chewing first.

769
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:07,972
You try it now.

770
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:08,772
I'll try.

771
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:11,372
Take a small bite.

772
00:39:14,572 --> 00:39:15,412
Then.

773
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:18,732
Right?

774
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:21,252
You can smell the aroma of the meat

775
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:23,212
and feel the crispiness of the bottom.

776
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:24,212
That's really good, right?

777
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:24,972
Very tasty.

778
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:26,372
When I was about twenty years old,

779
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,012
I really loved to eat.

780
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:28,932
During that time,

781
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:29,732
I was staying abroad,

782
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:30,412
so if I have a craving,

783
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:31,332
I'll just make all sorts of

784
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:32,612
delicacies for myself.

785
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:35,012
When I came back,

786
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:37,252
I was like a kid in a candy store.

787
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:38,852
All the good food and drinks,

788
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:39,692
in hotels or in restaurants,

789
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:40,732
I will find them all.

790
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:42,572
I didn't find out that

791
00:39:42,572 --> 00:39:43,612
you have this hobby.

792
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:46,492
I don't know

793
00:39:46,532 --> 00:39:49,332
when did I start to lose my enthusiasm.

794
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,132
Right now,

795
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:54,412
compared to doing reviews or
trying out new restaurants,

796
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:55,772
I'd rather just eat those few

797
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,932
same restaurants and order the same dishes.

798
00:39:58,052 --> 00:39:58,692
It's less tiring.

799
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:04,652
I think, Liang You'an,

800
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:06,572
from now on,

801
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:08,492
we should be meal buddies.

802
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:11,692
You

803
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:13,692
can teach me all your secrets

804
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:14,572
from your food adventures.

805
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,212
How about that?

806
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:24,012
What would I be able to teach you?

807
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:24,772
I'm eating all these

808
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,172
unhealthy foods,

809
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:28,132
and you are an athlete.

810
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:29,092
You,

811
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:31,252
you have to watch your diet

812
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,212
and play well.

813
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:33,772
Eat more vegetables.

814
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:10,012
Excuse me,

815
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:10,972
you have this room

816
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:11,772
8708

817
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:13,052
that's near the elevator and noisy.

818
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:14,412
Let me change that up a floor for you.

819
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,452
It's alright, give it to me.

820
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:15,892
I'll take that.

821
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:16,852
No.

822
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,652
I don't want to affect

823
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:19,292
the players' or coaches' rest.

824
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,012
You can take this room.

825
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,532
I'll take this room.

826
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,212
OK.

827
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:26,052
Sure, you're not busy, you can have it.

828
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,700
(Young Space Tennis Club
Beijing D3 Tennis Club Friendly Match)

829
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:56,772
It's alright, it's fine. Go on!

830
00:41:56,852 --> 00:41:57,292
It's alright.

831
00:42:05,812 --> 00:42:07,892
That's great.

832
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:40,892
Well done.

833
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:42,852
It's my turn now.

834
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:43,692
