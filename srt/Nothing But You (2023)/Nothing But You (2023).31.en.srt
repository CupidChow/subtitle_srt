=Nothing But You=

2
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,260
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:55,980
(You Had Been Crushing On Me for This Long?)

4
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,537
(How is he doing?)

5
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:00,617
(How long is his rehabilitation?)

6
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,817
It may take four to five months.

7
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,937
Okay, thanks for the information.

8
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,017
Someone should really fill in his spot.

9
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,897
He'll get it back after he recovers.

10
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:12,737
Okay.

11
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:15,177
(The club's official account
has gained 50,000 followers.)

12
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:16,977
(To be honest, I'm a bit nervous.)

13
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,497
(Many people are just here)

14
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:19,937
(because of Song Sanchuan's name.)

15
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,657
Right now,

16
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:23,137
I can't really post any more updates.

17
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,817
Do you want to consider

18
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,377
letting me document his rehab progress?

19
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:28,417
I won't. Make some other content.

20
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,817
(I don't want him to ruminate about it.)

21
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:31,897
Alright.

22
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,497
Help us cheer Chuan on.

23
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:35,297
(Sure.)

24
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:36,897
(Alright. Get busy then.)

25
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:42,457
Lunch?

26
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,217
Let's go.

27
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,497
Hold on,

28
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,817
I'm texting Jiang Jiaojiao and Chen Zhe.

29
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:48,297
Why?

30
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,257
Jiao said,

31
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:52,257
they want to come with us after
our meeting.

32
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:54,817
Okay, I'll take my bag.

33
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,737
Why are you coming when
we're just having Food Republic?

34
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:06,737
What do you want?

35
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,337
I have no money.

36
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,297
My dad thinks

37
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:12,577
my mom pays my living expenses,

38
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:13,737
my mom thinks

39
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:15,097
my dad should pay for it.

40
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:17,137
When they don't get along,

41
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:18,457
they don't care about me anymore.

42
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,337
Also, it's not the day where

43
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:22,697
you are paying me back yet.

44
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,777
I really have no money to eat.

45
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:27,737
Was it because you

46
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,257
lent me all your money?

47
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,617
It's just for these two weeks.

48
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,337
Can you just help me?

49
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:37,217
You're kidding me, right?

50
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,537
Chen Zhe, your bro over here

51
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:40,217
has no money to eat.

52
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,217
Why don't you treat him?

53
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:43,857
Sure! What do you want?

54
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,097
Go away, I'm not asking you.

55
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:48,377
What a beggar and a chooser.

56
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,497
I'm not kidding you.

57
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:53,857
He doesn't own

58
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:55,297
the money that he has now.

59
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:56,737
I feel guilty spending it.

60
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,777
I want to change too,

61
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:00,017
and I want to prove that I can.

62
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,697
Give me a chance.

63
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:03,297
You're really annoying.

64
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:04,657
Let me tell you,

65
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:05,417
I will note down

66
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,377
every single meal paid.

67
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,297
Okay, I know.

68
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,337
Please give me a tofu.

69
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:22,897
I want tofu too.

70
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,057
I thought you didn't like tofu?

71
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:29,737
I eat that too.

72
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:31,577
It's cheap.

73
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:33,217
I need to be thrifty.

74
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:38,497
Do you want more...

75
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:46,297
Really? Just tofu?

76
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,417
Tell me the truth.

77
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,137
How did the public account get
50,000 fans?

78
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:54,697
Jiao.

79
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:56,057
They are all real followers.

80
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:59,457
What's this new trick up your sleeve?

81
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,257
Spend her money, then she pays you back.

82
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,297
How despicable of you.

83
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:05,817
I really ran out of money.

84
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:08,817
What do you really want from her?

85
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,857
I recently found out

86
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:14,697
that these three people have

87
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:15,777
served as negative examples.

88
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:20,697
Jiang Jie, Chen Zhe, Huang Yike.

89
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,297
My dad always thought that

90
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:25,137
he can show that he cares

91
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:26,497
by buying a bag for my mom.

92
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,777
My mother divorced him in the end.

93
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:32,537
Well you, all you have left is
just money.

94
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:33,817
Go away!

95
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:35,577
Till now, no lady has been willing to

96
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:37,057
leave their hearts with you.

97
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,217
Regarding Yike,

98
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,177
she recently fell in love with

99
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:42,417
someone from the swimming team next door.

100
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,377
She applied to be a member immediately,

101
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:45,897
and spend so much money there every day.

102
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:47,417
Didn't expect that from her.

103
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:49,337
She is not single-minded at all.

104
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,097
I want to thank you three

105
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:52,697
for I understood that

106
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:55,577
you can't buy sincerity with money.

107
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:57,697
Peachy really despises

108
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:59,097
the fact that I've never been poor.

109
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:01,897
I want her to know that

110
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,297
I, Jiang Jiaojiao, can handle

111
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,337
hard times in life.

112
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:09,377
Peachy, wait up.

113
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:10,897
Buy me a cup of coffee.

114
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:12,897
Put it on my tab.

115
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,937
It's over. This is happening.

116
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,857
This guy really fell for her.

117
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:21,817
Thank you.

118
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:23,977
He looks good.

119
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,817
He's very focused on training.

120
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,177
There's no rush to do this.

121
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,297
It's going to take quite a while.

122
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:30,937
Take it easy.

123
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,577
It's right to use the wheelchair everyday,

124
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,137
especially for the first two weeks.

125
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,617
Apart from coming to the rehab center,

126
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:39,257
other times, don't work your leg for now.

127
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:39,977
Okay.

128
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:42,137
After another two weeks of training,

129
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:43,457
you'll know how to work it well,

130
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:46,137
then your movements will come easier.

131
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,137
Thank you for your hard work.

132
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:49,537
We will definitely work closely
with you on this.

133
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:50,497
Don't worry, it's our job.

134
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:51,657
I'll be in your hands.

135
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,520
(Your driver has arrived)
Our ride is here, let's go.

136
00:06:59,177 --> 00:06:59,937
Are you tired?

137
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,777
- Quite.
- Must be.

138
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:03,377
I'll push myself.

139
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,217
It's okay.

140
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:09,417
Hello.

141
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:11,217
Are you the passenger with

142
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,417
the number 7551?

143
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:12,977
Yes.

144
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,377
Our car is equipped with this platform

145
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:15,257
to help you get in the car.

146
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:15,697
Let me help you.

147
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,017
It's okay, I can do it myself.

148
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:18,097
Let me just help you.

149
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:19,057
Be careful.

150
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,457
Why, you can be my emergency contact but

151
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:23,617
I can't take care of your knee for you?

152
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:25,817
You can, you can.

153
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,337
Thank you, sir.

154
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,457
You're welcome.

155
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,337
Careful. Don't burn yourself.

156
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,897
Okay. Stop staring at me.

157
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,857
Check out that jigsaw puzzle. Is it nice?

158
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:51,817
I bought it especially for us.

159
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:55,257
I'm done.

160
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:57,057
How's that?

161
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:00,097
It looks pretty good.

162
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,937
What are you doing?

163
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:19,857
Who puts a puzzle together this way?

164
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:22,497
What's wrong?

165
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,657
You don't know how to play with puzzles?

166
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:29,097
Ah, I've discovered that

167
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,457
the great Liang You'an
has something that she does not know.

168
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,177
Alright. I admit that

169
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,497
it's my first time buying a puzzle.

170
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:42,736
Let me show you.

171
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,736
When playing jigsaw puzzles,

172
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:44,857
you should first look for

173
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:46,497
pieces with right angles.

174
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,057
After pinning down the corners,

175
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:49,177
you complete the four sides.

176
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:51,137
Packs of puzzle pieces like these,

177
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,217
they belong to a certain area.

178
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,977
You look at the sample,

179
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,337
find the color corresponding
to the different areas,

180
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:56,417
then you put the puzzle together,

181
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:57,577
one area at a time.

182
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,177
Lastly, you'll come back and deal with

183
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,257
the leftover materials.

184
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:05,617
That sounds like a really sensible plan.

185
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:07,977
Yeah, I studied tutorials for that.

186
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,097
Is this really your first time?

187
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:11,657
Yes.

188
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:14,097
Where would I find the time
to do this last time?

189
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:16,537
I bought this because

190
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:17,977
I'm finally out for once.

191
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,337
We can really catch a break

192
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:20,737
and have a life.

193
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,097
That's true when you think about it.

194
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,377
You're usually working,

195
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:28,777
and I'm usually training.

196
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,097
Both of us really don't

197
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:32,657
"have a life".

198
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:35,857
Why don't

199
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,817
we take this opportunity

200
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:40,017
to do more things

201
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:42,577
that we've never done before?

202
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:44,937
Let's just

203
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:46,457
randomly pick a piece

204
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,897
out of this puzzle pile,

205
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:49,897
then,

206
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,897
when the puzzle is completed,

207
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,257
we can both put our puzzle piece of choice

208
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:55,417
back into the puzzle?

209
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,737
That feels quite ceremonial.

210
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:02,737
Pick one then.

211
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:03,417
Pick whichever you want.

I didn't think it through that day.

I think you must like it very much.

275
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:19,377
I don't like it actually.

276
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,177
I just used it to work on a funny video.

Let's add a few more sets today.

00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,697
You're in quite the state today.

301
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:09,977
Yes.

Today,

305
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,577
we'll first start with hip stability.

306
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:18,097
Alright.

307
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:21,097
Try doing some supine flexion
and extension exercises.

308
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:22,097
Alright, go.

309
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,497
Support it with your humerus.

310
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:26,737
When you're doing this movement,

311
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:30,457
actually your iliopsoas works independently.

312
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:31,657
Let's do it slowly.

313
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:32,657
Ten more reps.

314
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:33,817
Alright, go slow.

315
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:35,617
Good.

316
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:37,537
We can now accurately assess

318
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,137
and your rectus femoris.

319
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:43,897
You must keep your body balanced.

320
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,377
Come, let's go.

321
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:47,457
You'll have to work it here.

322
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:48,857
Wait.

323
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,097

324
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:52,937
Okay.

325
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:55,697
Yeah.

326
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,017
I think I'm a gone case.

327
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:01,017

328
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,537
so happy just accompanying

329
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:03,777

330
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:07,457
I never thought that

331
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,497
I could be this lovestruck.

332
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,217
Am I?

333
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:11,497
What should I do then?

334
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,537
That's why people say you fall in love.

335
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:15,297
I am falling.

336
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,217
Why are you calling me?

337
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,697
Our public account these days,

338
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:19,737
have you looked at it?

339
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:22,337
There's something regarding Liang Tao.

340
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:23,617
Liang Tao?

341
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,020
(She is not a rich
second generation at all)

342
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,220
(She's the daughter of a mistress.)

343
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,420
(An illegitimate daughter of
an extramarital affair.)

344
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:39,417
You...

345
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:40,057
I asked Coach Luo

346
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:41,137
for your home address.

347
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,537
What's up?

348
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:47,537
Give me your mobile.

349
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,337
I'm not born out of wedlock.

350
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:14,977
I'm not an illegitimate daughter.

351
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:17,057
Yes.

352
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,857
I faked an identity,

353
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:20,097
and faked a relationship online.

354
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,577
I can apologize and admit my mistakes.

355
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,337
When I was in primary school,

356
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:26,857
I couldn't explain it all very well.

357
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:28,457
That's why I've been changing schools.

358
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,217
Now that this came up,

359
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,737
I don't think I can stay at the club.

360
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,097
You don't need to worry about the club.

361
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,377
No one will ever believe those stuff.

362
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,777
Come back tomorrow.

363
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:54,257
Everyone misses you.

364
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:05,857

365
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,577
sync over the account's password

366
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:09,137

367
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:11,417
I'll monitor and delete those comments.

368
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:12,937
And you,

369
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,897
don't read what's written online.

370
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:16,857

371
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:18,777

372
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,137
Don't you slack off.

373
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:34,937
Have some wafer rolls,

374
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,537

00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:38,137

00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:46,137

00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:51,217
Take a bite, you'll feel right.

378
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,977
It's not a big deal,

379
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,057
it's really not.

380
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,937
Where did you learn these rhymes?

381
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:01,777
I learned it from Peach Academy.

382
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:18,457
It's going to be alright.

383
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,577
You'll never need to leave.

384
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:22,977
Never again in the future.

385
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,177
For you've caught the eye of

386
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:27,937
the campus heartthrob.

387
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,577
Which school are you from anyway?

388
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:32,857
Didn't I just tell you?

389
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,257
I'm from Peach Academy.

390
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,057
Alright.

391
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:39,497
This is for you, campus heartthrob.

392
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:41,897
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:10,817
Hello.

394
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,697
(Hello. Where are you?)

395
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:14,577
I'm at home.

396
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:16,417
(Let Luo Nian take over)

397
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:17,497
(the public account for now.)

398
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:19,257
Don't fire me.

399
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,777
What would I fire you?

400
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:23,617
Just stop posting for two days.

401
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:27,377
(Turn off the comments and shares for now.)

402
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,577
Let's observe how it goes for a week,

403
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:32,537
and then we'll make further plans.

404
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,417
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,817
I brought the club down.

406
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,177
What?

407
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:45,697
After all,

408
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,217
it's just a public account of a tennis club.

409
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:49,417
Who looks at it anyway?

410
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:50,897
What impact could that have on us?

411
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,737
This won't even last longer than

412
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:53,977
neighborhood gossip.

413
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:56,417
(Stop thinking about it.)

414
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:57,377
(Don't look at it.)

415
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:59,017
(Just pass it to Luo Nian.)

416
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,577
Jiang Jiaojiao came to see me today.

417
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:02,737
He said he'll look after the account.

418
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:03,537
That works too.

419
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:05,897
Don't stop working though.

420
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:07,497
Don't try to slack off.

421
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:09,177
You still need to produce content.

422
00:22:09,257 --> 00:22:09,777
I know.

423
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:10,857
I know.

424
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:18,937
Is there anything that I can do for you?

425
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:21,977
Not really.

426
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:25,697
Thank you, You'an.

427
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:29,897
No. Thank you, Ms. Liang.

428
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:33,177
I'm hanging up.

429
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:55,737
Just listen to me. Put your legs on my lap
and straighten them.

430
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:57,217
You'll feel more comfortable.

431
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:58,137
No, no.

432
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,297
I'll hurt you.

433
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,097
Just listen to me and relax.

434
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:02,577
Don't hurt yourself.

435
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:03,297
I'm not.

436
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:04,337
It's good now. It doesn't hurt anymore.

437
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:05,537
It hurts inside but not the outside.

438
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:08,657
Why is it so painful this time?

439
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,297
I've never seen you
be in such pain before.

440
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,257
Before this,

441
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,217
on a lucky day,

442
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,577
I'll get to lie in bed for a day.

443
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:18,937
If I am catching up with work,

444
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:20,057
I'll take painkillers.

445
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:21,257
But I forgot to bring

446
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:22,617
my usual go-to pills.

447
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:24,737
It's okay. It usually hurts only on the first day.

448
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,657
I'll be fine tomorrow.

449
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:27,937
What if I rub your stomach for you?

450
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:28,457
Is that better?

451
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:34,977
It still hurts.

452
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,017
Stop, stop.

453
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:38,937
Maybe try going on your phone.

454
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:40,137
Speaking of that,

455
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:41,457
is Liang Tao's matter resolved?

456
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:46,017
Jiang Jiaojiao went to comfort her.

457
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:49,017
I feel that Liang Tao has a crush on him.

458
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:51,417
Did you feel that too?

459
00:23:58,177 --> 00:23:59,137
Give me your hand.

460
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:02,377
The internet said
massaging this point helps.

461
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:03,657
I wonder if it works.

462
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:05,937
Do you feel better?

463
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:07,217
Much better.

464
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:11,577
Can I ask you,

465
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,377
has your

466
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:18,097
heart skipped a beat for me?

467
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:20,017
The first time,

468
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:21,617
when was it?

469
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:28,377
What kind of a crush
are we talking about?

470
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:28,937
Well,

471
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:31,537
before you fell for me,

472
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,497
the kind where you felt

473
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,857
there was a spark.

474
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:37,257
I don't want to tell you.

475
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:38,977
That won't work.

476
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,217
I picked a time when you're

477
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:42,897
half-conscious, yet you're not telling me still?

478
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,857
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

479
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:45,937
Okay, I'll tell you.

480
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:47,017
That one time

481
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:50,657
when we were swinging and playing seesaw.

482
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:53,137
You were so close to me,

483
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:55,097
my heart was just throbbing.

484
00:24:57,377 --> 00:24:57,817
Wait.

485
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,377
Why are you so good at this?

486
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:02,177
Do you push girls

487
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:03,057
on the swing often?

488
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:04,977
What girl? Why would I...

489
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,617
No, I...

490
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:07,457
No.

491
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:08,777
No matter male or female,

492
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:09,297
I've only...

493
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:10,297
I've only

494
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:11,737
swung you on a swing before.

495
00:25:13,297 --> 00:25:14,257
What about me?

496
00:25:14,857 --> 00:25:16,937
When was the first time

497
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:17,897
you had a crush on me?

498
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:22,897
That would be...

499
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,257
Do you remember

500
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,217
there was once you asked me to stay

501
00:25:27,497 --> 00:25:29,057
then you gave me a fitness test.

502
00:25:29,257 --> 00:25:30,337
So early on.

503
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:32,177
No, guess it was even earlier.

504
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,137
Do you remember the first time

505
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:36,377
when I went to find you at your office?

506
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:37,337
At Young Space.

507
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:38,297
Then,

508
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,337
I shouted "Liang You'an",

509
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:41,777
then you turned around.

510
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:43,737
You had a crush on me since that day?

511
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:45,577
I still don't think it's that.

512
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:50,697
The first time when we met, during the marathon.

513
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:51,617
You were in the tent,

514
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:53,857
and then you pasted that timecode

515
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:55,297
on my back.

516
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:57,257
Your cold, soft hands.

517
00:25:57,897 --> 00:25:59,777
It was love at first sight?

518
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:00,937
No, but anyway, every time

519
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:02,057
I was just so nervous when I saw you,

520
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:02,817
you know?

521
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:05,777
Are there any more?

522
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:07,537
There is.

523
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:13,377
It's that one time,

524
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:18,577
when I really fell in love with you.

525
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:20,697
That was when

526
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:24,297
you covered up the 18-18 scoreboard for me.

527
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:27,977
Since then,

528
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,017
anyway,

529
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:32,737
I knew definitely that
I want to pursue you.

530
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:35,297
That's what it is, you know.

531
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:37,217
Anything else?

532
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:38,697
Do you remember

533
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:39,657
when you came to my house

534
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:40,657
and asked me to eat wontons?

535
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,977
You said the wontons

536
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:42,657
will become lumpy soon.

537
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:43,737
I was on the first floor.

538
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:44,897
I opened the window and saw you.

539
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:48,417
Are you not in pain anymore?

540
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:50,377
I'm much better now.

541
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:53,057
Chatting works better than painkillers.

542
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:56,377
Chatting with me works better than painkillers.

543
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:18,577
Liang You'an.

544
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:25,297
Liang You'an.

545
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,097
Liang You'an.

546
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,980
(I'm out to buy breakfast.)

547
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,297
Where did you go?

548
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,537
I went to buy shampoo.

549
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:37,057
Wouldn't it be nice if you waited for me?

550
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:37,737
It's just downstairs.

551
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:38,497
I can do it on my own.

552
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,377
You're having a meeting soon, right?

553
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:43,297
Come over here for your breakfast.

554
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:45,537
I'll take a shower first.

555
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,337
Be careful.

556
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,320
(Nian)
The physiotherapist

557
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:35,137
has sent me the plans for his next stage recovery.

558
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,337
I forwarded it to your mailbox.

559
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,177
Take a look.

560
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:38,897
(He told us that before we leave,)

561
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:40,017
(if anything needed adjustments,)

562
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:41,017
(we can tell him anytime.)

563
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,217
Okay. After I've received it,

564
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:43,617
I'll print it out and

565
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:45,057
talk it over with Coach Yan.

566
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,097
Alright.

567
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:47,457
(How is he?)

568
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:49,657
He's well. The therapist said

569
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:51,537
he is recovering faster than expected.

570
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:52,617
That's good.

571
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:54,537
(We are also looking for ways to)

572
00:29:54,537 --> 00:29:56,217
(combine tennis playing techniques)

573
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,897
(with the physiotherapist's plan.)

574
00:29:59,337 --> 00:30:00,217
What's wrong?

575
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,137
I'm fine.

576
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:05,817
The shampoo fell on the floor.

577
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,097
(Just hang up.)

578
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:07,937
(Don't mind us.)

579
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,297
(Take care of the disabled.)

580
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:10,017
Yes, yes.

581
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,017
I'll talk to you later.

582
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,697
Song Sanchuan,
what are you doing in there?

583
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:16,217
I'm...

584
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:18,217
What else can I  be doing?
I'm taking a shower.

585
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,537
Right?

586
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:21,297
Then, are you okay?

587
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:24,377
If I'm not,

588
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:25,817
are you coming in to check on me?

589
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:28,777
That... Never mind.

590
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,257
You seemed all right.

591
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,960
(Top Smash)

592
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,457
Sanchuan has about another two weeks

593
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,657
before he comes back, right?

594
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:46,137
What do you think about it?

595
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:48,017
What do you think about

596
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:48,817
the physiotherapist's plan?

597
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:53,257
I think that the training direction seems fine.

598
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:54,977
But regarding the time,

599
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:55,857
one month?

600
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:57,337
Doesn't it seem too optimistic?

601
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:00,737
I think this specialized training

602
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:03,057
plus athletic recovery training

603
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:04,537
might need about two months.

604
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:05,777
I agree.

605
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:08,257
That means both of us have some sort of pre-judgment

606
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,217
to help him make adjustments.

607
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,057
How about this?

608
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:16,257
I will follow his framework,

609
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:17,777
and the time taken will be two months.

610
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:21,777
I'll break it down a bit more
and show you another plan.

611
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:22,337
Alright.

612
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:23,537
Good.

613
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,457
This...

614
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:36,137
What are you looking at?

615
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:41,857
At the plan.

616
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:44,737
Is there a plan on the back of my head?

617
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:46,097
No. It's just...

618
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:47,777
there are two white hairs.

619
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:50,577
Impossible.

620
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:54,217
What?

621
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:56,577
You have old eyes I think.

622
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,017
One of us has old eyes,

623
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:01,737
the other has white hair.

624
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:03,817
Quite a match, like a set meal.

625
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:05,657
Think again.

626
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:07,657
Let me tell you. In this club,

627
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:09,617
you are the oldest person here,

628
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:11,137
and the only one too.

629
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,297
Don't you even dare think

630
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,177
I am in your age category.

631
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,737
Who wants to be part of the set anyway?

632
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:17,457
I'm leaving.

633
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:18,657
I'm going home to draft out plans.

634
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:20,777
Bye.

635
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:25,297
Did you drive?

636
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:27,297
It's quite congested now.

637
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:28,617
Must be tiring to drive.

638
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:29,457
Let me drive.

639
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:30,257
I'll send you home.

640
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:33,457
I did drive here,

641
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,137
but did you drink?

642
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:56,817
When did she find out?

643
00:32:58,657 --> 00:32:59,417
I hid it so well.

644
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,900
(Good morning, Ms. Liang)

645
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,980

It took me a long time to learn that.

652
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:55,697
You know how to make balloon flowers!

653
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:56,857
There's just one?

654
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:58,817
It took a lot of time too.

655
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:00,097
I'm terrified of balloons bursting.

656
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:01,217
It scared me good.

657
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:02,697
You're that scared?

658
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,217

Please don't.

664
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:15,097
Really, take it easy.

665

Wait, I gave you flowers.

666
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:16,737
Why are you like this?

667
00:34:16,816 --> 00:34:17,697
Listen to me. Give it to me.

No.

Don't.

670
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:21,416
Don't do that.

671
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,257
The moral of the story is

672
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:26,457
don't expose your weaknesses easily.

673
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,416
The bad guys will take advantage of you.

674
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:29,937
You know that now?

00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:30,537
Do you know now?

676
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:31,376
I want hugs from bad guys.

You'll burst it.

This is the nicest flower

682
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:40,977
that I have ever received.

683
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:46,416
Done.

684
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,137
We can hug now.

685
00:34:49,977 --> 00:34:51,777

This time around,

you've been recovering pretty well.

702
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:05,337
Thanks to your solid foundation.

703
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:06,657
Starting now,

704
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:08,177
you won't need a wheelchair.

705
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:08,697
Good.

706
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,657
Before I leave this place,

707
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,257
would it be possible for me
to remove this?

708
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:13,857
It depends.

709
00:36:13,897 --> 00:36:15,017
We'll work together on that.

710
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:17,617
I want to start training earlier.

711
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:19,337
There's no rush.

712
00:36:19,497 --> 00:36:20,657
Before our rehab ends,

713
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:22,617
don't exert too much force with this leg.

714
00:36:22,857 --> 00:36:23,777
You still have to use your crutch.

715
00:36:24,857 --> 00:36:25,737
Did you hear that?

716
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,217
Don't worry.

717
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:33,337
Before your rehabilitation
is over completely,

718
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:34,697
being too impatient

719
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:37,577
will only bring harm to your

720
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:38,817
sports career in the future.

721
00:36:46,617 --> 00:36:48,377
You're really good,

722
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,417
you hid so many balloons.

723
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:55,017
Did you change your shampoo?

724
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:56,257
You smell good.

725
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:57,497
I didn't.

726
00:36:57,697 --> 00:36:59,337
I've always used this brand of shampoo.

727
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:05,297
Now I recall.

728
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:16,697
Don't worry.

729
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:20,297
Give it some time.

730
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:26,937
I've been very cooperative.

731
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:29,217
I'm sure to recover.

732
00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:33,697
You will.

733
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:38,417

736
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,777

737
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,097

738
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:51,417
How nice.

739
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:02,337
What's up?

740
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,217
Let's play a game, shall we?

741
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:29,617
Let's play charades.

742
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,537
Guess what am I?

743
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:39,497
Toad.

744
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:41,377
Guess again.

745
00:38:42,617 --> 00:38:43,297
Spider.

746
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:45,097
Ant.

747
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:46,657
It's an ant.

748
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,097
Guess what this is?

749
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:50,497
Elephant.

750
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:52,137
You are so smart.

751
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:57,577
Bunny girl.

752
00:38:58,937 --> 00:38:59,697
No.

753
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,537
Pole dancing.

754
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:01,897
Wait, that...

755
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:06,497
That is the monkey king!

756
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,497
You are right!

757
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:37,097
This is the itemized bill.

758
00:39:37,257 --> 00:39:39,057
It includes all the payment

759
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:41,577
for classes, for the physiotherapist,

760
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:42,377
the consultation plan,

761
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:43,457
and some consumables.

762
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:44,857
In the future,

763
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:46,177
before you return to the pitch,

764
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,737
our physiotherapist will go to your club

765
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:49,697
and do a professional

766
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:50,737
technical assessment for you.

767
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:52,257
The traveling expenses

768
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:53,577
is also included in this bill

769
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:54,897
This means that, after we're done

770
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:56,577
with stage four rehabilitation training,

771
00:39:56,617 --> 00:39:57,817
we should contact you, right?

772
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:58,417
Yes.

773
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:00,177
Make an appointment with me
a week in advance,

774
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:02,177
and I'll make time for that go to you.

775
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,497
Can I have a look at that?

776
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:05,657
You can bring this bill

777
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,697
back with you.

778
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:09,617
So who will come with me to pay the bill?

779
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:10,217
That would be me.

780
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:25,657
Mr. Pang,

781
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:28,417
will the insurance company
cover such a high amount

782
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:30,377
of rehabilitation fee?

783
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:32,577
That would be impossible.

784
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:34,257
As far as I know,

785
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:37,417
most insurance companies only cover 30% of it.

786
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:44,977
Thanks.

787
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,857
Why are our things more than

788
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:03,377
when we came?

789
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:07,577
Can you check if

790
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:09,657
we left anything in the bathroom?

791
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:17,497
(If we don't bring this
bottle of shampoo,)

792
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:18,897
(it won't be that wasteful, right?)

793
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,820
(High-end imported shampoo - RMB289.00)

794
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:33,857
(This shampoo is so expensive!)

795
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:46,697
Alright.

796
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:49,377
Anything else?

797
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:50,177
That's all.

798
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:53,897
Okay.

799
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:56,017
This is the last of our unfinished business.

800
00:41:59,297 --> 00:41:59,857
Okay.

801
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,817
Let us bring out the last two pieces.

802
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,057
Mine's over here.

803
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,017
It's a dog.

804
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:18,297
What's yours?

805
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:19,817
Mine's a pair of slippers.

806
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:29,737
I really like this puzzle.

807
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,857
Every scene is so healing to me.

808
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:32,937
Yes, it is.

809
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,657
I feel that every scene in this puzzle

810
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:37,377
would be us in the future.

811
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:44,457
We are heading home now.

812
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:47,057
We'll go back to where we once were.

813
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:51,897
Are you ready to go and face the court?

814
00:42:55,977 --> 00:42:57,657
I feel reluctant to leave this place and go,

815
00:42:58,497 --> 00:43:00,017
but I really to get back to playing tennis.
