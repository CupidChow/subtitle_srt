00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,950
(Heart Rate: 108)

4
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,397
It's not locked. Come in.

5
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,237
Were you triggered because

6
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:20,117
you couldn't find a job?

7
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:21,357
Come.

8
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:22,877
Clean the house for me.

9
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:23,917
But why?

10
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:24,717
Did you call me here

11
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:25,677
to be your janitor?

12
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:26,877
If you clean it up,

13
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:27,717
you can have the things

14
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:28,597
on the table.

15
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:33,477
Concentrate on your task.

16
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:34,437
Forget about the rest.

17
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:35,117
Just leave it to me.

18
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,860
(Liang You'an)

19
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,037
Hello, Dad?

20
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:12,077
I'm at Liang You'an's house right now.

21
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,197
I think she's possessed.

22
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:15,757
She's acting abnormally.

23
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:16,477
Liang Tao,

24
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:18,757
pass the phone to me.

25
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:23,797
Don't be afraid.

26
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:25,157
Come here.

27
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:32,357
Sit down.

28
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,757
Hello, Liang Shu?

29
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,557
Let me confirm something with you.

30
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,557
You borrowed me 300,000 yuan

31
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,277
when I was preparing

32
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:42,837
to study overseas.

33
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:43,837
I included

34
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:44,957
a 6% interest into the sum.

35
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,117
And, I've been giving you

36
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:46,957
and Liang Tao money

37
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,117
for the past few years.

38
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:49,477
Here.

39
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,157
Check it for your father.

40
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,517
I still owe you 30,000 yuan.

41
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,060
(Ledger)

42
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,860
(Transfer amount, 30,000 yuan)

43
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,180
(Liang You'an [Transfer]
Please accept payment)

44
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,117
She just received the sum.

45
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:12,797
Now,

46
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:14,877
you and I are even.

47
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,077
I got her a job

48
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,157
before I left my company.

49
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:21,517
From now on,

50
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,316
no matter if you get sick or die,

51
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,357
it has nothing to do with Mom and me.

52
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:27,996
I hope

53
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:29,997
you can remember that.

54
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:35,957
What job did you find for me?

55
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,517
Your father begged me

56
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,997
to get you a job in Young Space
before this.

57
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:42,557
I didn't agree to it back then.

58
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:43,797
Now that I'm leaving,

59
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:44,757
I guess I can do you one last favor.

60
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:47,877
It's a position as Young Space's
administrative specialist.

61
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,317
It depends on yourself

62
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,397
if you can pass the probation or not.

63
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,077
Administrative specialist?

64
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,117
Do you mean an admin?

65
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:56,597
The company is so terrible
that you're leaving.

66
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:57,597
You want me to work there?

67
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,397
No thanks.

68
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:00,117
All these years,

69
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:01,037
I've heard about

70
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,397
all your stupid stories.

71
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,237
It was something like: "If Liang Shu"

72
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:05,877
"didn't borrow Liang You'an
300,000 yuan"

73
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:07,517
"for her"

74
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:08,477
"to study overseas",

75
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:10,397
"maybe my family"

76
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,517
"would've struck it rich"

77
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:14,317
"and I would've been a rich lady".

78
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:14,957
That's right.

79
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,237
Humans

80
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:18,437
always blame other people.

81
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:19,837
It's much easier than acknowledging

82
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:20,837
the fact that you didn't work hard.

83
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:22,477
Even so,

84
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:23,837
at least I would've gotten a chance

85
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:24,957
to study overseas if it weren't for you.

86
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:26,077
Do you think

87
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,757
the world is unfair to you?

88
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,437
Let's forget about
the previous generation.

89
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:30,597
What's the difference between us?

90
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:32,397
I'm his daughter too.

91
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,317
Fine.

92
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:39,717
Go to Young Space then.

93
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:41,997
Your current position is higher

94
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:43,397
than mine when I first joined

95
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:44,357
the company.

96
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,597
You have plenty of space to be promoted.

97
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:48,157
You love to compare yourself

98
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:48,877
with me, right?

99
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:49,677
Work hard then.

100
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:52,117
When you're doing better than me

101
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,357
at my age,

102
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,437
that means you've proven yourself.

103
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:01,117
If that's the case,

104
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,277
I can go there.

105
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,557
If I can do better than you

106
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:06,597
in a company you hate,

107
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:07,717
that means I'm better than you.

108
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,317
If so, I'll judge your corn
with my bushel then.

109
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:11,757
Liang Tao,

110
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:13,957
be successful.

111
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:15,557
After all,

112
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:17,117
you're Liang Shu's only daughter now.

113
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:41,397
Hello?

114
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:43,477
I'm not selling my house!

115
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:45,477
Liang Tao, time to have breakfast.

116
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:48,037
Tidy your bed if you're not sleeping!

117
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,117
Coming.

118
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,197
You'll report for duty tomorrow, right?

119
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,597
I heard that Liang You'an

120
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:06,997
got you that job.

121
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:08,917
Keep an eye out.

122
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:10,037
Don't let her trick you.

123
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,037
She's not that free.

124
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:15,677
She wouldn't need to
go that far just to trick me.

125
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:16,877
I'm worthless anyway.

126
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:17,717
Who said so?

127
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,237
Your beauty represents your value.

128
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,197
If so, you were valuable

129
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,157
when you were young too.

130
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,397
Why did you fall for Dad then?

131
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:25,557
That's why I'm on the lookout

132
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:26,637
for you.

133
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:28,357
There are plenty of useless men

134
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:28,997
who look otherwise.

135
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,557
Didn't you read the article online?

136
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,477
Defaming one's father

137
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,237
in front of her

138
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:39,677
is the source of one's inferiority.

139
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:41,997
We'll have our own separate meals.

140
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:43,277
The rule is the same.

141
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,277
An has already

142
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:47,277
returned the money to us.

143
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:48,837
You lent her

144
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:49,677
300,000 yuan in one go.

145
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:51,237
Liang Shu, it was
300,000 yuan, you know?

146
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,317
You could've achieved
so much with that money.

147
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,237
But she returned the money to you
in installments.

148
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,677
You two had spent all of it.

149
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:56,917
What gives you the right
to have my cooking?

150
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:57,757
What gives?

151
00:07:58,837 --> 00:07:59,477
You're overbearing.

152
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,077
You're unreasonable.

153
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:04,477
I don't need to reason
with a person like you.

154
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:10,757
I'm done eating. I need to head out.

155
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,637
You guys can argue all you want.

156
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,437
Tao, you're heading out?

157
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:21,757
Don't look.

158
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,277
There's no food for you here.

159
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,140
(OVV)

160
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:53,877
I want to try all three of them.

161
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:54,477
Okay.

162
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:02,677
You do look pretty good in them.

163
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:04,597
(Liang You'an)
I won't lose to you.

164
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,700
(Ancong Wig Shop)

165
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:14,957
- I'm leaving.
- Great timing.

166
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,077
You're going to the wonton stall again?

167
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:18,877
Do you know how many days
you went there in a row?

168
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:21,797
You wait there for her all the time.

169
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:22,317
Why don't you

170
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:23,397
contact her directly?

171
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,077
You're back again.

172
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:39,957
What's the matter?

173
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:41,797
You're not going now?

174
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:44,917
I was just saying.

175
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,597
If you like her, you need
to take the initiative.

176
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:47,277
Just finish your food.

177
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:52,117
Fine, I'll stop talking.

178
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:55,397
Anyway, you'll encounter her again
if fate allows it.

179
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,637
(Wang's Wonton)
We should've come here long ago.

180
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:02,477
This place is great.

181
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:03,877
Your food is here!

182
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:08,997
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

183
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:10,717
Yoyo,

184
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,237
the supplier list you need

185
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,477
is in the red folder

186
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:14,517
in the second cabinet.

187
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:15,757
The PowerPoint slides for

188
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,117
the seasonal meeting report
is on the PC desktop.

189
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,677
There's an online version of it
inside the meeting file.

190
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:22,677
Thank you.

191
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:26,957
Tell me then.

192
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,637
What was on your mind back then?

193
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,637
I actually

194
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:34,677
decided to resign

195
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:36,077
long ago.

196
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:38,477
Initially, I was thinking

197
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:41,037
that if Song Sanchuan won the match,

198
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:42,517
I could recommend him

199
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:43,277
to Jiang Jie.

200
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,277
It's better to choose

201
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:46,317
a suitable spokesperson

202
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:47,157
than to choose

203
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:48,717
the problematic Jin Yi.

204
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,277
And, I could finish the project too.

205
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,677
I could use the opportunity to resign.

206
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:57,877
The result was pretty much the same.

207
00:10:58,637 --> 00:10:59,557
But, it ended on a sour note.

208
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:01,797
I'm sure your boss
hates you to the core.

209
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,077
Actually,

210
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,437
I suddenly figured it out

211
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,677
when I was standing
in front of the meeting room.

212
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:07,037
My value

213
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:08,517
lies in my work.

214
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:10,517
I live for my projects,

215
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,077
and I die for them.

216
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:14,637
Mingyu said Mr. Gao

217
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:16,597
didn't pursue responsibility

218
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,317
as I took on the blame

219
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,077
and resigned

220
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,117
from the company.

221
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:22,277
Publicly,

222
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:23,917
I've finished my last project.

223
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:24,997
Privately...

224
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:30,117
Bosses don't interact much

225
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:31,837
with their personal assistants
in private.

226
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:36,117
Anyway, I'm free.

227
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:36,637
Isn't it great?

228
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:43,997
Look at you.

229
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:46,157
You've rested for a month.

230
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,877
What's your plan for the future?

231
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:51,317
I'm not in a hurry.

232
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:52,957
Now that I've lost this job,

233
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:53,997
it means that every job

234
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:54,717
in the world

235
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:55,757
might become

236
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:56,597
my next job.

237
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,357
From studying,

238
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:01,677
going overseas, graduating,
to working in Young Space,

239
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:03,917
I had never done anything

240
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:05,157
according to my own will.

241
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,117
It was a seamless transition.

242
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:07,997
And now, I finally have a chance
to escape from that cycle.

243
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,797
I feel as light as a feather.

244
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:11,477
I will take my time

245
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:12,517
and choose my next job.

246
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,197
Am I hungry?

247
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:18,677
Or their wontons

248
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:20,037
are just that good?

249
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,557
They were good in the first place.

250
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:31,197
Thank you.

251
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,877
Why are you suddenly being so polite?

252
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:34,597
Most of one's memories

253
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:35,877
of another person

254
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,317
are warm.

255
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,837
Actually, I'm not used to it too.

256
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,357
I've heard about
the incident with Jin Yi.

257
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:56,997
Young Space

258
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:57,717
wasn't implicated, right?

259
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:02,357
I'm monitoring

260
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:03,317
public opinion now.

261
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:04,717
It's not a major issue.

262
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:06,877
Mr. Jiang said everything
I wanted to say.

263
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,397
Seems like the underdog project

264
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:10,797
isn't that meaningful after all.

265
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:11,717
There's nothing wrong

266
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:12,797
with the project itself.

267
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,397
I will be more cautious
with the candidate selection

268
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:16,397
in the future.

269
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,357
There's one thing

270
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,037
I don't understand at all.

271
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:24,117
You see, out of all
the professional sports,

272
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,517
why didn't you include

273
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:26,317
tennis?

274
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,357
Tennis is very popular nowadays.

275
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:30,197
And, Jiao, your son,

276
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,717
he's a tennis player, right?

277
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,877
I chose jogging, basketball,

278
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:34,797
and badminton

279
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:36,317
based on the big data I got

280
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:37,877
from the market analysis.

281
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:40,477
This has nothing to do with it.

282
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:41,197
What a shame.

283
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:42,757
If your son

284
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,597
was a tiny bit better,

285
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,997
even just by a tiny bit,

286
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,037
you could've signed him for us.

287
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:48,917
After all, you established

288
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,157
Young Space Tennis Club

289
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:51,717
for him, right?

290
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:54,877
Mr. Gao, it seems like
you're getting a little senile.

291
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,157
You got the order wrong.

292
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:58,637
Young Space

293
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,317
built the tennis courts first.

294
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:01,357
With that,

295
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,517
we established a tennis club.

296
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,437
It's just a coincidence

297
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:06,597
that Jiao is playing at the tennis club.

298
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:08,717
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:10,357
You're using public facilities
for private purposes.

300
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,597
Wait, that's not the phrase.

301
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,437
Sorry, I didn't study much.

302
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,077
I'm uncultured.

303
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,197
What I wanted to say

304
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,517
was you separated private affairs
from public affairs.

305
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:21,117
Enough. Stop talking.

306
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:22,437
Come and have some tea.

307
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:24,237
No thanks.

308
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,557
I have a tennis session to attend.
I can't afford to be late.

309
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:28,277
See you.

310
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:29,757
You guys can enjoy your chat.

311
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,637
Him and his foul personality.

312
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,957
Here, let's drink.

313
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,540
(The 5th Shenzhen City
"Champion Cup" Tennis Tournament)

314
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:25,317
Hello?

315
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:27,437
How is Jiao doing

316
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:28,117
in his match?

317
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,157
(I'm at the venue.)

318
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:30,677
Jiao just won his match.

319
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,037
Was it a proper competition?

320
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:34,597
Yes.

321
00:15:34,637 --> 00:15:36,237
It's the kind with title sponsorship.

322
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:37,957
(Why don't we)

323
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,157
(have a meal tonight)

324
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,237
to celebrate his victory?

325
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:42,917
It's just a community cup.

326
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,037
It's not like he's that good.

327
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:46,717
(I don't know)

328
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:47,837
(when my meeting will end.)

329
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:48,877
(And, the traffic is terrible at night.)

330
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:49,997
(What about this?)

331
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:51,317
You can send me a video of his match.

332
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:52,037
I'll check it out.

333
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,797
The meeting will start soon.
I need to go.

335
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:12,677
Mom.

336
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:14,557
Let's go.

337
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:17,477
You're sweating so much.

338
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:18,557
How did I do today?

339
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,517
Let me introduce her to you guys.

340
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,037
This is our new colleague,

341
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:26,637
Liang Tao.

342
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:27,717
She'll be joining us as

343
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:28,517
an administrative specialist.

344
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:29,437
Hello, everyone.

345
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:30,277
I'm Liang Tao.

346
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:31,837
You guys can call me Tao.

347
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,837
Please help me out

348
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,517
if I encounter any issues in the future.

349
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:38,517
This is your desk.

350
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,717
Put your things here.

351
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:40,797
I'll bring you around.

352
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:43,157
(Marketing Department)
This is the marketing department.

353
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:45,597
I was very close with You'an

354
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,277
in the past.

355
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,317
Not only was she capable,

356
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:50,237
but she was nice too.

357
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,437
That's why we thought it was a shame

358
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:53,877
for her to leave the company.

359
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:56,157
A great colleague had left the company.

360
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:01,877
Both of you have the surname Liang.

361
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:04,317
Are you guys related by any means?

362
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,757
What did she tell you about me?

363
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:09,957
She said nothing in particular.

364
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:10,997
She said

365
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:12,677
you were a good friend of hers.

366
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:13,757
And, she wanted me to recommend you.

367
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:14,837
That's right.

368
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,636
That's why you don't
need to tell the others

369
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:17,717
that we know each other.

370
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:18,957
I will surely work hard

371
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:19,717
and fulfill my tasks.

372
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:21,957
Okay.

373
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:23,277
Over here.

(Recruiting one dog walker)

375
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,237
I just put it on.

376
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:27,197
Why did you tear it down?

377
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:29,597
Hire me. I can do it.

378
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:30,797
Miss, stop messing around.

379
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,237
I'm being serious here.

380
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,356
Look at all the dogs

381
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:34,037
I need to take care of.

382
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:34,877
I need to take them out for a stroll

383
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:35,797
every morning and evening.

384
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,037
It's very tiring.

385
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,717
Although I don't have much stamina,

386
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,157
I have plenty of patience.

387
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,717
If other people can bring three dogs out
for a stroll at one time,

388
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:42,797
I can bring a dog out
for a stroll three times.

389
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,037
Where else can you find

390
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:44,757
a familiar person

391
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:45,557
with true passion

392
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,397
for dogs?

393
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,477
How can you explain yourself
to the dog owners

394
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:48,837
if you miss out on someone like me?

395
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,957
Are you serious? Are you sure
you're not joking?

396
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:53,757
I'm serious.

397
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,157
I've been jobless for over a month.

398
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:55,877
I haven't

399
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:56,797
found a new job yet.

400
00:17:57,037 --> 00:17:57,957
I just think

401
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,277
that being a dog walker is great.

402
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:01,317
Just let me try it out.

403
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:02,757
I won't ask you to pay me
if you think I can't do it.

404
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:03,557
It's not like you'll lose anything.

405
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:06,997
This is Yuki.

406
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:09,557
This is Nemo.

407
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:10,997
Yuki,

408
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:11,797
I'll bring you outside.

409
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:12,717
Yuki!

410
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:13,917
Wait! Come here!

411
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:14,477
Wait.

412
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,437
Wait for your friend,

413
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:15,837
okay?

414
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:16,997
You can take it out for a stroll first.

415
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,477
Why do you have no confidence in me?

416
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:21,317
Yuki, slow down!

417
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,400
(Children Fitness)

418
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,637
Alright, prepare to jump.

419
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,157
One, two, three.

420
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:29,317
Alright, do your landing.

421
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:30,677
Let's try this one.

422
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:31,917
I'm number one!

423
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:32,677
One, two, three.

424
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:36,277
One, two, three.

425
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:37,957
I'm Ultraman!

426
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,037
I'm going to defeat you!

427
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,717
One, two, three.

428
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,237
Alright, be careful.

429
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:45,277
Luo Le,

430
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,037
wait here for me,

431
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:46,477
okay?

432
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:49,277
Enough.

433
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:51,397
Ultraman won't fight with
another Ultraman.

434
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:52,477
If you're a man,

435
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,277
prove yourself

436
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,397
through a contest, okay?

437
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:54,757
Come.

438
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,557
Ultramen need to protect world peace.

439
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:56,877
Let's go.

440
00:18:59,157 --> 00:18:59,477
Okay.

441
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:06,397
Go now.

442
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:08,837
- Drink more water.
- Goodbye, Siyu.

443
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:09,917
Luo Le's mom,

444
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,517
Luo Le did great today.

445
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:12,317
Really?

446
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:14,037
Coach Chuan, thank you.

447
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,317
Luo Le has improved a lot in sports

448
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:17,277
after you came.

449
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:18,477
Many parents

450
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,557
of her classmates

451
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:20,997
asked me where she took

452
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:21,837
her PE class.

453
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:22,637
I recommended your center.

454
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:23,477
Thank you so much.

455
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:24,397
Don't mention it.

456
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:25,197
I'll resume my work then.

457
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:25,877
Okay.

458
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,037
Goodbye, Luo Le.

459
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:27,797
Goodbye.

460
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,877
Mom, I'm starving.

461
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,077
You're starving?

462
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:36,117
I brought you

463
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:38,477
your favorite cookies.

464
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,637
Wait.

465
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:42,477
Your hands are dirty.

466
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,317
Mom,

467
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,957
I want to attend

468
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,757
Coach Chuan's class every day.

469
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:52,877
Really?

470
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,797
If so, we can extend the classes

471
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,277
after this semester, okay?

472
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,157
Okay. Eat up.

473
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,197
I want some too.

474
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:08,917
Hey,

475
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,157
what are you doing?

476
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:12,357
Both of us are starving.

477
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:13,597
I'm still cooking the fish.

478
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:15,037
What are you looking at?

479
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,077
I want to buy an insurance policy
for Luo Le.

480
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:17,997
My friend recommended some to me.

481
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:18,917
Help me check them out.

482
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,040
(Is retirement the only way
to get rid of your trouble?)

483
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,717
I think I heard of this before.

484
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:22,877
It has good interest,

485
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,717
and you can choose two policyholders.

486
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:25,317
It's pretty good.

487
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:26,277
Yeah, right?

488
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,197
Many things have happened lately.

489
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:30,197
I was feeling uneasy.

490
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,237
I'm just trying
to prepare for a rainy day.

491
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:32,917
I want

492
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,037
to save up some money under her name.

493
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,317
Maybe she can use it in the future.

494
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:37,037
Alright.

495
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,557
I can rest at ease now that
you've given me the nod.

496
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:39,797
I'm starving.

497
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:40,677
Alright.

498
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:42,437
It's almost done.

499
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:43,437
Tell Luo Le to get ready.

500
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:45,437
Baby, time to eat!

501
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:54,637
Can you two slow down?

502
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,557
My daughter

503
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,997
went to a PE class.

504
00:20:58,077 --> 00:20:58,917
What did you do?

505
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,157
I found a new job.

506
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:00,997
I'm working as a dog walker

507
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:01,837
in Mo's shop.

508
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:05,317
Wait. Before this, you told me

509
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,677
that every job

510
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:07,637
might be your next job.

511
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:08,477
I thought

512
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,317
it was just a metaphor.

513
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,117
What are you thinking?

514
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,877
Being a dog walker is great.

515
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,477
I love cats and dogs.

516
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:15,797
It's just that I don't have

517
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:16,637
much stamina.

518
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,077
Even so, I'm sure you don't intend

519
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:20,317
to work there all your life, right?

520
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:21,397
Do you know something?

521
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:22,957
When I was studying

522
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:23,637
overseas,

523
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,357
I was especially envious of kids

524
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,197
who had free time

525
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:28,717
after they completed
their high school studies

526
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,397
and before they enter university.

527
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:31,637
They could try out

528
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:32,637
so many possibilities.

529
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:33,757
After that, they could choose

530
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:34,917
the profession they liked.

531
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:35,837
I didn't have

532
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:36,917
that chance.

533
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,837
I'll treat this as making it up
to myself.

534
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,157
Don't worry about me.

535
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,037
I made up my mind
after serious consideration.

536
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,157
I'm very serious.

537
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:54,797
You see.

538
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,237
It's not recruiting season.

539
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,357
And, there aren't any
good positions out there.

540
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:58,517
If so, why can't I

541
00:21:58,597 --> 00:21:59,557
enjoy myself for a few months?

542
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,317
Alright, I'll support Mommy An.

543
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:04,877
You have great taste.

544
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:06,917
Mommy An will give you a drumstick.

545
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:08,077
You already have a drumstick?

546
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,077
If so, I'll have it myself.

547
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,237
I want to eat a lot so that
I can run fast

548
00:22:13,637 --> 00:22:15,877
and earn the most stickers.

549
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,237
Hey,

550
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:21,437
her PE class was amazing.

551
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:22,357
Look at her.

552
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:24,477
She's exercising and eating well.

553
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,637
She's going to grow.

554
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,357
The main thing is,
the new coach they hired

555
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:31,877
was a hunk.

556
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:33,037
How handsome is he?

557
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,197
Let me put it this way.

558
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:35,637
I can skip

559
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:36,477
all of her other PE classes

560
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:37,837
except for

561
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:38,957
this one.

562
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:40,037
I don't trust you.

563
00:22:40,077 --> 00:22:40,917
You're exaggerating things.

564
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:41,797
If he was truly that handsome,

565
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:42,917
why didn't you register for it yourself?

566
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:43,877
It's because I...

567
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,397
I know. You're too old.

568
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:47,477
Yes.

569
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:48,957
I would definitely register for it
if I was younger.

570
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:50,197
He's truly handsome.

571
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:50,917
What about this?

572
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:52,117
Give me an opportunity

573
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:54,757
to pick Luo Le up after class.

574
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:56,957
No way.

575
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:00,717
Is he truly that handsome?

576
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:05,077
I don't trust you at all.

577
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:12,917
Slow down!

578
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:17,317
Yuki, slow down!

579
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,877
Slow down!

580
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:19,957
Slow down!

581
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:40,437
Is this your dog?

582
00:23:43,277 --> 00:23:45,917
I'm helping the pet shop
to take their dogs out for a stroll.

583
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:50,077
Let me handle it.

584
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:56,317
What about this?

585
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:57,997
Wait here for me.

586
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:00,157
What's its name?

587
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:00,957
Yuki.

588
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:02,917
Yuki, let's go.

589
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:15,437
Yuki, let's go.

590
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,877
Let's go.

591
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:21,397
Yuki.

592
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,757
You love to bully me, don't you?

593
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,517
Did I not feed you

594
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,717
any jerky?

595
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,037
Or did I not pick up your poo?

596
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,277
Why are you so obedient
when he's taking you out on a stroll?

597
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:31,437
Why do you treat me differently?

598
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:33,717
Making acquaintances with dogs

599
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:34,557
is the same as humans.

600
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:35,997
We need some time to get along.

601
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:36,757
At first,

602
00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:37,717
your rope was too long.

603
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:38,757
They won't thank you for it.

604
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:39,837
They'll only run like crazy.

605
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:41,637
You need to shorten the rope.

606
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:42,197
When it wants to run,

607
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,117
just drag it back.

608
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:44,677
Let it know that it cannot stand up
against you.

609
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,477
Smart dogs like them

610
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:47,877
will become obedient

611
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:49,117
after one or two rounds.

612
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,557
You do know quite a lot, huh?

613
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:53,477
Alright.

614
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,157
You can bring it back without any issues

615
00:24:55,357 --> 00:24:56,037
later.

616
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:58,517
Okay, thank you.

617
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:02,117
It acted like this
after I brought it out.

618
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:03,837
So, is this your new job?

619
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,477
How long do you think I can last?

620
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:11,277
How many km can you jog without a dog?

621
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:13,197
I don't know. I don't jog.

622
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:19,077
I have something else to do.

623
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:19,757
I have to go.

624
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:21,037
Will you be here at this time tomorrow?

625
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:23,837
See you tomorrow.

626
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:25,357
Your bag.

627
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:27,317
See you.

628
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:28,157
Goodbye, Yuki.

629
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:29,837
Enough! You still want to play with him?

630
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:30,597
Bring it back immediately.

631
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:31,797
Come back.

632
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:36,517
He's not training at this hour?

633
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:37,517
What is he doing here?

634
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,957
Yuki, come here.

635
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,437
One,

636
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:44,477
two,

637
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:46,117
three rounds.

638
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:53,357
You can't run now, can you?

639
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:56,877
No.

640
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,077
I'm losing signal here.

641
00:25:58,277 --> 00:25:59,877
Did you say that Jin Yi was sacked?

642
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,120
(He wants to get another
contract with Oscom.)

643
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,280
(But this time, they're smarter.)

644
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,640
(They said they would
check his profile first.)

645
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,200
(In the end, they discovered)

646
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,600
(many disciplinary issues with him.)

647
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,840
(That includes slandering
the sports shoes we provided.)

648
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,560
(In the end, the leader)

649
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,200
(of the sports team)

650
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,920
(sacked him.)

651
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:19,277
So, for the underdog selection,

652
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:20,037
did you recommend

653
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,237
Song Sanchuan to Mr. Jie?

654
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,640
(He left the team before Jin Yi.)

655
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
(Didn't you know?)

656
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,520
(He applied for retirement)

657
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,920
(even before the tournament was over.)

658
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:34,877
He did go against

659
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:35,677
the rules.

660
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:37,757
However, it's nothing major

661
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,117
like a principle issue.

662
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,157
If he truly wishes to change his way,

663
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:43,517
I can help him out.

664
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:45,237
The thing is, he wanted to leave.

665
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,557
He even told me

666
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:48,717
that he could do anything as long as

667
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:49,717
he didn't need to play badminton.

668
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:55,637
Look.

669
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:57,637
The photo

670
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,357
was indecent indeed.

671
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:01,117
We were trying to alter and improve

672
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:01,957
the team's atmosphere too.

673
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:08,997
Coach,

674
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:11,757
can I have this photo?

675
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:22,477
Eat up.

676
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,717
Do you still play tennis?

677
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:26,957
I go to the tennis club every day.

678
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,797
Did you go there to play tennis
or to have fun?

679
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:32,597
Of course I went there to play tennis.

680
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:34,317
Mr. Jiang,

681
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:35,757
did I offend you again?

682
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:37,117
I've decided.

683
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,077
Once this year's tournament

684
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:40,477
is over,

685
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,317
you should quit tennis.

686
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:43,797
Stop fooling around.

687
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:46,077
Get yourself a decent job.

688
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,197
I'm already 22.

689
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:48,637
Why are you still

690
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:49,957
ordering me around?

691
00:27:51,077 --> 00:27:52,197
Why should I get a job?

692
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:53,397
I want to play tennis!

693
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:55,117
You want to play tennis?

694
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:57,197
Was the prize money you won

695
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:58,677
even enough to pay for your transport?

696
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,037
You're just wasting my money!

697
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:03,477
Have you encountered any issues

698
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,437
during work lately?

699
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:05,997
Even so, you shouldn't

700
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:07,037
vent out your anger
on his tennis career,

701
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:07,717
okay?

702
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:09,677
You only know how to spoil him.

703
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:11,797
A kind mother makes a wastrel.

704
00:28:12,277 --> 00:28:13,037
Look at him.

705
00:28:13,797 --> 00:28:14,557
What will he achieve

706
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:15,957
if he keeps playing tennis?

707
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:17,997
Have you seen me play tennis before?

708
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:19,477
What gives you the right to judge me?

709
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:22,957
You think I didn't know about

710
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:24,517
your conversations with Liang You'an?

711
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:25,637
You say things like:

712
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,357
"His match isn't worth watching".

713
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:29,637
"Even if he's one of the
top 100 local tennis players,"

714
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:30,517
"there's no point"

715
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:31,597
"in wasting two hours of my time"

716
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:32,317
"to watch his match".

717
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,197
You said that.

718
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:33,877
Am I right, Mr. Jiang?

719
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:35,837
I was just saying.

720
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:36,517
What's wrong with that?

721
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:37,837
I know those were your heartfelt words.

722
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:41,157
What? You don't dare
to admit what you said?

723
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:42,637
Listen up.

724
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:44,477
I chose to play tennis,

725
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:46,157
and I'll stand by my choice.

726
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:14,797
Talk.

727
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,440
(Mr. Jie,)

728
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,680
(the company's secretaries
held a gathering lately.)

729
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
(I heard them gossiping about you)

730
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
(and the tennis club.)

731
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,480
(I think)

732
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,800
(Mr. Gao was the one who spread)

733
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,520
(the rumor.)

734
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,440
(He said something about
the tennis club)

735
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,080
(belonging to your son.)

736
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:27,797
Got it.

737
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:16,380
(Mr. Jie)

738
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:24,557
Hello, Mr. Jie?

739
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,840
(Let's meet up with each other.)

740
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,320
(It's been a long time.)

741
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:29,837
Okay.

742
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:38,957
Thank you.

743
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:39,517
Don't mention it.

744
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:43,637
Over here, please.

745
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:45,877
Have a seat.

746
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:46,157
Be careful.

747
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:47,037
Okay, thank you.

748
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:57,157
There's no need to look around.

749
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:58,677
It's just the two of us.

750
00:30:59,197 --> 00:31:00,557
I'm treating you to a meal in private.

751
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:06,877
Mr. Jie, I'm not drinking today.

752
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:08,077
I just had a minor surgery

753
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:09,317
two days ago.

754
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,037
Drink some water then.

755
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:12,917
Your health is more important.

756
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:14,077
I can do it myself.

757
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:18,357
Thank you, Mr. Jie.

758
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,397
I didn't mean anything else

759
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:24,717
by treating you to a meal.

760
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,757
It's an apology from me.

761
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,277
It may seem like Mr. Gao

762
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:33,357
had an advantage over me
after you resigned.

763
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:34,357
But in reality,

764
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:35,877
you saved me

765
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:38,037
from falling into a deep pit.

766
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,357
I'm truly thankful to you.

767
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:44,197
You kept telling me

768
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:45,757
that Jin Yi was a bad choice.

769
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:47,277
I didn't trust you.

770
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:48,557
In the end,

771
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:50,037
you were right.

772
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,157
Anger took over me on that day.

773
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,317
Try and understand my feelings, okay?

774
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:55,677
I treated you poorly.

775
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:57,357
I'm sorry about that.

776
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:08,837
Mr. Jie,

777
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:10,997
you don't need to tell me all this.

778
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:13,677
I didn't take your words to heart.

779
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:15,437
I'd learned

780
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:16,677
everything I knew

781
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,357
from you all these years.

782
00:32:19,597 --> 00:32:20,277
That's why

783
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:22,797
I'll always remember your kindness.

784
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,917
You don't need to remember my kindness.

785
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:26,637
I just hope you won't hate me.

786
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:29,437
It was a joke.

787
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,317
Say, do people reminisce
the past more often

788
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:35,077
as they grow older?

789
00:32:35,517 --> 00:32:36,997
I've been reminiscing about
the past lately.

790
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:39,277
I remember every time

791
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,237
you stood by

792
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,237
my side

793
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:44,037
and resolved my issues for me.

794
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,557
I was too dependent on you.

795
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,677
How do I put it?

796
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:53,517
Whenever you're beside me,

797
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:55,517
I always feel at ease.

798
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:01,837
It impeded your growth instead.

799
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,317
I need to reflect upon my actions.

800
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:33,277
Mr. Jie,

801
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:36,917
what happened?

802
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:41,357
What's wrong with you today?

803
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,717
I need you to do me a favor.

804
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:45,837
You're not allowed to reject me.

805
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:55,517
My business trip

806
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:57,157
will at least last for ten days.

807
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,517
When you're free, you should
come upstairs

808
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,997
and keep an eye on Luo Le
and my housekeeper.

809
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:02,757
Got it.

810
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:05,317
I've already reached the fitness center.

811
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:06,997
I'll bring Luo Le to have a meal

812
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:08,437
(Children Fitness)
after picking her up,

813
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:09,077
okay?

814
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:10,917
You'll admit you're wrong

815
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:13,277
after seeing the coach.

816
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,437
You will regret what you say
about my taste.

817
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
(Did you see him?)

818
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,320
(Did you?)

819
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:28,397
Sorry. I was wrong.

820
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:31,597
Get ready. Jump!

821
00:34:31,756 --> 00:34:35,397
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

822
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:39,317
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

823
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:43,437
3, 2, 3, 4, step in place!

824
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,477
1, 2, 3, 4.

825
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:49,397
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

826
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:53,317
3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

827
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:55,837
4, 2, 3, 4, 5...

828
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,940
♪Flustering over bumping each other♪

829
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,380
♪Not missing a single moment♪

830
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,780
♪I, who's starting to let down my guard♪

831
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,940
♪Have a soft spot for you♪

832
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:28,797
I asked you how did
your badminton career go

833
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:30,677
when we were at the hospital.

834
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:32,957
So, you lied to me.

835
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:34,157
Back then,

836
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:35,517
you looked so pale.

837
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:37,277
I didn't want

838
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:38,237
to upset you.

839
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,557
If, back then,

840
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:44,397
I didn't insist on making you
put on the bunny hairband,

841
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:47,157
maybe you wouldn't end up like this.

842
00:35:51,757 --> 00:35:52,597
I did the marathon.

843
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:53,557
I made the money.

844
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:54,917
It has nothing to do with you.

845
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:57,357
Where did you get the photo?

846
00:35:58,837 --> 00:35:59,877
I got it

847
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:00,597
from Coach Yu.

848
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:04,197
Actually, my current job

849
00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:04,797
is pretty good.

850
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,237
It's my expertise,
and the environment is pure.

851
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,237
As for my income,

852
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:10,437
I can support myself easily.

853
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:11,717
Working again after retiring

854
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:12,517
is nothing

855
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:13,717
to me.

856
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:15,317
But you.

857
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:17,597
You had a great job.

858
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:19,157
But you ended up being a dog walker

859
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:20,517
after I won the match.

860
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:22,477
So,

861
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:23,757
you think

862
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:24,837
I couldn't find a job

863
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:26,557
and ended up being a dog walker, huh?

864
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,757
After that, you came here
at the same time every day

865
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:31,237
just so you could help me out, huh?

866
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:32,997
Isn't that so?

867
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,277
I...

868
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:36,957
I can't explain myself to you.

869
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:38,197
Let me put it this way.

870
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:39,997
At least I truly

871
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,157
love my current job.

872
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:41,997
I'm willing

873
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:42,797
to pick up

874
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:43,957
their poo every day.

875
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:44,957
It's much better than measuring

876
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:45,597
Jin Yi's smelly feet.

877
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:46,357
I'm sure

878
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,117
you understand what I'm trying to say.

879
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:50,637
You do hold a grudge pretty deeply.

880
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:54,837
So, are you sure

881
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,837
you want to be better at this?

882
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:57,717
I always believed

883
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,597
that there's nothing in this world

884
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:01,117
that I cannot achieve
if I set my mind to it,

885
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:02,957
until I met them.

886
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:04,357
Okay.

887
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,317
If so, from tomorrow onward,

888
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,277
I'll jog with you

889
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:09,757
and train your stamina.

890
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:16,957
(Song Sanchuan)
I'm the top children's physical trainer,

891
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,437
Song Sanchuan.

892
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:22,597
Sales pitches are everywhere indeed.

893
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:23,317
Fine.

894
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:24,917
I'll attend your class.

895
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,237
I thought

896
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:35,877
you would at least bring me

897
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:37,877
to a professional training ground.

898
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:39,717
Even a field is better than this.

899
00:37:40,317 --> 00:37:41,517
Track isn't suitable for people like you

900
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:42,357
who don't exercise much.

901
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:43,637
You can enjoy the scenery

902
00:37:43,757 --> 00:37:44,917
and its people if you jog in a park.

903
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:46,637
It can distract you and
alleviate your suffering.

904
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:47,717
Yeah.

905
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:49,277
You do have a point.

906
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:51,917
When you jog,

907
00:37:52,077 --> 00:37:52,757
do not hunch your back.

908
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,517
Don't move your shoulders too much.

909
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:55,317
Breathe naturally.

910
00:37:55,677 --> 00:37:56,957
I will jog according to your pace.

911
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,517
Where's the finish line then?

912
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:01,477
Over there.

913
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,717
We'll go from there to there.

914
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:04,917
It'll end when we reach
the top of the hill.

915
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,317
It's that far away?

916
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,837
How long do we need to run?

917
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:08,957
That doesn't matter.

918
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,077
Just follow my lead.

919
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:13,637
Here, put this on.

920
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:19,637
This can monitor your heart rate

921
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:20,557
for me.

922
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,837
Tell me if you feel

923
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:23,317
any discomfort.

924
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:24,637
Is it tight?

925
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:35,877
(Heart Rate)
Why is your heart rate so high

926
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:36,757
when you're standing still?

927
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:41,517
Your heart rate is quite high.

928
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:44,157
Just jog already.

929
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:51,517
Jog properly.

930
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,517
Alright, we're almost there.
You can do it.

931
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:10,477
We're almost there.

932
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:11,557
This is the last bit.

933
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:12,557
Sprint!

934
00:39:13,357 --> 00:39:14,117
Okay, stop.

935
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:14,557
We're done.

936
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:15,437
We've arrived.

937
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:26,877
Open your eyes.

938
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:27,517
Don't close them.

939
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:28,317
Liang You'an,

940
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:30,517
adjust your breathing slowly.

941
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:32,397
Don't rush.

942
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:33,477
Exhale

943
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:34,597
before you inhale.

944
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:36,997
Come, follow me. Breathe out.

945
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:40,557
Breathe in.

946
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:43,637
Breathe out again.

947
00:39:46,477 --> 00:39:47,357
Do you feel better?

948
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:53,077
Actually, it's more than just jogging.

949
00:39:53,637 --> 00:39:54,197
Many people

950
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,317
don't know how to breathe properly.

951
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:56,317
You can only

952
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:57,517
inhale more oxygen after exhaling

953
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:58,437
all of the extra gas

954
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:00,317
in your lungs.

955
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:01,997
And, when you inhale,

956
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:03,277
you need to pay attention
to your right lung.

957
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:04,957
One's right lung

958
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:05,917
has three pulmonary lobes.

959
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:06,837
It has one more than our left lung.

960
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:08,397
Therefore, when you breathe in,

961
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:09,317
try to fill up

962
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:10,277
your right lung.

963
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,077
Again.

964
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:14,037
Breathe in.

965
00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:17,517
Breathe out.

966
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:23,157
This is amazing.

967
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,117
It feels as if

968
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:27,797
this is my first time

969
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:28,997
inhaling air.

970
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,197
So, we need to learn how to breathe too?

971
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:32,317
You're exaggerating it.

972
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:33,277
I'm serious.

973
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:35,557
Do you wish to know

974
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:36,237
how long you'd run?

975
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:41,277
45 minutes.

976
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:43,717
Never in my dreams

977
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:44,797
would I imagine

978
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:46,117
that I could run for such a long time.

979
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,717
Although your pace is ordinary,

980
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,237
this is your first
jogging session after all.

981
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:50,197
You've already

982
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:51,037
exceeded my expectations

983
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:51,837
for running so long.

984
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,277
Do you know something?

985
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:54,917
Although I worked for a sports brand,

986
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:56,117
I had never

987
00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:57,317
truly exercised.

988
00:40:57,717 --> 00:40:58,437
I can tell.

989
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:00,197
I did apply for a gym membership before.

990
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:01,357
But I can't even last

991
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:02,877
ten minutes on the treadmill.

992
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:03,877
I can't even walk on the treadmill

993
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:04,837
while watching dramas.

994
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:06,277
45 minutes?

995
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:07,757
It's hard to believe.

996
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,597
So, how do you feel after the jog?

997
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:12,597
I feel as light as a feather.

998
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,237
And, the world looks much better.

999
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:16,397
So, are we going to jog again tomorrow?

1000
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:17,997
Tomorrow?

1001
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,077
I have to do someone

1002
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:20,677
a favor first.

1003
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:25,477
Here.

1004
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:27,757
Time to recharge myself.

1005
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:29,077
I sweated a lot.

1006
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:30,877
Time to replenish my electrolyte.

1007
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:33,957
The favor you mentioned just now,

1008
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:37,677
was it something important?

1009
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:42,477
It's something I haven't decided yet.

1010
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:44,317
I still don't know
if I should go or not.

1011
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:46,757
It might be related to my next job.

1012
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:48,317
You should go then. Why not?

1013
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:49,637
Don't tell me

1014
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:50,917
you wish to be a dog walker
for the rest of your life?

1015
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,797
It's not a great job by any means.

1016
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,237
Mainly, I've never done it before.

1017
00:41:58,397 --> 00:41:58,917
I don't know

1018
00:41:59,077 --> 00:41:59,837
if I'll be good at it or not.

1019
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:02,477
Don't think of it like that.

1020
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:03,677
Before this, you thought

1021
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:04,517
you couldn't jog, right?

1022
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:05,757
But you finished your jog today.

1023
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,837
Sometimes, we're only

1024
00:42:09,677 --> 00:42:10,997
scaring ourselves.

1025
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:17,117
You often say something

1026
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:18,597
simple

1027
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:19,997
yet deep at the same time.

1028
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:20,717
Is that so?

1029
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:23,117
For example,

1030
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:27,637
You can only

1031
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:29,237
inhale more fresh air after exhaling

1032
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:30,117
all of the extra gas.

1033
00:42:31,837 --> 00:42:33,517
That means I'm mature.

1034
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:42,277
What about the day after tomorrow?

1035
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,037
Will we be jogging again?

1036
00:42:45,037 --> 00:42:45,677
The day after tomorrow?

1037
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,477
I have an appointment with Luo Nian.

1038
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:53,117
What about the day after that?

1039
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,197
The day after that?

1040
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:57,717
I have something to do.

1041
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,957
Are you serious? Why are you busier

1042
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:02,837
now that you're jobless?

1043
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:04,557
You just want to slack off, right?

1044
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,397
That's not true.

1045
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,277
What about the day after that?

1046
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,037
The day after that? I'm lazy.

1047
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:11,117
What about the day after that?

1048
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:11,717
I understand now.

1049
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:12,517
It's not a time issue.

1050
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:13,797
