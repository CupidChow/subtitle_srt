(Song Sanchuan, Meng Xin)

10
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
It's okay.

11
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,406
As you gain more points,

12
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,799
you will meet stronger opponents.

13
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,067
When you play headwind game
like this again,

14
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,146
accept that you've lost the first round.

15
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,201
Get over it.

16
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,947
Bounce back.

17
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:26,673
I got it.

18
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:28,867
I'll be more focused tomorrow.

19
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,207
Want another bowl?

20
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:40,527
No, thanks.

21
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,167
That's enough for you?

22
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,247
When I was your age,

23
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,687
I could finish five bowls
when I came out to play.

24
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,647
Ms. Luo said

25
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,167
no excessive intake of carbohydrates.

26
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:54,887
Yes, we should listen to her.

27
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,807
Competitive sports these days

28
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,447
are so different from our time.

29
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:02,487
For example,

30
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,687
like the trending sport psychology.

31
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,047
Yes, it stabilizes athletes' mind

32
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,287
when going on the field,

33
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:09,847
but it just increases

34
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,327
your emotional bluntness.

35
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,487
You can't get excited
when you win the game,

36
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:13,607
and you can't get panicked
when you lost.

37
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,287
But don't you think the biggest appeal

38
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,167
and most addictive part
of competitive sports is

39
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:23,567
the extreme ups and downs
of winning and losing?

40
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,047
I don't want to lose.

41
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:29,607
I don't want to feel

42
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:30,727
this extreme suffering.

43
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,007
When I fail to catch the ball,

44
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:34,887
I only feel one thing.

45
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,447
I feel like a loser.

46
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:40,967
So useless.

47
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,767
Who gave you your name?

48
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:52,807
My mom.

49
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:55,727
Does it mean anything?

50
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,447
My mother used to be
a badminton player.

51
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,087
That's why I practiced badminton.

52
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,407
She probably gave me this name

53
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:08,567
because she wanted me

54
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,167
to be able to catch the ball
coming from left, center, and right

55
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,567
when I was on the court.

56
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:15,807
But the word "Chuan"
[*The word "Chuan" means through.]

57
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,847
isn't a good name.

58
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,047
So, she replaced it with another word.

59
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,567
Once she changed it,

60
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,247
I really couldn't catch any balls.

61
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,687
Who says that?

62
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:27,767
Your current "Chuan" means unending.

63
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,567
It's a good name.

64
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,967
You can use it to describe
your tennis journey.

65
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,020
(Workspace)

66
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,307
I have set up the public account and

67
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,627
several short video platform
accounts this week.

68
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:46,867
I'll update the public account
weekly after this.

69
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,147
It will focus on their training
and competition promotion.

70
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:51,867
(I will try to upload
a short video daily.)

71
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,340
I've studied the videos

72
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,100
about different sports.

73
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,940
Those that received most likes and comments

74
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,060
are about the players' daily life

75
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,860
and skills tips.

76
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,780
I will focus on these contents.

77
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,860
After thinking about it,

78
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,900
I still want to focus on

79
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,060
the ten trainees.

80
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,980
If they win games in the future,

81
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,407
they will make our club famous.

82
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,240
Publicity must be done in advance.

83
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,140
How about I film an introduction vlog

84
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,980
for each of them?

85
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,380
This sounds like a good idea.

86
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,260
But you must find out about

87
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,780
their personal experience
and characteristics.

88
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,060
Highlight them.

89
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,980
That's what I'm good at.

90
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,380
Ms. You'an,

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
about the membership gift

92
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,460
and the club merchandise products
that you mentioned earlier,

93
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,380
the designs are completed.

94
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,420
Once you approve it,

95
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,780
I will ask the factory to make it.

96
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,060
Water cup, wrist guard,
and sweat towel,

97
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,100
we will produce these
more useful products first.

98
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,820
We have limited funds, after all.

99
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,420
Leave the rest to next time.

100
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,860
Got it, I'll contact them now.

101
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,860
All right.

102
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,340
You've worked hard, guys.

103
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,140
I'll treat you to a nice meal tomorrow.

104
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,460
It's okay, Ms. You'an.

105
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,780
I just had a bottle of coffee.

106
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm full of energy now.

107
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,540
You're such a kiss-ass.

108
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,140
Why tomorrow?

109
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,100
Treat us today.

110
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,500
I can't today.

111
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,220
I'm meeting someone.

112
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,060
Cut.

113
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,340
Can you not be so pretentious?

114
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,620
It's unnatural.

115
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,420
No, I mean,

116
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,820
I've never been filmed before.

117
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,700
I don't know how I can make the movement

118
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,980
of my arms and legs look natural.

119
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Just pretend I'm not here.

120
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,100
Focus on your training.

121
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,220
You are standing right here.

122
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,740
How can I pretend you aren't here?

123
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,420
Do you prefer me to
film you without telling you?

124
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,100
You are quite something.

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,860
There are so many players in the club.

126
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,780
And you had to choose me.

127
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,380
I know I'm the best player.

128
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,900
And I'm the best looking one too.

129
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,740
But you're being unfair to them.

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,020
It's bad if people see us.

131
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,980
They will call our club
"Crown Prince's Club" again.

132
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,540
Are you fascinated by me?

133
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,820
I'm fascinated by your stupidity!

134
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,700
This is an order from Ms. Liang.

135
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
Everyone has to shoot a personal vlog.

136
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm filming you first

137
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,460
because everyone else

138
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,260
has gone to play matches.

139
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,300
You are the only one here.

140
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,500
Dai Yi doesn't have any matches.

141
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,820
Dai Yi is in class.

142
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,900
Listen,

143
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,380
you are so...

144
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
You really are no fun.

145
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,260
I don't want you to film me anymore.

146
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,300
I saw the push

147
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,020
of your public account.

148
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,180
It has received a great response.

149
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,020
It went really well.

150
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,060
Mr. Jiang, just admit it.

151
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,540
We're doing better than you expected.

152
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,620
Ms. Liang, you no longer

153
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,140
see me as your boss now, huh?

154
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,380
I actually went to the opening day.

155
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
Really?

156
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,860
I didn't see you.

157
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,900
I was at the door.

158
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,580
Something came up, so I didn't go in.

159
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,780
It was grand.

160
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,660
I could see it.

161
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,420
You were trying so hard
to show me that you did it.

162
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,100
What does that mean?

163
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,660
Someone told me

164
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,180
that you are giving out benefits

165
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,340
and subsidies.

166
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,900
Isn't that too idealistic?

167
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,340
Yes,

168
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,140
it's true that Chen Ke got some money
from our divorce.

169
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,620
But how long can it last?

170
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,980
I thought

171
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,500
you were treating me to a lunch today

172
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,580
to congratulate me.

173
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,580
Now it looks like I was wrong.

174
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,100
I'm not standing on
the opposite side of you.

175
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,780
One of you is my former employee,

176
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,660
the other is my ex-wife.

177
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,060
My son is in it too.

178
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,100
Right?

179
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,180
I feel it is

180
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,620
my responsibility to remind you.

181
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,420
If one day

182
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,380
your business can't go on anymore,

183
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,780
you can come to me.

184
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,460
No matter what difficulties you have,

185
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,460
I will solve it for you.

186
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,420
Sometimes,

187
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,260
I just can't figure out.

188
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,540
Whether it's you or Chen Ke,

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,300
why are you fighting me?

190
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,820
Is it necessary?

191
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:47,261
Do you think your life will be better

192
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,940
if you leave me?

193
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,140
Personally, I think,

194
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,900
this is how men like you

195
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,557
see the world.

196
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
You always think that

197
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,920
you are the center of the world.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,880
Look at this.

199
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
You think

200
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
everything revolves around you.

201
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,486
But as a woman,

202
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,046
I see the world in a parallel way like this.

203
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:50,593
There are many, many things

204
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:51,953
that I care about.

205
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:52,953
For me,

206
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,873
you are just one of these little circles

207
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:55,913
that don't necessarily rank

208
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:57,673
in the first sequence
of our thinking behavior.

209
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,433
So, about what you just said,

210
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,553
whether it's about the club or the games,

211
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
we aren't doing them
to compete with you

212
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,440
or to prove something to you.

213
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,840
I have something to do. I should go.

214
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:06,660
(Song Sanchuan)

215
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,880
Come clean now.

216
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,960
The photo of the food just now,

217
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,480
you actually wanted to send it
to Song Sanchuan, right?

218
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,160
You only sent it to me

219
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
because you were afraid
of distracting him.

220
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,840
Jiang Jie asked me out for lunch today.

221
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,200
He kept trying to provoke me.

222
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I couldn't hold it back.

223
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,600
So, I reproached him.

224
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,440
You reproached him?

225
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,360
I just lectured him a little.

226
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I gave him a lesson.

227
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,040
So, you were thinking

228
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
of seeking consolation from Sanchuan?

229
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Yes.

230
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,800
I want to look at his face

231
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,280
to cleanse the bad luck.

232
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,520
Now that I'm home.

233
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,920
It's a meal that I've always liked.

234
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Why do I feel that it will only taste better

235
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,960
after I share it with him?

236
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,080
I can't believe I want
to share it with him,

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
and I want him to respond to it.

238
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
Why else?

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Because you missed him.

240
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,400
That day he said that

241
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,920
after the club reopened,

242
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,320
we would each focus on our duties.

243
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,120
We would be back to being a player and an agent.

244
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,000
God knows

245
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
how hard I tried to hold myself back

246
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,360
from touching him when I saw him.

247
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,280
Why?

248
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
Why are you testing me?

249
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,720
Be grateful that you're living in
a mobile and social media era.

250
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,560
When you miss someone,

251
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,640
there are many things

252
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
that you can do.

253
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,280
You can send him a photo,

254
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
upload a message to Moments,

255
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,360
or share a song.

256
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,880
It will make you feel better.

257
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,400
Why do I feel that there is
only one thing I can do

258
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,280
when I miss someone?

259
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,220
(Zhang Zhenlei, Song Sanchuan)

260
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,380
(The 3rd "Talent Cup"
Tennis Tournament, Nanjing)

261
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,380
(Zhang Zhenlei, Song Sanchuan)

262
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,520
You can do it!

263
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,320
Time's up.

264
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,000
What are you doing here?

265
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,400
It's been so long
since I watched a live game.

266
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,760
A club in Nanjing wants

267
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,520
to discuss cooperation with me, anyway.

268
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,120
I paid for the ticket myself.

269
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,520
I didn't spend the club's money.

270
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,320
How you lost today is worse than

271
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
how you lost yesterday.

272
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,360
I told you it's not scary to lose,

273
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,840
but you can't lose like that.

274
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,680
What was going on with you
during your last two rounds?

275
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,360
What's wrong?

276
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,080
Have we been practicing so long for nothing?

277
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,040
I couldn't bounce back.

278
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm sorry, Coach Yan.

279
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,840
What the hell is this?

280
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,040
Fortunately, I left my luggage

281
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,160
at the front desk when I came out.

282
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,320
That saved me money
for the rest of the day.

283
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll go back to get my luggage.

284
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
Let me know when the tickets are booked.

285
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,560
Song Sanchuan,

286
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,240
don't look down.

287
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,360
The balls come from the front.

288
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,240
Look up.

289
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,360
Winning and losing are normal.

290
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,320
Stop thinking about it.

291
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,880
I have an appointment with a club manager.

292
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,000
You're coming with me.

293
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,160
Okay.

294
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,360
Have some dishes.

295
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,240
Help yourself.

296
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
These are our local specialties.

297
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

298
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,880
Sanchuan.

299
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,600
Let me do it.

300
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,000
It's hot.

301
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,360
I saw the trainee program
on your public account.

302
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,280
Honestly,

303
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,920
I was quite moved.

304
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,320
On the one hand,

305
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,840
I really admire
your courage for doing that,

306
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,640
on the other hand,

307
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,080
I think that this isn't a risk

308
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,600
that a club like ours
without a patron can take.

309
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,000
Mr. Xu,

310
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,600
first of all, our club doesn't have

311
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,320
a big corporation
behind us like people say.

312
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,240
We only have individual shareholders.

313
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,000
So,

314
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm also under a lot of pressure

315
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,600
for carrying out
such an innovative project.

316
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
The good thing is that our shareholders

317
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,640
are willing to take the risk with me.

318
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,000
We also hope

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,040
to make this trainee program an ecosystem

320
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,240
of tennis talent development.

321
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,720
We want to give those
who have dreams and talents

322
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,200
but are unable to pursue them

323
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,040
due to practical issues a chance.

324
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,000
That sounds nice.

325
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,360
When I go back,

326
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,000
I will tell my players in the club about this.

327
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
I will tell them

328
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,160
to apply for the program too

329
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,120
if there is a chance.

330
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,080
Aren't you afraid

331
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,680
of losing your members?

332
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,880
I am,

333
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,120
but I'm more afraid

334
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
that these good talents would give up.

335
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,160
After being in the sports industry
for a long time,

336
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,760
I can't just

337
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,840
care only about my own turf.

338
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,640
All I'm thinking about is

339
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,840
if this industry can make any breakthrough.

340
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,040
In fact, the most important thing

341
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,160
between clubs is healthy competition.

342
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,920
Ms. Liang,

343
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
many people in the industry

344
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
think you will fail,

345
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,920
but I truly hope

346
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,480
that you will succeed.

347
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,080
I hope you can share your experience

348
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,840
with me in the future.

349
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,160
I'll do my best.

350
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,880
If there is anything
I can share in the future,

351
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,960
I won't keep it to myself.

352
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,520
Okay.

353
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,240
This must be the player

354
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,440
who switched from badminton, right?

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,680
That's me.

356
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm Song Sanchuan.

357
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,960
You are obviously a sport talent.

358
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,680
If you don't mind me saying,

359
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,360
everyone is watching

360
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
the results of you and your mates.

361
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
They are waiting to see

362
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,040
if Ms. Liang would win her bet.

363
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,320
Let them wait and see.

364
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,080
I believe Ms. Liang

365
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,600
has made a right decision.

366
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,680
Good.

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
Did it upset you just now?

368
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
What makes you say that?

369
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,400
Mr. Xu didn't mean any harm.

370
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,720
I know.

371
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,640
I think he's quite honest.

372
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,040
He must have said

373
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,480
those words to motivate me.

374
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,240
I always overthink things.

375
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,400
That's why they say

376
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,840
it's not a bad thing to be simple.

377
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,960
I didn't know

378
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
so many people were waiting

379
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,840
to see my results.

380
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,720
That's great.

381
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,280
So I have to work even harder.

382
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,280
I have to work harder to win.

383
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Only then can I help you prove

384
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,880
the viability of the trainee program.

385
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,760
Have you pulled yourself together now?

386
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,920
Of course.

387
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
Now I just want to get back to the game.

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,280
Sorry, sir.

389
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,600
We're not going to the hotel now.

390
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,560
Please take us to the airport.

391
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,400
Thanks.

392
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,720
What about my luggage?

393
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,440
Coach Yan just texted me

394
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,760
that he got your luggage.

395
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,800
He's just a typical person

396
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,280
who is tough on the outside
but soft on the inside.

397
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,560
Very soft.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't be afraid of him.

399
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,320
I'm grateful for Mr. Xu.

400
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
What for?

401
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,440
Because he

402
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,760
brought you here.

403
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,960
It feels so nice.

404
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:53,500
(The 7th "Aiyin Cup"
Tennis Tournament, Shenzhen)

405
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,920
- Sanchuan!
- Chuan!

406
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
We just won our games.

407
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,200
How did it go?

408
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
How did you do?

409
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,840
Stop asking.

410
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,240
I lost three games in a row.

411
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,440
Did you fail to master secret technique?

412
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,200
That's right.

413
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,280
I didn't even practice that.

414
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,120
I haven't done well
in the last few games.

415
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,920
I don't know
what's wrong with me either.

416
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,960
It's okay.

417
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Maybe your head
wasn't in the game.

418
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,600
Adjust your mindset.

419
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,000
Everyone has slump, right?

420
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
Exactly.

421
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,280
Didn't you give us advice before?

422
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,720
This means you are about

423
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
to have another breakthrough.

424
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,560
That's right.

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,480
All right. Want to
have lunch together later?

426
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,840
There you go.

427
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,360
Eating comes first before anything.

428
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,600
Even if you lost, you still have to eat.

429
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,280
Guys, how about we try something new?

430
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,480
How about Food Republic?

431
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Hang on.

432
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,280
What's going on with you lately?

433
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,680
You keep thinking about Food Republic.

434
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Are you short of money?

435
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,080
Of course not.

436
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,480
My parents just got divorced.

437
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,120
I got two shares
of living expenses now.

438
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
If I had known
I would be this happy,

439
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,240
I would've told them
to get a divorce sooner.

440
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,520
Food Republic is good.

441
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,280
My treat tonight.

442
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,040
Don't fight it with me.

443
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,240
You lost games.
Of course it's your treat.

444
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,720
Let's go.

445
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,920
Food Republic is good.

446
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,120
The food is great.

447
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,920
Really?

448
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,120
Is it that good?

449
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,080
Guys, raise your glasses.

450
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,360
Here's to Chuan, who is treating us

451
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,840
a nice meal.

452
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,600
Cut it out.

453
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,080
Come.

454
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,720
Dude,

455
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,960
no wonder you joined tennis.

456
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,120
You've become someone's boss now.

457
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,400
This is such an unlucky day for me.

458
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
All bad stuff come together.

459
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,520
I heard that someone here

460
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,920
chose to join tennis

461
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,000
because he wanted to avoid the 18-18 tie.

462
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,600
What are you up to?

463
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,440
You think you can be champion there?

464
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
Yi told me before

465
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,960
that he can only play downwind game.

466
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,720
He will try to get
as many scores as possible

467
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,320
when the game starts.

468
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,000
But when he encounters a headwind game,

469
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,920
he is unable to

470
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,840
tie the score.

471
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,880
You two must be his teammates.

472
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,520
We just gave you some free tips.

473
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
You can defeat him now.

474
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,840
Let's go.

475
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,160
Who did that?

476
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,440
Who did that?

477
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,240
Get them!

478
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,440
Stop there!

479
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,540
Stop right there!

480
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,200
Stop!

481
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,800
Stop!

482
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,160
Song Sanchuan,

483
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,920
you're not meant to be an athlete!

484
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,840
You'll never make it!

485
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,040
You'll never make it!

486
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,460
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

487
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
(Song Sanchuan,)

488
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,160
(you're not meant to be an athlete!)

489
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,280
(You'll never make it!)

490
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,500
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

491
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,640
Have you watched

492
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,200
the video of his last two games?

493
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,520
Have you noticed

494
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,360
that there is one thing in common

495
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,200
in the games he lost?

496
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,360
He lost in the opening round.

497
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
As long as he couldn't win the first round,

498
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,240
he would lose the game.

499
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,160
It was just a speculation at first,

500
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,280
but after he was eliminated

501
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,760
in the first round of game yesterday,

502
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,280
it basically confirmed my speculation.

503
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,320
He can't handle headwind game.

504
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,280
Why do you think he is like that?

505
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,320
When we were in Nanjing,

506
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,680
I talked to him tentatively once.

507
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,840
I think,

508
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,040
the stress of losing weighs
too heavily on his mind.

509
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,840
A player cannot go on the field without fear,

510
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,440
but if he's totally overcome by fear,

511
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,360
he wouldn't be able
to play as he normally does,

512
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,360
not to mention winning games.

513
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,520
This can be a rather serious issue.

514
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,280
If he can't overcome it,

515
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,960
it will be difficult for him
to get farther.

516
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,920
Do you know what causes it?

517
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,640
Have you talked to him lately?

518
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,080
(I think)

519
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,160
(you don't need to think about)

520
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
(whether you can do it.)

521
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,520
I think

522
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,920
you need to believe that we can do it.

523
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,760
Trust me.

524
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,760
I'll make your promise

525
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,880
a reality one day.

526
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,920
Here you go.

527
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,840
I said that I would carry you.

528
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Just wait

529
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,840
as I carry all trophies back to you.

530
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,680
I didn't know

531
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
so many people

532
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
were waiting to see my results.

533
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,360
That's great.

534
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
So I have to work even harder.

535
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,000
I have to work harder to win.

536
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,760
Only then

537
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
can I help you prove

538
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,760
the viability of the trainee program.

539
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,360
Song Sanchuan.

540
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,000
What's up?

541
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,400
Coach Yan told me

542
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,280
that you haven't been doing well.

543
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,600
He asked me to talk to you.

544
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll cut to the chase.

545
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,720
What's going on with you?

546
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I don't know.

547
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,560
I feel like my muscle memory

548
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,680
of losing games is back.

549
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,160
Have I been putting too much pressure

550
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,760
on you lately?

551
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,840
No. Of course not.

552
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,560
I don't know why I haven't been

553
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,360
doing well lately.

554
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
I knew the angle and power were accurate,

555
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,080
but I just couldn't serve well.

556
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,240
So was the headwind game,

557
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
I just kept messing up.

558
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,080
I will improve on it.

559
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,120
Stop practicing.

560
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,280
You are taking a three-day break.

561
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,360
Don't think about anything.

562
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,960
Give yourself a three-day break.

563
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,320
No need.

564
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,720
I can still practice.

565
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,240
I...

566
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,560
I've made up my mind.

567
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,120
I...

568
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,120
Starting now,

569
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,080
I will practice with pressure ball.

570
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,960
I will practice 0-40 shots everyday.

571
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,480
I will overcome it.

572
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm just doing what he said.

573
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,440
Hang on, Chuan,

574
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,320
we don't mind practicing with you,

575
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,400
but don't stress yourself out, okay?

576
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,160
Even Chen Zhe doesn't know what to do.

577
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,960
That's right, Chuan.

578
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,840
Don't listen to those two idiots.

579
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,760
We don't trust them.

580
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,880
Don't take it to heart.

581
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,600
That's right.

582
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,560
But they weren't wrong.

583
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,360
I can't handle headwind games.

584
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,360
Let's practice it. Really.

585
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,960
I can overcome it with more practices.

586
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,560
I'll start practicing now.

587
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,840
Come on.

588
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
Are there still balls on your side?

589
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,420
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

590
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,280
You startled me!

591
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
When did you get in?

592
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Why are you filming me?

593
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm filming a vlog.

594
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,160
A vlog like this always
gets many clicks.

595
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,840
You scared me.

596
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,960
His body is so good.

597
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,720
Serve you right.

598
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,360
No one wants you to film them.

599
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,840
Why are you taking off your shirt?

600
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
You want to film this, right?

601
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm sacrificing myself.

602
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,000
Go on. Film me now.

603
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,200
Why are you leaving?

604
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,560
Is my body not good enough?

605
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
What is she thinking?

606
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,760
Liang Tao.

607
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,320
Liang Tao.

608
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
Didn't you hear me talking to you?

609
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,440
I was asking you,

610
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,040
how's the personal vlog coming along?

611
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,640
Almost done.

612
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,760
Only Song Sanchuan is left.

613
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,560
He won't let me film him.

614
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
Just edit the current vlogs you've filmed.

615
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,040
Don't disturb his training.

616
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,120
I'm visiting the badminton team

617
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,280
this afternoon.

618
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,960
Call me if you need anything.

619
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,600
Got it.

620
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,260
(Certificate of Honor)

621
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,160
Song Sanchuan!

622
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,800
Use mine.

623
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,280
You play quite well.

624
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,120
If your performance is stable,

625
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,280
you can definitely beat him.

626
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,480
What the hell is wrong with you?

627
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,600
Where are you looking?

628
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,440
I still want to play
even if I lost in every game.

629
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,040
It's probably because
I still want to win.

630
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

631
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,360
I got held up.

632
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
It's okay.

633
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,120
Do you want

634
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,640
to talk to me about Sanchuan again?

635
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,840
Mr. Yu,

636
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,320
Song Sanchuan's performance

637
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,400
has been poor lately.

638
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,440
I always thought

639
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,200
that leaving the badminton court,

640
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,640
without 18-18,

641
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,760
he would be able to get over his issue,

642
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,520
but I now realized that

643
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,200
it isn't that the numbers that bother him.

644
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,720
As soon as Song Sanchuan

645
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,960
is exposed to adversity,

646
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,440
he won't be able

647
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,080
to hold it together under pressure.

648
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,319
As his mentor,

649
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,839
I would like to know

650
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,359
what happened to him.

651
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,920
Look.

652
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,359
We demand a good athlete

653
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,960
to be distraction-free

654
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,319
when they get on the court.

655
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,961
He should only focus on the ball.

656
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,600
He cannot think about all the things

657
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,600
that happened outside the court.

658
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
This is actually asking

659
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,279
a person to act like a deity.

660
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:42,680
Most people can't do it.

661
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,600
By looking at an athlete's

662
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,799
sports career,

663
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,960
you can also see

664
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,080
the trajectory of his life.

665
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,279
Every successful or
unsuccessful breakthrough

666
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,020
has something to do
with emotional factors.

667
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,720
Some people

668
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,760
turn emotions into motivation

669
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
to help them go further,

670
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,440
but for some people,

671
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,880
emotions become a burden

672
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,640
that weighs them down.

673
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,520
Sanchuan is the latter.

674
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,680
So I think

675
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,240
that's why he's afraid of losing.

676
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:27,160
(Ancong Wig Shop)

677
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,000
Mr. Yu is right about him.

678
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
But I think that solving

679
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,600
the current problem isn't enough

680
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,640
to resolve his issue.

681
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,640
Tong Lu is the root of the problem.

682
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,720
Uncle An,

683
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,160
after Chuan's mother left,

684
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,320
did you really never look for her again?

685
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
(Top Smash Tennis Club)
(Hi, I'm Song Sanchuan.)

686
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,040
(I'm a tennis player of Top Smash.)

687
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
(When I was 22,)

688
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,720
(I switched from professional
badminton to tennis.)

689
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,427
(Everyone said it was impossible,)

690
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:27,547
(but)

691
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:29,787
(I made it.)

692
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,667
(Once thought to be)

693
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:33,667
(an impossible
badminton-to-tennis player,)

694
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:34,587
(Song Sanchuan,)

695
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,187
(is now on the rise in his tennis career.)

696
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:39,467
(He has started)

697
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,227
(to make a name for himself in tennis)

698
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:43,747
(after winning several tournaments in a row.)

699

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,080
(Just a few years ago,)

701
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,707
(he was still a professional badminton player.)

702
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:53,787
(Since childhood,
teenager Song Sanchuan)

703
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:55,747
(has been nurtured by his mother,)

704
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,107
(with his amazing talent,)

705
00:36:57,307 --> 00:36:58,907
(he has obtained excellent results)

706
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:00,267
(in badminton competitions.)

707
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:03,227
(Many people thought)

708
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:05,307
(that he would become
an excellent national player.)

709
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:08,067
(However, because his mother
abandoned him without saying goodbye,)

710
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,147
(he suffered unimaginable grief)

711
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:14,587
(and eventually retired
from badminton with regret.)

712
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:16,787
(At the age of 22,)

713
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:19,107
(Song Sanchuan made a bold decision.)

714
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,427
(He switched to tennis.)

715
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:23,947
(With self-discipline, tenacity, and fearlessness)

716
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:25,827
(that no one else possesses,)

717
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,910
(he strives to win on the tennis court.)

718
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,070
(He just hopes that
wherever his mother is,)

719
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,830
(she can see him shining brightly on the field.)

720
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,950
Can we use this?

721
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,190
I edited it based on

722
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,630
the best feature of his transition.

723
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,270
I think the ending is good too.

724
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,830
Maybe we will be able to
find his mother with this.

725
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,270
No.

726
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,630
This is a very personal matter for him.

727
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,270
We can't upload this

728
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,590
unless he gives his consent.

729
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,310
Are you sure about this?

730
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,950
This is the story that investors love.

731
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,390
A gifted young man
who switched late.

732
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,150
If he succeeds,

733
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,270
he will become

734
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,750
the best underdog you discovered.

735
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,310
You can keep the content
about his switch,

736
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,790
but the content and photos

737
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,590
about his mother, delete all of them.

738
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,630
As for his mother,

739
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,870
I'm already helping him find her.

740
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,390

(if you want to be a champion,)

743
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,750
there is only one way to go!

744
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,710
You have to practice!

745
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,550
Practice like there is no tomorrow!

746
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,470
(Watch your racket angle, your pace,)

747
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,830
(and your movements!)

748
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,950
(In your game yesterday,)

749
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,750
(you shouldn't have)

750
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,270
(made a mistake on the shot.)

751
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,030
(The problem lies with your feet.)

752
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,350
(Split steps and lunge,)

753
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,150
(you will practice this today.)

754
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:53,543
(Practice 1,000 sets first.)

755
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,910
(Song Sanchuan,)

756
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,910
are you even playing tennis?

757
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,860
(Song Sanchuan, Li Hao)

758
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,670
Break time is over.

759
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,590
Please watch the serve clock.

760
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,190
Please watch the serve clock.

761
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,070
Please watch the serve clock.

762
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,390
Please watch the serve clock.

763
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,470
The way you look today

764
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,590
reminds me of

765
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,310
the first time I watched

766
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,790
you and Jin Yi play in the badminton court.

767
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,070
The last three balls,

768
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,790
you looked exactly the same.

769
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,070
I knew it then,

770
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,270
you can't play anymore.

771
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,910
I'm sorry.

772
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,270
I requested a forfeit for the next game

773
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,136
