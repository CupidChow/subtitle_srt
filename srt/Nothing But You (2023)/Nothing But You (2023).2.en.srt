=Episode 2=

3
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,740
(You moved me)

4
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,820
(with your resolution.)

5
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
How did you find me?

6
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
The Young Space logo

7
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,079
is all over the arena.

8
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm not blind.

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
That's not my question.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,320
How do you know my name?

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,320
There was a name tag
you wore around your neck.

12
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,320
It's a lovely name.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,240
That's why I remember.

14
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,600
Did you

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
wait two hours

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
to compliment me on my name?

17
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
The mannequin that fell off

18
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
the marathon day

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,600
wasn't an advertising mannequin, right?

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,760
What do you mean?

21
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,800
We have

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,720
issued a statement.

23
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,440
I ran across the street corner.

24
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,440
There wasn't any advertising space.

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,400
A rewind of the security footage

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,920
will prove

27
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,880
that your statement

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,840
is invalid.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,640
What are you looking for?

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
A deal?

31
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
Who do you think I am?

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,520
I just wasted

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,480
two hours of my day.

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
I take back what I just said.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,760
I apologize.

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,760
I'm genuinely sorry.

38
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,160
If it's not what I thought,

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,840
the reason you waited long...

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
The wig

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
should come from my shop.

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,480
It looks like a big company
from the outside

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,640
but turns out
to be one man one cell too.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,960
What you refer to

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,520
is a columbarium.

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
This is an office seating arrangement.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Are you a student?

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,200
I work.

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
What business are you in?

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
Not like you, anyway.

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
I don't stay in a cell.

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,020
(TL)

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,760
I knew it.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,720
TL.

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
This belongs to my shop.

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,400
If you want,

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,680
I can ask my family

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,920
to check when and

59
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,960
to whom it was sold.

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Can I

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,280
go directly?

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,280
It's okay.

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
I'll let you go.

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
I can go by myself.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,520
You waited so long for me today

67
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,280
because of this,

68
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
but I

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,080
said those words to you.

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Like what?

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Do you mean your frank opinion?

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,840
You can tell I need money

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
from yesterday's marathon.

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
So you thought

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
I was here to blackmail you.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
That's what you thought, right?

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,400
You...

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
You don't have to be so straightforward.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,440
Typically,

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not a busybody.

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
But I paid you back

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,240
because of the 2,000 yuan.

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,320
I don't like being in debt to anyone.

84
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,840
I saw you picking up speed

85
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
during the half-marathon yesterday.

86
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
(The moment you ran forward,)

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
did you ever think
that you would lose money?

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
Yes,

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,320
but I still found them annoying.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
I couldn't bear it.

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
It's strange.

92
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
You moved me

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
with your resolution.

94
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
Is this why you didn't deduct my money?

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
One

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,160
should be kind

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
if it is possible.

98
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,160
That's when

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,440
good karma comes.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm blessed

101
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,760
to have you here today.

102
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Can I add you

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,280
on WeChat?

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,640
You can send me the address.

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
I'll scan your QR code.

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,480
Okay.

107
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,720
(Song Sanchuan)

108
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,280
Song Sanchuan?

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,720
Your name is unique.

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,520
Well...

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
Don't bother yourself.

112
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,560
There is no reason

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,760
for me to quit now.

114
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
I'll take you to the shop.

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,520
Let's get it

116
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
done today.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,800
It's the junction ahead.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
Cars cannot pass through.

119
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,280
We have to walk.

120
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,120
Just stop there.

121
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,480
Your wig shop is here,

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,000
right?

123
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,880
Yes.

124
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,640
This place is near the hospital.

125
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,240
(Traditional Chinese Medicine,
Tuina, and Acupuncture)

126
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,120
More customers.

127
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,280
(Ancong Wig Shop)

128
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,960
She is Young Space...

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
You must be Chuan's friend.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,880
Hello, my name is Liang You'an.

131
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
I can tell she is not our customer.

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,360
A florid face and refreshing look.

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
The most important thing
is that your hair is real.

134
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
You're a master.

135
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,520
Girl.

136
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Let me know if you want to

137
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,840
get a buzz cut.

138
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,600
Snip, snip,

139
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,200
go the scissors.

140
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
I'll take it at the highest price.

141
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
Enough said.

142
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
You already have a room full of wigs.

143
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
Leave her alone.

144
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,640
He is...?

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,120
An Cong.

146
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm his father.

147
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,440
Don't call me uncle.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Just call me An Cong.
It sounds friendly.

149
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,240
All right.

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,120
By the way...

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
The wig.

152
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,840
I would like you

153
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,280
to check the wig.

154
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
Hey!

155
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,920
What is this?

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,480
Why didn't you tell the truth

157
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,560
when I asked you the other day?

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
You just showed me

159
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,320
a press shot.

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,200
It's certainly not good news.

161
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,880
Why should I admit it?

162
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,520
Come on.

163
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
She is in a hurry.

164
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,960
Check it out.

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
Girl, don't worry.

166
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,120
I'll check it out for you.

167
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
Thank you.

168
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
Well.

169
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
Here is the number.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,000
Got it.

171
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
It really came from me.

172
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,200
Last week.

173
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
The buyer was a man.

174
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
I remember him.

175
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,880
He was not a patient.

176
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,600
I remember

177
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
it was dinner time.

178
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,680
About six o'clock.

179
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,680
Is your shop
equipped with surveillance cameras?

180
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,800
I have no such thing.

181
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,040
Look.

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,040
It's a room full of things like this.

183
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,920
It's pretty creepy to capture.

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Are you using Alipay

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,640
or WeChat for payment?

186
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Can I have a look at the records?

187
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
You're smart, girl.

188
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
Alipay.

189
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
It's usually Alipay.

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,480
It should be this. Have a look.

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,860
(Transaction Details)

192
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Can I make a phone call?

193
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
Go ahead.

194
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
Thank you.

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,560
(Hi, my employee number is 580.)

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,920
(How may I assist you?)

197
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Hi.

198
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
This is Ancong Wig Shop calling.

199
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,560
We have a problem

200
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,400
with a transaction.

201
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,240
Can you ask the payer

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,920
to call us back

203
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
as soon as possible?

204
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,520
(All right.)

205
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Okay, thank you.

206
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,160
I will submit

207
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
the order information online.

208
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,440
(Ancong Wig Shop)

209
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
Put it on my tab.

210
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,120
Sure.

211
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
Thank you.

212
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,120
Your father looks young.

213
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,160
My surname is Song,
and his surname is An.

214
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Do you think we are father and son?

215
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,360
Do you think David Ma

216
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,080
will call us back?

217
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
It will be easier if he calls back.

218
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,159
If he doesn't,

219
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,080
I have got something lined up.

220
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
Hey,

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,960
treat your wound.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,240
Otherwise, it will be infected.

223
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,480
Give it to me.

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,760
Thank you.

225
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
May I

226
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,960
know

227
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,880
what you did with the money you earned

228
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
running the marathon that day?

229
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,680
Eat, drink, and play.

230
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,160
I spent it in an instant.

231
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Blame me.

232
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
I should have docked the pay.

233
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,080
An.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
Hello, is this Mr. Ma?

235
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,480
(Who are you?)

236
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,080
This is calling from

237
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,160
Ancong Wig Shop.

238
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
You bought a wig

239
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
from me last week, right?

240
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
(Yes, what's the matter?)

241
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,080
Well.

242
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,680
The manufacturer just contacted me

243
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,920
saying that there is a problem
with that batch of products.

244
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,160
I contact you

245
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,080
immediately

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,360
to send you a replacement.

247
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,480
Can you

248
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,200
leave me an address?

249
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
- Later...
- (No need).

250
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,920
(Stop calling me.)

251
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
He...

252
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
We lose the connection.

253
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,440
It's good enough.

254
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,920
Good enough?

255
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
This call is made from

256
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,040
Young Space's landline.

257
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
You have a mole.

258
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,800
Just wait until

259
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,240
I get to the bottom of it.

260
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,040
Then I can do a handover.

261
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,720
You did me

262
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,000
a great favor.

263
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,560
If you have time,

264
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,880
let me treat you to dinner

265
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,520
as a token of appreciation.

266
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,480
It's okay.

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,680
I'm helping you

268
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,760
so that we're even.

269
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,800
Don't worry.

270
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,160
Don't feel bad

271
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,720
for deleting each other's contact

272
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,560
after going back.

273
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,960
All right.

274
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,760
Let's say goodbye.

275
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,960
Just help me...

276
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,800
It's okay.

277
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,800
Let me walk you out.

278
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
This street is full of people.

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,400
What are you doing?

280
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
What?

281
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
My sister

282
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
bought a wig

283
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,360
from your shop.

284
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,520
Now she's gone.

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,360
Be sensible

286
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
and return the money.

287
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,040
Otherwise,

288
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,160
your shop will be closed.

289
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,920
Hey, you have to be reasonable.

290
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,520
Don't you?

291
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,480
Your sister's death

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,680
has nothing to do

293
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,520
with her buying a wig here.

294
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,000
It cannot be refunded.

295
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,840
Can't be refunded?

296
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,080
You see.

297
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,200
This is a rip-off.

298
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,680
The owner is evil-hearted.

299
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,160
He is defrauding cancer patients

300
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,120
of their life-saving money.

301
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
This shop should have closed.

302
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,080
Smash the place up!

303
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,200
You can't do this.

304
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,840
Get off!

305
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,120
Smash!

306
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,920
Who are you?

307
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,600
Are you all right?

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
This is your sister, right?

309
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,120
Put the lid on. Respect the dead.

310
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,280
To hell with it!

312
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
without a bag?

313
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,320
Do you know?

314
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
At this concentration,

315
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,600
flour in the air

316
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,280
becomes explosive.

317
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,600
Would you like to try it?

318
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,440
Let me tell you one more time.

319
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,040
We're not going

320
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,720
to sell or move our shop.

321
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,360
If you come next time,

322
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
I can't guarantee
who will be in the box.

323
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,960
Get out.

324
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,800
Get out!

325
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,360
Excuse me.

326
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,760
Go away.

327
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,720
Uncle Dahui, why are you here?

328
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,960
Watch your shop.

329
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,760
Go away!

330
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
Let's go.

331
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
Are you mad?

332
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,680
What if it really exploded?

333
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
Don't!

334
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
I was bluffing them.

335
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,920
They were trying
to screw up your business

336
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
to get the shop.

337
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,840
Are you sure you don't want to move?

338
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,160
Yes.

339
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,640
Mr. Jie, I got it.

347
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
It's not our competitor.

348
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,880
It's Mr. Gao.

349
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,320
We have the suspect.

350
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,800
(Transaction Details)
It's an employee of the sales team.

351
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,960
(Young Space's Employee Profile)
He chose

352
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
a small wig shop

353
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,080
opposite the cancer center.

354
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160

355

that it was a perfect plan.

Why did you shred it?

Do you think this information

359
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,960
can bring down Gao Li?

360
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
You heard it

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
in the meeting.

the mannequin incident at all.

365

Besides, Gao Li is his cousin.

366
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,240
He can excuse himself

367
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,440
by saying that

368
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,040
this thing was done by his men

369
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
and got nothing to do with him.

370
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,520
Not only can I not bring him down,

371
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
but I may also give away my plans.

Mr. Jie.

388
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,680
I know I've told you

389
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,440
many times over the past six months.

390
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
But all you've done

391
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,360
is changing the topic

392
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
and asking me to wait.

393
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,760
I don't know

394
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,240
how many projects

395
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
I have to work on

396
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,720
until the time comes.

397
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
Back then,

398
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,120
you were sitting

399
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,320
in this office

400
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,800
talking to me about my career plans.

401
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,520
You promised

402
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,160
to transfer me
to the marketing department

403
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,600
to be a project manager

404
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,640
after an Olympic cycle.

405
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
I trust you.

406
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,920
Am I the only one

407
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
who takes you

408
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,040
at your word?

409
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,040
You'an.

410
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,319
Why would you think that?

411
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,079
I don't understand.

412
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,920
What's wrong with

413
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,599
being an executive assistant?

414
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,280
Why won't you accept it?

415
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,079
Mr. Jie.

416
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,200
After I graduated, I went back to China
and joined Young Space.

417
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,680
Everyone in my age

418
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,760
has a

419
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,560
clear path to promotion.

420
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,120
But not me.

421
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
I haven't had a good night's sleep

422
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,280
for more than half a month.

423
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,680
And what?

424
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,320
My effort

425
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,120
is something

426
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,440
you can carelessly put in the shredder.

427
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,640
This is what

428
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,920
I've been doing
for four and a half years.

429
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm constantly on edge.

430
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm always on call.

431
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
I do what you want me to do.

432
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,120
I feel like I'm living the same day.

433
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
I feel tired.

434
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
There is no growth.

435
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,560
You'an, I'm really disappointed

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
with your words.

437
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
You're always close to me.

438
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
You have more learning opportunities

439
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,480
and access to resources

440
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,320
than anyone else.

441
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,040
Why do you feel like

442
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
you are not growing?

443
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,240
I understand.

444
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,600
There is a lot of big projects recently.

445
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
You're exhausted.

446
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
I understand

447
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,280
your frustration.

448
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,680
It's okay.

449
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,520
There's one thing

450
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
I've overlooked.

451
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
Have you not received

452
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,680
a pay raise in a long time?

453
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
I'll notify the HR department

454
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,760
to give you a raise.

455
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Also,

456
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,720
I will add your name

457
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
to the next project

458
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,600
to improve your performance.

459
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,520
This

460
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,920
will make your transition

461
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,800
into business

462
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
easier.

463
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,360
I guess we're cool now.

464
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,760
I have another meeting.

465
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,400
Have a good rest.

466
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,840
If not,
you can also take half a month off.

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720
Can you take me in for a moment?

468
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,440
Come in.

469
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,520
Is Luo Le asleep?

470
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,120
She went to bed early.

471
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,680
There's no drunk food at home.

472
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,840
This will do.

473
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
Jiang Jie

474
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
put my internal job transfer letter

475
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,560
into the shredder

476
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,040
in front of me today.

477
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,700
(Marketing Department Entry Application,
Name: Liang You'an)

478
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,700
(Marketing Department Entry Application,
Name: Liang You'an)

479
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,480
(The first day I joined the company,)

480
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,920
(they told me that a woman's)

481
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,880
(ultimate goal in the workplace)

482
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
(is to transcend gender.)

483
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,920
In the workplace, there are

484
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,040
injustices,

485
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,840
prejudices, and harassment
towards women.

486
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,640
So try to

487
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,080
make your work

488
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,880
worth more than your gender.

489
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,560
After all, working relationships

490
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
are more stable

491
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,320
than interpersonal relationships.

492
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,600
Therefore,

493
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,360
from the first day

494
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,400
I joined the company as an EA,

495
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
I pushed myself

496
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,720
to be responsible for everything
and be on call 24/7.

497
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
I strove to make me

498
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,960
indispensable to my boss

499
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,880
in all business matters.

500
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,960
Now, I admit

501
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,120
that I was wrong.

502
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
If your boss can't do without you,

503
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
you can never leave him.

504
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,120
You're right.

505
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,760
If I trained a handy,

506
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,680
loyal, and hardworking assistant,

507
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,120
I wouldn't let go of her too.

508
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Why don't you resign?

509
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,920
You are so good.

510
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,080
Why don't you change your job?

511
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,960
I'm in a

512
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,160
terrible predicament.

513
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,360
If I'm going
to change my employer or job,

514
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,640
do I have any experience
in team management

515
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,880
or project management?

516
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,680
If my boss doesn't sign,

517
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,200
I don't even have

518
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,720
a recommendation letter.

519
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,960
In general,

520
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,800
I should ask you

521
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,080
to divert your attention.

522
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,240
Even if you can't excel in your career,

523
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,280
you can fall in love.

524
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,520
But look at me.

525
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,040
I fear divine retribution

526
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,320
if I encourage you to pursue love.

527
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,640
Your love is not worthless.

528
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,760
You get a

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,400
cute little girl.

530
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
Luckily we have Luo Le.

531
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,720
Exactly.

532
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,760
Therefore,

533
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,760
don't be too hard on yourself.

534
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,960
I think it's not yet time.

535
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,360
You express

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,320
your regrets

537
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,320
because you have been holding back.

538
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,120
One day,

539
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,840
when you make up your mind,

540
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,560
I know

541
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,440
you will act without hesitation.

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
Tell me if you are itchy.

546
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
I'll scratch again.

No extra charge.

Who is that girl today?

549
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,920
I had never seen her before.

550
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,040
A nobody.

551
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,880
Come on.

she's older than you.

Chuan.

555
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
You need to

556
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,240
pay attention to your personal matter.

557
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,480
Stop hanging out with the bachelors.

You are a pretty good boy.

It will be a shame
if you stay single forever.

560
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,960
Catch this.

561
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,400
Worry about yourself.

567
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,560
I have an idea.

568
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,280
As long as you find a girlfriend,

or something else?

579
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm not leaving.

580
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Hey, An Cong.

581
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't lie to yourself.

582
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,080
Answer me.

583
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,680
It has been seven years!

584
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,040
Do you believe she will come back?

585
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,120
No one even knows if she's alive.

586
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,320
You stay in such a dilapidated shop

587
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,640
and wait for

588
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,040
someone who will never return.

589
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
An Cong, you...

590
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800

(of many people.)

608
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,920
(As if the crisis of turning 30)

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,440

Liang You'an, you are miserable.

635
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,800
Are there a lot of dining spots?

636
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,960
Just one or two.

637
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,440
Mr. Jie.

638
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
I think she needs no introduction.

639
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,240
The number one headhunter

640
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,360
and the number one beauty
in sport, Alex.

641
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,200
This is my assistant, Liang You'an.

643
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,280
She will follow up on our projects

644
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,040
in the future.

645
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,960
Hi.

646
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,160
Just call me An.

647
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,080
Can I add you

648
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,360
on WeChat?

649
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,560
Sure.

650
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,160
Okay, thanks.

651
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,960
Mr. Jie, the car is here.

652
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,920
Okay.

653
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,600
I didn't drink much today.

654
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,600
Next time,

655
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I'll find a place

656
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,160
for us to drink.

657
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm a heavy drinker

658
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
if I'm not working.

659
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,080
I'll see you out.

660
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,760
Mr. Jie, it's raining outside.

661
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,720
This way.

662
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,520
All right.

663
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
You don't need to

664
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,640
hold the umbrella all the time.

665
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,360
Sometimes observation

666
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,440
matters more than action.

667
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,600
Got it, senior.

668
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Do you have an umbrella?

669
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,400
No.

670
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,560
Let's get soaked in the rain.

671
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,120
Young Space is doing well

672
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
by playing safe

673
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,600
all these years,

674
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,280
but it hits a development bottleneck.

675
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,800
Emerging sports brands are now

676
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
grabbing market share.

677
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,720
The specialization of sporting goods

678
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,880
is an inevitable trend.

679
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,360
Therefore,

680
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,880
when the domestic market segmentation

681
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,720
is still not distinct,

682
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,680
Young Space

683
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,160
must seize the opportunity.

684
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,960
It's time to launch

685
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
the Underdog Project.

686
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,720
Do you still want

687
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,360
to start with badminton?

688
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,120
That's right.

689
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,240
Alex is recognized
as the best headhunter

690
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,480
in the industry.

691
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,800
As long as we

692
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,240
sew the deal up with her,

693
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,240
we won't have to worry

694
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,160
about finding suitable candidates.

695
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,400
I called you here today

696
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,760
because I want you

697
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,720
to be in charge of this project.

698
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,520
I promise,

699
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,280
I'll transfer you

700
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,160
after completing this project.

701
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,680
All right, go and get some rest.

702
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
Ask Zhang to give you a ride.

703
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
Thank you, Mr. Jie.

704
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,480
Thank you, Mr. Jie.

705
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,280
Ms. You'an.

706
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,240
Is the Underdog Project

707
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,480
really a big deal?

708
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,680
Underdog.

709
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
Let's take a well-known example.

710
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,640
It was

711
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,800
the commercial partnership

712
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,720
between Under Armour and Steph Curry.

713
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,960
At that time,
Curry was not favored by the industry

714
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,280
due to constant injury problems.

715
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,200
Under Armour

716
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,960
made a bet on him

717
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,520
at a relatively low price.

718
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,800
It gave Curry constant attention
and companionship

719
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,800
until he became a top

720
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
basketball international player.

721
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,720
After that, the sales of Under Armour

722
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,600
has been soaring.

723
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
This is the project

724
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,200
the boss has been trying to push on.

725
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,240
Select potential athletes

726
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,160
to endorse Young Space's products.

727
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,320
As long as

728
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,880
one of these three areas is successful,

729
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,760
it will support his proposal

730
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,480
to shrink

731
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,880
the production line.

732
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
In that case,

733
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,600
this is

734
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,920
a valuable chip for us

735
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,160
to compete against Mr. Gao.

736
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,440
Isn't that a good thing?

737
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,960
Why do you give me that look?

738
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,320
Looking for potential players

739
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,440
and preparing them to be sports stars

740
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,320
is

741
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,400
a long way.

742
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,000
Job transfer sounds as distant as ever.

743
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,640
No.

744
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,200
Not only Mr. Jie,

745
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
I also won't let you go.

746
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,260
(Shenzhen Xinyi Sports Training Base)

747
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,000
Song Sanchuan.

748
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,760
You came so early.

749
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,880
Did you clean the court?

750
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,040
Did you set up the net?

751
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,880
Too loose.

752
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,600
What's the matter with you?

753
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,040
Song Sanchuan, what are you doing?

754
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't be rude to Chuan.

755
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,040
Song Sanchuan.

756
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,640
I have discussed with Coach Yu about

757
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,680
the provincial team competition
next month.

758
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,880
Wang Xu and Lele will participate.

759
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,600
- Thank you, Yi.
- Thank you, Yi.

760
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,480
- We will do our best
- We will do our best

761
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,200
- to live up to your expectations.
- to live up to your expectations.

762
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Well,

763
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,360
any objection?

764
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,680
Let's play.

765
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,440
What's the advice Alex gave you?

766
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,760
She only said

767
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
there's a hidden talent here.

768
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,800
Given time,

769
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,960
his day will come.

770
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,920
Name?

771
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,480
She didn't mention it.

772
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,800
As it's her first time

773
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
working with us,

774
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
I think she wants to see if we

775
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,960
have the insight

776
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,760
to recognize the underdog.

777
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,440
I've spoken

778
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,719
to the coach.

779
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,120
Today is their open training day.

780
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,639
Most of them will be here.

781
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,920
Is Alex coming?

782
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,400
I think she's too eye-catching

783
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,280
after being here

784
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,120
many times.

785
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,960
If she comes,

786
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,239
the kids know who she is.

787
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,960
That's why I didn't ask her to come.

788
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,150
(Xinyi Sports)

789
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,040
Come with me.

790
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,639
From here,

791
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,480
you can see the entire training ground.

792
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,679
We call this the "observatory."

793
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:30,120
There are a total
of ten training grounds.

794
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
The team is composed of

795
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,159
a total of 22 athletes,

796
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,120
be it senior or junior,

797
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,159
men or women.

798
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,000
The team

799
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,679
has performed well
over the past few years.

800
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,000
We have won many championships

801
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,199
in the country.

802
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,360
There are many budding players here.

803
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,720
See for yourself.

804
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,200
Can I take pictures?

805
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,960
Yes.

806
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,480
Song Sanchuan.

807
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,080
(So he's a badminton player.)

808
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,280
What do you want?

809
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,280
Let's play doubles today.

810
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
We haven't practiced for a long time.

811
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,120
Wang Xu and Lele,

812
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,560
you are a team.

813
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
We pair up.

814
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
You think I suck, right?

815
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Stand in front.

816
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,240
All right.

817
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,480
I'll be your training partner today.

818
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,080
What are you doing?

819
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,800
I was helping you
to defend the rear court.

820
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
No need.

821
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,160
You said you don't need me.

822
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,560
Passive attitude.

823
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,560
Uncooperative.

824
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,800
You break two taboos of the team!

825
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,720
Fine.

826
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,000
No more practice today.

827
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Let's go one-on-one.

828
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,720
Sure.

829
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,840
What's wrong with him?
He is aggressive.

830
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,040
Who knows?

831
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,320
Which one is it?

832
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,400
The one in the red training suit

833
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,000
is called Jin Yi, right?

834
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,640
This is his profile.

835
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,880
From what I understand,

836
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,160
he's had an excellent year

837
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,880
with the team.

838
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,480
He outshines others.

839
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,240
He came to Xinyi

840
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,520
two years ago.

841
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,880
He has won many championships

842
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,040
in the country.

843
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,240
We believe
he will be the next big thing.

844
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,480
A few years ago,

845
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
he suffered from illness

846
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
before a major competition.

847
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,440
That's why he failed to shine
in the competition,

848
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,480
and his fame didn't spread.

849
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,520
Nevertheless,

850
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
he is in form this year.

851
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,760
Many badminton players

852
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,800
are late bloomers.

853
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
He will make it

854
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,680
in this year's competition.

855
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,520
His opposing player

856
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,240
is pretty good.

857
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,200
Mr. Yu.

858
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,240
The profile of the opposing player

859
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,360
is not in the information

860
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
you sent me.

861
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,760
This boy

862
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,040
is called Song Sanchuan.

863
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,440
He is

864
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,160
a gifted athlete.

865
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,400
He has won

866
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,240
many championships

867
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,440
in previous competitions.

868
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,800
He once had no rivals.

869
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
But then,

870
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,640
he suddenly went out of whack.

871
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,160
That's not to say he is out of whack.

872
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,160
He is a bit off form.

873
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,280
Up and down.

874
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,960
As coaches,

875
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
the quality doesn't worry us.

876
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,880
But we are afraid of erratic players.

877
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,040
No one dares to choose such a player

878
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
when there's a big game.

879
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,200
That's why

880
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,160
I didn't give you

881
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,680
his information.

882
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,040
Yi, the best is yet to come.

883
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Song Sanchuan.

884
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,840
It's been a long time

885
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,000
since I saw you
with a lot of fight in you.

886
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,680
Wow, Chuan,

887
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,080
you have 18 points.

888
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
18 to 17.

889
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,720
18 to 18. It's a tie.
