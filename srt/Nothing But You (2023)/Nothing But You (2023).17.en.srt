3
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,000
(Will She Open Her Heart One Day?)

4
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:10,722
She slept?

5
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:12,442
She slept.

6
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,320
She might wake up crying again later.

7
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,760
Look at me.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Why did I take my emotions

9
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
out on my child?

10
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
Don't be too hard on yourself, alright?

11
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,000
Anyone who sees that

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
will get angry anyway.

13
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,400
Also,

14
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
you've been so busy recently.

15
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
You're already on your toes.

16
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,280
Normally you aren't like that too.

17
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,440
You know,

18
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,280
all the parenting books

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,480
will have one line.

20
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,080
An emotionally stable mother

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,760
is a good mother.

22
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Those words that were written there

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,520
help with nothing

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
other than adding to

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,480
your guilt and remorse.

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,840
Anyone who's read that

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
will feel that they have been

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
a failed mother.

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Don't read any more then.

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,400
Don't read that again.

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,440
Luo Nian,

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
you're the best mother

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,920
that I've ever met.

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm serious.

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,080
Look, you're raising Luo Le alone,

36
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,640
yet she grew up to be

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,480
so optimistic, sensible, and brave.

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,560
You're the one who gave her all these.

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,760
It's just so difficult.

40
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,320
Like,

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,840
raising a child alone

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,160
is much harder than I thought.

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,640
You know,

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,160
these few days,

45
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,200
I turned down some business trips.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,840
Then I lost this customer.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
But I don't want to travel.

48
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
I don't want to see

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,480
my daughter to suffer in others' hands.

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,440
My child is,

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
as you said,

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
very sensible.

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,880
When she misses me,

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
she won't tell me,

55
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,640
for she's afraid that I'll be sad too.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
(Jiang Jiaojiao is playing)

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
(Zhang Yan)
(a ranking tournament tomorrow.)

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
(You should come and have a look.)

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
(There's something wrong with him.)

60
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,380
(The 6th "Soaring Cup" Tennis Tournament)

61
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,920
This opponent played

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,520
with Jiao last month.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,400
In principle,

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
Jiao is a sure win.

65
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
This is all your fault.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,960
My fault?

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,280
Yes.

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Since you last

69
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,320
told him clearly that

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,560
he has to get into the top 100,

71
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,560
he has lost five games in a row.

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
So it's all your fault.

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,320
You gave him too much pressure,

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
and now you broke his spirit.

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,200
That shouldn't happen.

76
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
He's also not the kind

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,360
to perform well under pressure.

78
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,920
He's still a child after all.

79
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,400
It's normal to have ups and downs.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,400
Did you also tell him that

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,000
when the club becomes A-ranked,

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,360
it will be able to leave the
"crown prince tennis club"

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,160
name behind?

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
When he feels this sense of urgency,

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
he forgets all his techniques.

86
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,280
Why don't we

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,880
arrange counselling for him?

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,040
No need for that.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,520
We can just bluff him.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
We shouldn't.

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,520
We'll give it a try.

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,160
Why? You lost a game again?

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Say,

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,240
am I done for?

95
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll never win a game again.

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
Right now, if I see the tournament date

97
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,920
popping up in our group

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,880
with my name and number of matches,

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
I will feel very unsettled.

100
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,400
Right now, when you

101
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,080
set foot on the pitch,

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
do you feel that

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
the sun gets in your eyes,

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,440
the wind is coming towards you?

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Your opponent stands so tall,

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,800
yet you're so short.

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,720
Every ball that you hit

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
expends the whole of your energy,

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,880
yet once it's over the net,

110
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,560
the projectile just flops and loses its force?

111
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
When you're on the pitch,

112
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,040
after two rounds of service, you feel:

113
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,840
"That's it."

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,640
"I'm definitely losing today."

115
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,400
You look at the ground,

116
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
you see holes everywhere.

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,160
You sway around,

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
and nothing seems to go right.

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
You're a fellow patient too?

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,560
Worst of all,

121
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,600
this sport that we're in,

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
you can't get it over with quickly.

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
When you lose,

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,040
it can go on for two hours.

125
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,560
In these two hours,

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,240
every minute is torturing.

127
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,360
You feel that you're so incompetent.

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes.

129
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,360
Like you're trash.

130
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,360
Then a sort of muscle memory forms.

131
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
In the end, it loops into

132
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,080
a cycle of fear and desperation.

133
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,920
You've described my situation perfectly,

134
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,800
but there's no solution to that.

135
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,720
How did you recover from that?

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,480
There's no solution.

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,480
You can only keep on losing

138
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,240
and losing until you get a win.

139
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
When you win,

140
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
everything will be fine again.

141
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Your words are not helping.

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,440
Your situation is not uncommon.

143
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,920
If you want to be

144
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,200
a professional player at the top,

145
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,160
you have to get over this hurdle.

146
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
I sort of believe what Liang You'an said.

147
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,360
You are indeed an excellent
professional player.

148
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,520
However, not everyone is as mad as you.

149
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,800
When you played badminton,

150
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,840
were you this crazy too?

151
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
For real, dude,

152
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,360
when you caught that ball barehanded,

153
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
I couldn't believe my eyes.

154
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,800
When I used to play badminton,

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,640
I was quite ruthless too.

156
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,800
But if you ask me,

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
I think

158
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,200
it's a little different from playing tennis.

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
What's the difference?

160
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,360
Wait. We were talking about you,

161
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,720
how did we start talking about me?

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
Anyway, I don't care.

163
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,920
You have to promise me that

164
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm on my way to becoming stronger,

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
not heading for doom.

166
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
I can't promise you that,

167
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,280
but this is a trick that I use.

168
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
If you really can't get over this hurdle,

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,880
just do what I did.

170
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,400
What?

171
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,160
Switch fields.

172
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,040
If you switch to playing badminton,

173
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,120
I'll be here to teach you.

174
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,560
No way, Chuan.

175
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,240
Since young, I've been switching from ping-pong

176
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,960
to football to basketball to tennis.

177
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,040
I can't switch no more.

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,360
Both of you went to the same university?

179
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,280
Yes, we're from SSU.

180
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,240
She did management and economics,

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
I studied nutritional science.

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
We always had been dormitory mates.

183
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
I heard that you have a player

184
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,200
who's not doing well.

185
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,840
His faltering might need some

186
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,960
technical support, right?

187
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,920
Yes.

188
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
I came to know that

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,640
some of the top tennis players

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
can be spiritually dependent

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,800
on the drinks

192
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,680
specially made by their nutritionists.

193
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
Before they play,

194
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
they'll drink it.

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,040
This would help them

196
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,960
improve their performance.

197
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,800
I told Liang You'an about this,

198
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,840
I said maybe we can try this out.

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
Put it this way.

200
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,040
In recent years,

201
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
sports nutrition

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
is getting acknowledged by more

203
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,040
professional players.

204
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,520
They are taking scientific diets

205
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,560
and energy supplements seriously now.

206
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,760
If you are simply

207
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,680
assuming that these drinks

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,960
only provide spiritual support,

209
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
you might be underestimating

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,280
what we as nutritionists can do.

211
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
We won't know until

212
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,720
we test it, right?

213
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
As long as their confidence levels

214
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,840
can be raised,

215
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,800
we'll give it a try.

216
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,000
I am a registered nutritionist,

217
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,960
and I also hold a meal-preparation

218
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
professional qualification certificate.

219
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
I have been a sports nutritionist

220
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,000
and personal nutritionist

221
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,000
for eight years.

222
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,760
So you can rest assured that

223
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
I am a professional.

224
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,520
Well,

225
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
let Jiang Jiaojiao try.

226
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,760
Your energy drink really works.

227
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,680
I did add in some customised nutrients

228
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,360
to suit his consumption,

229
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,200
but not like there will be

230
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
immediate effects.

231
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,200
In fact, Zhang Yan is right.

232
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,880
Sometimes,

233
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,360
athletes need these

234
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,040
supplements to boost their confidence.

235
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,880
Why did you talk back to him that day?

236
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,600
He was the impolite one at first.

237
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm not letting him get his way.

238
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,960
We'll continue the game.

239
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
Both players please return to the field.

240
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,400
That's a good one!

241
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,560
Awesome.

242
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,600
Come on!

243
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
Yeah!

244
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,600
It's good that we won.

245
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
A win makes everyone happy.

246
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,560
Thank you for the energy drink.

247
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
The help was timely.

248
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,600
It's nothing.

249
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,840
Sports science is trending right now.

250
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,000
Sure it is.

251
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,720
Liang You'an,

252
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,800
our organisational structure

253
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,320
needs a nutritionist.

254
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,240
You have this good friend here,

255
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,160
aren't you going to ask her to join us

256
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,920
and help us out?

257
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,600
You're hiring?

258
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,200
Why didn't you tell me that?

259
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,600
Actually, a while ago,

260
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,360
when you told me that

261
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,000
there were problems with your caretaker,

262
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
I fell into a dilemma for you said

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
you no longer wanted to travel.

264
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,280
Why don't you tell me then?

265
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
Honestly,

266
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,400
will this club

267
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,360
get ranked an A,

268
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,760
start to make a profit

269
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,040
or become a prestigious club?

270
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,320
No one knows.

271
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
You're so busy at work,

272
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,240
yet you do such a good job.

273
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,760
How dare I get you to come

274
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,360
and work at this lowly place?

275
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,120
So I thought

276
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
when there are more commercial members

277
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,680
and I am able to offer a decent salary,

278
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,080
then will I invite you to come.

279
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,440
I guess you only think of me

280
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,000
as someone who shares

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,280
only weal instead of woes.

282
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
Not at all.

283
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,640
I know

284
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,040
if I were to ask you to come,

285
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,560
you will never say no.

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,640
That's why I find it difficult
to make this request.

287
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,580
You're a sally girl.

288
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,720
What now?

289
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,320
Do you want me to come?

290
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
I can start anytime.

291
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,480
Sure.

292
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,440
Nian,

293
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
thank you for coming over to help me.

294
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm the one who should thank you

295
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,200
on behalf of my daughter.

296
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,280
Oh,

297
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,160
I brought you a box of vitamins.

298
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,920
You're so busy with work,

299
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,680
you must remember to take it.

300
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,920
You have to be well-nourished

301
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,600
for your body to keep up with your work, okay?

302
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,320
You definitely owe me from a past life.

303
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,160
Why are you so good to me?

304
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,120
Do you know what winning feels like now?

305
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,320
The sun is not in my eyes anymore,

306
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
the wind is not blowing my way.

307
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
I'll just beat the opponent real good,

308
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
and it's a done job.

309
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,080
Goodness,

310
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,560
one game and you're getting arrogant.

311
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,120
Thanks.

312
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
I know that you were consoling me that day.

313
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,560
You know,

314
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,320
you asked me that day

315
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
about the difference between

316
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
playing badminton then and playing tennis now.

317
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,200
I got home and

318
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,200
really thought about it.

319
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,800
Well,

320
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,040
when I was doing badminton training,

321
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,000
I worked hard too,

322
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,480
but only until the coach says

323
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,040
that's enough.

324
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,000
Playing tennis now, when doing volleys,

325
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,520
all I think of is

326
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,320
getting closer to the ball.

327
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,920
Just a little closer.

328
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,360
A little closer.

329
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,800
A little closer.

330
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,560
Closer.

331
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,200
Till I can reach out and grab it.

332
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,680
It's that drive

333
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,880
from the bottom of my heart,

334
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,320
to want to get stronger.

335
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,280
That felt really good.

336
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,800
I understand it now.

337
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,000
When you played badminton,

338
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,480
it was like fulfilling

339
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,160
the responsibilities in a marriage.

340
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,600
When you play tennis,

341
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,680
that's when you are free to love

342
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,720
and can go crazy.

343
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,600
Wow you summarised it pretty well.

344
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm just saying how it is.

345
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,680
The energy drink given by Ms. Liang

346
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,680
today really worked.

347
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,960
After drinking it, I was energetic.

348
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,880
For real?

349
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,200
What?

350
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
It's alright,

351
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,520
but the colour...

352
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
seems strange.

353
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,120
What's wrong with the color?

354
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,160
Looks fine to me.

355
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,280
Where are you going?

356
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,640
To lift weights.

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,720
Where are you?

358
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,360
(Young Space Tennis Club)
I won today.

359
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Let's go for a drink.

360
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,280
(I'm meeting someone else.)

361
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,560
(I'll celebrate with you another day.)

(Peachy Peach uploaded a new post)

365
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,900
(We'll be shooting
a big pool scene at Anthea.)

366
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,240
What a variety of content.

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
A big swimming pool shoot?

368
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,220
(They look identical.)
(Love is the end of the universe.)

369
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,640
(This couple is still going on?)

370
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,000
(I would like to have a look for myself.)

(Young Space Tennis Club)

372
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,560
What a coincidence!

373
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,720
Why are you here?

374
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,680
I just won a game.

375
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,800
I came here for a vacation.

376
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,720
I see that you are having

377
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,800
a local vacation huh.

378
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,720
Shouldn't you be congratulating me?

379
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,320
Congratulations.

380
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,240
What are you guys doing here?

381
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,760
My girlfriend and I

382
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,960
are here for a couple's video shoot.

383
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,920
Are you her new boyfriend?

384
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,280
Nice to meet you.

385
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,000
Come, introduce yourself.

386
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,560
I...

387
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,240
Let's go.

388
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
We have to make use of our time.

389
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,120
Today,

390
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
we are going to teach you

391
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
a couple's...

392
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,800
Ready to go live.

393
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,880
Five, four...

394
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,920
Hold on.

395
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Do you know him?

396
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,280
Why does he keep following you?

397
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,960
Why don't we call it a day now.

398
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,280
I'll have a look at the footage

399
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,240
and see if we can use any of it.

400
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,520
You should head back. Thanks for today.

401
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,440
Alright.

402
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,120
That will be it for today.

403
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,440
When you see others taking pictures,

404
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,680
can't you just give them some space?

405
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm just a normal guy

406
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,680
taking a shower after swimming.

407
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
That said,

408
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,560
how would I know where you're shooting?

409
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,360
There are only a few scenes,

410
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
yet you're in each one of them.

411
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,960
You're obviously messing things up.

412
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,920
I thought your boyfriend

413
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
is very athletic?

414
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
His muscles are not

415
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,360
well-defined at all.

416
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,920
Does he know who your ex was?

417
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,760
Are you trying to mess with me

418
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
and interfere with my work?

419
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm now thinking

420
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
you're including me in

421
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,960
those shots to increase your views.

422
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,840
The evidence is all in your phone.

423
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,360
I went to the club to find you,

424
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,840
and I thought we sorted things out.

425
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
Yet you come here and make a nuisance.

426
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,760
You should know

427
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,920
your intentions fairly well.

428
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,800
Yes, you won a match,

429
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
and you took yourself on a vacation.

430
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,080
Me?

431
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,040
I am not rich like you.

432
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,320
I have to work hard and

433
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
make money to support myself.

434
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm begging you.

435
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,040
Stop ruining others' hard work.

436
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,680
Please?

437
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,400
(She really got angry.)

438
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,560
(Maybe I overdid it this time.)

439
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,760
Liang Tao.

440
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,320
Are all of the footage

441
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,320
taken just now unusable?

442
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,240
Why?

443
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
The little conscience that you have left

444
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,600
is making you uneasy, huh?

445
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,080
Do you want to make it up to me?

446
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,480
Are you driving?

447
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,680
Yes.

448
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
Take me somewhere.

449
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,360
Sure. My car is over there.

450
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I'll take your luggage for you.

451
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,800
(Hanma Clothing Wholesale City)

452
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,440
We're here.

453
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,600
What are you going to do here?

454
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,600
You sent me here,

455
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,200
so we don't owe each other anymore.

456
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,080
I hope to never see you again.

457
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,200
(Qinyu)
Ms. Wang, has my order arrived?

458
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,360
Yes, it's over there.

459
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,920
OK.

460
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,720
Say,

461
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
that Schlager-style clothing that you wanted

462
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,240
was so hard to find.

463
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,160
Why are you buying so much for?

464
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm preparing for a project

465
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
that talks about using Schlager clothing

466
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,120
to create a cute style.

467
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,680
Ms. Wang, give me a 25% discount.

468
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,680
I'll pay everything at
the end of the month.

469
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Sure.

470
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,720
You're good at bargaining.

471
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,800
Right. I'll return

472
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,720
those props to you

473
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,920
when I'm done shooting.

474
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
So many things.

475
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
Can you carry it all alone?

476
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,760
Of course.

477
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,440
I'll get going, Ms. Wang.

478
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,520
Not easy for a young lady like this.

479
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
You're the boss, right?

480
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,840
This dress looks very pretty.

481
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
I will definitely buy it next time.

482
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,800
This hat too.

483
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:19,520
(Wigs)

484
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,640
Say,

485
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,760
this thing is pretty useful.

486
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,480
I didn't get stung at all tonight.

487
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,160
Can we keep a few boxes?

488
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,800
No.

489
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,760
This belongs to the club.

490
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,360
Hundreds of these.

491
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,160
Can we finish it all tonight?

492
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,800
Just do it one at a time.

493
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
If you're sleepy, go to bed first.

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,760
We'll be fine,

495
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,800
but what about electricity?

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
Go to the meter and

497
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,960
mark down the figures.

498
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
I'll make the claims for you.

499
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,280
How stingy.

500
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,880
Going by figures.

501
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,040
Raised you for nothing.

502
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,120
What's up?

503
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,040
(Tomorrow's new member recruitment,)

504
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,680
(see you at nine.)

505
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,720
OK. Got it.

506
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,880
Don't forget the swag.

507
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,640
I can't say for sure.

508
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,920
I tend to

509
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,560
oversleep easily.

510
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,400
My memory is bad.

511
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,480
(I will call you tomorrow morning)

512
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,400
(to wake you up.)

513
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,960
(I'll remind you, okay?)

514
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,600
OK.

515
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,440
Go sleep then.

516
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,560
Good night.

517
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,760
Chuan,

518
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
can I interview you?

519
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,920
How did you come to like

520
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,360
someone who is ten years older than you?

521
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
I didn't like her as someone older.

522
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
I like Liang You'an as a person.

523
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
Then tell me,

524
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,520
what do you like about her?

525
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
There's a lot that I like.

526
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,320
She's mature, independent,

527
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,840
thoughtful, responsible,

528
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,880
smart, kind

529
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
and she is very pretty.

530
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,120
Are you using all the nice adjectives

531
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,920
that you know on her?

532
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,280
She's better than all that combined.

533
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
Sure.

534
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,840
I think you have been fully bewitched.

535
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,560
It's totally normal for her to reject me.

536
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Maybe one day,

537
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,800
when I am stronger,

538
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,880
strong enough to match up
to all these adjectives,

539
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,640
then I'll be right for her.

540
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Enough for now.
I'm sufficiently impressed.

541
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,040
Don't sulk.

542
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,800
There's nothing I can do for you.

543
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,640
I don't care about claiming for
electricity or labour now.

544
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
I'll stay with you tonight.

545
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,720
Alright. Another box is done.

546
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,520
Didn't I tell you?

547
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,560
Put it on the right side of the logo.

548
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,760
It's the wrong way around now.

549
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,880
Efforts wasted.

550
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,640
I can't anymore.

551
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,080
I just can't.

552
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,840
I'm so sleepy.

553
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,880
Over here.

554
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,720
You're so early.

555
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,440
Look,

556
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,600
I finished applying the stickers.

557
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,400
The QR code is nicely pasted on.

558
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,400
How did you do that?

559
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,320
Your handwork is better than mine.

560
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,440
You spent so much money

561
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,880
on the marketing swag,

562
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,440
I must make sure to do my part well.

563
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,760
Alright.

564
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,480
Hold on.

565
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,720
There are a lot of mosquitoes here.

566
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,520
Put this on.

567
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,680
Let's go.

568
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,280
This repels mosquitoes pretty well too.

569
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,640
Let me tell you.

570
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,600
I come here often

571
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,520
to recruit new members.

572
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,280
It works well.

573
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,280
I knew

574
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,920
there will be

575
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,240
a junior game held today.

576
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,800
All are 8 to 12-year-olds.

577
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,840
They are exactly who we

578
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
want to target.

579
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,040
Right.

580
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,840
You go this way. I'll go over there.

581
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,480
Okay.

582
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,440
Excuse me, hello.

583
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,200
We're from Young Space Tennis Club.

584
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,160
We have a mosquito repellent bracelet for you.

585
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,360
You can take a look.

586
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
We have a lot of information

587
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,960
and also coupons in there.

588
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,360
Here, take one.

589
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,240
Do you like this blue one?

590
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,840
Do you like this?

591
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,840
Your head coach is Zhang Yan?

592
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,600
Yes, our coach is Zhang Yan.

593
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,600
He's famous.

594
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Coach Zhang Yan

595
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,800
mainly handles our professional players.

596
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,120
However, he also designed

597
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
the courses for our youth academy

598
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,840
and commercial members himself.

599
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,720
We basically share the same system.

600
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,760
The tennis clubs

601
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,160
are too many these days.

602
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,520
Let me tell you,

603
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,720
these coaches are the wild card factor.

604
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,080
We had enough of that too.

605
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
We want a reliable trainer,

606
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
and that's hard to come by.

607
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,440
Yes.

608
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
Some of them joined a few games

609
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,920
and claimed that they come
from a professional team.

610
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
You can be assured that

611
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,800
for our club,

612
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,680
our coaches are our greatest feature.

613
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,240
You can check out our public account.

614
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,760
There's this.

615
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,640
Since the beginning of the season,

616
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,880
our professional players

617
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,680
(Young Space Tennis)
have gained massive

618
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,200
improvements in their rankings.

619
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,120
We have to thank Coach Zhang Yan

620
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,200
for this rapid improvement

621
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
of our players' competence.

622
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Your public account

623
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
is well-designed,

624
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,760
it's very informative too.

625
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,040
You have a nutritionist as well?

626
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,760
Yes.

627
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,800
Will the tuition be expensive?

628
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Based on your deposited fees,

629
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,040
we offer a variety of promotions.

630
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,680
It won't be that much expensive

631
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,640
compared to other clubs.

632
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,200
On top of that, our physiotherapist

633
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,800
and our nutritionist

634
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
offer free lectures every month

635
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,760
so that our commercial members

636
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,120
can gain more knowledge

637
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,560
and help us in improving our tennis skills.

638
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,400
That sounds good enough.

639
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,280
Why don't

640
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,560
we add on WeChat?

641
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,160
Is that alright?

642
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,040
Sure, no problem.

643
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
I'll let you scan my code.

644
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,080
Alright.

645
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,880
Thanks.

646
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
Sure, sure.

647
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,960
I'll scan it as well.

648
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,720
Sure, sure.

649
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,880
You can call me Liang, Ms. Liang.

650
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,080
Have you got it?

651
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,600
Yes.

652
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,280
Right,

653
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,920
I feel that

654
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,160
this course is not bad.

655
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
It's fine, everyone can scan this.

656
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,520
What are you doing?

657
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,680
That woman there, what are you doing?

658
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,840
Come here.

659
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,520
Come.

660
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
What do you think you're doing?

661
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,280
Here to steal our customers!

662
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,800
It's fair play.

663
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,840
We just want to give parents some options.

664
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,840
This is a disruption to the market,

665
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,520
you know?

666
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,360
Wait, why are you yelling?

667
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,000
Why?

668
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,520
We said it's a fair competition.

669
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,480
If you are good enough,

670
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,360
your customers won't leave you.

671
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
If you are not at all good,

672
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,800
don't slow down their kids.

673
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,760
Young Space right?

674
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
I heard about you.

675
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,000
You guys poached Zhang Yan over,

676
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,680
so now you're arrogant?

677
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,840
Let me tell you,

678
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
I am acquainted with Young Space's

679
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,680
President Gao Li.

680
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,640
Should I give him a call

681
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,240
and ask him about

682
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,800
why his subordinates

683
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,560
have no respect for others?

684
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Go on, make the call.

685
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,560
Leave, now.

686
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,720
Don't let me see you again.

687
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,080
It's okay.

688
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Don't be angry.

689
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,280
Those parents have followed

690
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,120
our public account anyway.

691
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,640
Most of them added me on WeChat too.

692
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,320
Let's go.

693
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,200
I'm furious.

694
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,120
Let's go eat, I haven't eaten.

695
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,980
(Young Space Tennis Club)

696
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,840
(2. Have 800 commercial members)

697
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,920
The offseason is over,

698
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,880
and we finally have 800 commercial members.

699
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,320
We achieved another goal.

700
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,960
That's great.

701
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,740
(2. Have 800 commercial members)

702
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,840
I made an appointment
for the tennis grading assessment.

703
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,560
It's the day after tomorrow.

704
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
I'll be there.

705
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,520
Alright.

706
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,880
(In the Chinese Tennis Association
Technical Grading Exam,)

707
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
(there will be five assessment items.)

708
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
(The total score of the athlete)

709
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
(will determine their final level.)

710
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,920
(Level 1 is the highest,
level 10 is the lowest.)

711
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,040
(Song Sanchuan, Chen Zhe.)

712
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,880
Deep forehand and backhand corner.

713
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,280
(You have to be at least level 7)

714
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,520
(to make up for the club's)

715
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,040
(two remaining player vacancies.)

716
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,080
Forehand and backhand stability.

717
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,120
Forehand and backhand volley.

718
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
Out wide serve at the deuce side.

719
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,320
Mobility test.

720
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,000
Ready, go.

721
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,400
Eighteen thirty.

722
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,000
Next, Song Sanchuan.

723
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
Deep forehand and backhand corner.

724

Fifteen ninety-eight.

Song Sanchuan, level 5.

732

Chuan, you're good!

733

(Bye-bye.)

737

Bye-bye.

738

What's wrong?

739
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
The shoe is rubbing my foot the whole day.

740
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,200
Come.

741
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,480
You don't own a pair of sneakers even?

742
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,320
Of course, I do.

743
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm just styling this with my outfit,

744
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,600
else the photos won't look nice.

00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,440
Sure, outfit styling.

757
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,240
ask them to fill this out.

758
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
You have to fill in too.

759
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,320
Of course.

760
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,160
But if ten or a hundred people register,

761
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,520
it will make a great difference.

762
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,240
We have many options

763
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,720
regarding lesson hours.

764
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,280
Sure, sure.

765
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,080
Come over any time to learn more.

766
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,280
(Young Space Tennis Club)

767
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,320
This is Luo Nian, Ms. Luo.

768
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
From now on she will be

769
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,480
the team's nutritionist.

770
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,280
Please welcome her.

771
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,480
Hello everyone.

772
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
I am under your guidance from now on.

773
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,520
In fact, professional nutritionists

774
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,720
are playing an increasingly important

775
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,640
role in modern sports.

776
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,080
Ms. Luo will be

777
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,040
collecting your training data

778
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,360
as soon as possible

779
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,280
so that everyone will

780
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,560
get training and game-season diets

781
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,520
customised precisely to suit them.

782
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,600
Introduce yourself.

783
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Let me introduce to you

784
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
what's on the table.

785
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,840
I formulated these energy drinks

786
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,640
according to each of your functional
fitness assessment report.

787
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,040
I would like to take this opportunity

788
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,560
to get to know you as well.

789
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,360
Ms. Luo.

790
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,520
Busy?

791
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,720
Why? Is there anything?

792
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,120
Nothing.

793
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,920
I just wanted to say,

794
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,560
I took a look at your resume.

795
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,600
I think,

796
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,560
you are fine in terms of
professionalism.

797
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,480
Coach,

798
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,960
how did you manage to do that?

799
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,520
You are giving a compliment,

800
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,200
yet it also makes people feel

801
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,400
uncomfortable hearing that.

802
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,520
I'm like this.

803
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,920
I'm used to judging people as inferior.

804
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,160
If I have lower expectations of you,

805
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
you get more room for improvement.

806
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,080
Have you heard of a book named

807
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,360
"The Art of Speaking"?

808
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,360
I think you really need it.

809
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,160
I have this book. I've read it.

810
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,080
This energy drink,

811
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,520
I think it works.

812
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,640
My only concern is

813
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,520
the stability of supply.

814
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,560
It could be that Liang You'an

815
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,040
will leave someday, right?

816
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,720
If my team members got used to

817
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,320
your energy drink,

818
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,760
and both of you leave hand in hand,

819
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,560
what do I do then?

820
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,160
What?

821
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Have you ever experienced

822
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,000
psychological trauma?

823
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,800
I think you are very afraid of

824
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,360
people coming and leaving.

825
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,640
I'm wasting my time talking to you.

826
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Were you divorced?

827
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,840
Cheated on?

828
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,120
Betrayed by your club?

829
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
Were you abandoned by a player?

830
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,760
That's enough really.

831
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,960
Stop cursing me.

832
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,800
I also minored in

833
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
sports psychology and rehabilitation.

834
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,880
I can help manage this
psychological trauma too.

835
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,280
If you need counselling,

836
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,200
I can help too.

837
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,800
You are welcome to talk to me anytime.

838
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
How are you so poisonous?

839
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,920
Better make yourself a bottle

840
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,480
to cure yourself from all that poison.

841
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,200
How is this person so poisonous?

842
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,640
What kind of person is this?

843
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,480
I looked at the new budget.

844
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,080
There's an 'energy drink' added to it.

845
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,520
Yes.

846
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,000
This energy drink came from

847
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,720
my recent hiring of

848
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,000
a nutritionist for the club.

849
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,760
I wanted to

850
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,720
establish a solid

851
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,360
organisational structure for our club.

852
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,040
Right now,

853
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,760
I am producing this on a small scale.

854
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
However, I also discovered that our players,

855
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,520
after drinking,

856
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
showed significant improvements

857
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
in their body's functions.

858
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,040
I would like to see

859
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,480
if I can find investors

860
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,440
to mass produce it,

861
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,320
so that we can also sell it

862
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
to our commercial members.

863
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,480
Right.

864
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,920
The club now has ten

865
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,560
qualified professional players.

866
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,360
Jiang Jiaojiao is also working hard

867
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,040
to break into the top 100.

868
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
Recently, he got into a really good state.

869
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,160
He's improving rapidly.

870
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,280
I'm thinking that

871
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,360
this Saturday, he has a game of key shots.

872
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,280
Maybe you can

873
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,520
come over and see him play,
cheering him on.

874
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,440
We'll see.

875
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,680
By the way, you told me that

876
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,840
the professional players' scores

877
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,040
can effectively drive in commercial members.

878
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,040
Last month,

879
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,680
our profit grew over 50 percent.

880
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,360
In my plans,

881
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,320
wait till the club

882
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,200
receives the A-rank sign,

883
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,120
just the...

884
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,320
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

885
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,320
Just the fees from members

886
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,480
would be able to

887
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,440
turn our loss into a profit.

888
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,800
When that time comes, I would like to

889
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,320
develop some merchandise for the club

890
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,880
and bring in some derivative benefits.

891
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,880
That's great.

892
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,120
The results we have at this stage

893
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,560
have temporarily removed

894
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,600
the risk of closing down the club.

895
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,240
Cheers.

896
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,720
You'an,

897
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,520
I feel like you've become different.

898
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,800
Well humans

899
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,400
will always adapt to
their work environment.

900
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,080
No, no.

901
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,960
I am not talking about this.

902
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,120
I meant that

903
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,200
the way you dress and

904
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,920
and your overall state.

905
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,280
Like, I guess I can't put it into words.

906
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,360
It's different anyway.

907
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
I would prefer my current self though.

908
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,120
Look.

909
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,000
That's what I'm talking about.

910
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,760
Think about it.

911
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Would the previous you

912
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,720
be able to say that?

913
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,000
Come, eat.

914
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,040
Sis, see if this works.

915
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,800
The second last one,

916
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,520
the transparent one.

917
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Move it a little further out.

918
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,840
Is this it?

919
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,600
Yes.

920
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,080
Okay, get out of the way.

921
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,440
Ms. Luo,

922
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,720
doesn't this look a bit

923
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,520
unimpressive?

924
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,920
Is it too ordinary?

925
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,200
Shall we change it up a bit?

926
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,960
How?

927
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,520
Just wait for me.
