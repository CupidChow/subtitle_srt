2
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,740
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:55,780
(Liang You'an, I'm Okay Now. Thank You.)

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,708
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,668
I requested a forfeit for the next game

6
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,508
on your behalf without asking you first.

7
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,348
After all, it's tennis.

8
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:14,948
Once you lose your serving game,

9
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:17,668
it can be really upsetting.

10
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,868
Does playing headwind game

11
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,748
remind you of your own struggles?

12
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:26,548
I know my biggest problem now

13
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,748
is that I can't handle playing
headwind game.

14
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:32,308
Actually, my mindset was wrong
from the beginning.

15
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:34,308
I had already

16
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,268
mentally prepared myself
for the worst-case scenario.

17
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,308
To put it bluntly,
I was afraid of losing.

18
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,308
But when it comes to losing for real,

19
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:46,388
all I see is a dead end,

20
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,228
and I do nothing to counter it.

21
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:53,228
Did you know that whenever
we were away for a match,

22
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,028
we would leave
our luggage at the front desk?

23
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,668
If we won, we would extend our stay.

24
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,588
But if we lose, we pack up and leave.

25
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,748
It's not about the fear of losing.

26
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:06,868
It's about not getting any points

27
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:09,308
and wasting the club's money
on match fees,

28
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,868
travel expenses, and coaching fees.

29
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:13,068
I know you're struggling.

30
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,508
I don't want to lose any more matches.

31
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:21,428
Song Sanchuan,

32
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,148
I don't want to be your burden.

33
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,268
Lately, I've been wondering

34
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,588
if I made a mistake.

35
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,948
Remember the day I encouraged you
to switch from badminton to tennis?

36
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:33,868
I told you

37
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:36,988
there was no 18-18 score on the tennis court.

38
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:37,868
But in reality,

39
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:42,948
we were just running away from badminton.

40
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,108
We didn't let it go.

41
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:49,628
In my professional understanding,

42
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:53,668
competitive sports have always been cruel

43
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:57,268
and heavy burdens to bear.

44
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:59,828
You switched from badminton to tennis,

45
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,828
and what's most impressive

46
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,988
is not the successful transition.

47
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:04,788
But the fact you tell me every day

48
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:07,588
that you've been improving.

49
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:10,908
The emotion of happiness,
unrestrained enjoyment,

50
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:13,308
and passion radiate
from the bottom of your heart,

51
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,868
makes me so envious.

52
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:23,468
We've finally found joy in tennis.

53
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:24,988
Just let it be.

54
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,668
We shouldn't overthink it.

55
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:30,468
I admit,

56
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,508
there's pressure from the club.

57
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:35,228
It's normal to win and lose in matches.

58
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:37,988
But I want to work hard with you

59
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,508
and try our best

60
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:41,708
without being weighed down.

61
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:43,908
What do you think?

62
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:49,908
Who knows, maybe one day

63
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,108
when you can no longer play tennis,

64
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:55,068
and the club is in shambles
because of me.

65
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:56,508
Who can say

66
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,908
we never had any joy in our lives?

67
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,308
There's one thing

68
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:19,748
that I should stop avoiding.

69
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,148
Are you sure about this?

70
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:24,588
I must find Tong Lu.

71
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,148
All right, I'll make the arrangement.

72
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,700
(Guangzhou Railway Station)

73
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:51,908
Be careful.

74
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:55,988
Nine, eight, seven.

75
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:57,588
I think this is the one.

76
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:58,388
This one.

77
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,108
We're here.

78
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,788
Did you reserve a soft berth?

79
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:06,428
Of course,

80
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:07,428
it takes one day and one night trip,

81
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,428
soft berth is definitely
more comfortable.

82
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:19,948
Is this your first time
taking a green train?

83
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,468
We still have five minutes
until departure.

84
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:26,788
Let's make a bet.

85
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:27,908
Which one do you think will come first,

86
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,188
a boy or a girl?

87
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:34,308
I think a girl would be better.

88
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,068
But what if it's two stinky guys?

89
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:38,148
Why can't it be two handsome guys?

90
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:39,708
Just give up guessing.

91
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,028
Nowadays,

92
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,708
the only handsome guy
who's willing to ride this slow train

93
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,028
is sitting opposite of you.

94
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:45,748
Where's the handsome guy?

95
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,348
I thought there are high-speed trains.

96
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:50,788
Why did you purchase tickets
for this one?

97
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:52,868
Well, the biggest advantage

98
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,268
of taking this train is that it's slow.

99
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,708
How is slow an advantage?

100
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:00,348
It's like the trip to Lhasa.

101
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,188
Riding the plane may not necessarily

102
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,548
be the best choice.

103
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,268
If you don't get used
to the environment,

104
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,908
you might get altitude sickness
as soon as you land.

105
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,228
Actually, after we talked about it the other day,

106
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:12,828
I was afraid you acted impulsively.

107
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:15,188
But now,

108
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:17,828
we have 22 hours to think about it.

109
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,148
If you change your mind in between,

110
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:21,108
we can always get off at any stop

111
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,308
and go home right away.

112
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:27,628
I would never have altitude sickness.

113
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:30,908
Once I make a decision,

114
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,028
I won't change my mind.

115
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,668
This matter should

116
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,068
have been solved long ago.

117
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:41,908
An Cong is also on his way.

118
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,148
I've already talked to him.

119
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:48,188
During these 22 hours,

120
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:50,908
I hope we won't waste them.

121
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,548
When you said
we don't have to bear the burden,

122
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,228
I don't think it's just about me.

123
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,508
When we arrive at the final station,

124
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:00,988
we both need to clear our baggage

125
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,588
and throw it away.

126
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:05,628
Deal.

127
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:14,588
(Mr. Jiang, since your divorce,)

128
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,308
(Jiang Jiaojiao)
(I've never asked my mother for money.)

129
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:17,868
(If you cut my allowance again,)

130
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,068
(I can only ask your ex-wife.)

131
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,160
(Jiang Jiaojiao)
(Dad, I'm really broke.)

132
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,620
(Bank Card Deposited of 3,000 yuan.
Balance 3018.2 yuan)

133
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,548
I've been looking for you.

134
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:47,268
So here's the money for this month.

135
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:47,908
Thanks.

136
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:49,468
I got it.

137
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:51,628
You're quite punctual with the transfer.

138
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:52,988
I just received my pay.

139
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,468
So I transferred it to you right away.

140
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,188
You even brought interest with you.

141
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,068
Pick the flavor you want.

142
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:08,868
It's pretty good.

143
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,068
Can you explain this to me?

144
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,308
The club's official account

145
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,228
(Topsmash)
is turning into his personal account.

146
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,708
The video I recorded with Song Sanchuan

147
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,948
has a high click rate.

148
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028
You should think
about what's your problem.

149
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:32,948
Is this how you speak to your creditor?

150
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,948
Did you watch every video?

151
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,668
Of course, I watched every video.

152
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,588
Why is it that every video

153
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:41,828
of Song Sanchuan looks
so cool and impressive?

154
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:42,668
But when it comes to me...

155
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,188
See this?

156
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:48,788
It's all funny and ridiculous.

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,420
(WeChat Bizzare Footage. Test)

158
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:50,188
Liang Tao,

159
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:51,228
listen.

160
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:52,828
You are completely trying
to bring me down.

161
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:53,868
That's not true.

162
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,308
Ms. Liang said

163
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,668
that everyone should highlight

164
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:57,668
their own unique qualities

165
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,668
based on their personality.

166
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:00,228
That's how you create memorable moments.

167
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:04,028
Am I a comedian type of personality?

168
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:05,948
I don't know.

169
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,028
But every time I see you,
I find you funny.

170
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,028
You can't help
but laugh when you see me.

171
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,428
There are two possible reasons for that,

172
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,748
one is because they are funny,

173
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,188
the other one is you like me.

174
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,748
Could it be that you like me?

175
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,908
Nonsense.

176
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:29,828
Don't worry.

177
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:31,428
I won't because I'm not worthy of you.

178
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,748
But you can even pick white peach-flavored

179
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:35,228
sparkling water.

180
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,668
Who knows if you like me?

181
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,348
I finally know
what kind of person you are.

182
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,148
You're only nice to me

183
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:44,988
when it comes to paying back

184
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,108
your debts every month.

185
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,108
I've never met anyone as practical as you.

186
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,068
Okay, fine.

187
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,788
I'll post your cool and impressive video.

188
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:53,588
I'm going now.

189
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:58,588
She just can't do anything right.

190
00:10:58,628 --> 00:10:59,788
She's top at making people livid.

191
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,268
Don't you think we bought too many snacks?

192
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:11,908
Not at all.

193
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:13,748
Let's just treat it as a spring outing.

194
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,268
See, it's so ceremonious.

195
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:20,988
We have sausage. I'll open it for you.

196
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:21,948
Okay.

197
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:22,628
All right.

198
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,428
Would you mind

199
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:30,388
if I use my teeth to open this?

200
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,148
Yes.

201
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:36,708
I trimmed my nails to play tennis.

202
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,868
I can't open this
without using my teeth.

203
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:42,028
Show me your nails.

204
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:45,468
What's wrong?

205
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,028
Did you cut them

206
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:48,388
or did you bite them?

207
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,548
I think they look neat.

208
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,668
I've always been confused.

209
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:56,668
Do guys never use nail clippers?

210
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:57,908
Yeah.

211
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:00,068
Who needs nail clippers?

212
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:01,788
What about toenails?

213
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:05,588
Well, toenails...

214
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:10,348
And you know what?

215
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:11,748
We have dorms now.

216
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:12,788
It's even more convenient.

217
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:13,948
We can help each other out

218
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,468
and bite each other's nails.

219
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:19,028
You guys sure have a good relationship.

220
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:22,428
I've also been wondering.

221
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:23,748
Can I ask?

222
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:24,428
Sure.

223
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,668
Did our night together mean anything?

224
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:37,668
Here, drink some water.

225
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,028
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

226
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:54,188
I just want to know.

227
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:57,788
Was it really

228
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:01,428
just a drunken impulse

229
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,268
or was it because of me?

230
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,108
How can it be so coincidental

231
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:28,308
that it happened at my old school?

232
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,068
You were standing right there

233
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,788
by the excellent
graduates' announcement board.

234
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,348
(Liang)
(At that moment,)

235
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,708
(you shattered the shell)

236
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,508
(that was around me.)

237
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:43,868
It was as if I was never hurt before.

238
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,788
That was the 20-year-old Liang You'an

239
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,388
and the 20-year-old Song Sanchuan.

240
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,308
I knew it.

241
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:08,268
How is it possible

242
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:12,028
to feel happy just

243
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:14,548
by drinking at any bar?

244
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:18,828
The 20-year-old you is mine.

245
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,108
So is the 30-year-old you.

246
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:21,068
You're stuck with me now.

247
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:46,388
Do you have a pen?

248
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,068
What do you want to do?

249
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,028
Writing it down.

250
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,588
At this moment,

251
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,508
write the biggest burden in your heart

252
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,148
on this paper.

253
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,460
(Fear of losing)

254
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,060
(Fear of gaining weight.)

255
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,868
Come on, be serious.

256
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:29,388
You need to be sincere.

257
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:30,228
I'm really afraid of getting fat.

258
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:31,308
Come on, stop it. Are you even fat?

259
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:32,508
You're not fat at all.

260
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:33,428
You're just being pretentious.

261
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:35,868
Be more sincere.

262
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,428
Hurry up, we're almost there.

263
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:42,548
We're arriving already.

264
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,620
(Fear if losing)

265
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:48,508
I don't want to lose either.

266
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:56,788
Where are you going?

267
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,220
(Hitting is strictly prohibited)

268
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,988
(Let's just get off
and go straight there.)

269
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,228
(Am I right?)

270
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:55,428
(Are you ready?)

271
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:56,708
(I'm ready.)

272
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,188
(It's been six years
since she passed away.)

273
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:04,468
(This year)

274
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:05,628
(is the final year
for the signed agreement)

275
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:06,388
(to store her ashes.)

276
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,028
(If no family members come to claim them,)

277
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,827
(her ashes will be scattered at sea)

278
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:12,827
(according to her wishes.)

279
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,508
(It's fate that brought us together.)

280
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:18,948
(In the final month,)

281
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:20,988
(Ms. Liang contacted us.)

282
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,580
(Tong Lu)

283
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,028
(Did she suffer)

284
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,388
(in her final moments?)

285
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,188
(In the end,)

286
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:07,828
(she was hardly conscious.)

287
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,188
(She just murmured a couple of words
with her eyes closed,)

288
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,188
("Hurry up, hurry up.")

289
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,028
Thank you.

290
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,268
Thank you very much.

291
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,468
The words she used to like saying

292
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,588
to me the most

293
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:04,948
were,

294
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:07,108
"Hurry up,

295
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:09,828
hurry up.

296
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,028
Chuan,

297
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:20,628
please hurry up and grow up faster."

(Tong Lu)

00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,548
Go ahead.

315
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,708
I have to stop deceiving myself anymore.

316
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:43,188
It's okay.

317
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,548
You'll be free from now on.

318
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,068
You don't have to worry

319
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:55,308
about your lousy wig shop anymore.

320
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:14,028
Scatter her ashes.

321
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:14,588
Go ahead and scatter.

322
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:00,268
Rest in peace.

323
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:16,548
Chuan.

324
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:32,988
Lu,

325
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,828
nothing can hold you back now.

326
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:43,748
You can go peacefully.

327
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:47,988
Chuan is doing well now.

328
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:51,668
He's not playing badminton anymore.

329
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,188
Don't be angry about it.

330
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,188
He's much happier than before.

331
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:03,508
He has goals, friends,

332
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:06,068
and people who care about him.

333
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,908
I've done everything you asked me to do.

334
00:24:12,908 --> 00:24:15,028
When I think about when we were together,

335
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:18,428
I did everything you wanted.

336
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:22,868
But today, I feel like

337
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,588
I have the right
to say a few words to you.

338
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,948
You shouldn't have left us

339
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:29,868
without saying goodbye.

340
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:33,468
That was wrong of you!

341
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:41,668
Everyone in this world,

342
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:44,268
every single person,

343
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:48,188
deserves a proper farewell

344
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:54,588
if given the chance.

345
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:16,868
Go now.

346
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:18,748
Go.

347
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,108
Go in peace.

348
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:41,508
Lu,

349
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:44,748
you're free now.

350
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:48,748
And we're finally free too.

351
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:18,308
When we get back,

352
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:20,588
I'll clean up the house

353
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:21,548
your mother left

354
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,828
and you can move out.

355
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:26,948
You're right.

356
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,268
We're bound to go separate ways.

357
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:36,948
We'll do it now.

358
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,860
(Topsmash Tennis Club)

359
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,388
Help me...

360
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:18,628
Go and check on him.

361
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,468
Song Sanchuan went to the badminton court
the moment he arrived.

362
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:07,388
I'm fine.

363
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,348
I'll go back after a while.

364
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:19,668
One day,

365
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,668
I read Luo Le a storybook.

366
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:23,548
I thought it was pretty good.

367
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:24,428
Do you want to hear it?

368
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:25,988
No way.

369
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:28,668
I hate it when you treat me like a kid.

370
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:30,628
A lot of adults
can't even understand that story.

371
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:38,228
Fine, tell me.

372
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:48,908
The name of that picture book
is "The Hole".

373
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,348
It's about a little boy named Haozhi.

374
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:55,428
One day,

375
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:57,588
he suddenly got the idea

376
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:00,268
to dig a hole in his backyard.

377
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,948
Many people were curious

378
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:05,908
and asked him what he was doing.

379
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:09,028
But he didn't answer.

380
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:12,148
He just kept digging and digging.

381
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:14,188
The hole got deeper and deeper.

382
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:18,388
Some people suggested

383
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,908
that he turn the hole into a pool or a trap,

384
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:26,748
while others advised him

385
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:28,068
to stop digging.

386
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,668
But Haozhi didn't listen to them

387
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,148
and kept digging.

388
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:34,588
However, his dad would come

389
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,468
and see him every day,

390
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:39,148
without giving him any advice

391
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:40,908
or suggestions,

392
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,548
just watching

393
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:45,668
this boy digging his own hole.

394
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:48,708
Eventually,

395
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,188
the hole was deep enough,

396
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:56,788
and Haozhi jumped into it.

397
00:29:58,108 --> 00:29:59,028
Looking up,

398
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:04,828
he saw that the sky was especially blue,

399
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:06,868
and he even saw

400
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,108
a butterfly flying by in front of him.

401
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:21,748
Then he got out of the hole
and filled the hole back up.

402
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:28,748
That's it?

403
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:31,908
That's it.

404
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:36,268
Unbelievable.

405
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,748
What kind of ending is that?

406
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:40,988
The hole was filled back up.

407
00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:45,108
Do you think Haozhi feels better now?

408
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:50,908
He should feel better now.

409
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,748
And in this story,

410
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,228
the father is pretty important too.

411

00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,308
Okay, that's all for today.

558
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,548
Thank you, Tan.

559
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:37,988
Ms. Liang,

560
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:39,308
why are you here?

561
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:41,788
I finished work.

562
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:43,708
- It's time to go back.
- Thank you for your hard work.

563
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:45,108
Go on now.

564
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:49,068
What's the matter?

565
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:50,348
Sit down and talk.

566
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:55,388
Don't look at me.

567
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:58,588
Sit down. I said, sit down.

568
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:04,348
What's wrong?

569
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,148
Don't look at me.

570
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,228
Liang Tao has something

571
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:09,468
about us in her hands.

572
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:12,108
It's something unspeakable.

573
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:13,308
Seriously?

574
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,348
I said, don't look at me.

575
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:16,228
Just look at the sky.

576
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,028
Look at the sky instead, not me.

577
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:20,348
But how did she know we...

578
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:21,948
Not that.

579
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:23,428
It's not the one you're thinking of.

580
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,348
It's...

581
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:25,468
In any case, it won't do anyone good

582
00:41:25,468 --> 00:41:26,908
if that video gets out.

583
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,348
At least, people will gossip about it.

584
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:30,948
You also said

585
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,948
you want to focus on tennis.

586
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:34,588
So I think

587
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:38,228
we should be careful,

588
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,828
keep our distance,

589
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,028
don't let it influence us,

590
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:43,308
you know?

591
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:45,468
Got it.

592
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,988
I understand what you mean.

593
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:49,788
But I'm still not really sure

594
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,748
how should we find the right balance.

595
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:54,308
Let's both try and see.

596
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:56,428
In any case,

597
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,068
you need to be careful.

598
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:00,228
I'll do the same too.

599
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,468
I think

600
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,108
you overthink.

601
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:10,108
I get it.

602
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:12,188
We're...

603
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:13,628
Yes,

604
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,628
our relationship
is between a player and a manager.

605
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:21,348
We need to avoid suspicion

606
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:24,268
and be more restrained.

607
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:27,588
But don't worry.

608
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:28,588
Liang Tao

609
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:29,868
doesn't have the guts to spread rumors.

610
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:33,268
Yeah, she wouldn't dare to.

611
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,268
I'm glad that you understand.

612
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:41,868
By the way,

613
00:42:41,988 --> 00:42:44,188
I'm not staying
in the dormitory tonight.

614
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:44,908
I have to go home for a bit.

615
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,348
An Cong said
he wants to treat me to a meal.

616
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:47,988
Eating is good.

617
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:50,748
I'll get going then.

618
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:52,068
Stay for another minute here.

619
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:52,708
Okay.

620
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:54,948
Do I still need to look at the sky?

621
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:55,868
You can look at the ground too.

622
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:58,788
Everyone is in such a good state today.

623
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:01,228
Hello?

624
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:05,548
I know.

625
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,828
Let's work together, okay?

626
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:10,668
You're flattering me.

627
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:11,388
You are.

628
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,348
