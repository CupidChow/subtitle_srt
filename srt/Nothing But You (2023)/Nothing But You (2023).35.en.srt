Liang You'an.

5
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:07,147
Although this was quite a sloppy wedding,

6
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:08,627
but at least Liang Tao

7
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,866
has finally found where she belonged.

8
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,427
What about you?

9
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:12,707
Do you have a boyfriend?

10
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:14,427
Or are you still single?

11
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:15,747
Hello, Aunt and Uncle,

12
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:17,187
I'm Song Sanchuan.

13
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:18,387
Hello.

14
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,467
This is my boyfriend.

15
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:24,467
Isn't he Jiaojiao's teammate?

16
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:26,347
Well...

17
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,587
aren't you a little young?

18
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,387
He is younger than me,

19
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:31,547
but he's twenty-four now.

20
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,067
Sanchuan, right?

21
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:35,667
Come,

22
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,987
help me take a photo with You'an.

23
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,107
Come,

24
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:40,507
there is a rooftop.

25
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:41,267
Let's go check it out.

26
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:41,707
Sure.

27
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,427
Look at your lack of backbone, really.

28
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:47,507
Look,

29
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,987
you can see the sunset from here.

30
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:53,907
Many would watch the sun rise,

31
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,427
but few would watch the sun set.

32
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,387
That's probably because

33
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,107
when compared with sunrise, sunset is

34
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,707
associated with a sense of melancholy.

35
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:05,827
Let's watch the sunset together today.

36
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:07,387
Then we won't

37
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,707
this sad thing to deal with
in the future.

38
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,307
It's beautiful.

39
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:15,147
Whenever I see the sunset in the future,

40
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:16,547
I will think about today.

41
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:21,267
- Let's move in together.
- Let's move in together.

56
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:46,467
What happened?

57
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:47,267
How come you

58
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,707
opened the door before I knocked?

59
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:50,867
I can recognize your footsteps.

60
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:51,427
Really?

61
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:51,947
Really.

62
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:52,827
I don't believe you.

63
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:53,867
You're right.

64
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,347
I've been looking through the peephole.

65
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,587
I miss you so much.

66
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,347
Are those six bottles of shampoo

67
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:05,427
all for me?

68
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:07,147
Yes.

69
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,187
That's your favorite brand, right?

70
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,347
I've seen you use it,

71
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,267
so I just bought you more.

72
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,227
How did you know?

73
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:14,147
There were several scents

74
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,387
that I've been meaning to try.

75
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:17,027
Go on then.

76
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:17,787
Thank you so much.

77
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,027
Is it tasty?

78
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:21,947
It's good.

79
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,707
What are you doing?

80
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:28,987
Done.

81
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:34,187
Try the soup.

82
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,467
I have been simmering it for long hours.

83
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:39,907
The rehabilitation fee,

84
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:40,987
fully paid off.

85
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:44,987
Sure. Got it.

86
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:45,547
Oh.

87
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:46,947
This.

88
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,147
Keep this card.

89
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,267
I will save all the prize money

90
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:52,867
in here next time.

91
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:54,707
Use it however you want.

92
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,147
Are you supporting me financially now?

93
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,107
Both you and our home.

94
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,307
When we said we would live together,

95
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:11,707
I thought we might go to

96
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:13,427
the house that my mum left behind

97
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,187
or rent a bigger place.

98
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:16,827
But you said

99
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:17,907
you're used to living here.

100
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:18,827
I don't mind really,

101
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:19,547
but I'm just worried that

102
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,747
I'm often out for tournaments

103
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,707
or training,

104
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:22,507
and I'm not home.

105
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:24,387
I won't be able to take care of

106
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:25,467
the living expenses.

107
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:26,907
So...

108
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,947
If you really want to

109
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:34,827
share out the living expenses,

110
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,147
we can open a separate account

111
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:37,667
then we both put in money

112
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:38,867
and spend that together.

113
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:40,507
Can't you just put it

114
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:41,107
in this card?

115
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:42,027
I don't want to.

116
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:43,827
This is yours.

117
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:44,387
Don't.

118
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:45,707
Stop tempting me.

119
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:46,067
If you keep up like that,

120
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:46,747
I'll really take it.

121
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:47,467
Just take it.

122
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:48,947
Please.

123
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:50,467
Song Sanchuan, let go.

124
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:54,707
Take this.

125
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:55,947
This is the prize money

126
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,427
that you earned through
playing tournaments.

127
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:58,427
You should manage it.

128
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:00,627
Do I not stand a chance?

129
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,667
If you want to use this money

130
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:04,747
to buy me presents,

131
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,787
I will gladly accept them.

132
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,147
You said it.

133
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:11,587
I didn't get to give it out.

134
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:15,867
Do you know that

135
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:18,027
I've managed to get hold of

136
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:19,627
the new venue?

137
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:20,547
That's fast!

138
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,227
Do you want to check it out
with me tomorrow?

139
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:22,907
Of course.

140
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,267
I'm good huh? Praise me.

141
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:25,987
You're awesome.

142
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,587
Pink courts? Really?

143
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:33,827
Our club is doing pretty well

144
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,667
in both commercial and

145
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,507
professional business.

146
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:37,347
We don't have weaknesses anymore.

147
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,507
I just wanted to open another one.

148
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:40,987
This court will serve

149
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,907
this new, healthy mode of dating

150
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,147
for couples.

151
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,347
I thought of a name too.

152
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,027
What?

153
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:46,947
Top Love.

154
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:47,987
Top Love?

155
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:48,587
Right.

156
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:50,547
Do you know what its nickname will be?

157
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:51,067
What?

158
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:51,987
Lovey.

159
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,507
Lovey.

160
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:57,107
I wanted to take this opportunity

161
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,027
to distinguish it from Top Smash.

162
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,347
Then the professional players'

163
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,827
training time and venue

164
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:02,747
will remain unaffected.

165
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:04,067
Great.

166
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:05,947
You are a genius in business.

167
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:07,547
I think that Lovey

168
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,547
will become a franchise club.

169
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,027
I told Alex too.

170
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:12,947
Starting with this project,

171
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,347
we're officially accepting investors

172
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:15,667
to become shareholders.

173
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,147
What a pity.

174
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,267
What's wrong?

175
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:22,707
If it wasn't raining today,

176
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:23,627
I'm still thinking that

177
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,187
maybe my tennis star boyfriend

178
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,827
could teach me how to play
on this court.

179
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:29,627
What are you laughing at?

180
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:30,627
Tennis star boyfriend.

181
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,027
I'm starting to feel a little pride.

182
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,387
You are my tennis star boyfriend.

183
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,587
Okay. Let's go.

184
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,827
It's my mum's birthday this weekend.

185
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:39,026
Would you want to come?

186
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,187
Sure. This Sunday?

187
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,906
I should prepare some gifts, right?

188
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,140
(OVV)

189
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:06,747
Thank you.

190
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:08,827
Give it to me.

191
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:13,547
When I am using my boyfriend's card,

192
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,187
why do I feel such joy?

193
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,267
I'm not used to it.

194
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:15,947
You have to then.

195
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:16,947
Get used to it now.

196
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:17,707
That's because you have a

197
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:18,507
tennis star boyfriend.

198
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:18,987
Right?

199
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:21,707
Have a seat.

200
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:28,787
Aunt.

201
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:29,507
I'll introduce myself

202
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:30,467
to you once more.

203
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:31,587
I'm Song Sanchuan.

204
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,667
I'm a professional tennis player.

205
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:35,107
It's your birthday,

206
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,067
so I got you some gifts.

207
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:38,067
I don't really know

208
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,707
what to get you,

209
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,867
so I bought something practical.

210
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:43,067
Thank you.

211
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:44,427
Please sit and talk.

212
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:46,707
I heard from

213
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:48,707
You'an that

214
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,587
you really like to do Chinese paintings.

215
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:51,307
I got you

216
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,427
a pair of paperweights.

217
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,067
I hope you like it.

218
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,747
That's so thoughtful.

219
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,027
I haven't painted for a long time,

220
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:00,467
but thank you anyway.

221
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:01,947
Please sit.

222
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:03,107
There's more.

223
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,187
I also

224
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:05,787
got you two memory pillows.

225
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,187
It's supposed to be good for your spine.

226
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:07,987
You can pick

227
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,907
one that suits your sleeping style.

228
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:13,627
Thank you.

229
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,547
Come, sit.

230
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,507
Mom, don't keep staring at him.

231
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:25,987
He got up early in the morning

232
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:26,987
to take a shower and change clothes.

233
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:28,547
He's praying that this will go well.

234
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,467
Don't scare him.

235
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:30,947
Am I that bad?

236
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,187
Am I that scary?

237
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,907
No, no. That's not the case.

238
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:35,987
What are you talking about?

239
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:41,787
Alright, you two.

240
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:42,867
Sit down and eat some fruit.

241
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:44,307
I go to the kitchen and

242
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:45,387
make the meal.

243
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:46,627
We can have dinner soon.

244
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:47,387
No, aunt.

245
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:48,107
No one should let

246
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,067
the birthday girl serve them.

247
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:49,667
Let me try.

248
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:50,347
We even brought

249
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:51,267
the necessary ingredients.

250
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:53,147
You're

251
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:53,987
such a young boy,

252
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,067
yet you know how to cook?

253
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:55,467
Yes.

254
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:56,747
His food is delicious.

255
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,307
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

256
00:10:58,427 --> 00:10:59,947
Won't you try my cooking?

257
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,627
Sure then. Thank you.

258
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,227
I'll gladly try your cooking

259
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,267
thanks to You'an.

260
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,107
Don't worry.

261
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:06,987
I wanted to do this.

262
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:08,667
I'll go make food now.

263
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,067
He's not bad, right?

264
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:23,587
Yeah.

265
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:27,707
How old is he?

266
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:28,867
Twenty-three.

267
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,067
I have a gift for you too.

268
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,547
You scared me to death.

269
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,947
Let's do away with gifts

270
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:42,427
and talk about something
more substantial.

271
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,300
(Life Insurance Contract)

272
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,707
You prepared this pension fund for me?

273
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,067
How thoughtful.

274
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,907
Ask me if you can't find anything.

275
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:03,987
I'm fine.

276
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,987
When you said you could cook,

277
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,147
I didn't have any

278
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,307
expectations for the meal.

279
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,827
Now that I've seen this,

280
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:14,227
I guess you really can cook.

281
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:16,547
I haven't been cooking recently,

282
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:17,587
so I'm not sure if

283
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,347
I've overseasoned anything.

284
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:20,467
Would you want to dig in first?

285
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:21,267
Alright.

286
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:34,387
It's pretty good.

287
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,107
You'an can't cook.

288
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,067
Not even rice.

289
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,307
I can't cook,

290
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,467
but I can eat.

291
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,467
Of course, you can.

292
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:45,547
Aunty,

293
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:47,667
happy birthday.

294
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,067
Thank you.

295
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:49,707
Sit, sit.

296
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:50,547
Happy birthday!

297
00:12:58,307 --> 00:12:59,867
- Eat, eat.
- Yes, sure.

298
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:00,667
Eat, both of you.

299
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:02,267
Have some fish.

300
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,267
- Here.
- Thank you.

301
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:05,867
Have more.

302
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:07,667
This is too much.

303
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,507
Just eat.

304
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:09,427
Thank you.

305
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,587
Come, have some beef.

306
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:19,587
Here.

307
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,267
So good.

308
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:35,667
You'an, don't go home today.

309
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,227
Stay and keep me company.

310
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,227
Sure.

311
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:44,627
You'll go back on your own then.

312
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:45,467
No problem.

313
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:02,747
My boyfriend is solid, right?

314
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:06,707
Let me ask you something.

315
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:09,027
What are you doing

316
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,187
at that family's wedding?

317
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,867
You even took photos with

318
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,747
Liang Shu and his illegitimate daughter.

319
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,987
Look at your happy smile.

320
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:21,787
This is an aerial shot.

321
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,667
It's a group photo, mom,
do you understand?

322
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:24,267
Well,

323
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:25,747
should I cry instead then?

324
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:26,867
Whether or not that's a group photo,

325
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,267
you have the biggest smile there.

326
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,067
One more thing.

327
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,067
I wanted to ask you.

328
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,587
I went over to your place a few days ago

329
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,027
to give you some bayberries.

330
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:48,827
This kid was staying with you, right?

331
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:50,907
What kid?

332
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:51,947
His name is Song Sanchuan.

333
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:52,947
He's my boyfriend.

334
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:54,627
I don't like the way
you're calling him.

335
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,627
I waited so long over your place,

336
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,507
he dared not even come out.

337
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:58,867
If that's not a kid then what is it?

338
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:02,587
A few months ago,

339
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:03,907
you came in a hurry to

340
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,347
borrow so much money from me.

341
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,107
That's a huge sum over there.

342
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,907
Did you spend it on him too?

343
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:13,747
I borrowed that money because

344
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,067
during that time,

345
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,267
we ran into some problems.

346
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,907
Once I rearranged my finances,

347
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:18,867
I paid you back everything.

348
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,747
He paid me back the money too.

349
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:21,907
Mom,

350
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:23,867
he's not what you think he is,

351
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,147
someone who depends on me.

352
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,147
He is one of the best

353
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:27,227
tennis players now.

354
00:15:27,787 --> 00:15:28,867
I stand corrected.

355
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:30,907
When you two first met,

356
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,027
he wasn't the best at all.

357
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:34,427
What are you

358
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:35,347
trying to mean?

359
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,587
It's just us now,

360
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,027
spill the beans.

361
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:40,347
I'll just put this out there.

362
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,587
Your boyfriend is so young,

363
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,867
if he's not successful in the end,

364
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:47,827
and if he could still

365
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:48,707
stay in the kitchen willingly

366
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:50,507
and cook you meals like today,

367
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,787
that might really mean you're lucky.

368
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,507
However, as you said,

369
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:55,747
if he is the best athlete,

370
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,867
a future tennis star,

371
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,947
who will be the lucky one
when that day comes?

372
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,587
One plants the tree,
the other gets the shade.

373
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,227
What was it all for by then?

374
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,347
Do you want to end up like me?

375
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,307
I really hate it when you're like this.

376
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:20,467
Because you had an unsuccessful marriage,

377
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,947
you view everyone through a biased lens.

378
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:24,427
You wanted to plant this

379
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:25,347
thorn in my heart,

380
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:26,627
so are you happy now?

381
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:12,946
(Liang You'an,)

382
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:15,987
(when I gave you the wild card,)

383
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:16,827
(you promised to)

384
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,226
(fulfill my additional terms.)

385
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,067
(I hope you didn't forget.)

386
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:20,827
(Come to Young Space on Monday.)

387
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:22,426
(I'll be waiting to talk to you.)

388
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:37,027
Number 7551.

389
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:37,587
Yes.

390
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,987
Please fasten your seat belt.

391
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:43,587
Thanks.

392
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,547
Sir, can you open the rear window

393
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:46,667
for me? Thank you.

394
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:47,587
Sure.

395
00:17:59,147 --> 00:17:59,907
You scared me.

396
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:01,187
You scared me.

397
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,067
You're fast.

398
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:03,907
What were you doing? Were you going out?

399
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,227
I received your trip tracker.

400
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,980
(The trip of your friends and relatives has ended)
I'm here to pick you up,

401
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:06,867
I didn't expect you to be so fast.

402
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:14,827
What's wrong?

403
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,587
Did both of you quarrel again?

404
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,587
No.

405
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,507
I miss you.

406
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:21,987
Can't sleep without you.

407
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:26,147
Alright then, let's go and sleep.

408
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:26,707
Come.

409
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:30,467
What are you doing?

410
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,467
Let's hug and walk.

411
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:33,907
Hug and walk.

412
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,667
I really like hugs.

413
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:41,387
Can you open the door?

414
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:56,627
Jiaojiao.

415
00:18:57,947 --> 00:18:58,467
Jiaojiao.

416
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:02,307
What?

417
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,267
Are you traveling for the new year?

418
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,267
What's with all the luggage?

419
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,867
After my tournament,

420
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:08,707
Peachy and I

421
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,067
will be spending our honeymoon in Xiamen.

422
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:12,667
How carefree.

423
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:13,867
You're married,

424
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:14,867
where's the house?

425
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,027
Have you found one?

426
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:17,387
You dare go on a honeymoon.

427
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,667
Honeymoon is about living together anyway.

428
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:21,547
We save a month's rent too.

429
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,067
Isn't that great?

430
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,627
I won't give in and

431
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:24,387
help you find a place.

432
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:25,267
Dad,

433
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,427
I never gave that a thought even.

434
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:27,907
Don't you worry too much now.

435
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,107
Take care of the house, okay?

436
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,027
I'm leaving.

437
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:33,747
Coming.

438
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,227
Hello, uncle.

439
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:38,867
I'm here to pick Jiaojiao up
to go to the airport.

440
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:40,787
And,

441
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:42,867
I'm not really used to
calling you dad yet.

442
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:43,867
Please give me more time

443
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:44,707
to get used to it.

444
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,547
It's okay. I need to get used to it too.

445
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,787
We'll make a move first then, uncle.

446
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:52,227
Be safe.

447
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,587
My dad asked me today

448
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,227
when are we renting a place?

449
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,387
Should we hurry up and get this done?

450
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:07,227
I don't think it's that difficult
to find a place.

451
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,307
I'm just thinking is it

452
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:09,907
worth it for us to find a place now?

453
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:11,347
What do you mean?

454
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:12,787
Whenever it's the tournament season,

455
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,507
you'll go out and play often.

456
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,347
When you come back for training,

457
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,067
from Monday to Friday,
you'll be at the dormitory.

458
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:19,507
If we're renting,

459
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,267
we don't even stay together for ten days.

460
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,307
We still have to live together anyway.

461
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:24,987
If in a month we will be

462
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,507
together for ten days,

463
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,827
we might as well stay in a hotel.

464
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,547
It's 300 to 500 yuan a day,

465
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,027
we'll spend at most 5,000 a month,

466
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:32,547
we don't need to put down a deposit

467
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:33,787
nor do we have to pay agency fees.

468
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:35,747
We can stay anywhere,

469
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,067
and eat takeouts

470
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:38,347
wherever we want.

471
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,467
That sounds quite reasonable.

472
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,547
Really, I've been thinking for days.

473
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,107
When we're on our honeymoon,

474
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,707
we'll put this to the test.

475
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:47,787
Deal.

476
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,107
Seems quite fun,

477
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,507
and new and exciting.

478
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,627
But can we stay in better hotels?

479
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:54,427
Nope.

480
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:55,787
Unless you win enough.

481
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:57,987
When I play to stay in hotels,

482
00:20:58,347 --> 00:20:59,907
I feel quite like a breadwinner.

483
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,827
Get in the car. I'll get the bags.

484
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:10,507
Logically speaking,

485
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:12,067
when we gave you the wild card,

486
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,267
we had an agreement.

487
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,067
I think

488
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:16,027
there's nothing much

489
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,147
to discuss now.

490
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:20,187
The industry's attention

491
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,867
on Song Sanchuan owes it

492
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,027
to the wild card that was given to him.

493
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,107
Admit it.

494
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:28,267
So,

495
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,347
if he signs his business contract

496
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:31,907
with Young Space,

497
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,107
it would be a mutual achievement,

498
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:34,627
it would be good news for all.

499
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,107
Last time when I was at Young Space,

500
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:39,627
one crucial part of my job

501
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:41,507
was to sign on celebrity endorsements.

502
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,347
I know how this goes quite well.

503
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,067
Five years,

504
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,707
a signing bonus this low,

505
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,587
fixed without increase,

506
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:50,547
with the expectation of endorsing
the full product line?

507
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:52,667
Do you think this is reasonable?

508
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:55,027
Song Sanchuan is very capable,

509
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,907
we all know this.

510
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:58,667
However,

511
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:01,307
if he never participated in
this circuit tournament,

512
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,547
even if you gave him two years,

513
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:04,107
he still might not get much visibility.

514
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,787
So you're trying to use

515
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,867
the price of an underdog

516
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,147
to sign on a superdog.

517
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:13,907
Did I get that right?

518
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:20,907
I know.

519
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,707
Recently,

520
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,227
many sports brands

521
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:25,307
have approached you.

522
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:27,347
After all, this month,

523
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:30,307
Song Sanchuan's fame

524
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,227
is over the roof.

525
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,067
The sports industry hasn't

526
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,987
been this happening these days.

527
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:37,307
Which is why I'm here

528
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,947
to talk to you today.

529
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:41,907
Mr. Jiang should be handling

530
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:43,347
these operations on branding.

531
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:45,867
But I was the one whom you promised the

532
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:48,907
additional condition that
comes with the wild card.

533
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:51,707
I even promised Mr. Gao that

534
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,107
Song Sanchuan

535
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:55,027
will definitely come to Young Space,

536
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:56,547
and we signed him on

537
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:57,747
using the best price possible.

538
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:05,147
Mr. Gao,

539
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:07,907
I can't make this decision alone.

540
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:08,827
I'll have to go back

541
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:10,387
and talk to everyone before replying.

542
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:13,387
I want to know if there is

543
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,507
much room for negotiation

544
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,187
regarding these conditions
in the contract?

545
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,707
The speedier your reply,

546
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:20,147
the more room we have.

547
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,507
We're all quick decision-makers.

548
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:23,587
Don't drag it on.

549
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,467
Alright. I'll make a move first.

550
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,307
Is that a total of five boxes?

551
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:38,827
That's all then.

552
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,187
Yes.

553
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:40,947
One, two, three, four, five. All here.

554
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:43,467
Dahui,

555
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:44,987
I'll leave this cart at the door for you.

556
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:49,827
Put these three on some heads.

557
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,627
I forgot to ask you,

558
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,827
how was your meeting with
your girlfriend's mother?

559
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:01,467
It was alright.

560
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,707
Her mother was pretty polite to me too.

561
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:05,547
After I left,

562
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:06,707
they went on talking,

563
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,347
and it didn't end pleasantly.

564
00:24:09,627 --> 00:24:11,227
She must think that you are too young.

565
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:12,987
Not exactly.

566
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:16,547
Maybe her mother thinks I'm a little unreliable.

567
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:18,707
Unreli...

568
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:20,707
How could that be?

569
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:23,387
Your rankings

570
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:25,307
have been improving, going up steadily.

571
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,147
Isn't that a sign of reliability?

572
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,107
That's the reason that I'm unreliable.

573
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:37,707
She's an insightful mother.

574
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:39,667
She's one of a kind.

575
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:41,707
My babe told me

576
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,107
that's because her mother and her father

577
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,427
can't get over the divorce.

578
00:24:47,507 --> 00:24:49,387
For one plants the tree while
the other gets the shade?

579
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:51,387
Something like that.

580
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,107
When it came to me,

581
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:54,747
on top of our ten-year difference,

582
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:55,867
she'll say that I'm

583
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,227
even more unreliable.

584
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:02,267
It's going to be difficult.

585
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:06,947
But if we put ourselves in her shoes,

586
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,747
if this is my daughter,

587
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:10,307
and she got together
with such a young boy,

588
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:11,747
I'll be in doubt too.

589
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,187
However, you must believe

590
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,987
what I said.

591
00:25:17,027 --> 00:25:18,187
A man's reliability has

592
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,227
nothing to do with their age.

593
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:21,907
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,507
A loyal, dedicated man like you

595
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:24,667
who lives with me day in and day out,

596
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,147
I'm sure to be well-nurtured, right?

597
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,627
It's different knowing you

598
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:29,867
and meeting you in person.

599
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:31,707
I don't deny this.

600
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:32,947
If there were

601
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,627
world rankings like tennis,

602
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,227
I am definitely in the top three.

603
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:43,187
Oh no.

604
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:43,707
It's time.

605
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:44,787
I have to pick my babe up from work.

606
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:45,347
This...

607
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:47,387
I'll leave that to you.

608
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:52,787
I'm picking up my babe from work.

609
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:56,627
My babes,

610
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,227
you're still on the clock.

611
00:25:58,227 --> 00:25:59,307
Two more hours to go.

612
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:06,907
Are you tired?

613
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,387
Where did you go today?
Why are you tired?

614
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,147
Young Space.

615
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:15,867
Why are you at Young Space?

616
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,307
They have their eye on you.

617
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,347
What about me?

618
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:27,067
What about me?

619
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:31,267
The wild card game came with

620
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:32,627
all these additional conditions?

621
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:34,387
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

622
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,627
Back then,

623
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,587
I didn't find it necessary.

624
00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:43,267
It'll make you stressed too.

625
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:46,507
What if

626
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:47,747
I sign the contract?

627
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,507
Will you be free from Young Space's debt?

628
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:50,707
There's nothing else, right?

629
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:52,227
Nothing else.

630
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:53,707
Right now, they want

631
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,347
to close this deal as soon as possible.

632
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:56,747
Overbearing clauses and

633
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:58,347
taking advantage of others.

634
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,347
Do you think the signing bonus
is too low?

635
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:03,147
It's ridiculously low.

636
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:05,427
Five whole years.

637
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,667
Under the premise that
you maintain your current standing,

638
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:08,667
for just 300,000 a year,

639
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:09,747
fixed and no growth.

640
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,947
There may be some caveats in this.

641
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,187
Do you think that this is reasonable?

642
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:15,307
Come, eat this sweetest piece.

643
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:17,867
I think,

644
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:18,987
I think,

645
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,507
if it's just about money,

646
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,187
I don't mind signing.

647
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,387
After all,

648
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,147
that wild card game was really important.

649
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:26,507
If we owe others,

650
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:27,147
might as well pay it back.

651
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:27,747
Nothing wrong with that.

652
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,307
You're right.

653
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,827
However,

654
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,547
it's not a matter about

655
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:36,507
them paying more or less money.

656
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,667
It's a matter of value equivalence.

657
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:40,507
For an athlete,

658
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,467
their main goal is to

659
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,027
prove themselves with tournament results.

660
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:45,307
If you can bear this risk,

661
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:46,627
then that becomes a reasonable price.

662
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,827
Otherwise, your mentality will
become imbalanced.

663
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:51,467
That makes sense.

664
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:52,947
I never think

665
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:54,187
as thoroughly as you do.

666
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:00,507
I knew how they operate too well.

667
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:03,147
But it's okay, don't worry.

668
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,947
Didn't he say there's
room for discussion?

669
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,627
If you really have to sign it,

670
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:07,987
I'll help you

671
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,387
negotiate for better conditions.

672
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:11,747
I'm just letting you know.

673
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,267
I don't mind signing.

674
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:14,147
This is not

675
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:15,427
something difficult to get through.

676
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:16,747
You're right.

677
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,147
Negotiation,

678
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:20,187
is what I do best.

679
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:22,387
Let me hold that for you.

680
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:24,307
The sweetest piece, yeah?

681
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:26,027
Eat.

682
00:28:26,027 --> 00:28:26,667
For you.

683
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:30,667
That's huge.

684
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:36,707
We've secured the venue,

685
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,587
the rent has been transferred.

686
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,427
We can pick a day for opening now?

687
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,547
Has Liang Tao gotten the
promotional materials

688
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:45,987
for this club venue ready?

689
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:46,787
It's all on the computer.

690
00:28:46,787 --> 00:28:47,627
She handed it over to me already.

691
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,667
Alright. Send me when you get back.

692
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:51,507
It's Mr. Li. I'll take this.

693
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:52,147
Go ahead.

694
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:53,987
Hello, Mr. Li.

695
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,787
I was just about to call you.

696
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,387
Thank you for your support to

697
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,627
increase our budget.

698
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:00,667
We have picked out a new venue,

699
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:02,027
our coaches and other workforces

700
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,147
are already in place.

701
00:29:03,227 --> 00:29:04,427
Wait till we select a time for opening...

702
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,387
(Don't you rush into opening yet.)

703
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:09,547
(I'm calling you to talk to you about this.)

704
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:11,907
(TechMind's investment in your club)

705
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:13,747
(would be put on hold now.)

706
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,427
Put on hold?

707
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:18,147
Mr. Li,

708
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:19,787
the pre-opening funds
collected by Top Love

709
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,107
have been spent.

710
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:22,227
I don't understand

711
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,827
what do you mean by
putting things on hold.

712
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,907
(We will still invest our money,)

713
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:28,307
(but now we would like to)

714
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:29,787
(increase our operating rights.)

715
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:32,027
(If you insist on holding on to this,)

716
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:33,507
(we'll need time to reconsider.)

717
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:34,707
Mr. Li.

718
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,547
When you said you will invest in us,

719
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:37,547
we talked through the terms.

720
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:39,547
We only accept money from investors,

721
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:40,747
and prefer to operate it,

722
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:42,747
just like Top Smash, on our own.

723
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:43,427
Didn't you also choose to

724
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:44,587
invest in us because

725
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:45,707
you felt that we are doing a good job?

726
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,507
(I did. But I heard from)

727
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,627
(quite a number of people that)

728
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,747
(there are too many complications
involved in this.)

729
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:52,907
(Anyway, think about it.)

730
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:53,987
(If you're not fine with it,)

731
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:55,227
(I'm sure our next collaboration
will roll around some time.)

732
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:01,107
Did he hang up already?

733
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,627
They are not trying to

734
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:05,667
play tricks with us now, are they?

735
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:08,027
We have already spent our money on this.

736
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:13,947
I heard Mingyu say that

737
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:15,947
our investors are withdrawing themselves.

738
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:16,827
Why?

739
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:20,907
They said they wanted operating rights.

740
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,227
So I then...

741
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:23,627
It's so frustrating.

742
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,747
I can't give it away.

743
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,707
They are trying to profiteer from us.

744
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:29,907
We've already started on venues,

745
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:30,667
operations, hiring,

746
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,267
yet now they're giving us trouble.

747
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,147
This is a breach of contract.

748
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:35,787
Can we sue them?

749
00:30:36,227 --> 00:30:37,267
We can't do that.

750
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:39,067
Right now,

751
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,827
they have given us a down payment.

752
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:41,947
Also,

753
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,547
they did not explicitly say

754
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:44,587
that they are not investing.

755
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:45,867
They are just holding off.

756
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,587
If we really go for a lawsuit,

757
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:49,907
we'll just be arguing in circles.

758
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,587
Do we have alternative investors?

759
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:56,747
Today, Jiang Jie

760
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:58,867
called me out of the blue.

761
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,067
He said he's representing Young Space

762
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,547
to fill this gap.

763
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:07,227
Why is he looking for us at this moment?

764
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:13,067
You'an, I invited you over today

765
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,507
to talk about investing in your club.

766
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,787
Whether or not your club

767
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:21,387
is being divested,

768
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,427
Young Space

769
00:31:22,427 --> 00:31:23,667
is willing to invest in you.

770
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:25,867
I don't know if Alex

771
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,267
made it clear to you that

772
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:29,707
we only accept fund contributions.

773
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:30,667
We are definitely not

774
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:31,947
giving away our operating rights.

775
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:32,587
Of course.

776
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,387
I fully accept that.

777
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:36,307
We also come with one condition,

778
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,307
Young Space's capital ratio

779
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:39,867
must be the highest,

780
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:41,267
and we have decision-making power

781
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:42,587
over specific affairs.

782
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,547
Please listen to me first.

783
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:46,787
I fully believe that

784
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:49,467
Top Love will definitely soar in business.

785
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:52,747
The popularity of tennis in the country

786
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:53,987
is becoming more widespread.

787
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:55,147
However, every city

788
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,187
has its problems,

789
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:57,747
which is people find it
hard to distinguish

790
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,027
between the good and bad clubs.

791
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:01,667
There are even fewer branded clubs.

792
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:03,267
Didn't you tell me before that

793
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:05,827
your club's development will not be

794
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,507
restricted by a certain city.

795
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:09,147
If this is your plan,

796
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:11,387
Young Space will willingly invest in you.

797
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,667
Also, Young Space's execution abilities

798
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,067
are well-acknowledged by others.

799
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,307
Our collaboration is your best choice.

800
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:23,987
Today,

801
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,187
this is the first time that I felt

802
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:29,467
we were talking like equals
about collaboration

803
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:30,707
on the negotiation table.

804
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:32,427
Even though

805
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,627
the terms he raised

806
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:35,507
felt like they were trying to profit
from our difficulties,

807
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:39,467
but that's Young Space's money anyway.

808
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:41,387
When he shut us down last time,

809
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:42,427
he just did it.

810
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:43,867
If we are just talking about money,

811
00:32:43,907 --> 00:32:45,427
we just need to choose

812
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:47,187
the most suitable partner.

813
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:48,267
It is the same as
collaborating with anyone.

814
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:49,387
Also,

815
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:52,227
Young Space is an established
domestic brand.

816
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,107
Well Jiang Jie still

817
00:32:54,427 --> 00:32:56,307
has quite a good eye for making decisions.

818
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:58,907
He said he's optimistic about
our development

819
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,747
which led him to propose this
long-term collaboration.

820
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:02,827
The more we can consider,

821
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:04,747
the more I didn't want to

822
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:06,067
let them save us from this situation.

823
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:08,427
Otherwise, we will only be forced to

824
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,987
compromise a lot.

825
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:13,187
That's not a good start
for collaborations.

826
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,147
I still find it puzzling.

827
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:18,947
Our investors

828
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:20,427
pulled the brakes on us,

829
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:21,747
but it actually does not benefit them.

830
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:23,187
What were they thinking?

831
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:32,627
Jiang Jiaojiao.

832
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:38,267
What's wrong?

833
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:39,707
When I was at my tournament,

834
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,307
I overheard the organizers gossiping.

835
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:43,627
Did something wrong happen to Top Love?

836
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:46,187
Bad news spread pretty fast.

837
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:47,707
We just asked them.

838
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:48,627
It's Mr. Gao.

839
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:49,907
He was spreading rumors

840
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,467
saying Top Love is an extremely

841
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:52,267
stubborn collaboration partner,

842
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:53,747
we don't follow conventions.

843
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:56,587
When we hold the right to
operate independently,

844
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:58,587
we're just fooling around with
investors' money.

845
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:01,067
He also said that Top Love was just lucky

846
00:34:01,227 --> 00:34:02,187
to have Song Sanchuan for now.

847
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:04,147
The next franchise will never work.

848
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:07,787
Wait,

849
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:09,867
why would he say such a thing?

850
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,027
I don't know,

851
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:12,987
who knows what he's really thinking?

852
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:14,867
Okay, I get it now.

853
00:34:35,427 --> 00:34:36,107
Mr. Jie,

854
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:38,387
I didn't know that

855
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,187
you're now Mr. Gao's

856
00:34:40,187 --> 00:34:42,227
partner in crime already.

857
00:34:43,987 --> 00:34:45,227
Who did you hear that from?

858
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,107
He first got my investors to leave us,

859
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:49,346
you then immediately say

860
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:51,187
you will fill this gap for me.

861
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,147
I really almost believed it

862
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:54,907
that you really wanted to
collaborate with me.

863
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:56,427
You'an.

864
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,347
I know

865
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,547
Gao Li did promise the president

866
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,947
to sign on Song Sanchuan,

867
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:04,347
but I did not know

868
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:06,027
that he did all these behind your back.

869
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:09,067
No matter how horrible
I am as a person,

870
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,467
I would never

871
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:12,107
work hand in hand with
Gao Li to lie to you.

872
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:13,867
If you think of me this way,

873
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:16,027
I'll feel really upset.

874
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,547
If that was a misunderstanding,

875
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:21,547
I apologize.

876
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,747
However, even if both of you
aren't in this together,

877
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:26,587
I won't be able to
work with Young Space still.

878
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,987
Does it have nothing to do with
Jiaojiao's father?

879
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:43,307
It should have nothing to do with him.

880
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:45,507
So Mr. Gao is not really

881
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:46,547
trying to ruin our club,

882
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:48,707
but that's his revenge on me.

883
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:53,067
That's how he is.

884
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:56,227
Remember the marathon dummy incident?

885
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,747
He really likes to
resort to dirty tactics.

886
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:02,827
Isn't it just easy

887
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,227
to solve this problem?

888
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,707
Just let me sign the contract.

889
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,067
No.

890
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,827
We shouldn't give in especially now.

891
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:14,867
I don't want to work with them.

892
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:16,427
I don't want to.

893
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:34,467
Gao Li!

894
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:38,387
Be quiet, don't scare my fish away.

895
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,627
Were you the one to

896
00:36:40,747 --> 00:36:41,867
persuade Top Love investors to quit?

897
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:43,747
Well well, Mr. Jiang,

898
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,787
please think before opening your mouth.

899
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,387
What is your position actually?

900
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:49,347
If we do this well,

901
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:52,707
it's a win-win for both of us.

902
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:53,787
For me,

903
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:55,907
I just want Song Sanchuan.

904
00:36:56,107 --> 00:36:57,867
I want to sign on
the most popular athlete.

905
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:58,747
For you,

906
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:01,107
you just wanted to invest in that club.

907
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,787
I think it's a pretty

908
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,267
valuable business collaboration.

909
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:06,987
If it works, we will hit it off.

910
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,027
We're heading into
separate ways right now.

911
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:12,147
Now that you've been so unreliable,

912
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:14,187
all my suggestions for rationalization

913
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:15,947
are being seen to
have an ulterior motive.

914
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:19,707
Liang You'an is so stubborn that

915
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,427
she would rather

916
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,867
lose the club's money

917
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:24,827
than to compromise?

918
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:27,907
That seems like

919
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:30,827
Song Sanchuan means more than the club

920
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,067
to Liang You'an.

921
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:33,987
Then I picked the right one.

922
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:45,947
Mr. Gao, your guest has arrived.

923
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:47,427
Here he is.

924
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,180
(Young Space ​​(China) Sporting Goods
Co., Ltd. brand endorsement agreement)

925
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:06,427
This is really not some pact

926
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,707
that I made with Mr. Jiang.

927
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,947
I can only say,

928
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:10,987
after all these years,

929
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,747
both of us have some sort of
a tacit understanding.

930
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:14,667
I really had my eye

931
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:15,827
on you

932
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,547
while Mr. Jiang is interested in your club.

933
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:19,827
It's not contradictory.

934
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:21,707
It will be great if you all work with us.

935
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:24,667
I can't say for

936
00:38:25,227 --> 00:38:26,067
the club,

937
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,187
I'm here today to talk about me.

938
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:31,907
Just tell me this.

939
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:33,307
If I sign this

940
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:34,747
endorsement contract,

941
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:36,307
will you stop

942
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:37,547
messing with our investors?

943
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:45,627
Why are you back?

944
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:47,307
I thought you were
going to stay in the dormitory.

945
00:38:49,187 --> 00:38:51,387
I have something to say.

946
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:52,667
Do you want water?

947
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:53,827
No.

948
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:55,827
I swung by Young Space today

949
00:38:55,987 --> 00:38:56,947
and I

950
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,707
signed the endorsement contract.

951
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,060
(Young Space ​​(China) Sporting Goods
Co., Ltd. brand endorsement agreement)

952
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:27,067
The conditions are much better now,

953
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:28,067
and I got more money,

954
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:29,227
The five years are now three.

955
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:31,147
I was thinking I should just sign it

956
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:31,907
for it's not a big deal.

957
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:36,147
Song Sanchuan, didn't I tell you

958
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,867
I will try my best to solve this problem?

959
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:40,507
You shouldn't worry about
changing investors

960
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,427
or negotiating for better terms
in this contract

961
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:44,067
for it's very normal in the

962
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:45,347
back-and-forth negotiation process.

963
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:46,947
Now that

964
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:48,947
you can't stay put

965
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:50,067
and went on to sign the contract,

966
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:51,667
were you not thinking of others?

967
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:53,067
Don't say this out of spite.

968
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:54,867
If I sign this contract now,

969
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:55,707
wouldn't it be

970
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,187
the fastest solution to our problems that

971
00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:58,987
minimizes the loss of our club?

972
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:05,227
I mean you can

973
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:06,147
keep looking for investors,

974
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:07,507
but you will need time,

975
00:40:07,587 --> 00:40:08,387
and the club will

976
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:09,227
continue to lose money.

977
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:10,907
I know very well

978
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:12,027
how are we doing now,

979
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:13,187
and I know better what difficulties

980
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:14,467
you are currently facing.

981
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:18,387
I'd rather take a personal loss

982
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:19,947
than to let you bear it alone.

983
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:21,307
You don't understand

984
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:22,707
what do I really care about.

985
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:26,627
Why are you making your own decisions?

986
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:27,107
No. What do you mean...

987
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:28,067
I don't understand at all.

988
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:28,707
I...

989
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,347
In the end,

990
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:33,027
this contract is about me too.

991
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,387
Can't I make my own decision?

992
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:35,107
No.

993
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:38,867
This is such a big deal that

994
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:39,787
you should have

995
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:40,947
at least talked to me.

996
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:41,947
I...

997
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:42,987
I just didn't want the club

998
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:43,907
to be implicated by me.

999
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:44,987
I don't want you to feel bad about it.

1000
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:45,707
I don't need you to do that.

1001
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:46,947
I especially didn't want you to

1002
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:47,907
sacrifice yourself

1003
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:48,907
to solve any problems.

1004
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:50,907
Last time you said that

1005
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,587
you will listen to me.

1006
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,027
Did you really listen to me today?

1007
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,667
You didn't even tell me.

1008
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,627
I am really fed up with you.

1009
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:00,627
No, I'm the one who's fed up with you.

1010
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,067
Was it because you just can't accept

1011
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:02,907
when things happen,

1012
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,667
I'm the one solving it instead of you?

1013
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:06,107
Or you can't accept

1014
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:07,227
that I will become stronger than you?

1015
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:14,907
You really shouldn't have said that.

1016
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:18,187
I don't want to argue with you.

1017
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:19,747
Go back to your dormitory.

1018
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:28,987
Remember to put your stamp over it then.

1019
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:52,427
- Why are you back?
- Why are you back?

1020
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:55,867
Jiaojiao went nuts and

1021
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,107
planted a peach tree in the dormitory.

1022
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:00,187
Didn't he go on a honeymoon?

1023
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,707
He asked me to come and water it for him.

1024
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:04,547
I've watered it for quite some time,

1025
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:06,107
are there no seeds in there?

1026
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:16,067
I'm surprised that the tree will live
if you continue doing that.

1027
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:23,707
What's wrong?

1028
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:24,707
You had a fight with Miss Elder Sister?

1029
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,387
Anyway, I did nothing wrong.

1030
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:27,987
I'm not going back,

1031
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:29,547
and I will not apologize.

1032
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:32,067
It doesn't matter which of you is right,

1033
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,787
your bro is definitely on your side.

1034
00:42:34,707 --> 00:42:36,107
I'll go get some wine,

1035
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,027
we'll have a chat after that.

1036
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:38,827
