00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
In that case,

5
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
he's reliable?

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,080
After what happened,

7
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm even more sure of it.

8
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,439
Fine.

9
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
As long as you don't regret it.

10
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,800
It's your fortune to meet him.

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,640
I was biased toward him previously.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,160
I thought it through.

13
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
After so many years,

14
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
I've been hating everything

15
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
and put all my hate

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
onto you.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
It's my fault.

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
Every part of your life right now

19
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,640
is in the sun.

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
It's bright.

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
I can no longer become

22
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,800
the only dark side of your life.

23
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,960
Since I'm not that old yet,

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,160
I should go and travel

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
with my buddies.

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm going everywhere beautiful.

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,160
Go. Go immediately.

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll pay for it.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,880
We become happy when we go out.

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,520
All right.

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,240
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Yi!

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
Our Yi got 97 points.

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,480
Awesome.

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
The requirement

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,720
for that school's Men's tennis last year

40
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,880
was 91 points.

41
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,120
You got it.

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,200
97 points are safe.

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,720
Yes!

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,520
What are you doing?

45
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,840
Everyone is having fun

46
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,520
and you are

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,240
sulking here alone.

48
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,200
What's wrong?

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm asking you a question.

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,360
Actually,

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I wanted to say this before.

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
I will stop

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,319
playing tennis.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,160
I wanted to say this

56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
when I got banned.

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
Back then,

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
I felt embarrassed

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,960
if I were to leave alone.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,520
Isn't this nice,

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,000
Yi is going to study

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,760
so we can leave together.

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,680
Why?

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,920
You're stopping

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
and abandoning the club too?

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,680
Jiaojiao.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,640
You know this too.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,840
When I first

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,040
came to the tennis club,

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,240
I only followed you

71
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,120
and fooled around here.

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
Later, Liang You'an came.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,760
All of us were serious.

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,800
I am

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
also serious about it.

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,720
Later, I realise

77
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm the type of person who works hard

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,760
but has no talent.

79
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
So, I don't want to

80
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,240
fool around anymore.

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,480
After leaving the club,

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,840
I promise

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,960
to do business with my father.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
When I can also

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,360
find the thing

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,760
that I can be best at,

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,720
that means my hard work at Top Smash Club

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,440
won't be in vain.

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
I understand what you are saying.

90
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,720
What do we do?

91
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,440
Are we going on our separate ways now?

92
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
Why are you saying that?

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,920
That's impossible.

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Will the group chat

95
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
be dead silent

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
if I don't play tennis?

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
Are we no longer buddies

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
if I don't play tennis?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Besides,

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
if I'm really talented in business,

101
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,920
I will definitely

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,760
become the club's shareholder
when I return.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Also,

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
your salaries

105
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,720
will be paid by me.

106
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,560
Chen Zhe.

107
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,920
When I came to this club,

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,520
you were the first person

109
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,160
to teach me.

110
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,480
I will

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
never forget this.

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Your decision today

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,320
is a strong one.

114
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,560
I support you.

115
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,720
Chen Zhe.

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,360
I support you too.

117
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,460
Get lost!

118
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,920
You have a boss's face.

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,080
Go and become a boss.

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm telling you.

121
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
The three of us are going to become

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,640
incredible tennis players.

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,760
Don't regret it later.

124
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,960
I won't raise that flag.

125
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,680
No.

126
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Let's not be sad. All right?

127
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,080
Today is my day!

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,480
97 points!

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,640
Sure. 97 points.

130
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,360
Mr. Chen.

131
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,360
Let's do that.

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes, Mr. Chen.

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
We don't have any dishes.

134
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,080
No dishes here.

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,160
Fine.

136
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,120
Grab any food and drink

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,400
you want

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
from this street

139
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,400
and that street.

140
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm paying.

141
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
Free-flow ice cream!

142
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,960
Great!

143
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,840
We will prepare the dishes.

144
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Look at you.

145
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,680
This.

146
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,240
Boss!

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
Where's the boss?

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Give me a crate of beer!

149
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,360
Put it on the tab.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Anyone else has dreams?

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll pay!

152
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,160
Come!

153
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,719
Boss. These.

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,880
Where's the beer, Boss?

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Someone will pay for them later.

Hold on.

Let's talk outside.

163

Sure.

164
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,040
Sorry.

165
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,640
He is used to adjusting his mentality

166

before a match

167
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,120
to get used to the pace.

168
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,200
It's like this.

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,400
I think we still have some time

170
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,600
before the match

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,160
so we want to ask Mr. Sanchuan

172
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,920
to do a photoshoot
with these three outfits.

173
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,840
Sorry.

174
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
We have no time now.

175
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,760
This is very urgent.

176
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,160
We want to make a promotional poster

177
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,480
after the tournament is over.

178
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,040
You shouldn't

179
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
affect his match.

181

You were in this line of work too.

182
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,400
You should be clear.

183
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
We wouldn't have come

184
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,520
to disturb you

185

if we have a choice.

Today, he is really...

187
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,000
It's all right. Just do it.

188
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,080
Just make it quick.

It'll be quick.

190
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,840
We can do it inside the room.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,960
All right. Three, two, one.

193
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,560
Do this.

194
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,600
Yes. A cool pose.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Loosen up.

196
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Ready.

197
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,040
All right. Lower your head.

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,320
Okay. Three, two, one.

199
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,000
Can we get an action

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
of swinging the racket?

201
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,240
Yes.

202
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,040
Let's try it. All right.

203
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
Move a little.

204
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Move. Stop.

205
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
Good. Look at the camera.

206
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,439
Look at the camera. Three, two, one.

207
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,440
Another one.

208
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,600
That's enough.

209
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,840
I'm sure you got your shot.

210
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,320
There's one last set.

211
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,160
Please change into the outfit.

212
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Sorry. We really can't do it.

213
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
The first two outfits
took too much time.

214
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,960
He's going to play soon.

215
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,240
But the proposal says
these three outfits are required.

216
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,680
If I can't complete this,

217
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
I can't go back.

218
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,920
My boss will scold me.

219
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,160
Why don't you

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,320
do this outfit after the match?

221
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
It's really late.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,920
Just a jacket, right?

223
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,320
Yes.

224
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Come. I'll just put it on.

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,160
Please be quick.

226
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,840
We are really...

227
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,840
Sorry. This is...

228
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,560
It's ruined.

229
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,400
It's all right.

230
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
Perhaps we didn't check

231
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,400
the sample.

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
Why don't you go warm up first?

233
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,840
I'll come up with something.

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,560
Give it to me.

235
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,040
Sorry. I'll return

236
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,240
the outfit he has on him later.

237
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,800
Sure.

238
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,360
Thank you.

239
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,860
(Song Sanchuan, Yang Zheng)

240
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,520
Fault.

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,640
I heard this match

242
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,880
has been going on for almost four hours.

243
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,360
This opponent

244
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
is ranked a lot lower than Sanchuan.

245
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
What's wrong?

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
Do you think something's wrong
with his technique

247
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,000
or his mentality?

248
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm hanging up for now.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Talk to you later.

250
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,040
It's tough.

251
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,880
Did Coach Yan scold me?

252
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,160
It's fine.

253
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,520
Mr. Sanchuan. I got the outfit for you.

254
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,840
I still have to do the shoot?

255
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,920
Yes.

256
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,640
His match just ended.

257
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,400
It was more than four hours.

258
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
He's exhausted.

259
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
That's great.

260
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,840
After leaving the court,

261
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
it looks great

262
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,920
with him sweating.

263
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,080
His form is bad

264
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,200
and you are asking him
to smile and move around.

265
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,640
That's...

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,320
Aren't you making it tough for him?

267
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
The result won't be good.

268
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you think this works?

269
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,280
You can come to the club tomorrow

270
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,640
to do this outfit's shoot

271
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,320
or when you have another shoot,

272
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,680
just add this outfit in.

273
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I understand your trouble

274
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
but I'm really sorry for today.

275
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,040
We are

276
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,120
not working together
on a short-term basis after all,

277
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,920
right?

278
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm glad that you know that.

279
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
We are in a

280
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,840
contracted working relationship.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I believe

282
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,720
we should have

283
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
basic professional ethics.

284
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,400
You wouldn't do the shoot

285
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,400
before the match

286
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,160
and ruined our shirt on purpose.

287
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,320
I turned a blind eye to that

288
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,200
and even spoke nicely until now.

289
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,520
Do you need to be so arrogant?

290
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,960
No.

291
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,640
What do you mean

292
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,000
by ruining your shirt on purpose?

293
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I didn't even use any strength

294
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,520
and it was torn.

295
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,800
The result is still the same.

296
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,040
There's one outfit missing.

297
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,680
Okay.

298
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,160
Since you are speaking about

299
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,520
promised work,

300
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,760
let's talk about it.

301
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,360
Before he goes on the court

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,320
for his match today,

303
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,280
you brought a few outfits

304
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,160
for us to shoot it.

305
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
Did you inform us about it beforehand?

306
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,080
Did you communicate with us? No, right?

307
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,400
He also cooperated

308
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
and did the photoshoot.

309
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,320
What are you

310
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
talking about right now?

311
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,680
When I mentioned

312
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,920
a promised working relationship,

313
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,800
I was talking

314
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,040
about the ambassador contract.

315
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,400
This is included.

316
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,500
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

317
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,560
How is it?

318
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,840
Are you done venting?

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,080
Are you still angry?

320
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm not angry.

321
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
I don't feel good

322
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,360
for not playing well.

323
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,760
I will do my best

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
to avoid these things in the future

325
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,520
so they won't affect your match.

326
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,040
It's all right.

327
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,760
I know.

328
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,440
You can't stop them anyway.

329
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,400
When you told me about equal value,

330
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,120
I didn't know what you meant.

331
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
I know now.

332
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
It's fine.

333
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,800
As long as I'm good enough,

334
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
these things won't affect me.

335
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
Why are you so nice?

336
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
What do you mean?

337
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,480
I realise you are very strong now.

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,480
No.

339
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,200
Again?

340
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,600
Did I offend you?

341
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,960
Always saying I'm strong.

342
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,040
I'm impressed.

343
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
I'm not joking.

344
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
I'm telling the truth.

345
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:09,680
Do you know?

346
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
When I was watching you train
in the past,

347
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,160
I was thinking about

348
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,920
the kind of

349
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,080
matches to pick,

350
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,640
the opponent's style

351
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,760
and how you could win.

352
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,920
But when I was

353
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,480
sitting here

354
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,920
looking at you play just now,

355
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
I didn't think about anything.

356
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
It was the pure joy

357
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,320
of watching your own boyfriend

358
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,400
play.

359
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,800
I think

360
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,600
when Song Sanchuan

361
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,880
is here

362
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,280
and has a good mood tomorrow,

363
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,640
No one can defeat him.

364
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,320
Is it

365
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
exciting

366
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
and thrilling

367
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
to be carried by your boyfriend?

368
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,440
It's very exciting and thrilling.

369
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,880
Thank you, Mr. Strong.

370
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,920
Stop calling me that.

371
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,880
Remove that word.

372
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,840
Stop it. Just call my name.

373
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,400
No. You...

374
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,880
Call me Brother.

375
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,760
Quick.

376
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,720
Call me Brother.

377
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,679
I thought

378
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,560
you weren't a tacky young boy.

379
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,440
I didn't expect you to have this fetish.

380
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,639
I'm tacky.

381
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,240
I've never heard it once.

382
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,879
I want to hear it.

383
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,800
Call me Sister then.

384
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,480
Sister.

385
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,960
Sister.

386
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,800
Sister. Hurry up. Say it.

387
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:26,767
Stop it. Let's go.

388
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,720
It's almost 11 p.m.

389
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:29,761
I'm so tired.

390
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,840
Brother, let's go home and sleep.

391
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
Let's go, Sister.
Let's go home and sleep.

392
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Get changed. Hurry!

393
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,120
Oh no.

394
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,720
What's wrong?

395
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,520
Do you need to be so excited?

396
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,880
I've never heard someone call me that.

397
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I'll keep calling you then.

398
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,280
Brother.

399
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
Call me Sister.

400
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,520
Sister.

401
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
You'll have two official matches

402
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,560
this Tuesday and Thursday.

403
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,160
The remaining time,

404
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,360
you'll have one corporate match

405
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,240
and two events.

406
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,480
On Saturday,
you'll have a youth fan meeting

407
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,960
organised by Young Space.

408
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,400
Aren't there two matches this week?

409
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,400
Yes.

410
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,080
The season is ending.

411
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Look how full

412
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,280
your schedule is.

413
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,880
You don't have time
for matches elsewhere.

414
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
All right.

415
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,200
After returning to Top Smash,

416
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,760
Young Space will have
a car to pick you up

417
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,560
to visit

418
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,160
their tennis products' production line.

419
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,000
They might

420
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,560
take some pictures and videos
as materials.

421
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,440
Do you need me to go with you?

422
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,160
No need. Just take a break.

423
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,400
I'll ask Mingyu to go with me.

424
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,080
I'll return to training

425
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,000
after the visit.

426
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,560
When I think about

427
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,360
the farewell this weekend

428
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
and that Dai Yi and Chen Zhe
won't be coming anymore,

429
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,320
I feel dejected.

430
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,120
It's fine.

431
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
Let's organise

432
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,240
the party well.

433
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
Besides,

434
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,520
it's not that
we can't meet each other again.

435
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,520
Right?

436
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,680
Young Space also arranged

437
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,160
another

438
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
photoshoot for you.

439
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,360
I got them to reschedule it.

440
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,240
We should have
a good farewell with them.

441
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,000
Dear, hurry up.

442
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
Are you not done yet?

443
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,120
I'll be done soon.

444
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
You have been using the toilet
the whole morning

445
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
yet you're rushing me now.

446
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,360
The new members of the club
will arrive today.

447
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,200
I promised Coach Yan to go early.

448
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,520
Leave without me then.

449
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,520
Don't wait for me.

450
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,160
We aren't

451
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,040
going to the same club anyway.

452
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm leaving then.

453
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,880
I need to lead a training today.

454
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,160
What's the meaning of this?

455
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,560
A reward.

456
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,000
Honey.

457
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,080
You've been very career-minded recently.

458
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,800
You are always staying in the club.

459
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,680
Coach Yan said
you will be coaching new members.

460
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,560
Seems like it's true.

461
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,040
Dai Yi is leaving.

462
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,760
Chen Zhe is also leaving.

463
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,120
I know it's a good thing

464
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,400
but I keep feeling

465
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,760
that I've been too carefree

466
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,080
and only thought
about training on my own.

467
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,200
If I could

468
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,680
gather us together,

469
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,920
perhaps we wouldn't
have gone our separate ways.

470
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,400
It's better to think about the present.

471
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,600
Didn't you say it too?

472
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,280
They are going

473
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,400
to do what they want.

474
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,840
They thought it through.

475
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,600
That's great.

476
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,320
Fine.

477
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
I've thought about everything.

478
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,960
As long as I'm still here,

479
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,520
the club will stay intact.

480
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm leaving then.

481
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,840
Goodbye.

482
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,200
Don't take too long
or else you'll be late.

483
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,080
Got it.

484
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
My husband is so handsome.

485
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,660
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

486
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
New members!

487
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
I will send
a personalised nutrition plan

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,520
created by Ms. Luo

489
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
to your inbox later.

490
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,080
After training, I will create a group.

491
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,200
Announcements from the coaching group

492
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
and skill sharing

493
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,640
will be sent to the group.

494
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,360
In the future,

495
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,720
if you have any problems

496
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,760
regarding life or training,

497
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,560
you can come to me.

498
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,320
Are you clear?

499
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
Yes, Senior!

500
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,880
All right!

501
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,880
You'll be having technical training
in the morning

502
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,600
and fitness training in the afternoon.

503
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,760
Tonight,

504
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
I'll be treating all of you!

505
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,440
Thank you, Senior!

506
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
This kid is suitable to start a family.

507
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,840
Why do I feel like

508
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,240
he has changed a lot?

509
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,040
He's the senior.

510
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,720
He needs to be responsible.

511
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,240
He finally got rid of
his Crown Prince title.

512
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,840
Do you know

513
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,320
when did he start

514
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,640
having this resolve?

515
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,640
Since Chen Zhe and Dai Yi
said they were leaving.

516
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,480
Serve deeper!

517
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Every serve should be
behind the service box.

518
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,680
It's not bad.

519
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
These kids

520
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,560
have grown up

521
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
as they play.

522
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,520
Check your follow-through.

523
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,480
When will Sanchuan come back today?

524
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,600
He sent me a text

525
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,320
saying he'll be back in the afternoon.

526
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,080
The event hasn't finished yet.

527
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,600
I know what you want to tell me.

528
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,040
It does affect him.

529
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,520
His event schedule is too full.

530
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
To balance his schedule,

531
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,920
he has been making time for training.

532
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,480
I think you need to

533
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,520
think about it clearly

534
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
regarding your plan for him.

535
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,440
Whether you are looking
for short-term benefits

536
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,040
or looking towards the future

537
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,480
and think about his whole career.

538
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,360
Anyway, I think

539
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,320
this current situation

540
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
is exhausting for him.

541
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,320
I know.

542
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,120
I understand.

543
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,520
Here's what I think.

544
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,360
When he is done

545
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
with the season

546
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,840
and goes into the break period,

547
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,560
we can arrange the events again.

548
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,160
What you mentioned today

549
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,840
is too much for his schedule.

550
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
He still needs to play in the tour.

551
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,400
Why are there

552
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,800
so many events to attend?

553
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,760
There's a

554
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
jersey signing event,

555
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,600
a racket stringing performance,

556
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,920
and a fan meeting.

557
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,560
How can he train?

558
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
He's already exhausted.

559
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,080
That is why

560
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
this contract

561
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,440
seems like an advantage for us

562
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,640
of shortening it to three years

563
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
but in truth,

564
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,920
they are trying to milk

565
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
five years' worth out of us
in three years.

566
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,440
This scares me the most.

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Everything else is fine

568
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,560
but his results must not be affected.

569
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,880
Are the details
not mentioned in the contract?

570
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
How many events are they arranging?

571
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,880
The men's singles champion

572
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,480
of Shenzhen "Young Space Cup"

573
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,400
Corporate Tennis Invitational

574
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,760
is Song Sanchuan!

575
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,160
Let's welcome
the vice president of Young Space,

576
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,400
Mr. Gao Li

577
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,240
to present the trophy.

578
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:32,072
I have high hopes for you.

579
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,240
Play well for a few more years

580
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,120
and you can buy a house.

581
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,700
(Champion)

582
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,960
What do you mean?

583
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,320
What's wrong?

584
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,960
Tell Ms. Liang

585
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,840
what you told me just now.

586
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,560
What's wrong with that?

587
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,840
She is someone

588
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,680
that we trained.

589
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
This isn't something

590
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,600
that she

591
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,480
can't understand.

592
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
Liang You'an. Do you remember

593
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,440
that this wildcard

594
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,160
was supposed to be

595
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
for our marketing partner's son?

596
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,800
I remember.

597
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
Back then,

598
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
you persuaded me

599
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,960
and said it was not suitable for him

600
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,960
so it was given to Song Sanchuan.

601
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,640
Now, there's a
more suitable opportunity.

602
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,840
Next week,

603
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,800
we will organise

604
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,640
a higher tier

605
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,760
friendly match than this.

606
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,080
I think he can

607
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,200
defeat Song Sanchuan.

608
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,320
He can't win with the wildcard,

609
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,960
but he can win
against the person with the wildcard.

610
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,200
Don't beat around the bush.

611
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,920
Just be direct.

612
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,920
You want me to throw the game, right?

613
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,000
That's a serious accusation.

614
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,599
This is a friendly match

615
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,280
to make friends.

616
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,400
Is the result that important?

617
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm telling you. It's important.

618
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
I won't play these matches.

619
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,560
I understand.

620
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,520
All of you

621
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,920
are not satisfied
with the current contract.

622
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
We can pay you an extra appearance fee

623
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,000
for matches like these.

624
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,240
I can make a decision regarding this

625
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,320
and reduce his other activities.

626
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,400
Can you consider it?

627
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,480
No.

628
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,600
Liang You'an.

629
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,080
Think it through

630
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
before giving me an answer.

631
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,280
Don't overthink.

632
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
It'll be fine.

633
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,960
He dares not.

634
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,720
He can't force you

635
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,120
to do these things

636
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
and he can't go public about that.

637
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,360
What he did

638
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,440
was to test our resolve.

639
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,520
We have

640
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,200
rejected him firmly.

641
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
I think he is

642
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,000
humiliating me

643
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,120
by even suggesting it.

644
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,360
He asked me to throw a game.

645
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,600
That's ridiculous.

646
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,200
I know

647
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I signed the contract.

648
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Even forcing me to do all that

649
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,120
is fine

650
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,640
but this is

651
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,400
past my bottom line.

652
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,000
I just want to play well.

653
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,520
Why is it so hard?

654
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,560
We won't

655
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,000
allow that to happen.

656
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,920
It's fine. Go and get changed.

657
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
I will wait for you outside.

658
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,840
Also,

659
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,207
Sanchuan has already

660
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,400
reached a high standard

661
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,560
in all aspects.

662
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
In my personal opinion

663
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,480
and the coaching group's opinion,

664
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,720
we want to

665
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,960
catch up to his progress

666
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
but to be honest,

667
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,720
there will be fewer people

668
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
who can teach or guide him

669
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,960
in the future.

670
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,600
So, some things

671
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
need to be planned early.

672
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,920
Mr. Xu,

673
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,480
I've sent

674
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
the contract to your inbox.

675
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,280
Help me see

676
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,800
if there are any loopholes
in the contract

677
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,120
as I mentioned previously.

678
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,040
Sure. Thank you.

679
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,520
Luo Le!

680
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,480
Come and eat!

681
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Be careful.

682
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,280
What are you doing?

683
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Both of them are having fun.

684
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,320
Be careful. Don't fall.

685
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Is this done? This is done.

686
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,440
Here. Tan.

687
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,960
Sure.

688
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,600
Chen Zhe.

689
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,040
Everything is cooked here.

690
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
What's that over there?

691
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,760
Are you human?

692
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,560
Are you giving me a farewell

693
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,400
or are you teasing me

694
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,560
with the remaining time
you have with me?

695
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,720
That's enough.

696
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,560
I can't take this anymore.

697
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,360
Let others cook for you.

698
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,760
Our Yi is better.

699
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,440
They are all burnt.

700
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,880
Can you even eat this?

701
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
Let's make a toast.

702
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,600
Everyone's here.

703
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Right here,

704
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,280
I want to wish Chen Zhe and Dai Yi

705
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,080
to embrace their new life.

706
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,320
What are you saying?

707
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,080
Come.

708
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,960
Come.

709
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

710
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,920
Let's drink!

711
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,120
Cheers!

712
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,720
Do you all feel

713
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,320
Dai Yi has been having a positive aura

714
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,560
while playing recently?

715
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,680
A year ago,

716
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,600
someone was saying

717
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
that he didn't like tennis.

718
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,760
Yi.

719
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,320
Ms. You'an. I humiliated myself.

720
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,840
Ever since
something happened in my family,

721
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
even my parents said

722
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
I've grown up

723
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,240
but how can someone

724
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,160
grow up suddenly?

725
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Over the past year,

726
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,360
I first found the joy of playing tennis.

727
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,120
Then, I think

728
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,360
I need to be persistent

729
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
since I chose the sport.

730
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,720
Experiencing obstacles,

731
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,920
difficulties and failures
is part and parcel

732
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,760
of playing tennis

733
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,000
but after overcoming them,

734
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,360
you will become persistent.

735
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
This is what tennis has given me.

736
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
It is also what the club has given me.

737
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,320
See?

738
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,360
We are still the same, right?

739
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
We are shareholders in the club.

740
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,160
Outside the club,

741
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,880
we are also

742
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,000
gathering with all of you.

743
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,320
Besides that, I'm the best in tennis

744
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,120
among those bosses.

745
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,400
They beat others

746
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:10,481
at drinking

747
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
but I

748
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,120
beat them

749
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,000
on the tennis court.

750
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,560
So, I apologise to everyone.

751
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,520
When we meet again,

752
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
please call me Mr. Chen.

753
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,000
Mr. Chen!

754
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,920
- Hello, Mr. Chen!
- Hello, Mr. Chen!

755
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,560
Mr. Chen, pay us our salary.

756
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,520
Mr. Chen, do something realistic.

757
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,640
Is your chicken wing

758
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,400
done?

759
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,880
Yes, are you done cooking?

760
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,520
Yes.

761
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,880
Everyone gets one. Here.

762
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,560
It's mine.

763
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,680
- No.
- It's mine.

764
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
A happy couple.

765
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:38,607
It's hot.

766
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,200
Le.

767
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,920
Eat more meat.

768
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,880
Grow tall

769
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,560
and play tennis with me. All right?

770
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,200
All right.

771
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,320
All right?

772
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,560
All right. Let's play.

773
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Do you agree?

774
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,400
Fine. I can see it now.

775
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,040
I really need to leave this club.

776
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,720
It hinders my luck in love.

777
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,960
I swear to this pan

778
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,640
and wish

779
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
for a girlfriend.

780
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,120
This pan...

781
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,240
It's out.

782
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,120
I think...

783
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,760
Are you extinguishing

784
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,880
my last bit of hope?

785
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
I hope your love burns brightly.

786
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
Seriously.

787
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:11,408
Chen Zhe, thank you.

788
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
Although you are

789
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,960
always exaggerating,

790
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,040
I and

791
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,040
every member

792
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,280
of the club know

793
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,680
that you are

794
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,760
like a fireman.

795
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,640
When we are in trouble,

796
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,040
you will always be here.

797
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
I will always be here.

798
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,840
Even if I sit on the stands

799
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,320
instead of playing,

800
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
I will still

801
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,560
cheer for all of you.

802
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,880
Great! Nice!

803
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
Come. Cheers.

804
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,800
Cheers.

805
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,200
Yi.

806
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,800
All of us

807
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,960
are hoping

808
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,960
you can go out

809
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
and experience

810
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,720
the world

811
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,880
at your age

812
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,400
but no matter what,

813
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,720
if you feel tired or aggrieved,

814
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
all of us

815
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,840
will welcome you back.

816
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,200
Ms. You'an.

817
00:32:57,886 --> 00:32:58,928
When I graduate from university,

818
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,600
I will come and issue a challenge.

819
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,520
Chuan.

820
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,560
Jiaojiao.

821
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,360
I hope
you don't hang your picture behind me.

822
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,200
How arrogant.

823
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,240
Yi will always be Yi.

824
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,480
All of you must train hard.

825
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,960
I might be very good in the future.

826
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,720
Sure.

827
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,640
I believe you.

828
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,560
Time passes quickly.

829
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,320
Back then, the three of us

830
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,240
came from Beijing

831
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,720
to this small club in the South
on impulse.

832
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,400
We wanted to banish ourselves.

833
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,560
Surprisingly,

834
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,600
it was still

835
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,760
the best decision of my life

836
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,880
looking back.

837
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,760
You are right.

838
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,600
Coach Yan.

839
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't want to say this.

840
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,560
When you first came here,

841
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,440
you had a long face

842
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,360
like an emoji.

843
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,360
It was like you hated the world.

844
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,320
Yes.

845
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,680
If anyone can receive my serve,

846
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,800
he will be the captain.

847
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,560
No.

848
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,840
His face looked like this.

849
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,120
None of you can defeat me.

850
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,160
None of you.

851
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,000
I can defeat ten people.

852
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,080
I can defeat ten people.

853
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,400
During the beach training,

854
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,480
he wore a cap
and put his hands behind his back.

855
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,000
He was so cold.

856
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,160
He also carried an umbrella.

857
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,320
Don't you underestimate me usually?

858
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,160
Today, I'll give you a chance.

859
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,760
Hit me!

860
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,360
Hit me!

861
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,519
You're all grown up now.

862
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,959
You're all grown up now.

863
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,680
That's not hard enough.

864
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,360
All right.

865
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,120
All of you have grown up.

866
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,400
I wish all of you

867
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:23,840
can fly higher.

868
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,680
A toast to Coach Yan.

869
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,920
A toast to our small club.

870
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,920
To the small club.

871
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:34,880
To the small club.

872
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,080
Huo, why aren't you
finishing the bottle?

873
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,039
What?

874
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,400
I can finish it.

875
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,360
Tan. Drink.

876
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:56,407
Bring a crate.

877
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,800
Bring a bottle.

878
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,200
Xu Tan!

879
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,920
Xu Tan!

880
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,640
Coach Yan!

881
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,680
Let me tell you!

882
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,680
Tan!

883
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
They're amazing.

884
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,640
They're good.

885
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,240
This farewell party is so fun.

886
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,680
I felt a little sad before this.

887
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,480
Look.

888
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,040
Dai Yi and Chen Zhe

889
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,960
are having the most fun.

890
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,800
Look at Coach Yan.

891
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,920
Look at Coach Yan.

892
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,680
Le, I brought this yoghurt for you

893
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,200
but this one

894
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,720
is the love yoghurt
I took for your mother.

895
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,120
Can you give it to her for me?

896
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,320
It has a small heart.

897
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,480
Thank you.

898
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
This is for you.

899
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Is it delicious?

900
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,960
Help me

901
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
ask your mother if it's delicious.

902
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,600
Mom, is it delicious?

903
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,280
I think it's delicious.

904
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,000
Let's play some tennis,

905
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,600
all right?

906
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,960
Give it to me.

907
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,360
Go.

908
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Come.

909
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,840
If Coach Yan

910
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,120
doesn't teach tennis in the future,

911
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,920
he can be just like me

912
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,320
and become an excellent

913
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,960
child fitness instructor.

914
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,920
Not only that,

915
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,680
he can even become a teacher
at the kindergarten.

916
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,520
Do you think they...

917
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,240
It's possible.

918
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,200
I think so too.

919
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,160
Definitely.

920
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,600
Look at that...

921
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Try it.

922
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,840
Try this.

923
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,120
How is it?

924
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,680
It's so delicious.

925
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,400
Why do you know how to make this?

926
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,320
I'll be honest.

927
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
I prepared a lot

928
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,040
for this camp.

929
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,280
On various apps,

930
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,880
there are articles about

931
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,800
showing off to your girlfriend.

932
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,440
This is it.

933
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,560
Are you impressed?

934
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,520
Yes.

935
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,120
Try it.

936
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,760
It's delicious.

937
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,360
Right?

938
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,160
It's so sweet.

939
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,440
What are you going to do?

940
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,160
I wasted my time decorating this.

941
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,640
Don't stand up.

942
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,360
Don't let them see this.

943
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,360
It's so awkward.

944
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,600
How is it?

945
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,440
Did you make this?

946
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,800
I bought a few sets

947
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,720
to finally make this.

948
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm telling you.

949
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,240
The skills required to do this

950
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,960
is no worse than that puzzle.

951
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,960
Is this me?

952
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,840
This is me.

953
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,400
It even has a bunny hat.

954
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,160
Liang You'an.

955
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,000
It'll be fine.

956
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,840
No matter who leaves,

957
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,520
I will still be by your side.

958
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,880
Let me see.

959
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,040
Song Sanchuan.

960
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,720
I want to send you away.

961
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,960
I contacted a lawyer

962
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
and sent him

963
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,400
your contract with Young Space.

964
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,960
There are many unreasonable sections.

965
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,200
He said

966
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
if you terminate your contract
with Top Smash,

967
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,040
it'll be easy.

968
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,840
That means

969
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,320
if I want to escape from Young Space,

970
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,960
I must leave the club, right?

971
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,800
Coach Yan also said

972
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,280
with your current ability,

973
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,200
you should already

974
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,680
plan for your future.

975
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,480
So I tried looking

976
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,400
for Europe's

977
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,040
biggest agent company, TMG.

978
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,320
I sent your results and resume

979
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,280
to them

980
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,800
and they are interested.

981
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,520
They want to develop

982
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,360
the Asian tennis market

983
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,120
so they are willing to sign you.

984
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,720
They contacted

985
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,320
Spain's best tennis academy for you

986
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,000
so you can train for two years.

987
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,920
Later, they will plan all your matches

988
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
and commercial events for you.

989
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,960
What about the contract at Young Space?

990
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,560
They will compensate.

991
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,680
The compensation is low

992
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,560
so they are willing to bear it

993
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
as a transfer fee

994
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,680
for signing you.

995
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,000
So, you've thought about

996
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,040
sending me away.

997
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,320
You only tell me

998
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
after you did everything?

999
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,480
Actually, I had the resolve

1000
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,520
after Mr. Gao

1001
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,240
asked you

1002
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,240
to throw the game.

1003
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,200
I wasn't confident

1004
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,800
but I wanted to try my best.

1005
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,680
After I contacted them,

1006
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,880
they replied

1007
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,040
to my email quickly.

1008
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,880
They are actively pushing it.

1009
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,600
We need to be

1010
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,280
separated for two years.

1011
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,480
A time difference of seven hours

1012
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,000
but you will go to the best club,

1013
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,640
with the best academy and coaches.

1014
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,400
Song Sanchuan.

1015
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,080
This is an opportunity

1016
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,080
that you will

1017
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,560
never have again if you miss it.

1018
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,760
