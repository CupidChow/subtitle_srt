(Updating)

7
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:10,197
Mr. Jie,

8
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:12,997
what happened?

9
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:15,397
What's wrong with you today?

10
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:17,717
I need you to do me a favor.

11
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:19,837
You're not allowed to reject me.

12
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:23,157
Young Space owns a tennis club.

13
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:23,957
You know that, right?

14
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:26,597
Isn't that the place

15
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:27,877
where Jiang Jiaojiao
does his training at?

16
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:28,597
That's right.

17
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,317
Initially, it was built on

18
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:32,517
a vacant land owned by Young Space.

19
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:35,717
Now, I'm one of the top executives.

20
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:37,157
And that attracts unwanted rumors.

21
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:38,637
During our meeting,

22
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:39,677
Mr. Gao

23
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,157
has been targeting this club.

24
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,397
He said it's incurring losses.

25
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:44,757
Everyone in the company

26
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:46,277
understands this.

27
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,197
This is a business package.

28
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,397
It's meant for enterprise cups.

29
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:50,277
It's normal for it

30
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:51,397
to incur losses.

31
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,077
But the thing is,

32
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,197
my son, Jiang Jiaojiao,

33
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:56,597
is a member of the club.

34
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,197
Now, I'm caught in a dilemma.

35
00:02:58,477 --> 00:02:59,237
I don't know

36
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,277
if I should close it down or not.

37
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:03,877
Mr. Jie.

38
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,237
I don't understand.

39
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,077
How can I

40
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:08,277
help you with this?

41
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:16,877
Can you

42
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:18,837
take over the club?

43
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:21,317
Can you do me this favor?

44
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:27,117
I no longer want to have anything to do

45
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,117
with Young Space.

46
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:29,437
This has nothing to do with Young Space.

47
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:30,917
Young Space only
provides it with funding.

48
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:32,437
It doesn't care about the rest.

49
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,877
You can manage the club

50
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,077
with your own method.

51
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:39,197
Mr. Jie, thank you.

52
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,677
But to be honest,

53
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:41,197
I've never worked

54
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,397
as a club manager before.

55
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:43,597
I don't think

56
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:44,237
I can do you this favor...

57
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,077
Don't reject me first.

58
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:47,877
Think about it.

59
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,597
Why did you leave Young Space

60
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:50,997
in the first place?

61
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:53,197
What was the reason you started working?

62
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:56,757
Didn't you do it so that
you could take the lead

63
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:58,157
and become independent?

64
00:03:58,397 --> 00:03:59,677
Right now, there's a great opportunity

65
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:00,517
right in front of you.

66
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:02,557
You can take the lead

67
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:03,877
and be independent.

68
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:05,117
Why aren't you

69
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:06,517
grabbing hold of this opportunity then?

70
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,677
Sometimes, we're only

71
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,917
scaring ourselves.

72
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,117
Mr. Jie, I've decided.

73
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:33,397
I'm willing to take over

74
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:34,397
the tennis club.

75
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,357
Remember. Lift your hips.

76
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:42,517
After that, move your body

77
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:43,117
by swinging your arms.

78
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:43,797
Here.

79
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:44,757
Eight.

80
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,717
Land with your feet at shoulder width.

81
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,077
Nine.

82
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:49,597
Alright.

83
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,637
Okay. Let's take a five-minute break.

84
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:52,477
You're free to move around.

85
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:53,157
Go now.

86
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:54,597
Song.

87
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:56,477
This is the latest batch

88
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:57,237
of sports equipment.

89
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,317
Keep it in the classroom.

90
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,317
Alright, no problem.

91
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,237
Everyone, take note.

92
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,517
The survey for the gifts

93
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:02,357
for this year's

94
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:03,757
Fun Day

95
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,677
has been sent to your emails.

96
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,357
Please do the survey for me first.

97
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,557
Coffee vouchers, hair shampoo,
electrical fan?

98
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:10,917
Miss, it's the same every year.

99
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,237
There's nothing new at all.

100
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:13,477
If you have any good ideas,

101
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,317
you can bring it up.

102
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:15,397
We have a limited budget.

103
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:16,477
Mind the budget.

104
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:17,677
You guys know it too.

105
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,117
I think we should remove hair shampoo
from the gifts.

106
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:22,597
Most wage slaves are bald anyway.

107
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:23,557
Giving them hair shampoo is meaningless.

108
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:25,437
I think giving them wigs is better.

109
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,197
Wigs?

110
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:28,277
That's right.

111
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:29,717
Lately, I discovered

112
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:31,077
that influencers

113
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:33,277
bring at least three wigs with them
when they go outside.

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,100
(Wigs are a part of my daily life ever
since I experienced hair fall issues.)

115
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,677
This is pretty interesting.

116
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,637
Is this expensive then?

117
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,597
They won't be if we buy them in batches.

118
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,237
A better hair shampoo

119
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:43,197
already costs around 100 yuan.

120
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,277
And, we can use this repeatedly.

121
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:45,077
Alright.

122
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:45,917
We'll buy this then.

123
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,237
I'll leave the purchasing

124
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,037
to you then.

125
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:49,277
Don't worry, Miss.

126
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:50,597
I'll definitely

127
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,677
find a wig shop

128
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,837
with the best value for money.

129
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,660
(Ancong Wig Shop)

130
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,517
Ms. Liang, please go ahead.

131
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:57,997
These are only parts of my collection.

132
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,037
I still have other wigs
in the warehouse.

133
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,700
(Handmade Female Wig)

134
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:02,837
Look.

135
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:04,557
I've introduced everything I have.

136
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,357
How many wigs

137
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:07,397
will you order then?

138
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,357
Give me 500 of the best wigs you have.

139
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:13,877
Ms. Liang, have a seat.

140
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:14,797
Please sit down.

141
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:15,557
Let's talk this over.

142
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:16,317
Chuan!

143
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,157
Chuan, make me some excellent tea.

144
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,477
Use the one in the white container.

145
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:20,517
The one I always drink.

146
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:22,717
Ms. Liang,

147
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:24,037
you have great taste.

148
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:24,877
Listen.

149
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:25,797
Our wig shop

150
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,397
is definitely the cheapest

151
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:28,717
and best wig shop
you can find in the city.

152
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:30,397
The age range of our employees

153
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:31,237
is between

154
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:32,597
20 to 50.

155
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:33,477
And, some of them are bald

156
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,077
in the front, the middle, and the back.

157
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:35,837
If that's the case,

158
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:36,917
what kind of wig should I choose?

159
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:37,637
That's simple.

160
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:38,317
Let me introduce them.

161
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:39,157
If you're bald in the front,

162
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,237
we have fake bangs here.

163
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:41,197
Here they are.

164
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:42,557
If you're bald in the back, we have
back wigs.

165
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:43,557
If you're bald at the top,

166
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:44,077
we have top wigs.

167
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:44,917
You can choose them.

168
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:46,877
Our sponsor is here.

169
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,917
Here, please have some tea.

170
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,397
Your staff is pretty handsome.

171
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,477
He's not my staff.

172
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:57,437
He's my son.

173
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:04,357
Thank you for your support.

174
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:04,877
Do you know something?

175
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,197
It's been so long since I drew my eyes.

176
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:07,477
Both my eyeliner

177
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:08,477
and mascara dried up.

178
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,557
You're so lucky.

179
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,477
I bought new clothes

180
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:13,917
for the celebratory dinner.

181
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:14,717
I brought them here for you.

182
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:16,997
Pick whatever you like.

183
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,437
If so, I have to pick a grand one.

184
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:20,837
I thought you were just

185
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,077
heading to the tennis club?

186
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,037
Do you need to make it so grand?

187
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,917
This is my first time reporting for duty

188
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,837
after taking over it.

189
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,237
Of course I have to be formal about it.

190
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,637
Fine then.

191
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:35,357
I'll give you a wavy hairstyle.

192
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:37,157
No need for that.

193
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:38,156
Look at my hair length.

194
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,317
It's easier

195
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:39,837
if you just

196
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:40,277
get me a wig.

197
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,717
A wig, huh?

198
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,197
What do you think?

199
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,036
Are you charmed?

200
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:46,837
You're gorgeous.

201
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:49,237
I've arrived.

202
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:51,317
How do you feel?

203
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:56,397
It's different

204
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,157
(Young Space Tennis Club)
from the profile detail I saw.

205
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,357
There's a sense

206
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:00,237
of desolateness to it.

207
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:02,677
No matter what,

208
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:04,037
since I'm already here,

209
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:05,597
I should take a look.

210
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,260
(Young Space Tennis Club)

211
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,197
Are you from Young Space?

212
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:12,997
That's right.

213
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,517
It's a large enterprise.
There are plenty of benefits.

214
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:16,277
Ms. Liang,

215
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,837
I've contacted the supplier.

216
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,117
They have 500 sets of wigs ready to go.

217
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,157
Just tell us when you need them.

218
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:21,877
I need them in three days.

219
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:22,957
No problem.

220
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,877
I'll sell them to you
at a direct sale price.

221
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:26,637
Okay.

222
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:28,277
Goodbye.

223
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:28,997
Take care.

224
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:30,237
Goodbye, hunk.

225
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,037
What?

226
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:36,837
What?

227
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:38,477
How could you be so dense?

228
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:39,877
Look at the way

229
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:40,917
she's talking to you.

230
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,437
She's interested in you.

231
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:44,237
Do you even know how to chat with girls?

232
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,837
I'm just trying to avoid
any awkward conversations.

233
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:47,597
Listen.

234
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:48,757
You're the reason

235
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:49,877
you're single until now.

236
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:53,997
I'm entering the court.

237
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:56,677
It's pretty good.

238
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:01,677
This court

239
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,597
is huge.

240
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:06,557
Babe,

241
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,437
can you imagine

242
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:09,837
that there are

243
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,357
7 to 8

244
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,677
sweaty young guys

245
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,557
running around

246
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,277
and training their muscles
in front of you?

247
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:18,957
Liang You'an,

248
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:22,037
what's wrong with you?

249
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:23,437
You like

250
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,837
your new job already?

251
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,877
How do I put it?

252
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,397
I feel like this job

253
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,397
is pretty good for my mental health.

254
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,157
Alright, I'll hang up first.

255
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,557
Liang You'an.

256
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,757
What are you doing here?

257
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:47,797
Hello, everyone.

258
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,277
I'll introduce myself.

259
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,317
My name is Liang You'an.

260
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,517
From now on,

261
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:53,677
I'm the acting manager

262
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:54,837
of this club.

263
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,877
Please take care of me.

264
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,597
So, you're the new manager?

265
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:02,397
Hello.

266
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:04,437
You must be Coach Wang.

267
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:06,757
I'm Wang Guochao, the main coach here.

268
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:07,637
Nice to meet you.

269
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:09,637
This must be your first day here.

270
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,717
You haven't visited
your office yet, right?

271
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,357
I'll bring you there.

272
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:14,437
Thank you.

273
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:15,437
Come.

274
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:17,357
This place is pretty nice.

275
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:22,837
So, she's the new manager Dad mentioned?

276
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:24,997
For our club,

277
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:26,877
it's half professional
and half commercial.

278
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:29,077
Our income mainly comes from

279
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:31,037
the membership subscriptions
of club members.

280
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,277
The hardware facilities here
are pretty complete.

281
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,917
We have four indoor courts

282
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,197
and 14 outdoor courts.

283
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:36,997
Back then,

284
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:38,557
Mr. Gao Teng

285
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:41,677
loved to play tennis.

286
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,437
After that, he quit tennis as his waist

287
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,157
couldn't stand it.

288
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:46,037
But he kept the venue intact.

289
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:49,197
This is the manager's office.

290
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,517
Thank you.

291
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,877
The previous manager

292
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,157
rarely came here.

293
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:56,877
He didn't touch anything.

294
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,437
Everything is new here.

295
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,277
I'll resume my training then.

296
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,317
Thank you.

297
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,637
The finance department
will look for you soon.

298
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,077
I knew

299
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,077
that the club

300
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:20,757
had poor management.

301
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:22,117
But I never expected it

302
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,197
to be penniless.

303
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:25,757
Next Monday

304
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:27,117
is payday.

305
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:27,957
Ms. Liang,

306
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:28,877
please return to the group

307
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:30,317
and ask them to approve our budget.

308
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:31,237
Approve our budget?

309
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,437
Yes, that's right.

310
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:33,317
That means

311
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:34,957
we need to ask the group for money.

312
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,397
I understand what you mean.

313
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:38,277
But I thought we should

314
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,917
pay them periodically?

315
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,037
We have to endure grievances
since we aren't doing well.

316
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,157
Only our club has to ask

317
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:43,637
the group

318
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,237
for money every month.

319
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:47,237
The previous manager

320
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:47,797
quit

321
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:48,597
as he couldn't

322
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:49,397
stand the humiliation.

323
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:54,197
Ms. Liang,

324
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,277
I've already written down
this month's expenses

325
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:57,437
and reimbursements.

326
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,757
Do you need me to accompany you back?

327
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:04,597
Forget it.

328
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,077
You don't need to come.

329
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:07,157
I'll go back myself.

330
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,237
I'm pretty close with

331
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:09,277
Young Space's finance department.

332
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:09,957
This shouldn't be

333
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:10,997
too hard.

334
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,597
Coach Wang,

335
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:15,757
please send me the details

336
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,157
of the players.

337
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,590
(Jiang Jiaojiao)

338
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,357
Jiang Jiaojiao,

339
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:28,997
prince of the tennis club.

340
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:30,557
Whenever he's there,

341
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:32,437
everyone will suck up to him.

342
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:33,397
He's a typical athlete

343
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,477
who bought his way into the team.

344
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,660
(Prince of Young Space Tennis Club)
(Core figure of the team)

345
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,700
(Bought his way into the team)
(Not too good, not too bad)

346
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,357
Until now, his career

347
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:41,317
still can't sustain his living hood.

348
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:42,237
His prize money

349
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,597
can't even cover his transport fee.

350
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,870
(Chen Zhe)

351
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:45,637
Chen Zhe,

352
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:47,637
he came together with Jiaojiao.

353
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:48,837
At most,

354
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:50,397
he's just an amateur tennis player.

355
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:52,557
He's very casual
when it comes to training.

356
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:53,677
He'll play for a while
when he's in a good mood.

357
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:54,877
He'll go home when he's tired.

358
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,590
(Professional Tennis Amateur, strive
for leisure instead of excellence)

359
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:56,557
Look at his size.

360
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:57,837
He came here

361
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,877
just to work out.

362
00:13:58,877 --> 00:13:59,877
Take a break.

363
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,117
Let me show you something cool.

364
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,437
Let me show you something.

365
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,037
The shades I ordered from France

366
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,277
just arrived yesterday.

367
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:08,477
It was imported here.

368
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,150
(Dai Yi)

369
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:12,997
Dai Yi.

370
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:15,037
He's pretty serious
during training sessions.

371
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,117
He comes here every day.

372
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:17,637
Not only does he come here to train,

373
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,317
but his mother also comes here
to pick up tennis balls for him.

374
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,990
(Mommy's Boy, work hard so that he
won't need to play tennis in the future)

375
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,637
She's trying

376
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:22,597
to save up more time for him.

377
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,077
However,

378
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,117
he didn't work hard

379
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,677
so that he could turn into
a professional tennis player.

380
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,077
He just wanted to use tennis

381
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,277
as a platform to
launch him into university.

382
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,877
It's like he joined the tennis club

383
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:31,037
just to prepare for the NCEE.

384
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:33,157
As for the rest,

385
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:35,117
they're worse than these three.

386
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,477
I don't think I need
to introduce them to you.

387
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,117
Walk properly.

388
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:50,117
You'll sprain your ankle.

389
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:51,917
You see,

390
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,037
I feel refreshed

391
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,757
after I started to join you
for the morning jog.

392
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:56,757
Yeah, right?

393
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:58,317
I'm a good trainer, right?

394
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,557
By the way, did you take the job offer?

395
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:02,437
How is it?

396
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:04,357
It's worse

397
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:05,757
than I thought.

398
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:07,237
Not only are the players terrible,

399
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:08,517
but we lack funding too.

400
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:09,397
Later,

401
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:10,917
I need to go to Young Space
and ask them for money.

402
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,157
It's fine.

403
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:13,837
I'm still here for you.

404
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,757
If it doesn't work out,
you can still work as a dog walker.

405
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,517
No matter if it's jogging,

406
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:39,397
one's talent,

407
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:40,557
or body type,

408
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,117
all of them are the best.

409
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:42,997
Some people

410
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,877
are born to play sports.

411
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:46,437
In the end,

412
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,597
they give up without a fight.

413
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,197
Don't tell me

414
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:52,837
you have no regrets?

415
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,197
Are you satisfied with it?

416
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:57,677
I don't like that.

417
00:15:58,197 --> 00:15:59,357
Uno reverse!

418
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:02,797
You're so childish.

419
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,310
(Young Space)

420
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:20,997
Lulu.

421
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:23,037
Ms. You'an? Why are you back?

422
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,077
I'm looking for Ms. Li.

423
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:24,957
Ms. Li?

424
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:26,197
She just went outside.

425
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:27,997
This can't be.

426
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,877
I made an appointment with her at 10 a.m.

427
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,517
I'm not too sure either.

428
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,060
(Finance Office)

429
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:37,317
Liu.

430
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,437
Liang You'an?

431
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:40,717
What are you doing here?

432
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:42,397
I came to ask Ms. Li
to approve my budget.

433
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:43,917
Can I sit here for a while?

434
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:45,117
Go ahead.

435
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:29,437
Liang You'an,

436
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:30,677
it's lunchtime.

437
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,997
You...

438
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,316
Got it.

439
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:36,597
Sorry for the interruption.

440
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:03,797
Here.

441
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:04,917
You'll feel better.

442
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,157
I'm not hungry.

443
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:10,717
I thought you were highly regarded
in the company?

444
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:11,637
But it seemed to me

445
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:12,757
that you didn't do as well as I thought.

446
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,957
They wasted your morning.

447
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,117
Aren't you angry?

448
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:22,397
I know you're free.

449
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,277
You can continue to wait then.

450
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:24,917
I have plenty of work to do.

451
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:47,757
Liang You'an,

452
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:48,917
you're still here.

453
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:51,077
You can come back tomorrow.

454
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,597
I made an appointment with you.

455
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:53,677
I'm used to

456
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,917
fulfilling my appointments.

457
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:57,437
Ms. Li,

458
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,317
these are last month's expenses

459
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:01,917
and next month's budget

460
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:03,317
that was prepared by
our finance department.

461
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:04,357
Please take a look.

462
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,397
Please approve it

463
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,597
if there's no issue.

464
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,757
I've never heard of any department

465
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,517
that has to ask for money every month.

466
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:11,637
What about this?

467
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,237
Just tell us what you want us to change.

468
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:14,317
At the very least,
you should give us money

469
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:15,677
according to seasons.

470
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:18,237
Liang,

471
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,037
has it been too long since you
pasted receipts?

472
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:21,117
Look at

473
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,637
how messy they look.

474
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:24,277
They don't tally too.

475
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:25,797
I can't approve it.

476
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:31,917
You'an,

477
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:33,957
why are you pasting them yourself?

478
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:34,917
Find me next time.

479
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:35,997
I'll paste them for you personally.

480
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:38,637
Mr. Jie is busy.

481
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:39,677
You shouldn't trouble him.

482
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:40,917
You shouldn't paste them yourself too.

483
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:42,757
Sure, thank you.

484
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,797
I'm not trying to
make things difficult for you.

485
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:02,477
But when it comes to money,

486
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:03,877
there are certain regulations
we need to follow.

487
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:05,957
Since you just took over the club,

488
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,877
you need to fill the hole first.

489
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,877
After that, you can find Mr. Jie
and ask him to approve it.

490
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,117
Alright, I got it.

491
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:23,957
Leave.

492
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:33,510
(Marketing Department)

493
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:34,597
Hello, guys.

494
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:38,997
Ms. You'an?

495
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:40,557
What are you doing here?

496
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:41,677
I'm here to find Mr. Jie.

497
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:42,797
Is he back?

498
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:44,397
He hasn't returned yet.

499
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:45,437
Why don't you wait here?

500
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:46,477
Sure.

501
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:47,877
I'll get you a drink.

502
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:48,717
It's okay.

503
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:49,717
I already drank a lot.

504
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:51,157
Resume your work. Forget about me.

505
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:55,117
Mr. Jie and the rest are back.

506
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:00,677
Ms. You'an,

507
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,357
the meeting didn't go well.

508
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:04,797
He's in a bad mood.

509
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:06,677
It's best if you wait a little while

510
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:08,277
before you talk to him.

511
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:09,717
Okay.

512
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:31,957
Mr. Jie,

513
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:33,517
I know you don't wish to see me.

514
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:34,237
But I still need

515
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,677
to take up a little of your time.

516
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:36,557
Ms. Li said

517
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:37,797
I need your special approval for

518
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:38,557
the previous manager's

519
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:39,597
overspending

520
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,237
before I can head to
the finance department

521
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:43,157
and acquire the funding for next month.

522
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:44,637
You'an,

523
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:47,077
I can't approve your budget.

524
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:48,597
This club

525
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,437
is the worst business

526
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:51,877
that the company owns.

527
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,397
My son, Jiang Jiaojiao,
is a member of the club too.

528
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:55,757
I have to avert suspicion.

529
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,237
How can I

530
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:58,797
approve the budget for you?

531
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:00,517
Why would I beg you

532
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:02,237
to take over the club

533
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:03,677
if it was easy to handle?

534
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:10,597
You didn't need to
brush me off like that.

535
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:11,717
Fine.

536
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,317
I won't beg for your special approval.

537
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:14,397
Now,

538
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:15,277
I'm in charge of the club

539
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:16,797
that everyone despises.

540
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:19,917
I will make it better.

541
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,477
It just has a negative starting point.

542
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:23,957
It's just like me.

543
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,237
When I was working
as an executive assistant,

544
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,157
I was like

545
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:28,197
a robot

546
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:29,797
running on the treadmill non-stop.

547
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,677
It seemed like

548
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:32,637
I was working non-stop.

549
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:33,677
But in reality,

550
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:34,717
I was always in the same spot.

551
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:35,917
Most importantly,

552
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:36,997
even the slope and speed

553
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,757
were determined by someone else.

554
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:40,837
But now,

555
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:41,837
I've experienced the joy

556
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:43,677
of making progress in the world.

557
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:45,877
I would like to thank someone

558
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:47,957
who came in abruptly

559
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:49,077
and remove the cord

560
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:50,597
of the treadmill for me.

561
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,477
The inventory count
of our office supplies

562
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:20,437
is wrong.

563
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:21,917
What do you mean by that?

564
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,797
We can only use half of
the notebooks and pen.

565
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:25,757
The company wants to cut its expenses.

566
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,197
Try not to be wasteful with them.

567
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:29,437
Why haven't I heard about that?

568
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:30,837
Everyone in my office had taken them.

569
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:32,437
That's why we ran out of
office supplies for you.

570
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:34,557
You must be a newcomer.

571
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:37,917
Do you know what's going on?

572
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:41,437

573
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:42,637
By the way,

574
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:44,637

So, you're picking on me, huh?

578

584
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:08,237

celebrated it for me.

594

595
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:50,557
Are you trying to get yourself drunk?

596

I only dare to ask you this

599
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:02,757
after you retire from the team.

600
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:07,277
Say, back then,

601
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,117
why couldn't you

602
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:11,237
play badminton

603
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:12,917
after you found out that
your mother fell sick and left us?

604
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:15,837
Can you tell me the truth?

605
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:28,197
So, it's Tong Lu's birthday.

606
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:29,717
No wonder.

607
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,317
Fine.

608
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,037
I'll only tell you this once.

609

Listen closely.

610
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,757
During the first few years she left,

611
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:52,157
honestly, I felt

612
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:53,877
relaxed.

613
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:56,557
The burden on my shoulders

614
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:57,637
was finally gone.

615
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,197
But I was still driven.

616
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:00,637
That's why I played well

617
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,437
during the first two years.

618
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,437
But after that, I found the letter

619
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:06,317
you hid under the bed.

620
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:07,117
You know that, right?

621
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:14,437
I did my research.

622
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,037
The biggest cause of her illness

623
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,197
was unhappiness.

624
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:19,837
It came from her emotions.

625
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:21,957
Maybe it started because

626
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:22,677
I failed to become the champion.

627
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:23,997
That's not right.

628
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:27,357
I was the cause of her illness

629
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:29,077
ever since I was born.

630
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,197

Do you dare to say that I was wrong?

632
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:35,197
She was seriously ill.

633
00:26:35,517 --> 00:26:36,637
Even so, she left the family.

634
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:38,357
To me, it didn't seem like

635
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:40,837
she wanted to avoid dragging us down.

636
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,317
It seemed like she didn't
want to forgive me.

755
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,157
or lower bodies.

756
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:31,557
This form

757
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:32,317
can serve as a type of

758
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:33,477
supervision.

759
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:36,837
My father sent you here

760
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,037
as a demotion, right?

761
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:39,037
You should stop

762
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:40,397
after putting on an act.

763
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:42,277
Why are you being so troublesome?

764
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:44,837
It doesn't matter to me.

765
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,157
I don't care what you guys

766
00:32:46,237 --> 00:32:46,757
want to do.

767
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:47,797
Just don't let me do them.

768
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:48,797
I came here

769
00:32:48,877 --> 00:32:49,997
to relax.

770
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:51,477
If it doesn't work out,
I'll go to another club.

771
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:54,597
So, we're just here

772
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:55,437
to have a casual chat?

773
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:56,797
It's nothing serious, huh?

774
00:32:58,597 --> 00:32:59,717
If so, I'll resume my training.

775
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:01,357
Let's go and play tennis.

776
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:04,437
Let's go.

777
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:21,917
Don't blame them.

778
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:23,317
These children are hard to motivate.

779
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:25,757
A club and a sports academy

780
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,437
are two different things.

781
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:29,717
Many players in the sports academy

782
00:33:30,037 --> 00:33:31,797
come from poor families.

783
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:32,797
They go there to earn money.

784
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,917
They train with everything they have.

785
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:36,837
Producing result is
the only thing on their mind.

786
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:40,637
The kids in the club

787
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:42,437
are well-off.

788
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:45,117
If he doesn't want to do it,

789
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:46,837
your forms

790
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,717
won't work on him.

791
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,757
I think you hit the nail on the head.

792
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:52,957
These guys

793
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,117
are used to an easy life.

794
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:56,037
They don't have the determination to win

795
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,437
or the motivation to strive.

796
00:33:58,157 --> 00:34:00,117
They're way inferior

797
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,157
to professional athletes.

798
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:06,357
Can you recruit someone good then?

799
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:11,437
I know an athlete

800
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,877
who has great potential.

801
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:14,357
I want you to see

802
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:15,757
if he can do it.

803
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:19,196
54, 55, 56,

804
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:21,837
57, 58, 59!

805
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,317
So, you meant

806
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,877
a talented badminton player?

807
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,156
But of course.

808
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:31,196
There are plenty of badminton talents
in China.

809
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,517
Plenty of them have tried
changing to tennis too.

810
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:36,117
Some of them actually managed
to produce great results.

811
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:38,317
Which child do you mean?

812
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:39,877
The middle one.

813
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:40,837
He's slightly older than them.

814
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:43,917
The one in the middle?

815
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:45,716
The one who's juggling the shuttlecock.

816
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:47,837
You mean the coach?

817
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:58,117
I know this field is new to you,

818
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,196
but I didn't expect you

819
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:00,437
to be so bad at it.

820
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,397
Do you know how old is he?

821
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:03,557
He must be in his twenties.

822
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:06,037
Changing from badminton to tennis
in his twenties?

823
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,917
This is unheard of.

824
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:13,797
I want him anyway.

825
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:21,557
You want me to play tennis

826
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:22,597
for your club?

827
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:24,957
Liang You'an,

828
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:26,597
have you earned

829
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:27,957
too much from the sports industry?

830
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,677
Is that why
you're taking sports lightly?

831
00:35:29,717 --> 00:35:31,117
You want a badminton player

832
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:33,117
to save your tennis club?

833
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:36,957
There's another reason.

834
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:37,517
I don't want to see you

835
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:38,797
leave the sports industry
just like this.

836
00:35:39,157 --> 00:35:40,317
If you can join us,

837
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,597
at least those kids

838
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:42,917
will have a target to strive for.

839
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,317
At least they can refer to you.

840
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,637
You're the best

841
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:46,957
professional athlete I know.

842
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:48,557
I'm no longer a professional.

843
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:51,117
And, you manage a tennis club.

844
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:52,917
I'm a badminton player.

845
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:54,677
However, you started out
by playing tennis

846
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:56,277
from eight to ten years old.

847
00:35:57,477 --> 00:35:58,757
You actually found that out?

848
00:35:58,877 --> 00:36:00,117
Seems like you're bent on recruiting me.

849
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:01,877
I know you studied in
the sports university's

850
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:02,757
affiliated primary school.

851
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:03,877
My guess is

852
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,037
that you wanted to choose tennis.

853
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,797
However, due to your mother,

854
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:09,477
you could only choose badminton,

855
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:10,197
right?

856
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:19,077
You said so yourself.

857
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,797
It's the enlightenment
from eight to ten years old.

858
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:23,637
It's been more than a decade.

859
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:24,637
I've forgotten everything.

860
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:25,597
That's even better.

861
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:26,637
You can start from scratch.

862
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,317
You can be their training partner.

863
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:28,517
The kids in the club

864
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,037
have it too easy.

865
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:31,637
I need someone fierce.

866
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:33,717
I need a fierce athlete

867
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:34,717
to motivate them.

868
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:35,557
I've been working in

869
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,637
this industry for a long time.

870
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:38,117
I know

871
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,237
what an excellent athlete

872
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:39,757
looks like.

873
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:41,197
Song Sanchuan, you're very talented.

874
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:42,397
I believe you still have

875
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:43,917
that drive inside your heart,

876
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:47,677
am I right?

877
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,557
Fine. Tell me then.

878
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,277
I'm a 22-year-old athlete.

879
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:03,997
Now, you want me
to change my profession?

880
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,597
Is it even possible?

881
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:20,037
No one has done it before.

882
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:27,317
But you're Song Sanchuan.

883
00:37:27,357 --> 00:37:28,517
I would never dare to imagine it

884
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:29,957
if it was someone else.

885
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,797
Do you know something?

886
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:33,037
I didn't tell you the result

887
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:33,877
for the fitness test.

888
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:35,037
But now, I can tell you.

889
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:36,357
You were better than Jin Yi

890
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:37,077
in all aspects.

891
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:37,997
You even exceeded

892
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,437
most professional athletes.

893
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,517
Liang You'an,

894
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:42,117
I retired

895
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:43,677
because I wanted to.

896
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:44,757
If you still

897
00:37:44,797 --> 00:37:46,037
mind this issue

898
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:48,677
and you wish to make it up to me,

899
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:50,717
you can forget about it.

900
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,077
I know you're traumatized.

901
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:57,637
You think

902
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:58,877
people always abandon you.

903
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:00,437
You think your mother abandoned you.

904
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:02,717
You think your team abandoned you.

905
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,597
You think badminton abandoned you.

906
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:06,997
You may not believe me,

907
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,717
I led the same life as you

908
00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:10,637
even though I'm more than
ten years older than you.

909
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:12,357
I had no right to decide.

910
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:15,557
Do you know something?

911
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,997
I decided to leave Young Space

912
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:18,717
all because of

913
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:19,997
what you said.

914
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:22,837
Sometimes, giving up takes more courage

915
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:24,517
than persevering.

916
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,597
That's why I left.

917
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:27,797
I joined the tennis club

918
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:28,837
without caring for
other people's opinions.

919
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:30,237
It's also because you said

920
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:32,597
we're the ones scaring ourselves

921
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:34,477
sometimes.

922
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,557
I thought it was strange too.

923
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:38,357
All those things

924
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:39,437
that I hesitated

925
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:40,517
to decide,

926
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:41,557
I figured them out

927
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:43,077
by listening

928
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,117
to your simple words.

929
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:48,237
Were my words

930
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,157
that impactful?

931
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:54,717
I was touched

932
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:55,557
by the bravery hidden

933
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:56,797
in your words.

934
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:57,797
That was something

935
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,557
I lost faster than my metabolism

936
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:00,677
from

937
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:02,157
20 to 30 years old.

938
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:04,397
It's my first time

939
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:05,317
being the manager

940
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:06,477
for a tennis club too.

941
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,597
That's why

942
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:10,397
I wish to invite you to join me.

943
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:12,197
What if we succeed?

944
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:13,957
After all, you won't encounter

945
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:15,037
an 18 all score

946
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:16,077
in tennis.

947
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:36,117
Your hand.

948
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:48,957
All done.

949
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:50,717
The roasted fish is ready.

950
00:39:51,117 --> 00:39:52,997
This time, it's not burnt.

951
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:57,277
Your face is blushing already.

952
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,997
You drank a lot
when I was roasting the fish, huh?

953
00:39:59,117 --> 00:40:01,277
Forget about me.
You shouldn't drink too much.

954
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,117
You can't hold your liquor well.

955
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,437
I won't get myself drunk today.

956
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,397
I have something to tell you.

957
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:07,477
What is it?

958
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:11,277
You see,

959
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:13,877
before this, you were living
with the sports team.

960
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,277
They pay for your food
and accommodation.

961
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:17,117
How much you earn

962
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:18,117
has nothing to do with me either.

963
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:19,277
But now that you're back,

964
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,477
I need to feed you and give you
a place to stay.

965
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,317
You see,

966
00:40:23,837 --> 00:40:25,317
don't you think you should

967
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:27,397
pay me for the living expenses?

968
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,837
I was waiting for you to say that.

969
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:38,917
So, we were thinking of the same thing?

970
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:40,277
Great minds think alike.

971
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:42,677
But you even

972
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:44,757
went to the bank to get some cash.

973
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:45,957
Cash is good.

974
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:48,397
You can hold it.

975
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:49,517
Transferring money online

976
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:50,477
is meaningless.

977
00:40:50,597 --> 00:40:52,317
You do care about
a sense of ceremony, huh?

978
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,277
Kid, you're pretty romantic.

979
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:55,557
Come.

980
00:40:55,677 --> 00:40:57,637
Take it slow.

981
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:00,797
Take it slow!

982
00:41:04,677 --> 00:41:06,117
You must be troubled by something.

983
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:08,117
You're getting yourself drunk.

984
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:10,917
I know.

985
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:13,117
I know why

986
00:41:13,157 --> 00:41:14,157
you want me to pay
for the living expenses.

987
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:16,477
I'm very prideful.

988
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:19,437
If I don't pay you,

989
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:20,317
I will be too embarrassed

990
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:21,757
to live in your stupid wig shop.

991
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:26,437
Do you think

992
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:27,397
I'm pretty useless too?

993
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:31,357
It's been so many years since I was 18,

994
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,637
yet I'm still acting like a kid.

995
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:36,877
My real parents are nowhere to be found.

996
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:38,877
I have to spend my days in this place

997
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:39,957
with a fake father like you.

998
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,517
If she didn't mention it to me,

999
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:46,397
I would've forgotten

1000
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:50,437
that I registered for the tennis team

1001
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:53,637
when the school told us to choose
what we were interested in.

1002
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:57,077
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

1003
00:41:57,677 --> 00:41:59,197
Tong Lu kept an eye on
my badminton training.

1004
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,277
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I practiced tennis in secret.

1005
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:03,997
During that period,

1006
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:05,117
she always

1007
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:05,917
wondered why

1008
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:06,917
my wrist was stiff.

1009
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:08,157
It's because

1010
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:09,797
the two sports were
conflicting in nature.

1011
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:11,877
When she found out,

1012
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:13,757
she destroyed my tennis racket.

1013
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,077
She said:

1014
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:18,877
"You're my son".

1015
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,397
"You need to be a champion
in badminton".

1016
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:25,037
I did do my fair share of training.

1017
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:27,877
But out of nowhere,

1018
00:42:30,037 --> 00:42:30,917
she left.

1019
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:35,997
It doesn't matter.

1020
00:42:37,197 --> 00:42:38,517
What I'm trying to say is this.

1021
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:41,877
I've decided.

1022
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:45,397
I'm joining the tennis club.

1023
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,117
I'm going to turn into a tennis player.

1024
00:42:51,517 --> 00:42:52,797
You mean the one
Liang You'an is managing?

1025
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:55,317
Chuan, I...

1026
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:57,597
I have to tell you something.

1027
00:42:58,037 --> 00:43:00,517
You're trying to change your profession
at 22 years old?

1028
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:02,197
This is unheard of

1029
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:03,237
in the sports industry.

1030
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:05,837
