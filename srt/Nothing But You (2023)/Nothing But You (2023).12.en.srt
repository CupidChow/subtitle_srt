00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,140
(I'll Work Hard To Be Your Strength.)

4
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Mr. Gao.

5
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,240
You're back?

6
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
Mr. Jie.

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,640
Liang You'an.

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
Didn't you leave the company?

9
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,760
Yes.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm now the manager of the tennis club

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,400
of Young Space.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm here today

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
to apply for funding.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,400
What a coincidence.

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,520
I heard the son of Mr. Jiang,

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,480
Jiang Jiaojiao,

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
plays in this tennis club.

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Indeed.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I might as well

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,000
use this opportunity

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,680
to clarify something.

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,640
Young Space has always

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,160
had

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,640
a corporate tennis tournament
every year.

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,000
Because Mr. Gao

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
is

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,840
a tennis aficionado.

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,600
Anyway,

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
Mr. Jie's son here

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
plays tennis ball so that
he can study abroad.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,760
Naturally,

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,200
he turns to an excellent

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
tennis club

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,200
like Young Space

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,880
to hone

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,040
on his skills.

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
I see.

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,320
He's just supporting

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
our own business.

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,160
Right?

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Liang You'an.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,000
You mentioned a budget

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,640
just now?

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,080
I see that you brought your glass here.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,600
Drink to show your sincerity.

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,680
I'll drink three glasses

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,160
to thank every leader.

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Liang You'an.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,760
Sorry, I'm late.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
He is

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
a member of our tennis club,

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,160
Song Sanchuan.

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
Why did you drink this much?

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,440
I told her to.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,560
Is there a problem?

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,880
No, not at all.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,560
You know what?

58
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm late.

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,320
Ms. Liang and I

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,560
owe you an apologetic toast.

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,720
Come, sir.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
You look very spirited.

63
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,680
Like the Prince of Tennis.

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,680
How old are you?

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm 22 years old.

66
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,720
Work hard.

67
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,800
Come. Let's drink together.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,320
Cheers.

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,800
Can't finish now?

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,240
Ms. Liang.

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,360
Where do we sit?

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
Mr. Gao, I'll show him his seat.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,440
All right.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,840
Enjoy.

75
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
I was worried

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
because I forgot

77
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
to remind you to suit up.

78
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,040
But not bad.

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
You look dapper here.

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,440
I was just late for a while

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
and you're already getting bullied
by them.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Are you

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
tipsy now?

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Don't look down on me.

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
I can drink very well.

86
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
You even styled your hair.

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,160
I asked An Cong to help me.

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,400
So it's a wig?

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,200
What? No, it's real.

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
Real hair.

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,360
And now,

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
the event everyone has been
looking forward to

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
will begin. It's musical chair.

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,400
(A Young and Vibrant Space)
Like what we did last year,

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
the winner

96
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
can ask

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,520
Mr. Gao to buy him or her anything.

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
The winner from last year

99
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,760
asked for a sedan.

100
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,520
The candidates

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,200
elected by each department,

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,880
please come to the stage.

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
I have a question.

104
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
Young Space Tennis Club

105
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,680
falls under

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Young Space Group too.

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,760
Can we

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
participate

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,760
in the game?

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,760
Can we?

111
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,880
Sure. It's only fair.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Thanks, Mr. Gao.

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,600
Sit down.

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,160
We have work now.

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Right.

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,280
I have faith in you.

117
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,740
(Article Tag)

118
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,200
That's why he was late.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,280
He went shopping.

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,040
Wait.

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,840
I have to say something.

122
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,400
The one on this side.

123
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,880
I heard that he

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,360
is a tennis player

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
in the club.

126
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,400
As we all know,

127
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,520
athletes are more

128
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,240
agile

129
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,240
than office workers.

130
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,160
He keeps

131
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,920
winning

132
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,680
and it's no fun
for the spectators like us.

133
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,360
Don't you agree?

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,920
So

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,520
for fairness's sake,

136
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,240
let's pick

137
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,800
someone more athletic, shall we?

138
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,160
Yes!

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,280
Yes.

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,520
So

141
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,960
everyone knows who my chauffeur is.

142
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,920
He is also a veteran

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
in Young Space.

144
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
He likes to do sport too.

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
Why not pin them against

146
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,800
each other?

147
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes!

(The 12th Fiscal Year End Party & Award Ceremony)

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Mr. Gao.

174
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Can you increase the club's budget

175
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,440
in the new fiscal year?

176
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,960
Yes, I know

177
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,920
we are the worst-performing entity

178
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,240
in the group

179
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,880
so our budget has to be approved

180
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,120
on a monthly basis.

181
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
And it gets cut all the time.

182
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,120
But I believe.

183
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,200
If you can increase

184
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
our budget

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,240

I can promise you

188
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,840
that next year, we won't

189
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,600
be the worst-performing group anymore.

190
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,400
Good.

191
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,160
I approve.

192
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
I'll add one more thing.

193
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,920
You can claim your budget

194

on a quarterly basis.

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
No need to come here every month.

196
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,560
Is it good enough?

197
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Thanks, Mr. Gao.

198
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
Look.

199
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,040
I only feel safe

200
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,200
when the money is in my pocket.

201
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,200
They have increased

202
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,240
our annual budget by 300,000 yuan.

203
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,920
I already signed the paper.

204
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,400
You still have to follow the procedures

205
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,240
before you can withdraw the money.

206
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,680
You're working tomorrow.

207
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,160
Can you handle it first?

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,760
It's very urgent.

209
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
I need it

210
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,880
to hire a new coach.

211
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,240
But this is against the rules.

212
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Miss.

213
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,680
On behalf

214
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,880
of all members of the tennis club,

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
I would like a give a toast to you.

216
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,480
Mr. Gao already said

217
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
that we could claim the budget
on a quarterly basis.

218
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,760
Just transfer

219
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
three months' worth of budget

220
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,560
to me.

221
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,240
That's too quick.

222
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,280
You have to wait
till next month at least.

223
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,120
No one can bend the rule.

224
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
But you can.

225
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
You have the authority.

226
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,360
I know you can be flexible about it.

227
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,760
You can finish all the work in one go.

228
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,080
Aren't you sick of seeing me

229
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,040
every month?

230
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,920
This is against the rule.

231
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,480
Miss.

232
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,600
Do clean your hands with the warm towel

233
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,560
and have some fruits too.

234
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,840
It'll sober you up.

235
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,560
Liang You'an.

236
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,480
You

237
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,960
are very sly.

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
Is this a honey trap?

239
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,960
Fine. I'll make an exception.

240
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,080
Just this once.

241
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,000
Towel, please.

242
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,200
Where is he?

243
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,520
Liang You'an?

244
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,680
Where are you?

245
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm rich.

246
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,360
Put your hand down.

247
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,920
Put your hand down.

248
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,680
It's dangerous.

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,360
We're rich.

250
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,480
Don't put your hand outside.

251
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,560
You're an expert.

252
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
Of what?

253
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,680
Don't roll down the window.

254
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,080
It doesn't matter.

255
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
Do you know

256
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,000
what matters now?

257
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,440
That we have the money.

258
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,120
We are rich.

259
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,400
Mister, we are rich.

260
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,360
It's all thanks to you.

261
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,400
I did very well too.

262
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,160
It's a teamwork thing.

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,560
Once I have the money,

264
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,760
I'll slap it

265
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
against the coach's face.

266
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
Slap him hard.

267
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,160
All of the money?

268
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,520
That's crazy.

269
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
There's no use spending the money

270
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,440
on patching

271
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,240
things up.

272
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,080
Use it on an effective

273
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,480
solution.

274
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,160
Once I hire a star coach,

275
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,240
we have nothing to be afraid of.

276
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,160
And if you run out

277
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
of money next month?

278
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll go to them again.

279
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,280
I will.

280
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,080
If I need money, I go to them.

281
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
I'll keep pestering them

282
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
because I'm shameless.

283
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,440
I'm sure I can get the money like this.

284
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
We'll go together.

285
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,800
We made a killer team.

286
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
Yes, I'll come with you.

287
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
But I am not playing the role

288
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,280
of a gigolo

289
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
next time.

290
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
It's mortifying.

291
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,120
Take it off.

292
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,600
Take off your clothes.

293
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,760
Liang You'an, you're drunk.

294
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,240
Take it off.

295
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Take off your clothes.

296
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,760
What are you doing?

297
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,160
Just take it off.

298
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,920
Hold on. We're not home yet.

299
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Just take it off.

300
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,240
Eyes on the road, mister.

301
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,360
Don't worry.

302
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
Mister, don't look at us.

303
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,520
Stop.

304
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,280
Don't move.

305
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll take it off.

306
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,920
Hurry up. Don't waste my time.

307
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,720
Wait.

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
2,688 yuan.

309
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,120
I can't return it like this.

310
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,160
Don't return it.

311
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,960
I won't allow it.

312
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,040
I bought it for you.

313
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,520
All right?

314
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,480
It's expensive.

315
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,760
We need this weapon.

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
We need to go all out.

317
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,440
2,688

318
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,320
is a good number.

319
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,560
It's an auspicious number.

320
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,680
I'll keep it as memorabilia.

321
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,760
You don't believe me?

322
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
I'll give you the money right now.

323
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
2,688 yuan. I'll transfer it now.

324
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,040
Liang You'an.

325
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,440
Are you paying for the pants too?

326
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,080
Pants? Don't take it off.

327
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,160
You...

328
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,400
You can return it.

329
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,360
I won't pay for the pants.

330
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,800
The blazer is good enough.

331
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,680
Blazer only?

332
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,080
2,688 yuan.

333
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,040
Done.

334
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,160
You were serious?

335
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,200
I

336
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,440
can pay for it.

337
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,960
We have the money anyway.

338
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,360
All right. Settle down now.

339
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
Careful, there's a gap here.

340
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,880
Careful.

341
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm not drunk!

342
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,640
Left or right?

343
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,160
There is a child in this house.

344
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
Keep quiet.

345
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,560
Are we there?

346
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,040
702?

347
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
Access denied.

348
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,120
My fingerprint lock is always wonky.

349
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,040
Wait.

350
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,920
Watch out.

351
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
What are you doing?

352
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,560
It's okay.

353
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,439
Let's key in the access code.

354
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,719
Access denied.

355
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
What is my passcode?

356
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,760
How am I

357
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,439
supposed to know?

358
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,719
Right.

359
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
That stupid Liang Tao

360
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,440
asks me to change my passcode
all the time.

361
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,320
Stupid Liang Tao.

362
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,480
Key in properly.

363
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,440
You're mashing buttons there.

364
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
Shut up.

365
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,960
Liang You'an.

366
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,080
Tell me the passcode.

367
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
I'll help you key in, all right?

368
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,160
I'll help you.

369
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,920
Liang You'an.

370
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,520
Tell me now.

371
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,680
You won't key it in like this.

372
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,840
880979.

373
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
All right.

374
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,200
Stand here.

375
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
Come.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,240
Lean against the wall.

377
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,880
Take your purse.

378
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,480
Here. Your purse.

379
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,480
Steady.

380
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,520
Liang You'an.

381
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,720
Liang You'an.

382
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,920
Are you all right?

383
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,760
I don't want to drink anymore.

384
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
Never again.

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,920
(Are you all right?)

386
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,480
(What is wrong with me?)

387
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,000
(I can't believe that one day,)

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,480
(I'll be afraid
of what's behind this door.)

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,080
(No bad surprise.)

390
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,840
(No bad surprise.)

391
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,720
(No bad surprise.)

392
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,760
Morning.

393
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,600
Coach Chuan?

394
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,880
I wonder

395
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
if I was supposed

396
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
to intervene or not.

397
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,320
You should intervene.

398
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,360
Because if

399
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,880
I lost control yesterday,

400
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,600
I'd be one of those

401
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,080
unscrupulous managers

402
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,640
who sleeps with her athletes.

403
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,480
That is

404
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
workplace harassment, isn't it?

405
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
Come on now.

406
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,520
Coach Chuan

407
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
was quite

408
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,840
into it as well.

409
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,640
Anyway,

410
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,480
you already know

411
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,160
Song Sanchuan

412
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,920
but you never told me.

413
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,200
But

414
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,760
what's there to tell you?

415
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
Back then I thought

416
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,120
he and I

417
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,440
would never

418
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,280
meet again.

419
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
But here we are.

420
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
And now he's the key

421
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,760
to my comeback.

422
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
Maybe you can "privatize"

423
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,680
him one day.

424
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
Shut up already.

425
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,360
He's 22 years old, for goodness sake.

426
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
I feel like I was

427
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,360
crossing a line already

428
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
when I recall what happened last night.

429
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,640
What's wrong with being 22 years old?

430
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,360
He's old enough to get married.

431
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
It's not illegal.

432
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,200
Throw away
that outdated mindset already.

433
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,720
It's time for your life

434
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,440
to have

435
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,000
something sweet

436
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,880
to nourish you.

437
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,360
Come.

438
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,600
Try my coffee.

439
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,840
It's delicious.

440
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,880
Thank you.

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,480
I thought

442
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,800
you wouldn't mind the age gap

443
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,400
since you

444
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
are always surrounded by younger men.

445
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
This only happened

446
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,920
after I started working

447
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,720
in the tennis club.

448
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,680
You have no idea

449
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,800
how defeated I feel

450
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
lately.

451
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,680
I used to be

452
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,360
very proud of my

453
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,360
forms and slide shows.

454
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,200
But over there?

455
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,840
No one fills any forms

456
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,760
and those kids are belligerent.

457
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,760
Except for Song Sanchuan.

458
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,520
Jiang Jiaojiao

459
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
doesn't like him all that much

460
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
but everyone else does.

461
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,480
After he and I went

462
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,600
to the tennis club,

463
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
our social situations are inversed.

464
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,440
No.

465
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,520
I don't have the time

466
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,000
to watch it.

467
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,040
We train every day.

468
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,120
(Honestly,)

469
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,120
(I even feel intimidated
to mingle with them.)

470
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,800
(Because when I approach them,)

471
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,720
(they just walk away.)

472
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,720
I have categorized

473
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,200
all of your play styles.

474
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
Please have a look.

475
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Come. Let's play.

476
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,680
I'll be the umpire.

477
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm the umpire.

478
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,600
I'll be the umpire.

479
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,560
Where is the scoreboard?

480
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,400
Get a tennis ball too.

481
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,120
Sanchuan.

482
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,440
Sanchuan.

483
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,400
Come.

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
You're on my team. Take the ball.

485
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,120
Okay.

486
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,710
Let's go.

487
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,290
Come.

488
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,400
Good luck.

489
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,280
(For the first time ever,)

490
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,000
(the tactfulness)

491
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,520
(I learned by being an assistant,)

492
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,520
(the coaxing,)

493
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,440
I'll put it here.

494
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,760
(they don't work)

495
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,000
(on those kids.)

496
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,760
(The more I coddle them,)

497
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,520
(the more they ignore me.)

498
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,760
Easy-to-read person

499
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
like Song Sanchuan

500
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
was so

501
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,360
popular

502
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,280
among them.

503
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes, Sanchuan is very

504
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,760
straightforward.

505
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
But he doesn't lie.

506
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,560
He is genuine.

507
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,600
People like that.

508
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,120
That's when I realize

509
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
age is not

510
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,840
a gap, it's a barrier.

511
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,000
Like another dimension.

512
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
I'll help you key in the code.

513
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Tell me the code.

514
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,400
You can't key it in like this.

515
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,080
(Song Sanchuan)
(Sober now?)

516
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,920
(How are you feeling?)

517
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,000
(Liang You'an)
(Good. Very good.)

518
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,720
(I can't remember much about yesterday.)

519
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,840
(Luo Nian said you sent me back?)

520
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,640
(Thanks!)

521
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
(Song Sanchuan)
(Haha.)

522
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,920
(Liang You'an)
(I'll send the venue)

523
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,560
(and the time
of the tournament tomorrow.)

524
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,240
(Please notify everyone.)

525
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,640
(Especially Jiang Jiaojiao.
Make sure he attends it.)

526
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,600
(Song Sanchuan)
(All right.)

527
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,080
Work is all she can think of.

528
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,200
Why did you ask me to come here?

529
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,600
What is the surprise again?

530
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,700
(ILovePeaches)
(Same rules.)

531
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,280
(Can you see the lake before you?)

532
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
(I have already rented
the fishing tools.)

533
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,480
(See you on stream.)

534
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
What's so difficult about it?

535
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,200
Just watch my stream.

536
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,800
(Peachy Peach)
(This is indeed)

537
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,000
(a natural air anion bar.)

538
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,520
(So many mosquitoes.)

539
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,080
If you ever come here to fish,

540
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,640
remember to bring some insect repellant

541
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,720
and sunscreen with you.

542
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,120
What are you watching so seriously?

543
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,040
I see you won't share

544
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,040
with your good friend.

545
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,520
Have you had a virtual pet before?

546
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,800
What?

547
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Nevermind. You won't understand.

548
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,360
Just don't ask.

549
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
Oh.

550
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
You have skipped the training
for a few days now.

551
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,200
The tournament is tomorrow.

552
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,480
What are you trying to do here?

553
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,240
If you keep throwing this tantrum,

554
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,120
your sports career will be ruined.

555
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,680
I will train, for sure.

556
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,920
But I see it now.

557
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,000
My father sent her here

558
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,600
to see

559
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,760
if I would quit.

560
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,360
If I quit,

561
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,680
he will win.

562
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,400
So I will keep doing this.

563
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,760
But why?

564
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,800
Liang You'an is a competent manager.

565
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
She's pretty, at least.

566
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,760
Who doesn't want

567
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
to train alongside a cute girl?

568
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,400
Don't you think?

569
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,920
You...

570
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,520
Whatever.

571
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,560
That's all you can think of anyway.

572
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
But I'm right.

573
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,600
Just shut up.

574
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,200
Don't speak with your mouth full.

575
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,860
(The 8th "Liku Cup" Tennis Tournament)

576
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,400
Come on!

577
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,300
(Jiang Jiaojiao, Li Miao)

578
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,400
It doesn't make sense.

579
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
The opponent

580
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,760
is obviously

581
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,880
below Jiaojiao's level.

582
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,960
His backhand is good

583
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,800
but that's about it.

584
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,640
Jiaojiao

585
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,280
should win this game.

586
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,480
Jiaojiao skipped

587
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,920
training for a few days.

588
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,480
That's why he isn't playing well today.

589
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I did ask him to come to train

590
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,520
but he wouldn't come.

591
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
Now he lost the match hard.

592
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,440
If Coach Wang sees this,

593
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
he will be furious.

594
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Jiang Jiaojiao!

595
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,880
This is the men's locker room.

596
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,440
I know

597
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
ever since Coach Wang left,

598
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,840
you don't like me.

599
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,240
It's okay. I can put up with that.

600
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,240
But as an athlete,

601
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,320
you slack in your training.
Frequent no-shows.

602
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,040
That's why

603
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,960
you lost horribly

604
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,760
in the match

605
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,720
today.

606
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,080
You don't respect

607
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,880
your own sport.

608
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,320
It's okay.

609
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
Let me snap it on your behalf.

610
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,560
What are you doing?

611
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,240
Are you out of your mind?

612
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,720
Bugger off if you don't want to play.

613
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,840
Don't come near me.

614
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
I might do

615
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,520
something violent.

616
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
You skip your training.
You half-assed the match.

617
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Show me.

618
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,440
What else can you do wrong?

619
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,520
Dude.

620
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,680
You really want to ruin your career now?

621
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,880
It's just Coach Wang.

622
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,360
You can't get over it now?

623
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,360
Coach Wang left,
he hoped you could be better.

624
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,920
It's not

625
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,200
so that you can wallow
in self-pity like this.

626
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,120
You're too scared

627
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,040
to take the next step.

628
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,840
Don't pin your cowardice
on Liang You'an.

629
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,600
Dude.

630
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,640
I know her longer than you do.

631
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,240
My father taught her.

632
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,480
I know that very well.

633
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,120
They are the same kind of people.

634
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,240
Profit above everything.

635
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,520
Whoever gets in the way of the profit,

636
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,560
they kick him out.

637
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,280
Without any profit,

638
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,600
the club will close down tomorrow.

639
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Without any profit, how can your father

640
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,640
open this club for you?

641
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
He didn't establish this club for me.

642
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,360
Prove it

643
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,240
with results.

644
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,480
They speak louder than words.

645
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,840
If you can't defeat anyone

646
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,720
on the tennis court,

647
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,200
this club will always be seen

648
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,960
as your daddy's present.

649
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,480
People will insult you with it.

650
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Yes.

651
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,440
Liang You'an can't play tennis at all.

652
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,520
But every day, after work,

653
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,320
she does her research,

654
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
she watches tutorials,

655
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,320
she looks at the latest breakthrough.

656
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,280
All this

657
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,560
to find the best coach for us.

658
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,400
You know how much the club needs money.

659
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,400
She has begged

660
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,560
Young Space many times
to secure the budget.

661
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,000
Enough!

662
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,280
Come in.

663
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,320
Why are you here?

664
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,200
The leftover supplies from today.

665
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,200
Where do I put them?

666
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,400
On the tea table, please.

667
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,360
Let me see.

668
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
There are a lot of supplies left.

669
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,680
I have the money now.

670
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,120
Once the new coach

671
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,520
is here,

672
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,280
I'm sure

673
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,360
those kids

674
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,240
will listen to me.

675
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,200
What happens to your hand?

676
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,680
I smacked

677
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,200
the racket this afternoon

678
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,160
and hurt myself.

679
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,400
Why overexert yourself?

680
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,200
The swelling will only be gone

681
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,120
after three days.

682
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,360
I'm fine.

683
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,360
I'll use the sport spray back home.

684
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,040
Just go.

685
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,280
I have tons of things to do here.

686
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,680
I need to draft a proposal.

687
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,400
Ms. Liang.

688
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,960
Is the tennis club

689
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,480
all you care about now?

690
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
Sometimes,

691
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
you are warm and considerate.

692
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
But sometimes,

693
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,640
you're like an impregnable fortress.

694
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,400
Your thoughts are like a moat

695
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,160
protecting the fortress.

696
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,800
Are you psycho-analyzing me?

697
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,480
Jiaojiao is not complicated at all.

698
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,920
He

699
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,920
is sentimental and stubborn.

700
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,440
So try

701
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,200
being real

702
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,720
with him.

703
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,280
Cold ones, for you two.

704
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,720
Cold ones?

705
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,440
Thanks.

706
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,750
Yes.

707
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,670
Nice one.

708
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,120
(Liang You'an)
(Dinner tonight at seven. My treat.)

709
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,160
(Come if you dare.)

710
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,920
(Liang You'an)

711
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,920
She is daring me now?

712
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,520
Bring it on.

713
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,620
(Alleyway Spicy Chicken Skewers)

714
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:28,400
Dai Yi.

715
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,839
Put it down.

716
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,880
Drink water.

717
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,080
But the percentage is not high.

718
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,600
Even if it's only 5%,
it's still alcohol.

719
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:36,400
It's already higher than standard beer.

720
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,279
Put it down.

721
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,960
It's fine.

722
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,319
Wait.

723
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,160
Don't put it down.

724
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,880
Bring it over.

725
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,319
You're crazy.

726
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,680
Where is Liang You'an?

727
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
She invited us here.

728
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,520
It's been half an hour

729
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,240
and she hasn't shown up yet.

730
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,960
She said that she will be here soon.

731
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,359
She told us to eat first.

732
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,800
I know

733
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,560
some of you will be unhappy

734
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,160
to see me here.

735
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
So I intentionally

736
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,280
came late.

737
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,960
I bought all of you dinner
for several reasons.

738
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,240
One,

739
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,280
I want to apologize.

740
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,880
Sorry, Jiang Jiaojiao.

741
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,400
I smacked your racket.

742
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,640
I got carried away by my emotions.

743
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,520
I am at fault

744
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,680
so I ask for your forgiveness.

745
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,200
After Coach Wang left,

746
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,720
the position has been vacant.

747
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,440
It is my fault

748
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,600
that you are unable

749
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,000
to receive proper coaching.

750
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,160
I know you can drink.

751
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,880
You proved it yourself

752
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
during the year end party.

753
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,160
Look.

754
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,960
Take a good look.

755
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,920
This is Ms. Liang.

756
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,400
Who couldn't stop drinking

757
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,720
during the year end party.

758
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,400
I know some of you

759
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,520
are not fond of me.

760
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,320
But sometimes, I have to do things

761
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,760
that I'm not proud of.

762
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
You have to?

763
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,040
You're just weak.

764
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,880
Yes, we are lousy.

765
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,560
But you don't need

766
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,520
to publicize it.

767
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,600
It's because deep down,

768
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
you look down

769
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,680
on this joke of a tennis club.

770
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,560
Right?

771
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,280
I was told to drink

772
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,800
and I begged them for money.

773
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,200
But never have I looked down

774
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,560
on this tennis club.

775
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,320
On the contrary, what I'm doing here

776
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
is to prove

777
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,920
them wrong.

778
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,880
Those

779
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,040
who look down on the tennis club,

780
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,120
who look down on you,

781
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,120
I think

782
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,360
they don't know us at all.

783
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,160
Jiang Jiaojiao.

784
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,760
You look

785
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,360
like a bully.

786
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,000
But you are in fact a loyal person.

787
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
You are upset

788
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,200
after Coach Wang left

789
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,200
because he

790
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
was your mentor.

791
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
He was more than a coach

792
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,120
to you.

793
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,080
He taught you to love tennis.

794
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,800
Now that he is gone,

795
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,720
are you

796
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,840
going to give up now?

797
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,040
Chen Zhe.

798
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,520
Do you know?

799
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,840
I'm grateful to you.

800
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
Because you're the friendliest one here.

801
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,240
When Song Sanchuan came to this club,

802
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,280
you were the first

803
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
to reach out to him.

804
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,320
You taught him how to play tennis.

805
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,480
Without you,

806
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,720
he wouldn't be able

807
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,800
to mingle with everyone that quickly.

808
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,640
Dai Yi.

809
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,040
You are young

810
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,160
but you are the most sensible.

811
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
You're willing to share.

812
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,600
You teach everyone

813
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,520
all the techniques

814
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,960
you know.

815
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
I'm new

816
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,720
to this tennis club.

817
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
But I have faith

818
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,760
in all of you.

819
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
Truth be told, I even envy you.

820
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,640
You're in your early 20s.
You have the talent.

821
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,320
You can make a career

822
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,880
out of a tennis racket.

823
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,600
How amazing is that.

824
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,240
And that is why I can't

825
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,600
let you

826
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
squander your talent away

827
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,280
when you have all the opportunities at hand.

828
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,920
If I don't do what I'm told,

829
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,800
I'm squandering my talent now?

830
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,760
You don't

831
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,800
have to do what you're told.

832
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,640
You can

833
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,720
share your thoughts with me.

834
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
If you don't tell me,

835
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,560
how am I supposed

836
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,680
to know what you want to achieve?

837
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
I'll speak first.

838
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,240
After I came here,

839
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,240
you taught me

840
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,480
what I'm good at.

841
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,960
It isn't something

842
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,920
I thought I could do.

843
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,040
My goal

844
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,920
is to successfully
convert myself into a tennis player.

845
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,480
I will do my best to earn a spot

846
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,000
in the club.

847
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,800
What about you, Chen Zhe?

848
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,520
Goal? Pfft.

849
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,800
I don't do that.

850
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,680
I have never had any goal.

851
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,080
My parents don't expect much

852
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,920
from me either.

853
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
So...

854
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,360
Pass.

855
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,840
Tennis is too hard for me.

856
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,360
I wouldn't play it at all if it weren't

857
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,040
for the exam.

858
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,440
I'm just thinking

859
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,600
that once I pass the exam,

860
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,360
I won't touch it anymore.

861
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,720
Jiaojiao, tell us.

862
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,840
Yes, go ahead.

863
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
I want to attend
more prestigious tournaments.

864
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,720
I want my dad
to see me raise the trophy.

865
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
That's good.

866
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,280
We

867
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,960
were looked down upon today.

868
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,600
But that doesn't mean

869
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,720
we will be looked down upon forever.

870
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
Train well.

871
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,360
Bring some results.

872
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,320
Then everyone
can hold their chin up high.

873
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,640
Come.

874
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,920
I have a question.

875
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,600
Everyone has shared

876
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,960
their deepest thought.

877
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,160
But not you, Ms. Liang.

878
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,840
She did it on purpose.

879
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,640
She fishes out information from us

880
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,120
without giving hers out.

881
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
My father

882
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,400
is a jerk.

883
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,880
He divorced my mother.

884
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,280
Back then,

885
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,400
I was mad.

886
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,440
I swore that I

887
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,400
would never

888
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,840
ever talk to him again.

889
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
But in my third varsity year,

890
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,040
I fell in love.

891
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,240
With a handsome senior
who stayed to teach.

892
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,040
People found out and reported us.

893
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,120
To protect his career,

894
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,960
he said that I seduced him.

895
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
At the end of this relationship,

896
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,000
all I got

897
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
was an expulsion letter.

898
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,560
There was nothing I could do.

899
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,400
I could only study abroad.

900
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,840
I didn't have enough money

901
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,200
so I turned

902
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
to my dad.

903
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,400
After that, I worked for Young Space.

904
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,920
I was an assistant for eight years.

905
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,920
I learned

906
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,360
to study everyone's faces

907
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,000
to please them,

908
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,880
to be tactful.

909
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,760
Looking back,

910
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,200
I spent all 30 years of my life

911
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,960
trying to make people like me.

912
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,520
I'm never the main character.

913
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
It's not fair

914
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,400
to play the victim here.

915
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,040
You make it look like

916
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,880
all of us

917
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,760
are bullying you.

918
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,200
But I don't feel like a victim.

919
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,680
These 30 years

920
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,800
are just a small part

921
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,800
of my life.

922
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,120
I have you now.

923
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
I have a group

924
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,560
of talented athletes with me.

925
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I feel like my moment

926
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,280
is about to arrive.

927
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,960
The new coach will come soon.

928
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,040
I will

929
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,160
forge ahead.

930
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,640
Whether you will follow me or not,

931
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,160
