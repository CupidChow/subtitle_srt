4
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,389
I thought it was better

5
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,229
to wait for you with this.

6
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,740
(Divorce Agreement)

7
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,029
Why are you bringing this up again?

8
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,909
I thought it was already over.

9
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:29,389
Come on, Chen Ke.

10
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:32,149
What exactly do you want?

11
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,469
I've written what I want

12
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,229
in the divorce papers.

13
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,909
You can go through it

14
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,989
and find an attorney.

15
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,469
If there are any disagreements,

16
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,149
let our attorneys handle them.

17
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,789
Can you...

18
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,829
Can you please not make a fuss?

19
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,709
I'm seriously proposing

20
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:51,989
a divorce.

21
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,229
I brought this up four years ago.

22
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:56,829
At that time, you told me

23
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,589
you were going to be promoted
to marketing director

24
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,829
and you couldn't have
any problems at home.

25
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,949
I convinced myself that it was okay.

26
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,349
But that doesn't mean

27
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,309
everything has been fine over the years.

28
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,709
I really don't understand

29
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:13,149
what you're not satisfied with.

30
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,509
Isn't your current life

31
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:16,789
something most women

32
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,949
dream of?

33
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,029
You live in such a huge house.

34
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,509
As for me,

35
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,189
I'm not saying

36
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:24,949
I'm extraordinary.

37
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,589
But at least

38
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,349
I'm not that bad, right?

39
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,989
Don't I respect you?

40
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,149
Am I not always obedient to you?

41
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:34,629
I don't smoke or drink.

42
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,469
I never spent the night out, right?

43
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,069
Have I physically abused you?

44
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,429
Have I cheated on you?

45
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,669
Have I?

46
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,069
Isn't this what marriage is like?

47
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,149
What else do you want?

48
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:46,749
Okay, come.

49
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,069
Come on, let's clarify

50
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:51,709
your demands today.

51
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,669
Come on, tell me your demands.

52
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,309
Mr. Jiang,

53
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,669
please don't act so self-righteous.

54
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,749
I'm your wife.

55
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,709
At least, for now.

56
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:02,829
I'm not your employee.

57
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,429
We'll put other things aside for now.

58
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,269
Let's just talk about your demand.

59
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:16,508
Ah, I know.

60
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:19,029
I'm too busy with work
to spend time with you.

61
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,909
Isn't this a small issue?

62
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,229
What's the big deal?

63
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,829
You wanted to divorce
because of this reason back then.

64
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,749
There's no need
to make it such a big deal.

65
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,269
Of course, I understand you.

66
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,269
It's boring to stay at home every day.

67
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,709
Sometimes it's easy

68
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,749
to let your imagination run wild,

69
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:33,629
overthinking

70
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,549
about this and that.

71
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,149
I get it.

72
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,149
But can we not resort

73
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,349
to divorce all the time?

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,900
(Divorce Agreement)
It's a matter of principle.

75
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,509
It hurts our feelings.

76
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,389
This is my bottom line,

77
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,749
okay?

78
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:58,749
Are you done talking?

79
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,549
You really should take a good look
at yourself in the mirror

80
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,309
and look at how you gesture

81
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,469
when you talk.

82
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,229
Just sign the papers.

83
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,029
You're cheating on me, right?

84
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,429
All right, just give me their names!

85
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:28,789
If you tell me

86
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,669
his name today,

87
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,989
I'll let you leave right away!

88
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,029
Say it!

89
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:36,789
So in men's eyes,

90
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,829
whenever a woman proposes a divorce,

91
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:39,789
it means

92
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,989
she's seeing someone else?

93
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,149
Are there any other reasons?

94
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,709
Why can't it be

95
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,109
that there are problems between us?

96
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,229
Why can't it be

97
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,709
that I've had enough of you?

98
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,709
Our marriage has become an empty shell.

99
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,789
I don't want to deceive myself anymore.

100
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:07,629
Hello!

101
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:08,709
Liang You'an.

102
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,189
I'm at work now.

103
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,389
So I'm busy.

104
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:13,549
(Mr. Jie,)

105
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:14,429
(I'm outside your door.)

106
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:16,269
(It'll only take ten minutes.)

107
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:30,789
What is it?

108
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,069
Mr. Jie,

109
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,429
I'm here to verify something.

110
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,269
Is it true that the club
is going to shut down?

111
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,949
Yes, it is.

112
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,509
Come up with a plan.

113
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:46,909
Don't complicate things unnecessarily.

114
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,149
I...

115
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:51,829
I don't know what you mean

116
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,629
by that.

117
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,189
Do I have to explain it to you?

118
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:55,789
Just keep a low profile

119
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,269
and don't let the company notice

120
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,669
that the club is being shut down.

121
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,069
Mr. Jie,

122
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,509
you clearly said

123
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:07,749
that as long as I could make

124
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:08,589
the club profitable,

125
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,869
there wouldn't be any problems.

126
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,789
Now the club is finally surviving.

127
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,429
Can you give me some more time?

128
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:16,669
This club

129
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,109
is a time bomb.

130
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:20,069
Is it worth arguing

131
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:21,349
over something useless?

132
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,589
The club's account has been frozen.

133
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,109
The company won't provide
any more funds.

134
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:27,429
You need to shut it down.

135
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:28,829
Come back to Young Space Group,

136
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,429
and I'll let you be the director

137
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,709
and manage a sales line.

138
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,709
You're not thinking of leaving the club

139
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,349
and returning to the company, are you?

140
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:19,029
Why would I return to the company?

141
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:20,069
I'm going home.

142
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:21,789
That's good.

143
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,629
You scared me for a moment.

144
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,069
You didn't say anything on the way back

145
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:25,589
and I thought

146
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,989
you were swayed by his words.

147
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:28,709
I was evaluating the current situation

148
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:30,629
in my head the whole time.

149
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:33,028
Actually, the issue

150
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,109
with our club right now

151
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,069
is we're not profitable.

152
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,429
But if we can successfully upgrade

153
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:38,509
to an A-rank club

154
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:39,788
next month,

155
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,869
then our problem will be solved.

156
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:43,509
The key right now

157
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:44,269
is how we can

158
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:45,949
buy ourselves an extra month.

159
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,189
So, I think of going back to the club

160
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:49,709
and reviewing

161
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,389
the expenses and revenues
of the club for each month,

162
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,669
to see if we can come up

163
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,709
with a zero-cost operation plan for this month.

164
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:57,029
Maybe with this plan,

165
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:58,069
Mr. Jiang will be willing

166
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,229
to help us out.

167
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:01,749
I'll go with you.

168
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:02,949
When I was on the badminton team,

169
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,549
I learned some ways

170
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,069
to operate within the system

171
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:07,549
and save money.

172
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:08,909
I can give you some tips.

173
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:10,629
Are you still okay?

174
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,589
You trained all day

175
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,069
and drove for so long.

176
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,549
If you can handle it,

177
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:18,029
how could I not?

178
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,349
All right, let's go.

179
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:27,949
Next month's expenses

180
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,789
must be controlled
within the profitable range.

181
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,749
The club's monthly profits

182
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:33,429
can be roughly divided into
several categories.

183
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:35,189
Advance fees from new members.

184
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,589
No need to change your shoes.

185
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:37,429
Just come in.

186
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:37,749
Okay.

187
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,589
And there's the prize money
for that month's match,

188
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:41,829
business sponsorship,

189
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:42,869
and monthly expenses.

190
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,949
Besides the salaries of the employees,

191
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:45,869
we have promotion activities

192
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:46,909
to attract new members.

193
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:50,629
Have a seat.

194
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,069
The monthly operating

195
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:54,909
and maintenance costs

196
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:55,869
for the facilities

197
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,229
and travel expenses
for arranged competitions

198
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,069
are also expenses to consider.

199
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:00,949
Let's calculate it bit by bit.

200
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:01,509
Okay.

201
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:02,949
Give me a notebook.

202
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,109
You'll read them out
and I'll calculate them.

203
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:06,629
Here.

204
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:12,269
Let's start by looking

205
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,829
at the new registered members.

206
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:15,469
There are

207
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:16,669
a total of 72 new members.

208
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:17,909
72 new members.

209
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:41,789
If it doesn't work out,

210
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:42,669
we can cut some costs.

211
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,709
Are you hungry?

212
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,189
It's okay.

213
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:50,909
Why don't you eat something?

214
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:51,789
You didn't eat much

215
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:52,509
at the hotpot restaurant earlier.

216
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:53,389
I'm really fine.

217
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:54,349
When I worked at Young Space,

218
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:55,789
I wouldn't eat dinner
when working overtime.

219
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:56,669
Whenever I eat,

220
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,189
I get really sleepy.

221
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,149
Let's continue with this.

222
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:02,789
Let me check your fridge.

223
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,189
If you can't stand it anymore,
I can cook something for you.

224
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,269
I don't have anything in my fridge.

225
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:12,989
Liang You'an,

226
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,269
do you never cook at home?

227
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,749
No, I just order takeouts nowadays.

228
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:21,269
I don't have time to cook.

229
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,069
I have to give my comments on this.

230
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,829
When it comes to presentations

231
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:26,429
and work,

232
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:27,709
you're definitely the top performer.

233
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,149
But in terms of taking care

234
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,389
of your own health,

235
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,909
you really need to do better.

236
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:34,909
We'll order takeout for now.

237
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:37,069
And next time when there's a chance,

238
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,189
I'll buy groceries
and cook a meal for you.

239
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,389
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Song.

240
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,029
Who's there?

241
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,189
I'm making coffee.

242
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,589
Don't make mine.

243
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:04,549
Just give me as it is

244
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:05,269
for an extra buff.

245
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:09,509
Chen Zhe, do you want some?

246
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:10,549
Sure.

247
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:11,989
Only Sanchuan

248
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,309
treats us as his own.

249
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:14,789
Something like this has happened.

250
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,189
If it weren't for him mentioning it

251
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:16,749
in our group,

252
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:18,629
are you planning to inform us

253
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:19,749
when the club is closed?

254
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,429
I didn't want you to act impulsively.

255
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:25,309
You guessed it right.

256
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,589
Tomorrow morning, I'll go and ask Jiang Jie.

257
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,069
You can't go.

258
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:30,629
Your dad is being accused

259
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,269
of using public resources
for personal gain at this moment.

260
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,589
If you make a scene now,

261
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:34,869
you're giving someone else
the opportunity to bring him down.

262
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,269
That's right.

263
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:38,829
The more sensitive the situation,

264
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,629
the more we need to lay low.

265
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,149
We'll approach this

266
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,149
with facts and numbers.

267
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,389
Judging from what you said,

268
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:47,749
I could've become

269
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,109
someone's tool to be used against him.

270
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,429
Nothing wrong
to understand the situation.

271
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,469
We have no say
because the club is not profitable.

272
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:53,829
All right.

273
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:56,629
I'll just do what you say.

274
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,829
I'll talk to him later.

275
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:59,229
Song Sanchuan and I

276
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,749
did some calculations just now.

277
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:03,109
It'll take at least two months

278
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,869
to break even.

279
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,549
Even if the club
is no longer part of the company,

280
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,109
we can bear our own expenses.

281
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,829
But making money

282
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:10,669
is probably too late.

283
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:11,949
As for cutting costs...

284
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:13,269
Now, saving money

285
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,909
is not in my area of expertise.

286
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:18,309
Even if we tried to save some money
by using different equipment,

287
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,469
we probably wouldn't save much.

288
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,109
So, I wanted to discuss something

289
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,429
with you guys.

290
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:24,149
Can we put

291
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,029
all our winnings from the tournaments of

292
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,029
of the next few months into the club?

293
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,229
I'm okay with that.

294
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,189
But it may not help that much.

295
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:37,269
We'll do it this way.

296
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,829
In any case, we'll save as much

297
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,029
and earn as much as we can.

298
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:41,709
We only need to get by
for two months, right?

299
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:43,269
Let's overcome this together.

300
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,229
Can you give me another sachet?

301
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:50,629
Take all you want.

302
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,900
(Energy Drink)

303
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,820
(Young Space Tennis Club)

304
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,020
(Office)

305
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:00,749
Come in.

306
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,029
Don't you need to rest

307
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:06,429
after working all night?

308
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,029
It's okay.

309
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,349
I'm eating

310
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,429
the gummies you bought for me.

311
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,669
I need to replenish

312
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,669
all sorts of vitamins.

313
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:13,909
It tastes pretty good.

314
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:14,589
Do you want one?

315
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:15,469
No, thanks.

316
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,429
You should keep some for yourself.

317
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:17,509
You work so hard.

318
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:19,669
Are you okay?

319
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:21,909
It's nothing more

320
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,509
than carrying out basic tasks
to survive.

321
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:24,709
I'll be fine.

322
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,309
We haven't come to the hardest part yet.

323
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:30,549
I cannot fall now.

324
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,509
I'm really okay.

325
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:40,629
Others may not know.

326
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:41,709
But I'm not clueless.

327
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,389
What does the offer letter

328
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:44,749
from Jiang Jie mean to you?

329
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,509
Can you really give up?

330
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,509
It's Sales Director.

331
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:51,749
A career advancement.

332
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:53,989
That was what I wanted.

333
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:55,269
But not anymore.

334
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,549
Are you going to do this to the end?

335
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:59,069
What are the chances?

336
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:00,989
Not much.

337
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,229
But I don't want to give up either way.

338
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,269
They were discussing how to save

339
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,709
and help the club at my house yesterday.

340
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,069
The club is facing

341
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,469
an unprecedented crisis.

342
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:16,389
But it's also

343
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,189
the most united we've ever been.

344
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:19,069
That's why

345
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:20,229
I can't give up.

346
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,109
Okay.

347
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,549
There's nothing I can help much.

348
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,149
Luo Le's child support

349
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,389
is enough to cover expenses.

350
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,069
You can delay my salary.

351
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:35,189
The coach's mid-term fee

352
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,309
can be postponed for two months.

353
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,749
At most two months.

354
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:06,509
Is Jiaojiao not awake yet?

355
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,189
He went to the club early this morning.

356
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,669
I didn't sleep

357
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,309
all night yesterday.

358
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,789
I was thinking

359
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:51,349
about how we got to this point.

360
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:52,909
Jiang Jie,

361
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:56,789
I've wanted to ask you this.

362
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:58,949
Do you think there's still love

363
00:17:58,949 --> 00:17:59,909
between us?

364
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,189
I'm not talking

365
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:04,069
about the love between husband and wife.

366
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:07,069
I'm talking about the love
between a man and a woman.

367
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,429
We started dating

368
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,709
back in the university.

369
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,629
It was our first love, wasn't it?

370
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,589
Let's not compare with others.

371
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,589
We'll just compare ourselves.

372
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,069
We had

373
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,709
a really good time back then.

374
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,309
But over the years,

375
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:32,989
honestly,

376
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:36,189
do you still have feelings for me?

377
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,869
I feel like I'm the air

378
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,389
in this family.

379
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:45,749
It seems people can't live without me.

380
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:49,429
But no one can see me.

381
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,149
Some people may not have

382
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:53,789
high expectations for love.

383
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:57,309
But I can't stand a loveless marriage.

384
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,669
I can endure a marriage

385
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:02,149
without conjugal life.

386
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,469
But I can't endure

387
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:07,829
a marriage without love.

388
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:18,549
Give me some time, okay?

389
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:19,909
Give me some time

390
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,189
to think about all of this.

391
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,589
Let's break it off on good terms.

392
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:36,949
I've emailed you the information.

393
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:38,149
(Chen Ke's Personal Details)

394
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:38,909
Of course,

395
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:39,669
I don't think

396
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:40,709
no one can find anything on it.

397
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,669
But at least
we can rule out some possibilities.

398
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:49,069
Mr. Jie, Liang You'an is here.

399
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,469
Let her come in.

400
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,549
Mr. Jie,

401
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,749
this is our club's management plan
for next month.

402
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:02,989
You can take a look at it.

403
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,429
Give us two more months.

404
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:18,869
Help us go through

405
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:19,549
these two months.

406
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:20,749
I promise you

407
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:22,429
that the club

408
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,869
will no longer be a burden
or liability to you.

409
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,580
(Club's Management Plan)

410
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:31,189
If you close down

411
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,709
the club now,

412
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,389
wouldn't it just prove

413
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,149
Mr. Gao's doubts?

414
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:37,589
I know

415
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:38,549
our club

416
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:39,629
may seem unnecessary to others

417
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,029
and dispensable.

418
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:41,909
But these past few months

419
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,509
of training and competition

420
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,789
have given each of us

421
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,829
a new life goal,

422
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:46,789
including myself.

423
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:50,869
Give us a little more time,

424
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:51,549
just a little.

425
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,309
I guarantee that our club can be turned

426
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,909
from trash into treasure.

427
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:00,789
Over the years,

428
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:04,029
we've been competing with each other.

429
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:05,629
Do you think

430
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:06,869
taking away my online sales

431
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,109
means you're about

432
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,069
to win?

433
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,829
Of course, I can't win.

434
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:13,909
But can you win?

435
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:16,789
We must keep competing

436
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:18,389
but neither of us should win

437
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:19,669
nor lose.

438
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:22,829
That's what the president wants.

439
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:32,749
You're right.

440
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,749
After all,

441
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,869
having the usual opponent

442
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,029
is better

443
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,309
than a suddenly emerging greenhorn,

444
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:41,029
isn't it?

445
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:42,549
But you took away

446
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,109
my online sales,

447
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,549
I have to explain

448
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:46,629
to my subordinates.

449
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:49,669
I'll shut down the tennis club.

450
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:53,149
Everyone will think

451
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,829
I bowed down to you.

452
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:56,949
So you'll save face.

453
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,189
So do you want the details?

454
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,389
There are three directors
for online sales.

455
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:02,629
I'll only remove one.

456
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:05,229
The other two who are your people will stay.

457
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:20,589
You'an,

458
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,229
can we stop getting entangled

459
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,029
in this issue?

460
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,949
Okay. I'll admit.

461
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:29,509
I made a mistake.

462
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,829
I thought this tennis club

463
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:35,429
could turn into something valuable

464
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,669
and diffuse a difficult situation.

465
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,709
But I never expected

466
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:41,349
a tennis club that was losing money

467
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,389
to start becoming profitable
and valuable,

468
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:45,069
it would still be my treasure.

469
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,789
Do you think Gao Li

470
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:48,669
can tolerate it?

471
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,749
Let's not waste any more time

472
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:54,349
on something that has no value.

473
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:56,269
Enough said.

474
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:59,389
Since you've fulfilled

475
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:01,629
your promise

476
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,509
and proven your ability.

477
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:05,349
Come back.

478
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,189
Come back to Young Space.

479
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,229
I'll give you a better position.

480
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:16,469
No.

481
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,429
The club manager

482
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:20,829
is the best position.

483
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,309
If you want to sacrifice the club
for a greater interest,

484
00:23:25,749 --> 00:23:27,069
don't count me in.

485
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:47,469
(Jiang Jiaojiao)
(Dad, drop by the tennis court.)

486
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,940
(Young Space Tennis Club)

487
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:11,389
Dad,

488
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,389
you always miss my matches.

489
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:16,429
I was planning

490
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,189
to get you two tickets

491
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:21,909
for the tour next month

492
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:23,429
to show you my capabilities.

493
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:25,949
But I don't think

494
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:28,669
I will have

495
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:30,509
the chance anymore.

496
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:32,669
That's why I ask you to come

497
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:34,509
to let you see

498
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:37,229
what your son, Jiang Jiaojiao,

499
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,269
has been practicing at the club

500
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,509
all these years.

501
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,869
Bring it!

502
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,469
This one is called a topspin forehand!

503
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:53,709
This one is called a topspin backhand!

504
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:56,109
This one is called a slice forehand!

505
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:58,829
This one is called a slice backhand!

506
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:01,469
This one is called a forehand volley!

507
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:02,989
Backhand overhead!

508
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,469
Overhead shot!

509
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:15,709
Dad,

510
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:20,269
let me ask you one thing.

511
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,069
Does this club

512
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:24,669
have any dirty secrets,

513
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,349
like taking bribes or something?

514
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:28,549
Of course, not.

515
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,069
Why are you afraid then?

516
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:32,989
Just let them investigate it.

517
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:36,109
If you just walk away

518
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,549
after others throw mud at you.

519
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:38,789
That'll always make you look bad

520
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,069
in their eyes.

521
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:50,589
I know.

522
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:52,109
In your eyes,

523
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:54,029
your son, Jiang Jiaojiao, is not capable

524
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,669
and has never achieved anything

525
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:57,949
that can make you proud.

526
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:00,429
But this time it's different.

527
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,069
We're confident in making

528
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:04,429
the club successful.

529
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,069
Dad,

530
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:07,709
please trust me this time.

531
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,149
I'll definitely do it right.

532
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,789
Can I stand up for you this time?

533
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:22,109
Son,

534
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:24,989
you played really well, very well.

535
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:26,669
You see, every ball was in play.

536
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,309
But

537
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,069
in the adult world,

538
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:32,309
your ball

539
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,669
may not necessarily be in play.

540
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,469
Do you understand?

541
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:38,429
You've grown up now.

542
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:40,269
You know when to support your dad.

543
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,829
But

544
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:44,709
the club must be closed.

545
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:47,069
I've already told Liang You'an.

546
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,189
There won't be any room for discussion.

547
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:04,989

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,540
♪I can't sleep well, even in my dreams♪

568
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,149
We've all heard

569
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,309
that your club is going bankrupt,

570
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:28,069
right?

571
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:29,669
- I heard it too.
- Is it going to close down?

572
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,989
Ma'am, sirs.

573
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,909
I'm really sorry.

574
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:40,509
Can you give me some time

575
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,709
to explain?

576
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,069
I didn't deliberately conceal it

577
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:44,349
from everyone.

578
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:45,829
These past few days,

579
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:47,029
I've been trying to negotiate
with the company

580
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,509
to see if there's any chance

581
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:49,909
to save the club.

582
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:51,949
But now I have to be honest

583
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:53,109
with everyone.

584
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,029
The company did withdraw its investment.

585
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,909
The company withdrew?

586
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,909
What about our money?

587
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:58,749
What do we do now?

588
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,229
I thought you had the support
of a big company.

589
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:01,109
We thought so too.

590
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:04,669
How can you just shut it down?

591
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:05,629
That's right.

592
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:06,949
We're all dying to know.

593
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,269
What are we going to do?

594
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:10,149
What about our kids' training?

595
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,549
That's right.

596
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,189
We've already made the arrangement.

597
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:14,629
What about our kids' training?

598
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,429
You can't just
let us suffer the consequences.

599
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,909
- I'm really sorry.
- We have a few training sessions.

600
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,029
I've let down your trust in us.

601
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,029
But what I can promise you now is

602
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,309
that we'll refund

603
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,709
every single penny

604
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,669
of your membership fee.

605
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:29,309
However,

606
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,909
as the manager of the club,

607
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:32,229
I don't want to see our team

608
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,429
disbanded just like that.

609
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:35,029
I want to make one last effort

610
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,509
to find another way.

611
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,949
At the moment, our coaches

612
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,869
and most of the players

613
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:40,949
are still following my lead.

614
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:42,509
My new plan

615
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:43,789
is to find a new investor

616
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:44,589
and a new location

617
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:45,989
to build a new club.

618
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,949
Yes.

619
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:49,989
But that's not something
that can be done quickly.

620
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,389
Listen.

621
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:53,309
Today we're here

622
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,229
to represent the majority

623
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:56,349
of the parents.

624
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:57,229
Ms. Liang,

625
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:59,309
we have a good impression

626
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:01,309
of you and the coaches.

627
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,629
If you can reorganize the club

628
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,069
as soon as possible

629
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,589
without delaying
the kids' training,

630
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,229
then we are willing

631
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,189
to follow you.

632
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:08,869
That's right.

633
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:09,989
We're completely willing.

634
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,029
- We're willing
- We're all willing.

635
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:11,789
When it comes to tennis,

636
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:12,949
the location doesn't matter to us,

637
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,109
what matters to us

638
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,469
is the reliable manager.

639
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:16,749
Am I right?

640
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,789
Responsible coaches,

641
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:19,869
and hardworking players.

642
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:20,589
Am I right?

643
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:21,229
- That's right.
- True.

644
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:22,189
Ms. Liang,

645
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,149
as long as you can reopen

646
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:25,309
your club,

647
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:26,629
we'll just go wherever you go.

648
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:27,549
That's right.

649
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,109
We'll follow you wherever you go.

650
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:30,949
We'll follow you.

651
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,069
We still trust you.

652
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,149
We don't trust anyone else.

653
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:35,309
- That's right.
- She's right.

654
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:37,509
This is unexpected.

655
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,629
I'm truly grateful for your support.

656
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:41,789
One month.

657
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:43,589
Give me one month.

658
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:44,589
I will do my best

659
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,109
to establish the new club
as soon as possible.

660
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:47,189
- Okay.
- Sure.

661
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:48,269
- No problem.
- Okay.

662
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,709
Parents,

663
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:51,269
please register at the front desk.

664
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:51,829
Okay.

665
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:52,309
Let's go.

666
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:53,949
Sorry to trouble you.

667
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:55,109
I'm really sorry.

668
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:06,589
You'an.

669
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:09,589
Mingyu,

670
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:11,109
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:13,669
I caused you trouble

672
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:15,189
by making you reveal

673
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:16,589
so much internal information to me,

674
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,869
which cost you your job.

675
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:19,829
It's okay.

676
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:24,189
If you're willing,

677
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:26,309
do you want to join me?

678
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:27,509
Okay.

679
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,060
(Young Space Tennis Club)

680
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,469
We have such nice tennis courts.

681
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,989
It's a shame to give up on it.

682
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:43,509
Yeah.

683
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,029
When I first came here,

684
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:46,549
I didn't expect

685
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:47,949
to find a new goal here.

686
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:49,869
But I definitely didn't expect

687
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:50,909
our club to be shut down

688
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,749
when we were so close

689
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:53,549
to being promoted to A-rank.

690
00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:59,589
It's so frustrating.

691
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:02,629
So what's the plan now?

692
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:05,069
Are you planning to find new investors?

693
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,269
Actually,

694
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:07,549
I have already contacted
a few potential investors.

695
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,429
Let me show you something.

696
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:15,909
Last time during training,

697
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:16,749
I saw D3

698
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,109
wearing a neat team uniform

699
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:18,989
and I was so envious.

700
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:20,789
When we came back and looked at ours,

701
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:22,269
it just didn't feel satisfying.

702
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:23,429
I thought

703
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:24,949
we should have
a good-looking team uniform

704
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:26,069
and logo too.

705
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:26,949
But after going back and forth

706
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:27,989
with the logo design,

707
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:28,789
I never seem to be satisfied.

708
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:29,989
Before it was even finalized,

709
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,469
the club is gone.

710
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:33,989
Is there any reliable investor willing

711
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:34,949
to invest in us?

712
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:36,229
There will definitely be.

713
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:37,109
Coach Yan said

714
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:38,429
he would give me two months

715
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:39,589
and he won't leave.

716
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:41,589
The coaches, players, and members

717
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:42,509
are all there.

718
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,109
As long as we find a reliable investor

719
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:45,149
and a new venue,

720
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:45,749
the club

721
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,149
can start operating immediately.

722
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,149
Then let's continue with the design.

723
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:50,509
We can always change the name if needed.

724
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,509
Anyway, as long as
we still have our team,

725
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:53,829
we'll eventually be able
to wear the uniforms.

726
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:56,789
Let me see.

727
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,029
I think

728
00:32:59,229 --> 00:32:59,749
I remember

729
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:00,789
Coach Yan's suggestion from last time is not bad.

730
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:01,869
The anchor logo.

731
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:05,149
So we'll draw

732
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,109
an anchor

733
00:33:12,229 --> 00:33:14,429
with two tennis balls on the sides.

734
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:20,629
What do you think?

735
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:22,069
It looks good.

736
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:23,669
That's the general idea.

737
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:24,789
In any case,

738
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:25,749
you have to find

739
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,149
a professional designer to draw it out.

740
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,509
You're pretty talented.

741
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:30,549
Of course.

742
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,029
Because I pour my heart into this.

743
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,069
Even though

744
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:34,749
I haven't been here for long,

745
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:36,149
this club

746
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:37,989
really

747
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,429
feels like home.

748
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:43,909
I'm sure it's not just me.

749
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:45,789
Everyone else probably

750
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:46,949
doesn't want this club
to dissolve either.

751
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,509
It seems putting the anchor

752
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:51,909
in this circle is also good.

753
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:03,389
Let me try.

754
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:11,628
Drawing an anchor.

755
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:16,549
If we do it this way,

756
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:18,708
doesn't it look a bit like

757
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,469
a smiley face with a tennis ball
on each side?

758
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,749
It looks a bit strange.

759
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,389
Wait!

760
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:29,708
What?

761
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:30,749
Liang You'an.

762
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:34,628
I have a question

763
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,668
that I've always been curious about.

764
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,148
You see.

765
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:38,389
You train every day.

766
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:40,389
But where do you get so much time?

767
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,909
How do you still have time
to play badminton?

768
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,989
And tennis?

769
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,269
And cook?

770
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,628
You can even draw

771
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:48,989
and design logos.

772
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,668
Aren't these simple tasks?

773
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,820
(Tianyun Tennis Court)

774
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,549
Thank you so much, Alex.

775
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,669
I have no problem.

776
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:09,829
I can do it anytime.

777
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,109
Okay. Then

778
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:12,709
you can schedule meetings
with these investors.

779
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,469
I'll have everything ready on my side.

780
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:15,589
Okay, okay.

781
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,989
Thank you so much.

782
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:20,469
You should rest early.

783
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:22,509
Okay, see you.

784
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,189
(Song Sanchuan)
(Are you still awake?)

785
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:19,309
(Liang You'an)
(I can't sleep.)

786
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:41,669
Hi.

787
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:42,829
(Well,)

788
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:45,349
(I went survey nearby courts during the day)

789
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,069
(and sorted out all the
temporary court rental prices,)

790
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,549
(photos, and information into a folder)

791
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:51,309
(and sent it to your email.)

792
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:52,629
That was fast.

793
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:54,229
I'll go and take a look then.

794
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,829
(Are you in bed preparing to sleep?)

795
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:01,269
Well, no. I can't sleep.

796
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,669
I can close my eyes.

797
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,269
But my brain won't rest.

798
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:06,429
So it's better to get up
and do something.

799
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,229
(All right.)

800
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:11,389
(Then you can get back to work.)

801
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,549
(I'll hang up then.)

802
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:15,949
Well, are you getting ready for bed?

803
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:17,509
No.

804
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:22,149
(Then can we not hang up?)

805
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:23,989
(Just switch the video call)

806
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:25,749
(to a voice call.)

807
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,949
(Then we can do our own work.)

808
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:30,949
Is something wrong?

809
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:35,109
I just feel like today

810
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,549
is particularly hard to get through.

811
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,629
It felt like the day was too long.

812
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,349
I don't want to be alone.

813
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,309
And there's no sound in the house.

814
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,260
(The ride-hailing driver
is arriving soon.)

815
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:03,389
Song Sanchuan,

816
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,229
are you still there?

817
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:07,229
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

818
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:07,989
Well,

819
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:09,069
I just hired a ride

820
00:39:09,189 --> 00:39:10,509
and it'll arrive in three minutes.

821
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:11,669
(I checked the route)

822
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,029
(and there are seven traffic lights.)

823
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:14,069
(If I'm lucky)

824
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:15,149
and they're all green,

825
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,989
I'll reach your place

826
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,309
in 25 minutes,

827
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:18,989
which is around 10:38 p.m.

828
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,149
Please wait for me.

829
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:22,069
(See you.)

830
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,460
(I'm using Didi Express
with license number Guangdong B39G743)

831
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:50,509
Coming.

832
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:55,549
I brought

833
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:56,829
all the ingredients from home.

834
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:58,189
Tomorrow, An Cong

835
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,589
will think a thief broke into the house.

836
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:00,829
Come in.

837
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:36,789
You're good with a knife.

838
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,709
A few days ago,

839
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:42,109
Alex took me to meet some investors.

840
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,109
We'll need to have
another round of discussion.

841
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:46,829
Something aside from monetary interest,

842
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,469
and something more practical.

843
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,349
I also want to touch
on the philosophical side of things.

844
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,589
After all, we'll be working together.

845
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:53,669
If our values don't align,

846
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:55,469
working together in the future
will be a drain on both of us...

847
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:58,389
Liang You'an. Oh, Liang You'an.

848
00:40:58,549 --> 00:40:59,909
You've been using your brain

849
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:01,149
for much too long.

850
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:02,549
Now, I announce

851
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,749
that you'll be entering a forced shutdown.

852
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:06,589
Just leave these things.

853
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,349
Let me do it.

854
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:08,349
Just sit over there.

855
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:09,429
Don't do anything.

856
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,909
You can just play with your phone.

857
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,229
Don't think about work.

858
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:13,669
Then leave everything here to me.

859
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:14,309
Okay?

860
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:16,309
Here, wipe your hand.

861
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:24,429
It smells so good.

862
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:26,429
You'll get to eat them soon.
