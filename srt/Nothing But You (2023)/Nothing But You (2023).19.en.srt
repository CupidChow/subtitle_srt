=Episode 19=

3
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:56,340
(Let Me Interview You, Ms. Liang.
What Kind Of Man Do You Like?)

4
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,720
Ms. Liang.

5
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,400
Ms. Liang.

6
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,680
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

7
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,360
Good morning.

8
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
Last time when you came to Shanghai

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
to play a friendly match with us,

10
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,240
I wasn't the one leading the team,

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
so I didn't get a chance to meet you.

12
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
But this time,
I finally have the opportunity.

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,440
When I sent you an email last time,

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,920
I thought

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,800
that you might not come
because of the long travel

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
and the need to send players
and pay the expenses.

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
I didn't expect them
to actually show up.

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Thank you.

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,960
I must give face to Coach Yan.

20
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
After all,

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,000
he used to be a veteran player of D3.

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,600
Although there were some conflicts

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,640
between him and the club before,

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,000
the players are still keen

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
to attend the training sessions
conducted by him.

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,920
Moreover,

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
I also want to see

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,160
what results he has achieved

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
with you in the past few months.

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
We can learn from each other.

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,280
All right.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,120
Make sure your players don't hold back.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
After all, we might
meet each other again

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,000
in the upcoming tour.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
I really can't control this.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
In competitive sports,

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,520
if the opponent is good,

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
he'll make you stronger.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
But if the opponent is weak,

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
then the tournament will be lackluster.

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
We won't hold back for sure.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,720
However,

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
if your team still plays like before,

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,800
I cannot guarantee

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,920
what level of performance
my players will have.

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,800
You even designed

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
great team uniforms.

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,680
That's excellent.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
I should have thought of this.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,200
Ms. Liang,

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,320
team uniforms represent the team spirit.

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,880
Did you know

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,120
what conclusion I have gained

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,840
after managing a club for so many years?

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
In a club,

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
everything can be sold,

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,480
but team spirit is priceless.

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
I mean it.

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,600
Did you know

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
that when I first managed D3,

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
what scene it was?

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,360
It was a mess

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,320
with no cohesion among the players.

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,120
So at that time,

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,840
I decided...

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Go.

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,360
I had to make my players

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
have a sense of belonging.

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,560
True enough,

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
after the team uniforms were designed,

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,440
the training attitude and spirit

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
of my players completely changed.

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
It's like they're rooted.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,040
So

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,560
details determine success or failure.

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
This saying is logical.

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
It's just like our team name.

78
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,120
By the way,

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,120
look at our logo.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,080
Our logo

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,480
embraces profound meaning.

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Do interpret it.

83
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,040
Sure.

84
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,040
It's a "D"

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,160
and a "3", and that makes up "D3".

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,520
What are you talking about?

87
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,720
It's too superficial.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,880
Let me tell you.

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,560
"D1" is arrogant.
[*D1 sounds the same as No.1 in Chinese]

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
"D2" is self-defeating.
[*D2 sounds the same as No.2 in Chinese]

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,800
"D3" is just nice.
[*D3 sounds the same as No.3 in Chinese]

92
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,920
Am I right?

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,360
Let's take a five-minute break.

94
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,360
Go.

95
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,320
Thank you for your hard work.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,080
Liang You'an.

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
My neck is a little sunburned.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,320
Did you bring sunscreen?

99
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,720
I didn't bring it.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,040
Let me go to the room
and bring it for you.

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,880
That's fine.

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,840
Save the hassle.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
I brought it.

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,360
Is it this?

105
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,280
Here you go.

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
All right. Thank you, Mr. Lu.

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,560
Skip the formality. Here you go.

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Thank you.

109
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Oh yes, I forgot about it.

110
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,520
You can't apply the sunscreen yourself.

111
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
You're going to use your hands

112
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,000
to play tennis later.

113
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,520
If your hands are slippery,

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
you won't be able
to hold the tennis racket.

115
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,720
That's fine.

116
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
Let me help you with this.

117
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,560
No.

118
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,040
Let me do it myself.

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,720
I can wash my hands later.

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
I apply sunscreen for my players
every day.

121
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,360
Don't worry.

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,560
I will...

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,560
It's too much.

124
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,640
I'll do it slowly.

125
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,800
I'll apply it slowly and evenly.

126
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,160
Yes.

127
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,880
No. You wait...

128
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,240
It's okay.

129
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:35,480
You applied it on my hair.

130
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Dai Yi.

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,840
I didn't.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,520
How are things going?

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm good at this.

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,200
Trust me.

135
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,520
That part won't be exposed to sunlight.

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,200
It's okay.

137
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,160
You're already sunburned here.

138
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,800
I have to apply more layers here.

139
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,520
You applied it on my hair.

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,080
That's enough.

141
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,280
How is it? Are you okay with it?

142
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay, that's enough.

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,080
That's enough.

144
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,720
That's fine, right?

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,960
Thank you.

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,760
You're welcome.

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,000
Carry on with your training then.

148
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,440
With regard to the rope ladder,

149
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,400
their speed is...

150
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
Assemble!

151
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,280
Before the group matches begin,

152
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,280
listen to me for a bit.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,560
This has already been listened

154
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,040
by everyone from D3.

155
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,240
Tennis

156
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
is recognized as
a physical game of chess.

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Why is it called so?

158
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,360
You take a stopwatch

159
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,320
and calculate the time.

160
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,200
In an hour-long match,

161
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
the actual time the ball is in motion

162
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,520
is only 13 minutes.

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
The rest of the time

164
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
is used for thinking.

165
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
Our training time
is very short this time.

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,240
So I hope everyone has a focus

167
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
and a breakthrough.

168
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Get used

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,720
to playing tennis with your brain.

170
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,480
What does it mean
to play tennis with your brain?

171
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,840
When you're standing on the court,

172
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,400
you need to know where the landing point
of your shot is,

173
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
how your opponent will return the ball,

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
what the return path is,

175
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,280
and how you'll respond.

176
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,880
It's like playing chess.

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
In your mind,

178
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,880
at least deduce three steps.

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
So after all,

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
playing tennis

181
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
is about strategy formulation.

182
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,680
So Song Sanchuan,

183
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,160
you broke my serve last time,

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,800
I guess

185
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,360
you should have some experience in it.

186
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Coach Yan, don't mock me.

187
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,040
I admitted last time

188
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
that when I played with you,

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
I just studied the first three shots.

190
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,360
But there is one thing

191
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
you unintentionally did correctly.

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,000
You planned the shot trajectory.

193
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
So I hope you

194
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,000
bear these four words in your mind.

195
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,760
Always remember
to plan your shot trajectory first

196
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,960
before improving your technique

197
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,640
to complete your plan.

198
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,960
Not many people can achieve this,

199
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,720
but as long as you can achieve it,

200
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,040
you will naturally

201
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,760
be the most outstanding person in this sport.

202
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,360
So be more confident.

203
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
Your approach is correct.

204
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,160
I merely think

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
that the speed of tennis balls

206
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
is slower than that of badminton,

207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,440
so I guess we need more time

208
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
to think when playing.

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
I forgot to introduce him to you all.

210
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,360
This is Song Sanchuan, who has switched
from playing badminton to tennis.

211
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,440
The ways of playing both sports
are different.

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Feel free

213
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,040
to give him a hard time.

214
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,160
Okay,

215
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,120
that's it for the morning training.

216
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,790
(Tennis Together)

217
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
Don't walk with us.

218
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:33,060
(Fansi Bote)

219
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,240
Let me tell you something.

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,880
What's the matter?

221
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,800
Let me tell you something.

222
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,760
What's the matter?

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,599
Let me tell you something.

224
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,000
No.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,280
What matter is it
that you have to cling to me like this?

226
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,040
It's sticky.

227
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,479
Are you courting Liang You'an?

228
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,760
Are you?

229
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,480
What are you talking about?

230
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,360
Are you courting Liang You'an?

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,280
Lower your voice.

232
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,120
Are you?

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes, I am. What's it?

234
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm into her.

235
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Am I alert?

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
But you don't know

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
that I already confessed to her.

238
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,560
But I was rejected.

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
Chuan, you're really something.

240
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
It's already surprising
that you're into someone

241
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,280
who's ten years older than you,

242
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,640
but it turns out
that the girl is Liang You'an.

243
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Why do you keep making things

244
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,960
harder for yourself?

245
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
I kept challenging myself

246
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,520
until I failed.

247
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
She said

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
that she wanted to focus
on her career first.

249
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
She doesn't want
to be in a relationship.

250
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,400
But I think...

251
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
Why are you standing here?

252
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,360
Come on, let's go and eat.

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Wait, we have something to talk about.

254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,040
You go first.

255
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Help me add a drumstick.

256
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,520
You're isolating me, right?

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,040
Help me add a drumstick.

258
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,040
We'll be there in a moment.

259
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,840
So mysterious. I'll make a move first.

260
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,160
Tell me quickly.

261
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,160
Now, I

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,920
just want to work with her

263
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
to make the club better.

264
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
Everything else will come later.

265
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
Now I understand

266
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,360
why you've been training so hard lately.

267
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Love makes one tireless.

268
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,920
Double Jiao,

269
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,320
I treat you as my bro.

270
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,440
Now that you've asked me,
so I didn't keep it from you.

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,360
But can you keep this to yourself?

272
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,840
Don't misjudge me.

273
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm not a blabbermouth.

274
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,120
Because of your sincerity,

275
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll help you pursue her.

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,320
No.

277
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,240
Forget it.

278
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
Let me tell you. For this kind of thing,

279
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,360
I need to rely on myself.

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Enough said. Let's go for lunch.

281
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,080
Don't drop the ball

282
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,880
on the afternoon training by the sea.

283
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,760
Chuan, you're really something now.

284
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,960
You're even challenging me.

285
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm going to give you a hard time
in the afternoon.

286
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,040
We're ten years apart in age.

287
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm ten years old,
and she's 20 years old.

288
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,880
This is my normal attitude.

289
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,240
Okay.

290
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,680
Let me say a few words.

291
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,960
In fact, according to Ms. Luo's nutrition plan,

292
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,240
we weren't supposed to drink tonight,

293
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,920
but

294
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,680
I discussed with Coach Yan.

295
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,320
Since this is the first night,

296
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,160
we want everyone

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,040
to get familiar with each other quickly.

298
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,640
So

299
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
we prepared some alcohol.

300
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,760
It's limited to one can per two persons.

301
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,880
Don't drink too much.

302
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Liang You'an,

303
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,560
you're being too stingy.

304
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,520
You've even set a limit.

305
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,880
Today, this...

306
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,760
Ms. Liang is right.

307
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,000
Well,

308
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,280
Chuan, take the lead to not drink.

309
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,160
Stop it.

310
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
Everyone, drink a little less,

311
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,840
because we still have training later.

312
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,520
Over here, I'd like to say thank you

313
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,200
to everyone at D3 Club.

314
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
Thank you.

315
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,840
- Great!
- Great!

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,120
I hope that in our upcoming training,

317
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,280
everyone can bring out the best in you.

318
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,920
Let's learn from each other and have fun.

319
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,560
Let's dig in.

320
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
Well said, Ms. Liang.

321
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,240
Ms. Liang.

322
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
Have some kebab.

323
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,320
It's okay. You guys enjoy.

324
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,680
It's delicious.

325
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,600
Thank you.

326
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,160
Come, sister.

327
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,520
Cheers.

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I saw that Mr. Lu

329
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,640
was quite interested in you.

330
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,880
Why don't you go chat with him
for a bit?

331
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,040
I can't thank you enough.

332
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm really scared of Mr. Lu.

333
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,680
I mean it.

334
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,840
He likes

335
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
to indulge in empty talk very much.

336
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,320
I saw through the chat scenarios
involving male bosses

337
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
a long time ago.

338
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,560
If there was only one male boss

339
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,520
on the spot today,

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,240
then tonight

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,160
would be his one-man show.

342
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
He would be keen

343
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
to impart everything he learned,

344
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,000
including knowledge, values,
and experiences,

345
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
to everyone.

346
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
If there were two male bosses,

347
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
they would compete with each other.

348
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240
No one would look up on anyone.

349
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,040
What if there were three male bosses?

350
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,800
They would compliment each other.

351
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,480
"You're great."

352
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,680
"No, you're great."

353
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
"No, you're the one who's great."

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,480
It's so accurate.

355
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
Look at that group over there.

356
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,800
Let me switch my feet.

357
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,400
Stand on one foot and head to the sky.

358
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
You can't stand still.

359
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,240
Not really.

360
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,760
Voila, you can't stand still.

361
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,880
Even though they're a bit silly,

362
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,560
upon making a comparison,

363
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,800
it feels refreshing.

364
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,240
This job is awesome.

365
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,480
You should have brought me in earlier.

366
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,560
It's like

367
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,960
a street beggar suddenly being taken to

368
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,120
a top buffet restaurant.

369
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,080
Once the door is closed,

370
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,720
you can't leave until you're full.

371
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
I wonder which one of them

372
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,200
is Ms. Luo's type.

373
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,680
You can't do it anymore.

374
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,560
You can't do it anymore.

375
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,400
Don't move.

376
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,760
Song Sanchuan.

377
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,160
In our club,

378
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,000
we're not allowed
to get into loving relationships.

379
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,120
I haven't finished talking.

380
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,080
Song Sanchuan isn't my type.

381
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,280
What's the haste?

382
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,440
I... I'm not being hasty.

383
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,400
Aren't you being hasty?

384
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,520
Don't move. Let both of us do it.

385
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,040
Hurry up.

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,520
We need to high-five each other.

387
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,080
Come.

388
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,240
No.

389
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,680
No, let's play push-and-pull.

390
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Make a move there.

391
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,400
No.

392
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,960
Come, Ms. Liang.

393
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,240
Taste my kebab.

394
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,520
My kebab-making skills
are passed down from my ancestors.

395
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,520
You'll regret not trying them.

396
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,680
No.

397
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
You can't do it.

398
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,560
This must be Ms. Luo.

399
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I've heard so much about you.

400
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,160
Hello.

401
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,880
You should also try some.

402
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,200
Ms. Liang,

403
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,040
we didn't finish our conversation
this morning.

404
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,800
I mean it.

405
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,440
I feel

406
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,040
that we hit it off.

407
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,680
In fact, I understand your situation.

408
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
Starting a club isn't easy.

409
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,760
So I really want

410
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,400
to chat with you

411
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
about my entrepreneurial history.

412
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,360
I've had three major ups and downs
in my life.

413
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,800
Liang You'an.

414
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,400
This...

415
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
I have something to talk to you.

416
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,400
How come?

417
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,960
Ms. Luo,

418
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,760
you may not have heard me

419
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,800
clearly just now.

420
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,560
I said

421
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,520
that I've had three major ups and downs

422
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,800
in my life.

423
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
I need to keep an eye on the kids.

424
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm sorry.

425
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,200
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I can't hold it anymore.

426
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
Ms. Luo, come and join us.

427
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Thank you

428
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,320
for coming to my rescue.

429
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,480
Mr. Lu is quite a good person.

430
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,440
It's just that he's so into
sharing things with people.

431
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,640
He talked to me all day

432
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,120
about his entrepreneurial history
of starting the club.

433
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,000
He even wanted to share with us

434
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,320
his personal growth history just now.

435
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,040
Men can get quite annoying

436
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,840
when they talk too much.

437
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,080
The weather is not bad.

438
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,000
It hasn't been like this
for a long time.

439
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,920
It's great to stroll here,

440
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,520
with the sea breeze blowing.

441
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,760
It feels worthless

442
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
to mention the stress and worries.

443
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,960
Didn't you say just now

444
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
that you had something to talk to me?

445
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
What's it?

446
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,800
There's nothing.

447
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Huh, Song Sanchuan,

448
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,720
you took me out

449
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,800
but ended up saying nothing?

450
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,080
Didn't you say

451
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,560
that you didn't like men
who talk too much?

452
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Then

453
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,600
what other kinds of men
do you find annoying?

454
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,560
I don't like men
who are too calculating,

455
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,000
meaning like to beat around the bush,

456
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,240
and those who get jealous easily.

457
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,080
They have a narrow mind.

458
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,400
I can't accept them.

459
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,880
You...

460
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,480
No.

461
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,560
Are you mocking me?

462
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,840
No.

463
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
Okay.

464
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,440
Okay, let's do it this way.

465
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,960
Let me interview you,

466
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,400
Ms. Liang.

467
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,960
Well,

468
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
what kind of man

469
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
do you like?

470
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,519
What kind of...

471
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,519
Please say it right to the microphone.

472
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,800
Hey, is it okay?

473
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,440
Yes, it's fine.

474
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,279
What kind of man?

475
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,720
The man who can

476
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,120
make eye contact with a dog
for ten seconds,

477
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,400
loves eating fish,

478
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,279
and knows the number of turns

479
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,239
in the sewerage.

480
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,279
What?

481
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,440
What's this?

482
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,120
It's not worth it
for you to use my microphone.

483
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,800
You just can't be serious.

484
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,680
All these that you said

485
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
aren't even defining characteristics.

486
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,840
You... Say it again.

487
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,840
No.

488
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
I said it seriously.

489
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
Think about it.

490
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:40,960
Look,

491
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,280
if someone can make eye contact
with a dog for ten seconds,

492
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,800
that means he's very caring

493
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,160
and is willing to communicate
with animals.

494
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,560
As for the point of loving to eat fish,

495
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,120
don't we say that those
who love to eat fish

496
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,080
are intelligent?

497
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,200
They're meticulous.

498
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
If one knows the number of turns
in the sewerage,

499
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,920
that means he's very handy

500
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
and can provide a sense of security.

501
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,600
No, the last point

502
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,240
is ridiculous.

503
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,480
Don't tell me you know
what the sewerage of each house

504
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,320
looks like.

505
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,560
That would be a cockroach.

506
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,800
You don't understand it.

507
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,680
Let me tell you.

508
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,480
This is all based on the experience

509
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
of a senior.

510
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Fine, the experience of a senior.

511
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,080
Since you're experienced,

512
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,480
it's unlikely that you're single
at the age of 32 years old.

513
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,880
My microphone is very expensive.

514
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,760
Don't drop it.

515
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm buying it.

516
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,120
How much is it?

517
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
It's fine. I'll give it to you.

518
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,520
Why aren't you eating, Chuan?

519
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm not in a hurry.

520
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,880
Let's go, Chen Zhe.

521
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
Let's wait for Sanchuan.

522
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,240
I...

523
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,840
He's slow at eating.

524
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
There's no point waiting for him.

525
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,200
Lying in bed would be so comfortable.

526
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,760
Go.

527
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,240
All right then.

528
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,800
We'll make a move.

529
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
Walk faster, hurry up.

530
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,360
Don't drink it anymore.

531
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,680
Why are you in such a hurry?

532
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,380
(Song Sanchuan)

533
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,160
Eat a drumstick.

534
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,880
Each of your recipes

535
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
has been carefully crafted by Ms. Luo

536
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,200
for you personally.

537
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
Take it back and eat it yourself.

538
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,920
It's fine.

539
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,400
Lacking in this won't put me to death.

540
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,480
I'm eating fish.

541
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,320
Well,

542
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,160
I love eating fish.

543
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,240
Fish is high in protein as well.

544
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
How was the training today?

545
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,680
Not bad, it was pretty good.

546
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,760
I've never been trained

547
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,480
by the sea before,

548
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,720
it's quite enjoyable.

549
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,480
This training session is shorter,

550
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,520
so you should treasure this opportunity

551
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,240
and focus less on other things.

552
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,520
Think more about skills,

553
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,240
methods, and movements,

554
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,800
and play well.

555
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,360
You know?

556
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,640
Song Sanchuan,
I'm asking you a question.

557
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,840
Can you do it?

558
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
What happened to you?

559
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm choking.

560
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,640
What's stuck?

561
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,680
A fish bone.

562
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,120
How are you feeling now?

563
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
It still hurts when I swallow saliva.

564
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,080
The doctor said

565
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
it'll be a bit difficult to swallow

566
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,560
for these few days.

567
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,560
Well,

568
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,600
if you can't eat fish,

569
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,120
then don't pretend like you can.

570
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,280
You ended up choking yourself.

571
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,400
Didn't you say that?

572
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
What did I say?

573
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,880
You said you liked men who eat fish.

574
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,000
Song Sanchuan,

575
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,920
I meant

576
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
that I like men who eat fish,

577
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,520
but I don't like men

578
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,880
who get fish bones
stuck in their throats.

579
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,000
Did I not tell you

580
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,440
not to think
about other pointless things these days?

581
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
Go, focus on your training.

582
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,960
Go.

583
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,400
Go for training.

584
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,280

Look at Song Sanchuan.

631
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,160
That brat

632
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
is clinging to others
to ask questions again.

633
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,760
Song Sanchuan

634
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,800
is exceptionally good
at observing and imitating.

635
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,600
He can then deploy others' tactics.

636
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,480
When he broke my serve last time,

637
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,400
I could tell.

638
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,120
Our coach is still upset about it.

639
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,760
If I were upset,

640
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,120
I wouldn't have mentioned it at all.

641
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,480
I'm not a petty person.

642
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
This kid is suitable for playing tennis.

643
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,240
He's gifted.

644
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,360
He has a good sense of understanding

645
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,840
and is intelligent and persistent.

646
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,240
This is the first time
you've praised Song Sanchuan.

647
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,080
Do you also think he's good?

648
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,680
You're just an amateur.

649
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,680
How did you discover it?

650
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,280
Because he's good-looking.

651
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,920
I really shouldn't bother
talking to you.

652
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,280
I mean it.

653
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
Don't you think

654
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,400
that all top athletes

655
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,600
in any sport

656
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,440
have one thing in common,

657
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,320
that is, they are good-looking?

658
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,360
Their movements are smooth
and their bodies are flexible.

659
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,280
If they can combine

660
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,560
strength, speed,

661
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,680
and emotional contagion seamlessly,

662
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,800
isn't this a natural

663
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,040
external performance of talent?

664
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,320
Beauty in sports

665
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,000
is like courage in battle.

666
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,960
You still said there was nothing
going on between you both.

667
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,360
I've sent it to you.

668
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,080
Look at that infatuated face yourself.

669
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,080
What's wrong?

670
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,710
(Divorce agreement)

671
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,240
This coffee machine is broken.

672
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,520
How come it's like this?

673
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,040
What happened?

674
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
It wasn't plugged in.

675
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,360
Hello.

676
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,400
Three of them want to meet me.

677
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,560
Sure.

678
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,360
(Divorce agreement)
You arrange it at 10:30 a.m.

679
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes, you got what I mean.

680
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,360
The three directors with Gao Li before

681
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,040
want to meet me today
to report on their performance.

682
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,760
They're definitely going to take sides
and show their loyalty.

683
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,520
This will be interesting to watch.

684
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,800
I'll tell you

685
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,640
when I'm back tonight.

686
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,580
(Divorce agreement)

687
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,080
Hello, Mr. Jie.

688
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Mr. Jie, something bad happened.

689
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,360
Now,

690
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,240
in response to this report email,

691
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,240
the first inquiry investigation
is being conducted

692
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,320
regarding our company's
marketing director Jiang Jie's

693
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,720
abuse of power

694
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,680
to embezzle company assets.

695
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
The email

696
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,320
mainly provides evidence

697
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,440
that the Young Space Tennis Club,

698
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,440
as a perennially losing

699
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,280
bad asset,

700
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,960
is actually Jiang Jie's abuse
of public office for personal gain.

701
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,320
He occupies the company's
facilities and funds

702
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
to set it up for his son,
Jiang Jiaojiao.

703
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,000
At the same time,

704
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,600
he has been engaging in bribery

705
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,240
under the guise
of some corporate competitions.

706
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,840
Various financial statements

707
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,400
from the past

708
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,840
and a video

709
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
of Jiang Jiaojiao competing

710
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,960
with an internet celebrity

711
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
are provided as evidence.

712
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Meanwhile,

713
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,120
we received additional information
this morning

714
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,560
that the club is currently

715
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,160
undergoing a closed training
at a high-end resort,

716
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
and the issue of expenses
needs to be verified.

717
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,640
After this,

718
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
we can check one by one.

719
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,840
After this training is over,

720
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,000
you'll soon face

721
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,840
a large number of practical matches,

722
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,680
so our coaching team

723
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
has discussed

724
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,360
and decided to give you more training.

725
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,640
Coach,

726
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,160
what are you doing?

727
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,840
Beach volleyball?

728
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,200
You talk too much.

729
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,400
Shut up and listen carefully.

730
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,560
The average height of hitting the ball

731
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,920
of some tennis master players

732
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,880
is about one meter above the net.

733
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,240
A volleyball net

734
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,640
is over a meter

735
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,640
higher than a tennis net.

736
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,520
So,

737
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,080
as long as you can hit the ball
over the net,

738
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,040
and it lands within the boundary,

739
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,040
you'll have excellent stability.

740
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,080
Why did they even soak the balls
in water?

741
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,640
After these balls are soaked in water,

742
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,160
their weight and resistance
will increase,

743
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,560
which will help

744
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,480
your power and stability.

745
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,880
Anyway, it's the last day,

746
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,880
and I don't plan to take them back.

747
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,320
Ms. Liang.

748
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,560
I guess you don't mind.

749
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,320
It's fine, go ahead.

750
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,000
If worse comes to worst,
I'll ask for money when I go back.

751
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
All right, then let's get started.

752
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,360
Come!

753
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,640
Come on, coach.

754
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,960
How do we play it?

755
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
It's too difficult.

756
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
Come, let's stop.

757
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,080
You have no motivation?

758
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,680
Let me motivate you.

759
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,560
For those who are dissatisfied with me

760
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,400
in this training session,

761
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll give you a chance to get revenge.

762
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,200
I'll stand here

763
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,120
and won't go anywhere.

764
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,480
If you hit me, you're lucky.

765
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,400
Come on.

766
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,600
If you have any grudges against me,

767
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,040
then settle them.

768
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,840
Don't hold an umbrella, Coach Yan.

769
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,320
Be careful.

770
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,080
Play well.

771
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,560
Be careful.

772
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Okay, let's start.

773
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,680
Exert more strength.

774
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,560
Come on, Jiang Jiaojiao.

775
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm waiting for your ball.

776
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,760
It's not working.

777
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,560
It's not working.

778
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,880
I'm getting tired of waiting here.

779
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,380
(Match categories, men's singles,
Name, Jiang Jiaojiao)

780
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,540
(Jiang Jiaojiao, ranking, 95)

781
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Jiang Jiaojiao.

782
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,280
Jiang Jiaojiao.

783
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,440
What's it?

784
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
Listen to me.

785
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,400
According to the score statistics

786
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,520
of the previous matches,

787
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,480
the latest ranking

788
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,240
of the top 100 men's tennis players

789
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,240
is 95 for Jiang Jiaojiao!

790
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,360
One, two, three!

791
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,720
Yes!

792
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
Coach Yan,

793
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
am I awesome?

794
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,160
I entered the top 100.

795
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,000
There's nothing to be proud of

796
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,760
for just entering the top 100.

797
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,920
Come, get down.

798
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,640
It's time for training.

799
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,800
Training?

800
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,000
Come on.

801
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,120
Throw him into the sea.

802
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
Throw him into the sea.

803
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,880
Go!

804
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,480
One, two, three!

805
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,720
Okay, everyone,

806
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,760
look over here.

807
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,520
I announce

808
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,000
that our seven-day training

809
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,880
is officially over today.

810
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,160
Thank you, everyone.

811
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
Thank you, each and every one of you,

812
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,600
for giving it your all.

813
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,520
Also, thank you to our coaching team

814
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,160
for guiding us.

815
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,880
It's hoped

816
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,640
that our club can score A

817
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
in the upcoming tour.

818
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,920
I've booked a private room

819
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,160
tonight

820
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,240
to treat you all to dinner.

821
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,960
Ms. Luo said

822
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,760
that today, nobody

823
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,680
needs to watch their diets.

824
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,360
You may eat as you wish.

825
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Wait a minute.

826
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,520
Wait a minute.

827
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,440
Before dinner,

828
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,320
pass your personal training report

829
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,280
to me.

830
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
For those who don't hand in reports,
you'll watch others eat standing up.

831
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,000
You don't have to wait for me.
You may go off work.

832
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,280
Okay, Mr. Jie.

833
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,480
Put a spicy one on this table

834
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,400
and a clear soup on that one.

835
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,119
Stop!

836
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,000
Coach Yan,

837
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,079
these kids

838
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
have been on a low-fat, low-salt diet
for a week,

839
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,840
and they're counting on today's meal
to satisfy their cravings.

840
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,559
- Coach Yan.
- Coach Yan.

841
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,440
I'm sorry.

842
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,720
We'd like to have one spicy hot pot

843
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,360
and one extra spicy hot pot.

844
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,920
Thank you.

845
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,480
I was afraid that Ms. Luo
might have some objections.

846
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,680
Don't use me as your shield.

847
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
They may go all out in taking meat
since we've allowed them to.

848
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
Really?

849
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,560
Yes.

850
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,600
Then we'll have

851
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,680
the pork intestine, pork brain,

852
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,440
and that one.

853
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,880
Then for me,

854
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,560
I'd like to have crispy fried pork.

855
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Please get two portions for us.

856
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,920
Take a look.

857
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,160
I know what I usually eat.

858
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,640
Okay.

859
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,160
Get me a case of beer.

860
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
No, get us two instead.

861
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,760
Today, except for the coaching team,

862
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,160
you guys are not allowed
to break the alcohol ban.

863
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,520
That's not fun.

864
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,680
Hello, waiter.

865
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,720
I'm sorry, everyone.

866
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm a talkative person

867
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,640
and I couldn't help

868
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,800
but to say a few words to everyone.

869
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,600
First, Jiang Jiaojiao

870
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,200
has successfully ranked

871
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,560
in the top 100.

872
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Jiang Jiaojiao, you're amazing!

873
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,240
This means that Young Space Tennis Club

874
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,520
is only one step away

875
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,120
from being selected

876
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,520
as an A-rank tennis club,

877
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,800
which is to enter

878
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,480
the top ten in the national tour.

879
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,280
So the success

880
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,880
of this training session

881
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
is just a beginning.

882
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,960
After going back,

883
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,640
the coaching team

884
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,240
will summarize everyone's
technical improvements

885
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,840
and deficiencies.

886
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,360
We hope

887
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,000
that you can perform at your best

888
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,680
in the tour

889
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
and defeat opponents
of your respective levels.

890
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,600
I think

891
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,200
we're going to achieve what we want.

892
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,200
Good!

893
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,840
- Young Space!
- Young Space!

894
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,400
Well,

895
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,120
I think it shouldn't just be me speaking

896
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
all the time.

897
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,760
You should say a few words,

898
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,440
Coach Yan.

899
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Say a few words to everyone.

900
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,480
- Coach Yan.
- Coach Yan.

901
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,320
Coach Yan, say something.

902
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,680
Coach Yan.

903
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,840
Since you asked me to,
I'll say a few words then.

904
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,600
Don't regret it later.

905
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
I'll be honest then.

906
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,680
As you all know,

907
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,760
before I came here,

908
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,320
I had a falling out with D3.

909
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,600
The invitation letters

910
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,560
sent by the clubs
that would like to invite me

911
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,080
were sorted based on strength

912
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,920
from high to low.

913
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,440
There was one whole pile of them
on my table.

914
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,240
My real thought at the time

915
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,600
was to let myself rot

916
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,320
and go into self-exile.

917
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,560
So I randomly picked one

918
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,520
from the bottom of the pile,

919
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,120
which happened to be you guys.

920
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,200
This is so sarcastic.

921
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:06,760
Coach Yan,

922
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,400
you're too straightforward.

923
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Absolutely.

924
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,720
Shut up.

925
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,160
But after a few months,

926
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,760
I didn't expect

927
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,320
to see you all making progress.

928
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,560
The two people

929
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,720
I thought were the least reliable,

930
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
Liang You'an

931
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,640
and Song Sanchuan,

932
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,080
I saw

933
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,760
that one arrived the earliest every day,

934
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,880
and one was the last to leave every day.

935
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,280
They bring the team together,

936
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,640
with no one dropping the ball.

937
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,000
I've seen

938
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,280
many clubs

939
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,320
and led many teams,

940
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,880
but you all

941
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,760
are different from those I've met.

942
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,200
You have a real fighting spirit,

943
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,640
a desire to win,

944
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,080
and the essence of sports,

945
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,720
which is rare

946
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,000
in all the commercial clubs

947
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,680
where people only chase money.

948
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,000
Come, let's toast

949
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
to our future victories together.

950
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,640
Coach Yan,

951
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,560
the victory would be unremarkable

952
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,600
if you had picked
the first letter on top.

953
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,080
You were amazing

954
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,840
to dare let yourself rot.

955
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,560
Let's work hard

956
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
and try our utmost

957
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,560
to make Coach Yan great again.

958
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,680
Come, let's

959
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,280
toast to Coach Yan.

960
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,320
Come, let's toast to Coach Yan.

961
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,000
Drink it.

962
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,560
Do you still remember

963
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,160
the time at the barbecue stall

964
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,720
when I drank too much?

965
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,640
That day, I said some things,

966
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
some of which

967
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,240
were just my drunken bravery,

968
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,560
and some of which

969
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,920
were just empty talk.

970
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,080
But today,

971
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,960
you really did it.

972
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,000
You've made it through

973
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,680
to the tour.

974
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,240
Today, I don't want

975
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,640
to be the manager of the club,

976
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,800
instead, I want to be Liang You'an.

977
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,200
I still have to stand up.

978
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,760
I want to say

979
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,680
thank you to you all.

980
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,280
I really appreciate you all.

981
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,280
Thank you for making

982
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
my empty talk

983
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,080
almost come true.

984
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,680
Thank you.

985
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,720
Now it's up to you to perform well
and get results.

986
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,520
Play well, okay?

987
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,400
I'll be drinking water
instead of alcohol.

988
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,600
Come on, enough said.

989
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Let's all bottoms up.

990
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,160
That's a must.

991
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,920
Come.

992
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,880
It's Young Space's turn to win now.

993
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,500
(Urgent, call back as soon as possible)

994
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,640
Hello.

995
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,680
(Ms. You'an,)

996
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,040
(Mr. Jie is being investigated)

997
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,360
(because of the club's affairs.)

998
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,400
(Can you quickly come back?)

999
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,120
Sure.

1000
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,880
I know it.

1001
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,160
Can you drink slowly?

1002
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,320
You all eat first.

1003
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,240
There's a little problem
with Young Space.

1004
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I have to go back.

1005
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,320
How are you going back?

1006
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,880
Coach Yan drove yesterday.

1007
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,760
I'll borrow your car.

1008
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,160
Can you go back yourself?

1009
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,040
Let me keep you company.

1010
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,640
That's fine.

1011
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,080
I've booked the bus for you
for tomorrow,

1012
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,960
so don't be in a hurry.

1013
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,920
Take your time to go back after dinner.

1014
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
It's too dangerous for a girl

1015
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,760
to drive on the highway alone,

1016
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
you should let a guy go with you.

1017
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,240
Let me keep you company.

1018
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
All right, thank you.

1019
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,320
Thank you for your hard work.

1020
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,840
You should go ahead to eat.

1021
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,160
Come, let's toast to Coach Yan together.

1022
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,920
Okay.

1023
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,320
Coach Yan, I'll say no more.

1024
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,600
Thank you for your hard work!

1025
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,720
Our gratitude towards you
is expressed through the alcohol.

1026
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,760
Keep it up.

1027
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,320
You're doing well
at facilitating their relationship.

1028
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
You know that too.

1029
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,800
I can see that.

1030
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,080
Song Sanchuan

1031
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,440
just can't stop

1032
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,600
taking his eyes off Liang You'an.

1033
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,360
I thought I was the only one
who knew about it.

1034
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,760
Let's eat.

1035
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,280
(Wi-Fi hot spot)
Let me connect to the WiFi.

1036
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,480
Do you want to take a nap?

1037
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,080
There are still three hours left.

1038
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,600
I'm not sleepy.

1039
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,280
Mingyu sent me a document

1040
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,520
just now.

1041
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,360
Is it serious?

1042
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,760
Let me take a look.

1043
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,960
It's more serious than I thought.

1044
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,440
(Don't tell me he's going)

1045
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,120
(to shut down the club.)

1046
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,120
Didn't I send you a message on WeChat

1047
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,520
telling you not to wait for me?

1048
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,760
Did you not receive my WeChat message?

1049
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,440
I thought it was better

1050
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,040
to wait for you with this.

1051
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,540
