00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,960
(Song Sanchuan, Are You Ready?)

4
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,574
It's a dog.

5
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:02,854
What's yours?

6
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,374
Mine's a pair of slippers.

7
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,374
I really like this puzzle.

8
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:15,494
Every scene is so healing to me.

9
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:16,574
Yes, it is.

10
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:19,294
I feel that every scene in this puzzle

11
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,014
would be us in the future.

12
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,094
We are heading home now.

13
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,694
We'll go back to where we once were.

14
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,174
Are you ready

15
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:35,534
to go and face the court?

16
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,294
I feel reluctant to leave this place and go,

17
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,654
but I really to get back to playing tennis.

18
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:46,854
Speaking of which,

19
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:47,734
how are we going to bring this back?

20
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:49,574
It's too big for us to fit in a box.

21
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:51,414
We can't just mail it home either.

22
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:52,334
What if they shatter it?

23
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:54,934
If so,

24
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:56,254
I can only carry it with me.

25
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:57,454
That's what I thought too.

26
00:02:58,294 --> 00:02:58,974
You can carry it.

27
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:00,294
Okay, I'll carry it.

28
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:02,854
A hug for you.

29
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,054
Come.

30
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,174
Am I pressing against the puzzle?

31
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:08,334
Be careful.

32
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:09,494
Oh no.

33
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:14,934
Which one are you?

34
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:15,854
This is me.

35
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,854
If so, the person beside you is me.

36
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,974
You can play the accordion
at such an old age?

37
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:22,414
I'm a fast learner.

38
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:24,894
All done.

39
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,214
We can't bring that into a plane.

40
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,094
I...

41
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:43,054
I can't bear to part with it.

42
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:44,534
I need to hold it in my hands
for as long as possible.

43
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:45,574
Let's go.

44
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,220
(Ancong Wig Shop)

45
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:57,614
You're recovering pretty well.

46
00:03:58,294 --> 00:03:58,934
No wonder

47
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,614
you didn't need me to support you
when you went up the stairs.

48
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:02,614
It's still hard for me to run and jump.

49
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:04,054
I need to wait for my leg strength to recover.

50
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:06,334
That's pretty good.

51
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,854
I was wondering

52
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,414
why you mailed the wheelchair back in advance.

53
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:11,614
This is great.

54
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:12,614
I can rest at ease now.

55
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:16,014
You chose a great rehabilitation center.

56
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,293
Yeah.

57
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:19,973
Indeed.

58
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,574
Did you gain a little weight?

59
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:25,574
Yeah.

60
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:27,814
I had to reduce
the amount of exercise drastically.

61
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:28,854
It's difficult to lose weight like that.

62
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:31,294
I'll lose them when I resume my training routine.

63
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,494
I think it's more than that.

64
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,094
You two must've led a happy life too.

65
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:41,334
How's your relationship with her?

66
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:43,494
It's going pretty well.

67
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,654
Pretty well?

68
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:47,734
What's with that expression then?

69
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:52,494
For the rehabilitation fee,

70
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:54,294
my insurance policy didn't cover all of it.

71
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,094
I had to fork out a large part of it.

72
00:04:57,854 --> 00:04:58,974
And, Liang You'an

73
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:00,494
forked out the money for me.

74
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,014
And,

75
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:04,414
during our one-month stay in Chengdu,

76
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:07,254
she was the one who paid for everything.

77
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:11,454
So, you feel terrible about it?

78
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,854
Mainly, she didn't bring it up
in front of me.

79
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:16,454
I know she's trying to help me relax.

80
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,774
But the more she keeps it down,
the more terrible I feel.

81
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,254
I don't want her

82
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,294
to spend that much money on me

83
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:24,854
especially when we just started dating each other.

84
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:25,974
I'm having a rough time.

85
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,494
My legs haven't recovered yet.

86
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,254
I can't pay her back for some time.

87
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,174
On our way back,

88
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:33,814
I was waiting for her to bring it up

89
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:35,414
and discuss the expenses with me.

90
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:37,214
But she...

91
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,614
She acted like nothing happened.

92
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,574
How could she bring it up?

93
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,454
I'm sure she knew

94
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,854
you were thinking about it.

95
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,214
But, according to my limited personal experience,

96
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,574
this is what I think.

97
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,174
The harder it is for you two

98
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:58,134
to bring something up,

99
00:05:58,534 --> 00:05:59,614
the more you need to confront it.

100
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,494
However,

101
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,774
the person who has the courage
to bring it up first

102
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:07,294
will bear more of the consequences.

103
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,254
You have to understand that.

104
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,580
(Top Smash)

105
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:26,414
Before you came back,

106
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:28,334
Coach Luo spent over a week

107
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,494
to dissect and create this plan thoroughly.

108
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:33,654
The plan is so detailed that the training plan,

109
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:36,174
training goals, techniques, movements,

110
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:37,254
and the point of strength exertion

111
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:39,334
are labeled with different colors.

112
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,454
It's detailed indeed.

113
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,094
Coach Yan gave me
all the technical suggestions.

114
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:46,854
I just filled up the plan according

115
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:48,014
to the therapist's framework.

116
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:49,974
Alright.

117
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:53,214
I'll definitely complete everything in the plan.

118
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,134
Of course you need to do so.

119
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,094
However, you mustn't

120
00:06:57,094 --> 00:07:00,054
over-exhaust yourself like before, understood?

121
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,454
Yeah, I understand.

122
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:03,814
Sanchuan,

123
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,934
when it comes
to rehabilitation training,

124
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,014
I hope you can change your mindset.

125
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,574
This is a delicate

126
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:13,694
and complicated process.

127
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:15,974
It's impossible for you to do it alone.

128
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,014
But it's precisely because of that fact

129
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:22,134
that we are here to assist you.

130
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,494
We will be there for you for every phase.

131
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,094
Once we go through everything

132
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,134
listed on the paper together,

133
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,254
I'm sure you can return to the court again.

134
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,014
Okay.

135
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:45,814
What's the matter?

136
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:47,214
What is it?

137
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,254
Why must we speak here?

138
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,054
Ms. Liang, I want to ask you something.

139
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,294
You see,

140
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,014
about the part I need to pay

141
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,214
for my rehabilitation fee,

142
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:00,974
who paid for it?

143
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:04,454
It was me.

144
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,134
I didn't intend to hide it from you.

145
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:08,814
It's just

146
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:10,694
that I didn't want to tell you right now

147
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,414
because I was afraid
you might feel stressed out.

148
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:16,694
This is great.

149
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:19,134
At least you'll tell me the truth

150
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:20,934
when I ask you something.

151
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,014
I'm not that unreliable

152
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:25,654
in your heart, right?

153
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,254
But of course.

154
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,574
Song Sanchuan, to me,

155
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:33,374
you're a born athlete.

156
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,693
No matter if it's as your girlfriend

157
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,534
or as the club manager,

158
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:41,173
it's my duty to pay the fee for you.

159
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,014
Good.

160
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,174
I was waiting for you to say that.

161
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,254
This.

162
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:53,094
Keep it.

163
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,580
(Rehabilitation Center Payment)

164
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,254
Read the back.

165
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,630
(IOU, as of today, Top Smash's player,
Song Sanchuan)

166
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,180
(will borrow money from Top Smash's
Ms. Liang You'an due to private reasons.)

167
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,420
(From today onward, he shall clear his
rehabilitation bill within nine months.)

168
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:06,534
Once I return to the court

169
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:08,214
and get into better tournaments,

170
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,934
I'll pay you back
once I get enough prize money.

171
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,254
No matter if it's as your boyfriend

172
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:16,854
or as an athlete under your club,

173
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,454
I don't want to owe you any money.

174
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:22,574
So,

175
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:24,694
I guess this is a promise.

176
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,960
(Top Smash)

177
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:38,734
I missed you.

178
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:40,614
I'm serious.

179
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,094
Who are you trying to disgust here?

180
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,654
You missed me?

181
00:09:45,694 --> 00:09:47,574
I'm being honest here.

182
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:48,934
No one else was a match for me

183
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,534
when you weren't here.

184
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:52,254
Training was boring.

185
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:53,894
Hurry up

186
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,454
and recover from your leg injury.

187
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:56,974
You'll return to your spot

188
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,774
on the wall before long.

189
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,094
Don't worry.

190
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,854
I plan to do something about it.

191
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:03,174
That's more like it.

192
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:04,974
I'm in last place again.

193
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:06,214
I won't be on the wall

194
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,254
when Chuan comes back.

195
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:08,454
It's fine.

196
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,294
I'm going to take my mock exam soon.

197
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:11,654
If I do get into college,

198
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:13,134
I think I won't be here.

199
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,334
Do you guys have to
be that down about it?

200
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,694
You're speaking as if
we're going to part ways.

201
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:17,894
Chen Zhe,

202
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:19,054
today's your treat.

203
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,614
Prepare a welcoming feast for Sanchuan.

204
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:22,814
Alright. We shouldn't be so down
on such joyous occasions.

205
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:23,734
What do you guys want? It's my treat.

206
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:25,574
It should be my treat today.

207
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:27,774
I have something to tell you guys too.

208
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:29,654
- Let's go.
- Time to eat!

209
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:30,534
Let's go.

210
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:32,934
(Happy Times)
The gist of it is

211
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:35,094
that I have a girlfriend now.

212
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:35,774
I think

213
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:37,174
you guys should know who it is.

214
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,214
I thought you were going to talk about
something else.

215
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:41,774
Chuan, did you buy us a meal

216
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,534
just to talk about this?

217
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:44,974
Weren't you guys concerned
about it before this?

218
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:45,974
Now, I've finally made it work.

219
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:46,894
I have to tell you guys about it.

220
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:48,214
You didn't need to tell us.

221
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,174
You two had been going out
in private for one month.

222
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:51,734
You'll be a dufus if you can't
win her heart even after that.

223
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:52,894
You're exaggerating it.

224
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:53,774
You're trying to
connotate something here.

225
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:54,934
- Give it to me.
- No, I'm not.

226
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:56,374
I'm too lazy to explain myself
to you guys.

227
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:58,214
I know what you're trying to say.

228
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:00,774
Before this, Zhang Yan said

229
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:02,054
that if members of the club
got into a relationship,

230
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:03,014
it would affect the others

231
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,094
and make them unhappy.

232
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:05,854
My buddies, listen.

233
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:07,774
At least we won't do that here.

234
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:09,334
All of us are from

235
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,214
Young Space Tennis Club.

236
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:11,534
Our characters

237
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:12,654
are just like the dishes on the table.

238
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:14,254
They're obvious to see, am I right?

239
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:15,774
Anyway, I support you.

240
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:16,974
People say getting into a relationship

241
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:17,814
will affect your study

242
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:18,974
and distract you from tennis.

243
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:19,774
I don't think so at all.

244
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:21,854
For this placement test,

245
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:24,134
I got from 30th to 8th place.

246
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,294
Chen Zhe and I

247
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:30,014
didn't let anyone else

248
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:30,974
take your spot in our dorm.

249
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:31,934
We kept the bed for you too.

250
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,294
It's not like we treat everyone as buddies.

251
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:35,934
It all depends on you now.

252
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:38,214
Don't worry.

253
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,094
My picture will be
on the wall before soon.

254
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:41,734
I'll kick you guys off my spot

255
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:42,934
in a short while.

256
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,454
Come, since everyone's here,

257
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,934
- let's have a toast!
- Yeah.

258
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,694
The public account
is returning to normal.

259
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,734
The malicious comments are dropping.

260
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,694
I knew you were too busy to tend to it.

261
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:57,934
Now that you're back,

262
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:58,974
I'll accept whatever punishments
you give me.

263
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,974
Did you find out

264
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:05,294
who posted those comments?

265
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,334
I think

266
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:08,414
it's our rival companies.

267
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:11,134
After all, our club is pretty popular lately.

268
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:12,774
After the wild card competition,

269
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:14,414
views on Top Smash's public account

270
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,414
were increasing rapidly.

271
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,574
It's normal for them to ride
the coattails of our popularity.

272
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,934
Luckily, I wasn't featured
in many of the scenes.

273
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,454
That's why they retreated

274
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:23,294
once the wave was over.

275
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,734
In the future, I won't show my face

276
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:26,934
in any of the public account's videos.

277
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:30,414
Actually, I think it's pretty good

278
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:31,814
for things like these to happen
at this stage.

279
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,854
We can treat it as a reminder.

280
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,774
Regarding the controversial comments
you made before,

281
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:37,894
I think

282
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:41,734
you can issue a sincere public apology.

283
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:43,294
We should admit our mistakes.

284
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,854
However, we shouldn't
become someone else's scapegoat.

285
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:47,134
It's fine.

286
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:48,374
It's all in the past.

287
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,374
Just work earnestly in the future.

288
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,174
There's no need to let people
punish you again and again

289
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:54,494
because of something like this.

290
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:59,374
Are you saying that I'm still a part of Top Smash?

291
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:00,334
Isn't it obvious?

292
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,574
No choice. We share the same surname.

293
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:09,574
Are you too free?

294
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:25,734
What are you looking at?

295
00:13:26,494 --> 00:13:27,254
Look at your computer.

296
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,374
Okay.

297
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:44,294
All my friends bought her toys

298
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:47,094
like dolls,

299
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:48,574
toys for playing house,

300
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:50,134
or toy dressers, except for you.

301
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:51,134
I suddenly realized

302
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:53,054
that all the RC cars,

303
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,094
Ultraman figures,

304
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,614
and construction toys

305
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:56,774
were bought by you.

306
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:01,774
I hate it when people differentiate genders

307
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,534
with the toys they buy for young children.

308
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:07,694
If you give birth to a boy
in the future,

309
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:10,374
I can buy Barbie dolls for him if he likes it.

310
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,094
You can give birth to a son.

311
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:14,414
I'll buy it for him.

312
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,054
I still can't say for sure

313
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:17,854
if I can give birth at this age.

314
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,894
I always say such inauspicious words.

315
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:24,974
What?

316
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,654
I don't mind at all.

317
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,134
Why are you sighing?

318
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,054
But let's be honest here.

319
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,974
You didn't have a boyfriend

320
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:37,934
when you went for the surgery.

321
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:39,934
Now, it's different.

322
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,014
Although you have a young boyfriend,

323
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:45,294
have you thought about the future?

324
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,094
I have.

325
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:51,094
It's because

326
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,534
he feels trustworthy to me.

327
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:55,054
But I didn't think much about it.

328
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:57,814
When you think about
all these uncertainties,

329
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:00,254
it'll only distract you
from enjoying the present.

330
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:03,774
Buddy, you've fallen for him completely.

331
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:05,974
You weren't like this in the past.

332
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:07,654
Wait.

333
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,374
My hand is too slippery to open this.

334
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,174
Yes, get me some tissue paper.

335
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:26,894
I never felt anything like this before

336
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,254
in the past.

337
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,654
But now, I'm truly happy.

338
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,934
I'm serious.

339
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:34,534
Do you know something?

340
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,814
Lately, I smile for

341
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:38,454
no reason sometimes.

342
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,734
And, if I was suddenly reminded of him,

343
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:44,414
my heart will turn into soda water

344
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,854
and bubbles non-stop.

345
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,294
I can't contain myself from
the happiness I'm feeling.

346
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:52,614
More like love potion.

347
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:56,694
You're immersed in
the sweet river of love.

348
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,014
It feels great, huh?

349
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:00,174
It's a shame

350
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,814
that I'm going to be alone
in the future.

351
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,214
I feel so lonely.

352
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,214
You won't stay lonely.

353
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:10,854
I'm sure someone will keep you company.

354
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,654
- Really?
- Trust me.

355
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,334
Why are you still awake?

356
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,694
(I can't sleep.)

357
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,454
What's the matter?

358
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,654
Are you hungry or thirsty?

359
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:52,814
Isn't there a thermos cup

360
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:53,894
and an apple by your bedside?

361
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,014
I'm not used to sleeping without you.

362
00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:58,934
Me too.

363
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:00,854
(Sports Injury Management)
I'm reading.

364
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,574
What book are you reading?

365
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:07,054
It's pretty boring.

366
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:07,814
Do you want me to read it?

367
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,093
Sure.

368
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:10,774
I love boring stories.

369
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:13,294
Read it to me.

370
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:13,894
Alright.

371
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:16,093
I'll treat this as
my bedtime reading then.

372
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:17,054
Go on.

373
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:18,853
I'll read it then.

374
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:25,294
One's mindset and belief
during rehabilitation.

375
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:28,574
One's emotion isn't the only factor

376
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:30,334
that will develop a physiological effect
to the body.

377
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:33,134
Other senses are just as important.

378
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,854
One's mindset, especially belief,

379
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,534
will develop a physiological effect
to the body too.

380
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,974
Currently, there's extensive research

381
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:42,734
toward such a placebo effect.

382
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:09,174
Ineffective therapies do affect the body.

383
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:11,574
Not only does it prove that...

384
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,294
Liang You'an,

385
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:30,814
are you asleep?

386
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:40,654
Good night.

During this period,

he has done well

413
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,334
in completing the specialized training.

414
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:18,974
He had no issues.

415
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:20,654
If so, we'll do an assessment for him

416
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,694
before he returns to competing.

417
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:23,894
We'll check out his numbers.

418
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:26,734
Are you prepared?

419
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,254
I'm okay now. Let's begin.

420
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,134
Let's begin then.

421
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,974
Alright. Ready, set, go.

422
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,694
16.11 seconds!

423
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:11,014
Nice!

424
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:15,054
Just now, we did a sprint test

425
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,414
and mobility test for him.

426
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,974
He did great. He passed.

427
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,374
(Top Smash Physical Fitness Test)
The test results of the standing long jump

428
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:23,894
(Top Smash Physical Fitness Test)
and high jump showed that he has achieved

429
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:25,974
90% of what he could achieve
before he got injured.

430
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:26,854
He passed!

431
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,014
After that, we did a strength test

432
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:33,294
for his injured hamstring tendons
and quadriceps.

433
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:36,054
He achieved 95% of

434
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,334
what his healthy leg could achieve.

435
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:38,134
He passed.

436
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:40,134
This is great.

437
00:21:40,454 --> 00:21:41,654
Regarding the last test,

438
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,614
we still need our coaches

439
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,294
to give you their assessments of you.

440
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:48,054
Coach Yan,

441
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,454
do you think

442
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:51,014
he can return to training

443
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,254
confidently for a prolonged period?

444
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:55,494
According to my observation,

445
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:56,974
he has almost returned

446
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:58,254
to the state before getting injured.

447
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,974
We recorded both his diet

448
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:01,014
and training amount,

449
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,574
including the strength of his muscles.

450
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:04,454
I think

451
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:06,734
he's returned to at least
95% of his previous form.

452
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,454
What do you feel about yourself?

453
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,534
You're not worried about
getting injured again, right?

454
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:15,174
Nope.

455
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:17,734
I've been training like the others

456
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,094
for some time now.

457
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:20,494
I'm confident in myself.

458
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,774
I can devote myself to competing again.

459
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:23,894
Congratulations.

460
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:25,974
You can return to competing.

461
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:27,654
Thank you, Mr. Pang.

462
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:32,814
Be gentle!

463
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:37,014
Hey, watch out for his knees.
His legs just recovered.

464
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:37,894
Slow down.

465
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:39,014
Everything's fine now.

466
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:47,134
Sanchuan!

467
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,014
I've prepared

468
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:50,334
the materials required
for the evaluation.

469
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:51,214
We can arrange Song Sanchuan

470
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:52,814
to compete by next week.

471
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:53,454
Good.

472
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,574
I'm already filtering out the
competitions he can compete in.

473
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:56,294
Alright.

474
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:00,214
Although we've prepared for it
for a long time,

475
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,534
I still feel amazed

476
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:05,094
when the result came out today.

477
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:05,734
Do you know something?

478
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:06,574
He actually returned to competing

479
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:07,694
in such a short time.

480
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,494
This is all about one's drive.

481
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:10,694
No one can replace it.

482
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:12,814
That's the beauty of sports.

483
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:15,254
Breaking one's limits
and challenge oneself.

484
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:19,494
Actually, I'm pretty impressed by you.

485
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:20,694
In the past,

486
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:22,614
you were professional.

487
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,094
But this time,

488
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,494
you were more than just professional.

489
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:28,654
What do you mean?

490
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:30,734
Look.

491
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:31,974
You spent so much of your time

492
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,774
to join him in his training

493
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:36,174
for the past few months.

494
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,374
It's all because
you cherish talents like him.

495
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:42,014
In the past few years,

496
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:42,734
I've encountered

497
00:23:42,774 --> 00:23:44,614
coaches in all kinds of sports.

498
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,294
Plenty of them were devious and cunning

499
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,774
in order to gain fame and fortune.

500
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:48,694
A coach

501
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:49,374
who cherishes his athletes

502
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:50,854
is difficult to find.

503
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,574
Training someone without
any selfish desires,

504
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:54,894
that's how we know you truly

505
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:56,214
to contribute to the sport itself.

506
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,254
Actually,

507
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,454
I'm not as noble as you say.

508
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:06,014
Mainly, it's because

509
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:07,374
I had a terrible experience before this.

510
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:10,654
You never told me

511
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:11,774
about what you encountered in the past.

512
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:13,934
Do I even need to do so?

513
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:16,374
I think you have already predicted it by now.

514
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:20,614
Me?

515
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,734
I just know a little about it.

516
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:25,574
I didn't ask them about the details.

517
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:33,534
I...

518
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,054
I made a fool out of my athlete before.

519
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:38,654
And, I'm divorced too.

520
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:43,214
You're speaking
as if no one is divorced.

521
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:46,694
You actually mind that
when you're a man?

522
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:49,574
I...

523
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:51,094
It's not like I mind it particularly.

524
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:52,934
Today isn't the day
to talk about the past.

525
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:54,694
Today is a joyous day.

526
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:55,974
Aren't you going to take a sip?

527
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,534
I thought you brought it with you
everywhere you go?

528
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:01,734
So, you did it to drown your sorrow?

529
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:07,974
It's been over half a month
since I took a sip.

530
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:22,254
Did you drive here today?

531
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:23,894
I can drive you back.

532
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,734
I sent my car for maintenance today.

533
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:37,934
Maybe next time.

534
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:46,574
Next time?

535
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,134
I did quit drinking.

536
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,860
(Top Smash)

537
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:32,654
Are you sure you want to buy
a pair of couple rings?

538
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,174
Don't you think
we're being too pure here?

539
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,694
Our undisclosed relationship

540
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:37,854
has already lasted for 100 days.

541
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,014
You gave all kinds of excuses

542
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:40,734
to keep our relationship a secret.

543
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,054
And I cooperated with you.

544
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,494
My probation period was over

545
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:44,814
long ago, you know?

546
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,214
Just pick one.

547
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:47,934
It's not like

548
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,094
I don't want to
disclose our relationship.

549
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:51,294
It wasn't appropriate for us
to disclose it to our club

550
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:52,974
before this.

551
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:55,094
That's why I didn't
say anything about it.

552
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:58,694
Look at this. This looks great.

553
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,334
This does look good.

554
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,814
Are you two here to choose
your wedding rings?

555
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:09,094
You can take a look
at our diamond rings too.

556
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:09,934
Sure.

557
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:12,494
Forget about diamond rings.

558
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,574
We'll check out the normal ones.

559
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:17,574
She already took them out.

560
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:20,774
It's not like you have to pay
to see them.

561
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:28,254
These are classic designs.

562
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,134
I saw them online before.

563
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:32,734
You have no idea, right?

564
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:33,894
When I was in college,

565
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:36,454
I even took a course in jewelry appraisal.

566
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:37,134
In the end,

567
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:38,174
our lecturer didn't show us
the real deal.

568
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,174
Isn't this the real deal?

569
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:41,134
Try it on.

570
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,454
It's not like you need to pay
to try them on.

571
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:45,374
Can I try them on?

572
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,974
You can try them on if you like them.

573
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:51,094
Do you like it?

574
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:52,974
It does look nice.

575
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:56,094
Alright. We'll take it. By card.

576
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,094
Alright, mister.

577
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:02,614
I got back my supplementary card.

578
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,694
Jiang Jiaojiao,
what do you mean by this?

579
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:08,694
I already bought you a diamond ring.

580
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,254
Aren't I obvious enough?

581
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:13,334
So, you lied to me and brought me
here to buy couple rings

582
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:14,654
because you still harbored
a grudge over that?

583
00:28:15,014 --> 00:28:16,334
Do you think I'm tricking you?

584
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:18,254
This is what I'm doing today.

585
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,974
When the ghost blocked off
our escape path

586
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,454
during the escape room game,

587
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:27,094
you didn't hesitate when I asked you

588
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:28,414
if you were daring enough to marry me.

589
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,134
I thought you were just joking.

590
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:31,454
The atmosphere came.

591
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:32,774
I wasn't joking.

592
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:42,334
Although we talked about getting married
that day,

593
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,374
I didn't prepare
an official proposal for you.

594
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,494
But I'm being sincere here.

595
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:49,214
Tao.

596
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,094
I like you.

597
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,374
I like you so much

598
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:55,014
that I want to call you my wife.

599
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:58,734
But I think we need an official process

600
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,094
before I can change my way
of addressing you.

601
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:01,654
So Tao,

602
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,774
I have a serious question for you.

603
00:29:03,854 --> 00:29:05,334
You must answer me honestly.

604
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:09,174
Are you willing

605
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:10,974
to let me call you my wife?

606
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:20,974
Yes, I do.

607
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:24,854
You do?

608
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,574
Say that again?

609
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:28,374
Yes, I do.

610
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:29,134
You...

611
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,020
(You've spent 15,200 yuan on jewelries
with your supplementary card.)

612
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:02,014
Currently,

613
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:03,974
the biggest issue our club is facing

614
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,214
is that we have reached

615
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:05,974
the maximum number of members allowed.

616
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:07,934
Commercial club members
and professional athletes

617
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,774
are starting to line up to apply for their slots.

618
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:11,894
Management has also received

619
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,174
plenty of complaints and suggestions.

620
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:14,014
They were complaining about

621
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,214
the difficulty of booking
a court and class.

622
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:16,454
I've mentioned the issue
with the coaching team

623
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:17,734
to Coach Yan as well.

624
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,094
We don't have enough manpower.

625
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:20,454
Our technical coaches

626
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:21,414
and fitness coaches

627
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:22,654
are fully booked.

628
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:23,854
We don't have enough coaches.

629
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:25,334
In my opinion,

630
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:26,974
we can at least hire two more

631
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:29,254
technical and fitness coaches.

632
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,894
We need to relieve their burden.

633
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,534
Even if we do hire more coaches,

634
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:36,094
we still have the same number of courts.

635
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:37,414
Give me some time.

636
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:39,174
I'll see if there are
any suitable facilities.

637
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,134
Actually,

638
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:41,894
I told some workers
to survey our facility

639
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,654
and check our courts

640
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:45,614
to see if it's possible to
construct additional courts.

641
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:47,254
Alright.

642
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,494
Anyway, we need to make it quick.

643
00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:52,254
Once Sanchuan starts competing again,

644
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:53,974
our club will be popular again.

645
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,214
Many people have their eyes
on our club, you know?

646
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:58,134
Coach Yan.

647
00:30:58,814 --> 00:31:00,694
I know. The wild card tournament
is coming up.

648
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:01,854
But you shouldn't

649
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:03,094
give Sanchuan too much pressure.

650
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:03,814
That's right.

651
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,694
Am I giving him pressure?

652
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:08,774
I'm just trying to state the fact here.

653
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:10,334
Do you know how many people
came here for him

654
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,854
just because he won one competition?

655
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:13,934
Do you know how many parents

656
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:16,054
take him as a role model for their children?

657
00:31:16,134 --> 00:31:17,894
What if he loses then?

658
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:19,694
There are no what-ifs.

659
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:21,854
I'll be disappointed if he loses.

660
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:25,654
You'll be disappointed too.

661
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:31,214
- He mustn't lose.
- He mustn't lose.

662
00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:32,334
Yeah, he can't afford to lose.

663
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,334
But our priority is to increase

664
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,934
the number of courts first.

665
00:31:36,774 --> 00:31:37,574
By the way, You'an...

666
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,374
Sorry for the interruption.

667
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:46,254
I'm here to look for Zhang Yan.

668
00:31:57,094 --> 00:31:57,534
What's the matter?

669
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:58,974
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

670
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:00,894
I broke up with my boyfriend.

671
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:04,654
The one you saw last time.

672
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:06,214
You said he was a nice guy.

673
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:07,614
I trusted you.

674
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:17,974
I called the police on him
and got my injuries examined.

675
00:32:18,614 --> 00:32:19,574
I packed my bags

676
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:21,214
and flew here to find you immediately.

677
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:23,294
You did the right thing.

678
00:32:23,294 --> 00:32:24,494
You should call the police.

679
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:25,334
That's the right thing to do.

680
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,574
Why are you looking for me then?

681
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,934
He wasn't willing to break up with me.

682
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:31,054
He even took
my identification card away.

683
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,294
He bought a car and parked it
under my unit.

684
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:35,054
He said he bought it to compensate me.

685
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,854
It was terrifying.

686
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:43,534
It's all your fault.

687
00:32:43,654 --> 00:32:45,174
He wouldn't have had the chance
to threaten me like this

688
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,214
if it weren't for your lousy judgment.

689
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,054
Can you let me

690
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,374
live in your unit for some time?

691
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,214
I'm so scared.

692
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:07,774
Let's go.

693
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:09,094
I'll find a hotel for you first.

694
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,454
Regarding the promotion
for the coming season,

695
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,494
Liang Tao has started her shooting.

696
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:17,014
According to her,

697
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:17,894
she hopes that...

698
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:19,414
(I need to apply for leave)

699
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:20,734
(as I have some
private matters to handle.)

700
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:22,374
Yes, she told me about that beforehand.
I have no issues with it.

701
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:24,334
When are you two free then?

702
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,134
Coach Yan applied for leave. He said
he had private matters to handle.

703
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,134
Who was that woman just now?

704
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,094
That was his ex-wife.

705
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:37,174
Ex-wife?

706
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,560
(Top Smash)

707
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:46,254
The meeting ended already?

708
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:48,094
I thought I could make it in time.

709
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:51,494
This is?

710
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,574
I'm Luo Nian, Coach Yan's colleague.

711
00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:01,454
Hello, I'm Xu Lexi.

712
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:02,574
Hello.

713
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:05,774
Are you heading out on
a business trip or a journey?

714
00:34:05,774 --> 00:34:07,174
I'm here to visit my relative.

715
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:08,574
Am I right?

716
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:09,374
Don't be like that.

717
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:12,693
She's my ex-wife.

718
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:15,374
If so, I won't bother you two then.

719
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,294
Enjoy yourselves.

720
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:26,173
I don't want to live in a hotel.

721
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,733
Aren't there any vacant rooms
in your club?

722
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:30,814
I wish to stay closer to you.

723
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,814
We only have one bedroom per person.

724
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:37,414
It's all arranged.
There's no room for you.

725
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:39,814
Find one for me.

726
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,253
Let's go.

727
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:50,693
My car is ready.

728
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:56,934
Do you like her?

729
00:34:58,534 --> 00:34:59,694
That's none of your business.

730
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:00,654
Mind your own business.

731
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:02,254
Get in the car.

732
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:10,654
Chen Zhe,

733
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:12,494
according to your result
in the competition,

734
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,094
your picture will be removed soon.

735
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,494
The guy who applied for a membership

736
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:16,894
was pretty strong.

737
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:18,534
He hasn't lost in the two weeks

738
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:19,774
that he had been competing in.

739
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:21,894
I knew my picture

740
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:22,894
would be removed for sure.

741
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,094
But I'm not the one
feeling the pressure here.

742
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:28,454
To be honest, I have no idea
how it will go.

743
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:30,814
It's been five months
since I last competed.

744
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:32,854
But I will do my best.

745
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:34,774
Chen Zhe is right.

746
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,414
He can give away his spot on the wall.

747
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:39,254
After all, he's not sponsored
by the club.

748
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:42,014
However, you need to fill the spot.

749
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:46,454
So, if Chuan wins against that challenger,

750
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:48,734
will you guys put his picture
on the wall again?

751
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:50,254
It's his first competition
after making a recovery.

752
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:51,814
If Sanchuan wins,

753
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:53,654
at least that spot
will be vacant for some time.

754
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:54,934
He can still fight over it.

755
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:58,134
Chuan, you can't afford to lose.

756
00:35:58,374 --> 00:35:59,814
You have to win for our sake.

757
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:03,374
Thank you so much.

758
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,374
Don't mention it.

759
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,294
Why did they leave?

760
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,814
Mr. Cao said

761
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:12,414
we would need to suspend
the other courts temporarily

762
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,894
if we wish to expand our facilities.

763
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:16,254
It doesn't solve our issue.

764
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:18,054
I'll think of something else.

765
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:19,854
Indeed.

766
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,894
All these tennis players look new to me.

767
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,094
Our facility is running out of space.

768
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:26,334
Say, is our club popular now?

769
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:27,814
Of course.

770
00:36:28,374 --> 00:36:28,854
Did you forget about

771
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,054
who our manager was?

772
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:32,494
Go and practice later.

773
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:33,454
Mingyu and I

774
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:34,894
will organize the players' profiles.

775
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,094
Okay.

776
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:37,934
You're competing tomorrow.

777
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:39,534
Don't be too nervous.

778
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:41,094
I'll spectate you.

779
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:45,054
Relax.

780
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,334
It's not my first time competing.

781
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:53,414
I won't be nervous when you're not.

782
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:54,334
Okay?

783
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:57,974
See you tomorrow then.

784
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:58,814
See you tomorrow.

785
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:08,014
Go now.

786
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:09,534
Don't drive too fast, okay?

787
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:32,014
Dad,

788
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:34,134
you don't need to do this.

789
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,054
I don't need alcohol
to boost my courage.

790
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:38,014
You don't need to wait for me

791
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,374
to tell you the truth
after getting drunk.

792
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,614
Ask me anything you like.

793
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,534
I'll tell you the truth.

794
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:49,814
Who do you want to marry?

795
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,254
Liang Tao, Liang You'an's sister.

796
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:53,694
Who?

797
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,054
Liang You'an is involved?

798
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:57,494
It's not that big of a deal.

799
00:37:57,654 --> 00:37:59,534
My girlfriend is working
as the director of publicity

800
00:38:00,054 --> 00:38:01,254
in our club.

801
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,694
That tiny club of yours

802
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:06,694
actually has a director of publicity?

803
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:08,574
You guys must be here
to make people laugh.

804
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:12,294
How long have you dated her?

805
00:38:12,294 --> 00:38:13,174
We'd known each other for over a year.

806
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:14,374
We dated each other
for more than four months.

807
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:16,134
We have the same interests
and we complement each other.

808
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:17,654
Most importantly,

809
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,334
we're jovial
when we spend time together.

810
00:38:22,454 --> 00:38:23,494
Does your mother know about this?

811
00:38:23,974 --> 00:38:24,734
Not yet.

812
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:26,934
You bumped into me by accident today.

813
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:29,094
It's good to tell you about this first.

814
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:31,534
How much do you plan

815
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:33,014
to fork out for my wedding?

816
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,214
You want money, huh?

817
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:38,134
Fine.

818
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:40,454
You hit the nail on the head this time.

819
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,494
I want to ask you something.

820
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,774
Do you have a stable income

821
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:46,454
or a stable job?

822
00:38:47,214 --> 00:38:48,534
You're paying for your engagement ring

823
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:50,054
with my credit card.

824
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:51,214
No decent girls

825
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:52,134
would marry someone like you.

826
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:53,494
By the way,

827
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:56,654
that Liang Tao you mentioned,

828
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:58,454
was she the influencer we talked before?

829
00:38:59,014 --> 00:39:00,294
What are you trying to say here?

830
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:03,014
Jiang Jiaojiao,

831
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:05,694
I don't care who you'll marry

832
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:06,974
in the future.

833
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:08,414
But now, you're telling me

834
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:09,934
you want to get married

835
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:11,054
when you're only 22?

836
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:12,254
I don't agree with it.

837
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:14,294
Do you know what's a marriage?

838
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:16,014
What gives the right to get married?

839
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:17,854
What else do you have

840
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:18,614
besides the age requirement?

841
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:19,494
I have love.

842
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:30,774
Slow down.

843
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:31,814
Your steps are shaky.

844
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:42,494
You're here.

845
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:45,094
I have good news for you.

846
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,974
Your son is getting married.

847
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:51,014
You're going to be a mother-in-law soon.

848
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:53,334
Congratulations, Chen Ke.

849
00:39:54,774 --> 00:39:56,214
What do you mean by that?

850
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:57,414
What are you two up to?

851
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:58,214
Mom,

852
00:39:58,454 --> 00:39:59,774
I'm not messing around.

853
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,214
Liang Tao and I

854
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:04,094
truly love each other.

855
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:05,814
Truly love each other, huh?

856
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,214
That Liang Tao you mentioned,

857
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:10,334
did you think I never

858
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,254
watched her videos before?

859
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:13,774
The live streams she did were utter trash.

860
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:15,854
She just wants your money.

861
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:17,614
She wants my money.

862
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:18,254
Understood?

863
00:40:18,254 --> 00:40:20,654
You should stop misleading mom.

864
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,134
She took the wrong career path before.

865
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:23,614
Now, it's different.

866
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:25,974
She's not a moneygrubber.

867
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:27,654
That's why I hate talking to you.

868
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:29,694
Mom,

869
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:33,334
you don't need to buy me
a car or a house.

870
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:36,454
After I get married,
we'll rent a unit together.

871
00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:38,094
I just want

872
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,134
you two to sponsor me

873
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:42,774
so that I can hold a lavish wedding.

874
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:44,734
Did you see that?

875
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,774
Your baby son

876
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:48,254
is only 22.

877
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:50,774
He's still a child,

878
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:52,414
but he wants to get married now.

879
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:54,814
You got married when you were 22 too.

880
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,534
You had him when you were 24.

881
00:40:57,894 --> 00:40:58,894
Wait.

882
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,734
How could we be the same as him?

883
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:03,814
We were coursemates

884
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:05,574
for four years in college.

885
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,494
And, we were each other's first love.

886
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,214
Many people said that we were
a perfect match

887
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:11,134
for each other.

888
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,294
How could you put me
on the same level as him?

889
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:14,134
But you still got divorced too, right?

890
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:15,894
That's why this isn't

891
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:16,974
a major factor in marriage.

892
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:22,414
What's your stand then?

893
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,294
Do you agree with him?

894
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,254
I don't disagree.

895
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:28,974
He's over 18.

896
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:30,294
He's an adult now.

897
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:32,294
And, he came back today to tell you

898
00:41:32,294 --> 00:41:33,574
which lady he liked

899
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,774
and wanted to marry.

900
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:36,414
That means he wants to
take up responsibility.

901
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:37,094
That's right.

902
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,374
What if he comes back

903
00:41:38,654 --> 00:41:40,014
and tells him to clean up his mess

904
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:41,814
after he gets someone pregnant?

905
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:43,014
Which one do you think is better?

906
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,294
Wait, Chen Ke.

907
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:45,694
You're being so unrestrained

908
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:47,414
after divorcing me, huh?

909
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:51,534
That lady you mentioned,

910
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:53,174
is she working in your club?

911
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:56,574
Mom, did you see her before?

912
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,534
I have an impression of her.

913
00:41:57,774 --> 00:41:59,094
She was quite beautiful.

914
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:00,854
She's very beautiful.

915
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,654
Mainly, I think she's pretty good

916
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:04,894
at doing things.

917
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:06,334
I can sense that she's witty.

918
00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:08,814
Is she wittier than me?

919
00:42:08,814 --> 00:42:10,254
She's much wittier than you.

920
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:11,694
I can't rest at ease

921
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:12,374
if you find someone denser than you.

922
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:13,214
What do you mean by that?

923
00:42:13,374 --> 00:42:15,854
I brought you here to convince him.

924
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:17,734
You can't just

925
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,574
allow your son to ruin his future

926
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,974
just because you're unhappy with me!

927
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,054
Jiang Jie,

928
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:25,534
I suggest you stop drinking

929
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:26,974
and get a cup of tea tomorrow morning.

930
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:28,054
You should figure it out by now.

931
00:42:28,054 --> 00:42:28,934
You should sober up.

932
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:30,494
You should know this from the day

933
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:31,534
you had a child.

934
00:42:31,694 --> 00:42:32,934
One day, he'll tell you

935
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:34,494
that he's getting married

936
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:35,934
and that he'll live by himself.

937
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,854
Regarding the kind of girl he finds,

938
00:42:39,574 --> 00:42:40,654
the occupation she has,

939
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:43,334
her looks and age,

940
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:44,934
those are none of your business.

941
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:47,294
First, you cannot replace him.

942
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,214
Second, you can't disagree with him.

943
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:51,134
You can choose to disagree with him.

944
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:52,694
If so, you have to be prepared

945
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:53,814
that you might lose him for good.

946
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:55,214
You might lose me.

947
00:42:55,654 --> 00:42:57,894
You and your nonsensical words.

948
00:42:57,894 --> 00:42:59,014
What did you say?

949
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:00,294
You spouted a lot of nonsense.

950
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:01,894
Anyway, I didn't understand
what you were getting.

951
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,454
I'll tell you something.

952
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:05,054
I will never agree to this.

953
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:07,094
He wants to get married?

954
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:07,814
No way in hell.

955
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:15,734
