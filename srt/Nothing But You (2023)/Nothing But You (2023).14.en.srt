00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:21,993
You can do this.

00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,073
You got this.

8
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:25,713
You got this.

00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:26,713
Go!

10
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:27,433
Go!

11
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:28,433
- Go!
- Go!

12
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:29,113
Come on!

13
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:45,393
Good shot.

14
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:49,913
Bravo!

15
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,353
Nice.

16
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:07,073
Come on!

17
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:07,633
Nice shot.

18
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:39,513
- Well done!
-Well done!

19
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:52,713
Who else hasn't played?

20
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:00,633
Why?

21
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,153
Do you think you can?

22
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:07,153
No, I can't.

23
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:08,873
Good.

24
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,073
Glad that you know this.

25
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:14,193
Getting players who are above us

26
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:14,993
and beat us

27
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:16,392
wouldn't prove

28
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,753
that you're a qualified coach.

29
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:20,193
Their strength doesn't represent yours.

30
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:27,953
Let's have a round.

31
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,553
Come on. Bring it on.

32
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,060
- Well done!
- Well done!

33
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:22,273
Are you convinced now?

34
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,193
Do you want one more service?

35
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:44,353
After half a month of observation,

36
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:47,073
Jiang Jiaojiao has a technical advantage

37
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,473
in forehand topspin in an open stance.

38
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:51,273
However, your footwork appears inept

39
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,873
and lacks precision during a stalemate.

40
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:55,553
Also, serve and toss are inconsistent

41
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:56,473
and ball placement is inaccurate.

42
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:57,753
I will rate you 4.5,

43
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:59,433
including a friendly bonus.

44
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:03,073
Dai Yi's technical advantage

45
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,273
is baseline strategies
during a stalemate.

46
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,513
But your backhand is
an imitation of Xin Na's.

47
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,153
You don't have your own style.

48
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:10,953
The pace of hitting and
the order of exerting force

49
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,313
are just bad.

50
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:16,193
4.0 is the highest rate you can get.

51
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:17,913
Chen Zhe.

52
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:22,753
Forget it.

53
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:26,313
I can't find

54
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:28,553
any 5.0-rated players

55
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:29,953
from the entire club.

56
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:32,673
With such dodgy skills, do you think
you can play as a professional?

57
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:43,513
So, do you think

58
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,353
I'm qualified to coach you?

59
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,393
I will set a small goal for you.

60
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,073
Two months from now,

61
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:55,673
whoever can return my serve

62
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,433
during the intra-team evaluation

63
00:06:58,073 --> 00:06:59,873
will become the captain.

64
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,793
Brave enough to take up this challenge?

65
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:05,953
Yes.

66
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:08,993
- Bring it on.
- Bring it on.

67
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:10,433
Coach Zhang.

68
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,673
May I ask

69
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:13,753
if the intra-team evaluation

70
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:15,633
includes me?

71
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,913
You've put all your effort

72
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:20,313
into dirty tricks,

73
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:25,193
the coaching team won't teach you.

74
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:26,993
Dismiss.

75
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:35,553
Coach Zhang.

76
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:37,153
- Coach Zhang.
- Couch Zhang.

77
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:38,993
I don't get you.

78
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:41,033
What did you mean?

79
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,793
I've been wondering

80
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,753
why a badminton player like you

81
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,393
switches to a tennis club.

82
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:50,273
Finally, I figured it out.

83
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:51,753
It turns out

84
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:53,433
you're seeing someone
while getting paid here.

85
00:07:58,313 --> 00:07:59,193
Coach Zhang.

86
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,113
It's fine if you have a problem with me.

87
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,473
But you can't simply slander me.

88
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,753
We're just

89
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,593
a player and a manager

90
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:07,713
and that's all.

91
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,753
I slander you?

92
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,273
You've done something

93
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:15,753
that disgusted me, do you know that?

94
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,433
Do you have the nerve to tell me

95
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,473
that you take tennis sport

96
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:19,713
and the club seriously?

97
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,593
He said he couldn't play.

98
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,313
Why would you insist

99
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,113
on a player who can't play

100
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,153
to stay?

101
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,433
Serve as a mascot?

102
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,953
Ever since Song Sanchuan

103
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,032
joined the club,

104
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,313
he has been carving out time to train

105
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,593
whenever he has finished

106
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,273
his own task.

107
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,513
He's the most hardworking player

108
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,393
on the court.

109
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:41,273
His professional qualities

110
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:42,713
have helped

111
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,513
lift the spirit of the team

112
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:45,833
and everyone witnesses that.

113
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:46,633
Yes,

114
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,153
you can say that I'm not professional

115
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,553
and I'm an amateur. I admit that.

116
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:51,473
But you can't

117
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:52,753
use Song Sanchuan as an excuse

118
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:54,073
to cook up rumors.

119
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:00,033
Forget it.
I couldn't care less about you.

120
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:02,353
I will take my pay

121
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:03,273
and you can stick to your toy boy.

122
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:04,553
Do whatever you want,

123
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:06,153
as long as you don't appear before me.

124
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:10,593
It's fine.

125
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:12,393
Forget it.

126
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:14,913
How could he say that?

127
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,193
Don't waste your breath on him.

128
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:18,793
It's meaningless.

129
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,953
Believe me.

130
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,673
I will shut his mouth.

Jiang Jiaojiao.

135
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:39,193
Your power chain isn't right.

136
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,593
Recall the force exerting order.

137
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:41,553
Come again.

138
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:46,673
Stop.

139
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:49,193
Come here.

140
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:50,793
Who taught you that?

141
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:52,193
This is the most basic one.

142
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,073
Come on, get in your stance.

143
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,673
Load up on your leg.

144
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:55,193
Go.

Connect linear force
with angular force.

151
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:03,993
The ball went out.

152
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,073
Are you playing golf?

153
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:06,033
Once again.

154
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:07,393
Do it yourself.

155
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,233
Get in your stance.

00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:13,233
Load up on your leg. Create racket lag.

157
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:14,993
Connect linear force to angular force.

158
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:16,193
Turn with your hip.

159
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:17,553
Pronate your wrist inwardly, and go.

Go over there.

Load up on the leg.

00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,153
Turn with the hip.

Connect linear force to angular force.

175
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,033
Connect linear force to angular force?

176
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:14,593
What's that?

177
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,593
What does that mean?

178
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:23,353
To connect linear force
with angular force,

179
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,713
you need

180
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,993
to turn with your hip

181
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,153
and load up on your leg

182
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,353
to concentrate all the force

183
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:30,513
in the arm.

184
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:32,473

00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:37,553
I was going to leave.

188
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:38,993
But seeing you

189
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:39,953
practicing so hard,

190
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:41,313
I'm so impressed,

191
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,433
hence, I decide to continue to work.

194
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,873
announcing that Zhang Yan

195
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,273
has joined the club as a coach.

196
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,593
In Shenzhen, there are

197
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,993
many players who eager to train with him

198
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:52,713
including children.

199
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:54,553
In just a few days,
we have already gained

200
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:55,713
32 new commercial members.

201
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,353
I'm adjusting the training schedule.

202
00:14:57,873 --> 00:14:58,713
Pretty good.

203
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:00,193
With a skilled and famous coach

204
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:01,633
like Zhang Yan here,

205
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,313
I can see it leads to a good outcome

206
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,753
in terms of revenue

207
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:06,273
and performance results.

208
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,353
Rightfully so.

209
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,833
I want him to earn back
the extra coaching fee

210
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,433
I've spent on him.

211
00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:13,553
You know what,

212
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:14,713
when I was training just now,

213
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,233
I could hear the sound

214
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,073
of your mind going "ka-ching"
from there.

215
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,393
That was loud.

216
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:26,393
I thought

217
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,113
you would disapprove of him

218
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,193
after you return this time.

219
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:34,433
To shut him up,

220
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:35,713
there's only one way.

221
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:38,233
I must become a successful
badminton-turned-tennis athlete.

222
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,033
Only this can prove

223
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,393
that you made the right choice
by recruiting me.

224
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:43,713
As for other methods,

225
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,353
they are just senseless.

226
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:49,073
Still, you can't

227
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,313
strain yourself too hard.

228
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,433
You've spent

229
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:52,393
12 hours

230
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:53,913
training on the court.

231
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,993
It's fine. I'm all good.

232
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:00,873
I promised to word hard to be your strength,

233
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,473
I can't afford to slack off.

234
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:39,673
Tao, come here.

235
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:40,793
Do you ask for me, Ms. Kiki?

236
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:42,113
You're on sparking form lately.

237
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:42,953
The amount of followers

238
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,233
has surged to 18 thousand immensely.

239
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,433
You're really good
at choosing the venue.

240
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,393
(Live-stream Statistical Analysis)
This western restaurant

241
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:48,553
and the yoga studio are great choices.

242
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:49,673
You're well aware
that with high investment

243
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,073
comes high return.

244
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:52,273
Besides, you're so witty

245
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:52,753
that

246
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,313
you've found a partner for yourself.

247
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,433
Do you realize that?

248
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:56,993
Whenever you collaborate

249
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:58,033
with ILovePeaches,

250
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,993
the views are always

251
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:00,873
better than other videos.

252
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:01,913
Do you know what it means?

253
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:03,193
It shows that users enjoy watching

the interaction between you.

255
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:05,393
Also, they can relate to you

256
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,033
when they see you fighting
and throwing tantrums

257
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,393
at your boyfriend.

258
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:10,913
Is he really your boyfriend?

259
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,673
Can you manage
to continue this interaction?

260
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,713
To be honest...

261
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:16,753
Well...

262
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,112
All right, I get you.

263
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,072
Whether or not he's your boyfriend

264
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,273
doesn't really matter.

265
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,513
As long as

266
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:24,553
he's your boyfriend

267
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:25,352
in front of the audience.

268
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:26,233
Tell me

269
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:27,033
which company is he from?

270
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:28,072
I'll reach out to them.

271
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:29,353
I suggest both of you

272
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:30,433
to make a "couple"

273
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:31,353
for the live-stream content.

274
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:33,153
Wait, must it be him?

275
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:33,913
Well,

276
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:34,633
the thing is

277
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:35,633
he's not a professional online streamer.

278
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,073
Hence, he may not have much time

279
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:39,153
to work with me.

280
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:41,233
Tao.

281
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,353
There're millions

282
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:44,593
of off-brand online streamers like you.

283
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,793
What kind of people do you think

284
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,313
can stand out amongst all?

285
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:49,953
That'll be those

286
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,433
to seize the right opportunity

287
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:52,513
and show whatever contents

288
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:53,313
that audience

289
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:55,153
like to watch.

290
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,273
However, audience preference

291
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:57,393
can't be decided by you

292
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:58,713
or me,

293
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:00,513
but by the click statistic.

294
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:01,873
Therefore, I don't wish you

295
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:02,833
to miss out on this opportunity.

296
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,633
Do you get me?

297
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:07,033
I get you, Ms. Kiki.

298
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:09,353
I will try to talk to him.

I will take him down a peg
two months later.

Why are you here?

I just drop by here.

Thank you.

311
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,673
As for what has happened before,

312
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,713
I admit

313
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:52,873
that I was out of line.

314
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:55,673
But you don't have

315
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:57,993
to come to the club.

316
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:58,953
Many people are here.

317
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:00,433
You're making me embarrassed.

318
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:03,073
You looked so much more decent

319
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:04,113
when you were playing just now.

320
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,193
Yet you're annoying when you speak.

321
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,553
I don't have much leisure time like you.

322
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:09,993
I came here to ask you for a favor,

323
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,353
not trouble.

324
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,233
To my surprise,

325
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:19,793
you're a professional player.

326
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,593
Can you really play tennis?

327
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,073
Don't take me lightly.

328
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:25,193
That's rude.

329
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,193
Just now, the height of the ball reached

330
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,513
during the return of the lob

331
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:30,313
at the baseline

332
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:31,673
needs years of effort

333
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:32,513
to achieve.

334
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:35,113
When I saw you

335
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,033
playing immensely down there,

336
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:37,593
I was quite surprised.

337
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:42,033
Also, I'm not the toff

338
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:43,633
as you said.

339
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:46,513
Since I was a kid,

340
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,393
I really enjoy

341
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:50,273
looking at the ball

342
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,313
being hit,

343
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,633
falling on the ground and then bouncing

344
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:56,873
and being hit again.

345
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,753
I feel a sense of stability

346
00:20:58,793 --> 00:20:59,913
living life like this.

347
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:04,913
But look at you.

348
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,873
You keep updating new content

349
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,593
and go everywhere

350
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,353
to shoot a video or live stream,

351
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:11,953
all you seek

352
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,393
is the clicks and followers.

353
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:14,273
Does it worth it?

354
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,793
What's the problem with the clicks?

355
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:16,993
It signifies

356
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:17,713
that you're seen

357
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,273
and heard.

358
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:20,633
You're not alone

359
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,553
and you live by your own skill.

360
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,193
Don't make it sound
like a difficult thing.

361
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:26,793
Of course,

362
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:28,393
it's worth

363
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:29,953
as you can gain fortune and game

364
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,153
if you do well.

365
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:34,593
Besides,

366
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,633
the most ironic thing is

367
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:37,833
the statistic shows
a significantly positive result

368
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,673
when you appear in my live stream.

369
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:41,033

370
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:42,033
to approach you

00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:43,033
to team up as a "couple"

372
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,193
for the live stream.

373
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,153
She has a wild idea.

374
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,193
As you can see,

375
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:49,753
I'm

376
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:51,273
a professional tennis athlete.

377
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:52,393
This is

378
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:53,673
a real job

379
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:55,953
and I have no time for the live stream.

380
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:58,313
Don't worry, I won't insist.

381
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,313
Focus on your sport.

382
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:01,713
This is the only place

383
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,713
you appear pleasantly.

384
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:10,793
Obtaining your recognization

385
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:12,353
is my great pleasure.

386
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:19,993
Well.

387
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:23,113
Can your live stream carry on

388
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:23,993
without me?

389
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,353
Don't worry.

390
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:27,393
The earth keeps on rotating
even with anyone absent.

Liang You'an.

393
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:34,753
I dropped by here

394
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:36,593
and checked your work.

395
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,153
Not bad. Keep up the good work.

396
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:38,993
I'm leaving.

397
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,913
I've done my best.

398
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:44,833
ILovePeaches doesn't agree with that

399
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:46,153
no matter how hard I tried to persuade.

400
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,273
I think

401
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:49,513
I would give up on the "couple" thing.

402
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:50,553
Even though

403
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:51,953
we value good statistics and clicks,

404
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,833
we shouldn't get held up

405
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:53,873
by a man.

406
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,433
Am I right?

407
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:01,393
We shouldn't be held up by a man.

408
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:05,833
I got it.

409
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:07,513
This idea is just amazing.

410
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:09,433
A cold city woman

411
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:11,193
who's indifferent to all men.

412
00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:13,073
Of course, we're not going to be held up

413
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:14,113
by a mere guy.

414
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,193
We can...

415
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:16,873
I mean,

416
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,073
one man may

417
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:19,073
be a stumbling block for you,

418
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:20,473
but two men

419
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:21,713
can be your stepping stones.

420
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,353
I don't get you, Ms. Kiki.

421
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:28,753
Do you want me to approach someone else?

422
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:29,393
No need.

423
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:30,673
We're going to highlight

424
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,353
your character

425
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:33,033
with a girlfriend's vibe.

426
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,113
I have a perfect choice

427
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:37,273
who's bright, athletic, and gorgeous.

428
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,473
All-rounder.

429
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:39,873
Your next video

430
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:40,633
will be announcing your breakup.

431
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:41,873
I will get you a guy

432
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,433
to try out all kinds

433
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,473
of "couple" plot.

434
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,593
Tao, Su Ke.

435
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:48,673
Come here.

436
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:53,793
Look at this.

437
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,033
Both of you

438
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,233
look compatible.

439
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:58,233
A witty and sweet gal

440
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,113
and a bright and athletic guy.

441
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:01,753
Just trust my taste.

442
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,393
You will definitely

443
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:04,713
make a viral "couple".

00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:07,313
This photo is nice.

445

446
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:09,313
keep this.

447
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:10,353
Tao.

448
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:11,593
When there's a suitable time,

449
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:12,473
upload the lovely pictures

450
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:13,433
of you and Su Ke.

451
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,433
Then, you can start the plot

452
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:16,873

453
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,113

458
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:23,513
Good.

459
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:24,833
Go ahead. Continue the photo shooting.

460
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:28,073
You can order first.

461
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:28,833
I need to go to the washroom.

462
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,433

The guy is dashing. They make a good couple!)

465
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,153
Handsome, my foot.

466
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:03,873

469
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:22,113
to make a living?

470
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:25,353
What are you looking at?

471
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:26,913
Nothing.

472
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:27,913
Come on, let's eat.

473
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:29,193
Go back for training after this.

474
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:31,073
Have you ordered?

475
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:34,713
You will do it.

476
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:39,633

Don't waste your effort.

479
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:08,473
I will handle this.

480
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:11,713
Later, Zhang Yan

481
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:12,833
has a serve drill at the outer court.

482
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,153
It's a rare opportunity.

483
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,753
It's better to finish this earlier.

What are you doing?

495
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:13,113
I have to pick out the damaged balls.

496
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:14,433
Leave it.

497
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:16,393

All right, I'll get going.

501
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,193
We've finished on the first serve.

502
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,233
Let's proceed to the second serve.

503
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:34,713
Why do we have to stand forward

504
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,513
when receiving the second serve?

505
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:37,713
In terms of speed,

506
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:38,713
the second serve

507
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:39,433
is relatively slow

508
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:40,953
and the angle isn't tricky.

509
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,273
Therefore, you must take the initiative
to attack

510
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:43,153
to build advantage.

511
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:45,633
The best attack isn't about

512
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:47,593
how fast or heavy the ball is,

513
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:48,833
but rather compressing

514
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,593
your opponent's time.

515
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,393
How?

516
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:52,513
It's simple.

517
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,313
Move forward to hit.

518
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,713
Come, Yu Zhiyuan. Serve the ball.

519
00:27:56,793 --> 00:27:57,833
Jiang Jiaojiao, take it.

520
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:01,713
Move forward to hit.

521
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:08,753
Good.

522
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:10,513
Let me show you this again.

523
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:01,753
(Thank you.)

524
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,913
Over the past time,

525
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:09,073
I put my focus

526
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:09,833
on the professional club.

527
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:11,033
Because I believe

528
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:12,553
players and coaches

529
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:13,753
are the most important asset

530
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,993
to a club.

531
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,153
After Coach Zhang Yan joined us,

532
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,713
our professional players

533
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:20,273
are getting up to the mark.

534
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:21,993
Moreover, the club welcomed
the first batch

535
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,473
of members who came
because of Coach Zhang.

536
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:25,473
In fact, most domestic clubs

537
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:26,913
rely on

538
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:28,313
word-of-mouth promotions.

539
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,953
If these members
have a good experience here,

540
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:30,713
they will recommend it

541
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:31,913
to their friends.

542
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,553
So, I believe this should be

543
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,233
the fastest way to see results
in the short term.

544
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:39,153
This is how a professional club
leads to its commercial success.

545
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:39,793
Right.

546
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,153
As for the long-term plan,

547
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:43,833
I have an idea.

548
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,153
Our commercial members

549
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:46,353
are categorized

550
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:47,553
into the group and individual lessons.

551
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,633
Concerning individual lessons,

552
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:49,233
I want like to make some adjustments

553
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:50,313
on the membership policy,

554
00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:52,193
including the category
of stored-value cards,

555
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:52,873
session duration

556
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:54,513
and amateur competitions.

557
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,593
Speaking of group lessons,
I have set several goals for it.

558
00:29:57,113 --> 00:29:58,633
I'm fortunate

559
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,593
to learn

560
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,713
some sales techniques
from you previously.

561
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,073
Hence, I'm planning to give it a shot.

562
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,233
Your presentation is straight
to the point and well-structured.

563
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:06,033
Proceed.

564
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,193
Thank you, Mr. Jie.

566
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:31,553
Don't bother me.

567
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:32,873
I'm busy.

568
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,233
How come you've been leaving early

569
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,753
and coming back late these days?

570
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:44,993
I haven't seen you around.

571
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:46,473
I went for training.

572
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,620
(Zhang Yan's Service)

573
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,633
Don't strain yourself.

574
00:30:57,473 --> 00:30:58,673
Your limbs,

575
00:30:58,713 --> 00:30:59,673
hip, and waist

576
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:00,873
are injured all over.

577
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:02,353
Taking extra practice

578
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,633
and exhausting your career

579
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:05,033
is the dumbest thing to do.

580
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:06,233
Can I have my sports career

581
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,713
if I don't exhaust myself?

582
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:12,393
I fear that you will cripple yourself.

583
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:14,193
Put that out of your mind.

584
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:15,833
I know what I'm doing.

585
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,260
(Pain Reliever)

586
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:04,633
Did you seek potential clients

587
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:05,513
at the bank today again?

588
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:09,073
I will go with you

589
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:09,913
tomorrow.

590
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:12,593
It's too tiring.

591
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:13,753
No need.

592
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:15,993
All of them complained

593
00:32:16,553 --> 00:32:18,553
that you've been
practicing too hard recently.

594
00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:21,313
So, I bring you some treats.

595
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:25,153
Where did you get

596
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,313
such luxurious food?

597
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,033
Someone you know.

598
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,193
Luo Nian made this.

599
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:31,553
It's Luo Le's mother.

600
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:32,753
She's a nutritionist

601
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:33,713
and my best friend.

602
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:35,153
She said that athletes who train hard

603
00:32:35,273 --> 00:32:35,993
should consume

604
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:37,153
more high-quality protein.

605
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:43,953
Smells so good.

606
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:58,753
What has happened to your hand?

607
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:02,153
It's raw from practicing too much.

608
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:03,513
Let me check.

609
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:18,153
Song Sanchuan, please

610
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:21,913
don't overexert yourself.

611
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:27,273
No matter what others say,

612
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:29,033
I always believe

613
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,433
you're the treasure I found.

614
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:33,233
But how are you going to play

615
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:34,593
if you overexert your body

616
00:33:34,673 --> 00:33:35,553
with ultra-intense practice?

617
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:51,793
Liang You'an.

618
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,953
Thank you for inviting me
to join tennis.

619
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:02,233
You know what,

620
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,193
the days of playing tennis

621
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,873
are the easiest days I've had

622
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:11,113
in many years.

623
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:14,313
In the past, it was all about training

624
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:16,632
and no one waited for me

625
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,672
with a deluxe boxed meal.

626
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:24,712
Do you think

627
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:27,393
this is a compensation

628
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:28,593
from heavens?

629
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,033
Silly.

630
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:43,913
Stop daydreaming.

631
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:44,873
Eat.

632
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:47,192
My athletic career is ruined.

633
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:54,433
Use the spoon.

634
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,553
Do you expect me to feed you?

635
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,113
I'd love to.

636
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,713
Probably your hand isn't that painful.

637
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,193
Do you want an abalone?

638
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,273
No.

639
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,073
Eat up.

640
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:13,993
It's going to cool off.

641
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,380
(Two months later)

642
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,500
(The day of "Returning Coach Zhang's Serve")

643
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:09,393
Next one.

644
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:46,713
(His wrist pronated outwardly.)

645
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:48,233
(Judging by his habit,)

646
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:49,713
(he plays T serve.)

647
00:36:54,953 --> 00:36:55,833
(That's right.)

648
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:22,313
(Pronated inwardly. It's a wide serve.)

649
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:41,593
(Tossed the ball to the right side
of his head.)

650
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:47,873
(The target was the ad side
down the T serve.)

651
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:57,873
Is anyone up for this?

652
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:00,033
Gave up already?

653
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:01,673
Do extra training tomorrow.

654
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:05,633
Coach Zhang.

655
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,433
Can I try?

656
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:17,353
No.

657
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:18,593
You're not qualified.

658
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:20,753
Why?

659
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:21,993
Are you afraid of losing face

660
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:23,273
if I score one point?

661
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:30,953
Fine.

662
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:32,873
I will give you a chance.

663
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:35,393
Come on.

664
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:20,273
(Pronated inwardly, it's a wide serve.)

665
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:47,753
Great.

666
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:48,873
- Good.
- Good.

667
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:49,713
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

668
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:50,633
Bravo.

669
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:53,033
Love-fifteen.

670
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:40,593
We've finished on the first serve.

671
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:41,633
Let's proceed to the second serve.

672
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,033
Why do we have to stand forward

673
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:44,833
when receiving the second serve?

674
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,033
In terms of speed,

675
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,033
the second serve

676
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:47,793
is relatively slow

677
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:49,313
and the angle isn't tricky.

678
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,313
The best attack

679
00:40:50,353 --> 00:40:51,673
isn't about

680
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:53,113
how fast or heavy the ball is,

681
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:54,833
but rather compressing
your opponent's time.

682
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:56,753
How?

683
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:57,833
It's simple.

684
00:40:58,353 --> 00:40:59,593
Move forward to hit.

685
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:01,273
Move forward to hit.

686
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:22,513
What was that?

687
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:23,073
What skill was that?

688
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:24,473
Love-thirty.

689
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:24,913
Awesome.

690
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:25,833
Come on.

691
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,273
Keep up.

692
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:28,513
Once more.

693
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,073
(Tossed leftwards. It's out wide serve
on the deuce side.)

694
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:03,833
Nice shot.

695
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:05,513
Nice shot.

696
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:06,513
Well done, Sanchuan.

697
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:07,553
Love-forty.

698
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:08,553
Well-played.

699
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:20,673
Match point.

700
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:22,193
Come on.

701
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:47,633
- It's fine.
- Chuan.

702
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:48,033
Last shot.

703
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:48,793
Last shot.

704
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:49,433
It's cool, Chuan.

705
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:50,793
It's cool, this is the match point.
