=Nothing But You=

2
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,060
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,980
(- Liang You'an, Do You Like Me?
- Yes, I Do.)

4
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,030
I know.

5
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,710
Your original plan
was to give this wild card

6
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,110
to the son of Mr. Qi
from Yuanshan Property.

7
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,230
Do you know  Coach Zhang Yan

8
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,020
from our club?

9
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,390
He was Joe's private coach.

10
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,430
He knows him very well.

11
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,590
He knows this kid is extremely introverted.

12
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,110
He doesn't like playing tennis.

13
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,910
Tennis is the sport Mr. Qi chose for him

14
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,950
to expand his own social circle.

15
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,110
With his current skill level,

16
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,390
he will be done in one match

17
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,310
if he goes to the tournament.

18
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,390
Joe won't thank you for that.

19
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,150
Mr. Qi won't take pride in that outcome.

20
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,430
Your wild card might as well be a vial of poison.

21
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,870
This is a list of the best resources I can get.

22
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,070
Let Joe be interviewed by the tennis magazine.

23
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,950
Afterward,

24
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,630
if any renowned
athletes come to China,

25
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,270
I'll arrange for him
to practice with them.

26
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,590
For Mr. Qi,

27
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,190
this is more worthy of getting shown.

28
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,030
Right?

29
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,870
Liang You'an.

30
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,870
I can let you use this wild card,

31
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,710
but only on one condition.

32
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,830
Let's have a gentlemen's agreement.

33
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,230
I haven't decided on what to get,

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,550
but when I have,

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,230
you can't say no.

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,710
I can't sell it to Young Space Group.

37
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,030
I've thought this through for a while now.

38
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,470
Selling or not, it's a matter of time.

39
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,470
We can play it by the ear later on.

40
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,150
Very well.

41
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,550
You have a deal.

42
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,910
One more thing.

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,230
I need you to tell Song Sanchuan

44
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,990
to do well in the game.

45
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,390
At least don't get obliterated.

46
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,150
After all,

47
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,990
Young Space got the card, right?

48
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,730
(Top Smash)

49
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,870
Everyone's here.

50
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,190
I have good news.

51
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,990
Hold on.

52
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,230
Someone sent a photo

53
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,390
to the club's reception counter.

54
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,750
There are some hate comments online.

55
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,990
They say Top Smash's effort

56
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,430
to get a wild card for the tournament

57
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,550
is the special treatment
the manager gave

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,150
to her precious beau.

59
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,750
That's utter nonsense.

60
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,510
He gets the wild card

61
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,190
because he's ranked
number one in the club.

62
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,990
They also say

63
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,470
the internal ranking of our club is a joke,

64
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,950
that it's rigged anyway.

65
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,830
We are definitely getting slandered.

66
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,350
Did you get the wild card?

67
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,510
Yes.

68
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,310
Good.

69
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,470
I should get to practice.

70
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,170
That's utter nonsense.

71
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,630
They say

72
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,630
I let Song Sanchuan win.

73
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,430
This is outright disrespectful.

74
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,510
Alright, get over it.

75
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,670
I think Liang You'an and Sanchuan

76
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,750
are actually seeing each other.

77
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,150
They look sweet

78
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,190
in that photo.

79
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,670
But he never mentioned it.

80
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,590
If they are in love,

81
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,550
how can he not tell us?

82
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,070
How can he handle

83
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,830
the criticism...

84
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,830
Chuan.

85
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,430
So,

86
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,110
did Liang You'an get the wild card?

87
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,710
So,

88
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,390
don't believe a word from the comments

89
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,470
you see online.

90
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,470
We always train together.

91
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,670
We know you all too well.

92
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,910
Did you use skills or connections...

93
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,430
Silly me.

94
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,270
We are friends,

95
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,270
so we don't doubt you.

96
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,870
We don't believe
in your special treatment.

97
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,950
Liang You'an is too upright.

98
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,590
Okay?

99
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,870
Yeah.

100
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,710
We all know that.

101
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,990
None of that matters anymore.

102
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,270
They attacked me

103
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,070
because they think I'm bound to lose the game.

104
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,430
When I lose,

105
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,750
it proves them right,

106
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,870
that I don't deserve the wild card.

107
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,990
Nothing we say can prove otherwise.

108
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,190
You're right.

109
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,470
We should forfeit while we can.

110
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,270
They won't get the chance
to make more rumors.

111
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:45,870
Yeah.

112
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,430
I think we should forget it.

113
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,030
This game is impossible to win.

114
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,790
We are going to lose for sure.

115
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,550
For athletes like us, it's plain anguish.

116
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:54,990
Yeah.

117
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,470
We lose nothing by not going.

118
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,890
Song Sanchuan is so handsome.

119
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,790
We have a little over a month.

120
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,230
We may not lose.

121
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,510
Chuan...

122
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,630
He's so cool.

123
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,310
I once led
a team in the early days.

124
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,310
A female athlete and the male manager fell in love.

125
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,910
At first, no one knew.

126
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,950
So, there was no trouble.

127
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,190
But then, their relationship
was brought to light.

128
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,230
Then, trouble came.

129
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,670
Actually, everyone only wanted

130
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,150
to have a better training environment

131
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,230
and contests with better rewards.

132
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,030
So...

133
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,110
from the assigning of coaches,

134
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,710
contest schedules,

135
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,350
to using of the court,

136
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,550
everyone had a beef with the girl.

137
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,630
Whenever she got anything,

138
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,590
they thought it was unfair.

139
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,670
But in this regard,

140
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,510
there are pros and cons for everyone.

141
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,870
But because of her relationship,

142
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,150
the girl couldn't

143
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,030
get anything that's
remotely better than the others,

144
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,390
or there'd be quarrels.

145
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,710
She had potential.

146
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,190
But this debacle

147
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,150
got her to quit.

148
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,550
The club has had this barrier ever since.

149
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,990
Sanchuan seems like a good person.

150
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,470
He finally overcame

151
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,510
his mental struggle.

152
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,550
He should

153
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,910
aim for greater heights.

154
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,230
His career can't be ruined

155
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,070
because of gossip.

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,310
If you insist on doing things your way,

157
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,510
the club will have to

158
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,750
suffer the consequences for you.

159
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,780
If everyone questions the integrity

160
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,510
of the club's rule and its fairness,

161
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,270
good players would never join us.

162
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,230
Coach Yan.

163
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,870
I could've handled
the matter more delicately.

164
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,710
I was unprofessional.

165
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,390
I shouldn't have

166
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,430
fallen in love with him.

167
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,150
I'm his manager.

168
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,110
I'm much older than him.

169
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,470
I should take full responsibility.

170
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,830
After the wild card match,

171
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,030
if the damage to our club continues,

172
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,870
I'll find us a new manager

173
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,790
to take over my position.

174
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,190
Song Sanchuan and the club

175
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,350
have to move forward.

Are you feeling better now?

200
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,310
Much better now. Thanks, Ms. Luo.

201
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,350
Does it hurt?

202
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,470
Much better now.

203
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,510
This can't go on.

204
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,910
You must ease up

205
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,110
on the practice tomorrow.

206
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,190
At this rate,

207
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,550
you won't make it to the game.

208
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,430
I don't need rest.

209
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,790
I've never felt so great.

210
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,870
I'll tell you if it's too much.

211
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,390
It's okay. I can keep practicing.

212
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,070
You forced your body to recover

213
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,470
with distractions.

214
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,550
When your muscle and skeletal system

215
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,670
can't cover the amount of training you get,

216
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,990
you'll fall apart instantly.

217
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,350
No.

218
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,990
I won't take that risk.

219
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,070
I must talk to Coach Yan.

220
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,990
Stay in this bucket.

221
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,870
But,  Huo...

222
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,790
See you, Ms. Luo.

223
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,230
Wait...

224
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,270
Ms. Luo.

225
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,390
Could you adjust the recent menu for me?

226
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,750
I think I'm not eating enough.

227
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,390
The more I eat,

228
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,550
the faster I recover.

229
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,710
Wait here.

230
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:06,750
You...

231
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,190
You are overexcited, do you know that?

232
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,750
In this state,

233
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,790
your blood flow, nerves,

234
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,550
and other organs are being burned up.

235
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,030
Food can replenish your strength.

236
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,030
But I won't make anything worse for you.

237
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,750
I study sports science.

238
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,830
Science boils down to

239
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,430
respecting objective facts.

240
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,390
Are you really going to ruin your health

241
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,670
over one match?

242
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,310
I know.

243
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,630
No one is saying it out loud,

244
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,230
but everyone thinks

245
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,230
I'm certainly losing this upcoming match.

246
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,630
Am I right?

247
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,190
Ms. Luo.

248
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,870
I really need your help.

249
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,430
What's the matter?

250
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,190
You should check on Song Sanchuan.

251
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,490
(Top Smash)
He only listens to you.

252
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,430
His intense training

253
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,190
is putting his career at risk.

254
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,590
Nian.

255
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,190
I wholeheartedly understand him.

256
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,710
Everyone expects him to fail.

257
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,270
He is no match for the opponent
and had a sudden career change.

258
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,270
Winning this game

259
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,950
is the best counterattack

260
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,430
to prove everyone wrong.

261
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,270
So...

262
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,270
I don't know how to
dissuade him from training.

263
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,550
But I'm worried

264
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,990
his training intensity is too much.

265
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,110
He will collapse before he goes to the court.

266
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,350
He's not thinking straight.

267
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,870
You have to help.

268
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,870
One more.

269
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,110
Wait,

270
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,350
why did you come back?

271
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,750
The coaches want me to talk some sense into you.

272
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,150
You've been training too hard lately.

273
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,510
We're already qualified to

274
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,470
participate in this match.

275
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,950
We're getting one point anyway.

276
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,910
Consider this a lesson of experience.

277
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,150
That's more than enough.

278
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,950
I know.

279
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,230
Based on my score and skills this year,

280
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,070
I'm surely losing the official game.

281
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,150
I also know

282
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,390
what this match actually means

283
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,310
for the club.

284
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,910
I saw everything.

285
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,790
I saw how difficult it was
for you to get the wild card.

286
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,070
So, I am grateful for that.

287
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,430
Because I'm the one going to the court.

288
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,710
As an athlete,

289
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,150
my mission

290
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,870
is to win the match.

291
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,950
Before this,

292
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,070
I couldn't stand it.

293
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,910
I thought you'd always put the club

294
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,070
before me.

295
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,710
But that changed

296
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,150
when we got the photo

297
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,870
and the club was slandered.

298
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,790
Only then did I realize what you feared

299
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,310
and wanted to avoid.

300
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,310
I know now is a bad time.

301
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,470
But I have to ask again.

302
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,910
Liang You'an,

303
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,470
do you like me?

304
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,150
Yes, I do.

305
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,430
That's good enough for me.

306
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,910
You could've said so sooner.

307
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,510
You're concerned

308
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,060
that our relationship will undermine
the integrity of our club.

309
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,630
Only I can resolve that.

310
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,430
If I can win even one round,

311
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,150
none of us will need to leave.

312
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,710
None of the doubts will hold.

313
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,670
All you need to do is stand here

314
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,270
and look at me.

315
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,950
Wait for me.

316
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,310
Leave the rest to me.

317
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,550
Okay?

318
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,830
Okay.

319
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,350
So...

320
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,150
go home, take a shower, and sleep tight.

321
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,590
I'll do two more sets of workouts

322
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,510
before I head back.

323
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,510
I'll hold you to it. Just two more sets.

324
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,590
Go home when you finish.

325
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,750
Yes.

326
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,470
Promise.

327
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,670
Switch off the light
and lock the door behind you.

328
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,470
(Gu Han TCM Clinic)

329
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,470
(You're a professional player?)

330
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,350
(Doesn't your team have a doctor?)

331
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,830
(I don't want them to know.)

332
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,310
(Is the knee injury serious?)

333
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,950
(Osteoarthritis is)

334
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,910
(common among athletes.)

335
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,430
Judging by your condition,

336
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,910
I think it's very likely

337
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,430
the cartilage is damaged.

338
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,590
I've seen many patients with a similar condition.

339
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,870
You will recover with the right treatment.

340
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,710
However,

341
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,630
you must ease up on intense training.

342
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,710
Maintain the most
basic recovery training.

343
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,590
Adequate amount of stretching.

344
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,670
If you don't stop exhausting your body,

345
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,270
things will get worse.

346
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,190
Doctor, do you have any medicine

347
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,550
for the pain?

348
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,150
Doctor, you know what?

349
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,630
I'm about to play in an awesome match.

350
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,390
Are you kidding?

351
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,190
It's likely your medial meniscus is damaged.

352
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,830
If this goes on,

353
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,550
you might have trouble running or jumping,

354
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,030
much less playing in a match.

355
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,750
It's alright.

356
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,430
It's worth it.

357
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,630
Here he comes.

358
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,350
I'll get you a bottle of water.

359
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,550
It's so hot today.

360
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,030
(Hello, beloved fans.)

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,430
(Welcome to Young Space Cup Tennis World Tour,)

362

(Shenzhen Station.)

363
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,910
That match we'll witness

364
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,470
at the Central Stadium today

365
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,750
is the first highlight match

366
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,190
of the world tour.

367
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,150
For the players, we have

368

369
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,550

(and his opponent

371
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,470

(Yes.)

374
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,390
Ito's performance this season

375
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,990
has been remarkable so far.

376
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,110
(His maneuver has more varieties.)

377
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,270
(Song Sanchuan is relatively
inexperienced in tennis.)

378
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,190
(There is a clear skill gap
between the two players.)

379
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,870
(There are some hate comments online.)

380
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,910
(They say Top Smash's effort)

381
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,230
(to get a wild card
for the tournament.)

382
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,630
(Are you really
going to ruin your health)

383
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,670
(over one match?)

384
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,150
(Intense training...)

385
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,790
(You're concerned.)

386
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,630
(Only I can resolve that.)

387
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,510
(For an athlete,)

388
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,270
(impatience can hurt.)

389
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,190
(No one is going to the match.)

390
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,350
(All you need to do is stand here.)

391
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,510
(Leave the rest to me.)

392
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,870
(Lad, hang in there.)

393
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,830
(This anesthetic shot
is going to hurt.)

394
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,510
Song Sanchuan.

395
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,990
It's time to go.

396
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,430
Chuan!

397
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,870
- Sanchuan!
- You can win it, Chuan!

398
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,910
Go for it, Chuan!

399
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,590
Teach the other guy a lesson!

400
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,230
Go for it!

401
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,950
(Both players have entered the court.)

402
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,830
(They are sitting by the side.)

403
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,270
(The match begins.)

404
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,310
(It's the coin toss.)

405
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,550
(Ito is serving first.)

406
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,790
(He scored a point.)

407
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,710
Come on!

408
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,030
Fifteen-love.

409
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,070
(Ito is serving from the left box.)

410
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,190
(Song Sanchuan countered with a backhand.)

411
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,310
(Another backhand.)

412
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,430
(Ito steps forward for a hit!)

413
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,430
(Song Sanchuan tries to save it.)

414
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,350
(He didn't get it.)

415
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,030
It's okay. Steady.

416
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,230
(As you can see,)

417
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,670
(Ito's offensive is powerful.)

418
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,830
(He scored two points already.)

419
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,230
(I wonder if Song Sanchuan)

420
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,430
(can withstand the pressure.)

421
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,350
Forty-love.

422
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,550
(Ito has a lot of experience)

423
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,390
(with different matches.)

424
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,550
He gained momentum effortlessly.

425
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,550
He did great with his serves.

426
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,510
Song Sanchuan, on the other hand,

427
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,550
(is falling behind.)

428
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,550
(He can barely catch up with Ito's pacing.)

429
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,110
(He's on the defensive side.)

430
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,210
(Song Sanchuan 1)
(Okaibara Ito 6)

431
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,590
(Ito got the match point.)

432
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,350
(He won the first round.)

433
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,670
(Judging by the looks of it,)

434
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,230
(the first round was one-sided.)

435
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,630
(I think Song Sanchuan)

436
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,070
(has trouble countering Ito's serves.)

437
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,470
But...

438
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,030
This isn't his usual play style.

439
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,430
We studied his play style for ages.

440
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,070
He's not playing by his usual standards.

441
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,870
Isn't it obvious?

442
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,390
He looks down on Sanchuan.

443
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,590
He doesn't think Sanchuan

444
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,230
is a match for him.

445
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,630
He's using him
to test his new play style.

446
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,870
Nothing we say matters.

447
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,550
Have faith in him.

448
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,670
Time.

449
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,070
(Okay, the second round begins.)

450
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,830
(It's Song Sanchuan's turn to serve.)

451
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,910
(A serve from the right box.)

452
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,430
(Ito got the ball with forehand.)

453
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,110
(Song Sanchuan moved forward)

454
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,750
(to counter it!)

455
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,950
(He scored a point!)

456
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,070
Well done!

457
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,990
Fifteen-love.

458
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,750
Out.

459
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,670
(Song Sanchuan lost the first round,)

460
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,750
(but judging by his current round,)

461
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,630
his ability to analyze and adjust

462
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,670
the match as he plays

463
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,630
is still very respectable,

464
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,630
given his past experience.

465
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,390
See?

466
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,550
He's anticipating moves.

467
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,830
He analyzed every move

468
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,310
while he was taking a break.

469
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,070
The kid sure is witty.

470
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,230
He's getting the hang of it.

471
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,990
(A beautiful intercept.)

472
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,030
(Great job!)

473
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,070
(Song Sanchuan)

474
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,550
(was bold enough to employ)

475
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,470
(the SABR developed by Federer.)

476
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,190
(It's a sneak attack
to throw his opponent)

477
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,950
(off guard.)

478
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,710
(This is Song Sanchuan's)

479
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,430
(break point during
the opponent's service game.)

480
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,550
(It's also a set point.)

481
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,030
He's successfully
broken the service game.

482
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,950
The match has entered the climax.

500
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,190
(Song Sanchuan
moved forward to intercept.)

501
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,750
(Song Sanchuan 7  Okaibara Ito 5)
(The ball landed with precision.)

502
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,950
(The angle was perfect.)

503
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,910
(Ito couldn't reach the ball in time.)

504
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,030
(As we can see,)

505
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,190
(Mr. Ito)

506
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,830
(just threw his racket on the ground.)

507
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,430
What's wrong with you?

508
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,390
Watch the attitude!

509
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,910
Go home!

510
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,630
(It seems Song Sanchuan's play style)

511
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,470
(has given Ito a lot of pressure.)

512
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,990
(He's showing signs of frustration.)

513
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,630
(Song Sanchuan)

514
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,950
(managed to calm down)

515
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,910
(after losing a round.)

516
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,070
(He won the second round.)

517
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,150
Time.

518
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,430
(This is the final round.)

519
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,990
(Well played!)

520
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,550
Out.

521
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,110
(Song Sanchuan)

522
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,750
(did a great job with the passing shot.)

523
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,510
(But the assistant referee said out.)

524
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,150
I think...

525
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,630
How is it out?

526
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,350
Mr. Song is challenging

527
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,590
the call on the right
near the side line.

528
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,470
The ball was called out.

529
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,150
(Song Sanchuan is challenging the call.)

530
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,270
(Let's watch the replay.)

531
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,590
(Yeah, the replay.)

532
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,390
(It was very close.)

533
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,670
(It hit the line. Just a little bit.)

534
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,630
It hit the line! It's in!

535
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,670
Fifteen-love.

536
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,790
(Song Sanchuan's
got the scoring overruled.)

537
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,590
(The score is now 15: 0.)

538
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,350
I told you that was in.

539
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,470
It was only a little bit off.

540
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,990
(Song Sanchuan)

541
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,790
(is gaining momentum.)

542
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,190
(Yes.)

543
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,390
(The pressure has shifted to Ito.)

544
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,750
(Yes.)

545
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,390
(Song Sanchuan figured out
the right tempo.)

546
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,150
(He's slowly gaining the upper hand.)

547
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,430
(The round is now at the match point.)

548
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,750
I can see it now.

549
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,830
Is Ito

550
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,950
using the play style

551
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,470
we studied earlier?

552
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,350
Liang You'an, that's some improvement.

553
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,150
See?

554
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,630
The kid is going to show us

555
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,350
his ultimate move.

556
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,070
(Song Sanchuan)

557
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,230
(went to the side.)

558
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,430
(He changed to a different racket.)

559
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,630
(If you want to master the smash shot,)

560
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,510
(I know a way to make it work for you.)

561
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,310
(Aren't you a badminton stringer?)

562
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,430
(The mechanism is similar.)

563
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,750
(I've studied it.)

564
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,990
(From what I know,)

565
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,830
(the tension of a normal tennis racket)

566
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,870
(is between 50 to 60 pounds.)

567
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,550
(Tighter strings)

568
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,270
(give better handling and precision.)

569
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,630
(Looser strings)

570
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,070
(give more power, speed, and spin.)

571
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,550
(This racket)

572
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,430
(has a tension of 35 pounds.)

573
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,350
(It has the maximum friction
for maximum spin.)

574
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,870
(It increases your chances
of a successful smash.)

575
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,310
(This is all I can do to help you.)

576
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,270
(Song Sanchuan)

577
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,270
(changed to a different racket)

578
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,270
(in the heat of the match.)

579
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,350
(I wonder)

580
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,670
(why he did that.)

581
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,790
(Let's look forward)

582
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,070
(to his performance with it.)

583
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,630
That's my work.

584
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,390
(Song Sanchuan)

585
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,550
(made a curved shot.)

586
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,950
(He scored a critical point.)

587
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,230
(But we also saw him)

588
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,830
(using the racket to
support his stance.)

589
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,910
(I think his knee is injured.)

590
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,550
(Yes.)

591
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,550
(Song Sanchuan)

592
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,070
(is clearly limping.)

593
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,470
(You've been too exhausted
with your training intensity.)

594
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,590
(I saw how difficult it was)

595
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,790
(for you to get the wild card.)

596
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,390
(I saw everything.)

597
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,270
My mission is to win the match.

598
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,910
It's 6:5

599
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,310
for the tiebreaker.

600
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,470
For the first time,

601
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,870
he got the match point.

602
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,870
(We can see)

603
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,110
(Song Sanchuan's injury)

604
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,990
(has a negative impact)

605
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,030
(on his hits.)

606
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,670
(Yes.)

607
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,990
(I think Ito has noticed that.)

608
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,510
(He is adjusting his play style.)

609
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,470
(He is aiming at different locations)

610
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,670
(to force Song Sanchuan)

611
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,190
(to cover more ground.)

612
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:09,790
(Yes.)

613
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,110
(If this round drags on,)

614
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,310
(Song's chances of winning dwindles.)

615
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,230
Ito is a jerk.

616
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,430
He knows Chuan's injured,

617
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,390
so he makes him run.

618
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,710
You can't say that.

619
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,590
This is a match.

620
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,910
It's perfectly normal

621
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,950
to make use of weaknesses.

622
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,670
We'll see how Chuan counters it.

623
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,950
(Ito caught up to Song's score.)

624
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,190
(It's 6:6 for)

625
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,230
(the tiebreaker round.)

626
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,070
(In other words,)

627
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,910
(for Song Sanchuan to win this match,)

628
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,990
(he must score two points.)

629
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,110
(Yes.)

630
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,310
(For one of the points,)

631
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,110
(it's the opponent's turn to serve.)

632
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,390
Yes.

633
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,630
For Song Sanchuan who is now

634
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,550
carrying an injury,

635
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,870
this is an uphill battle.

636
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,630
(Let's see how Song Sanchuan)

637
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,310
(scores the final two points.)

638
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,350
Time.

639
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,630
A smash!

640
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,670
(We were all shocked)

641
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,750
(by what we just witnessed!)

642
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,990
(After his curve shot)

643
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,230
(to counter his opponent,)

644
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,350
(he landed a shot
that spanned after it landed!)

645
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,670
(After it went over the net,)

646
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,110
(it bounced back into the net.)

647
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,830
(It caught Ito off guard.)

648
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,030
(The referee ruled this
as a legitimate point.)

649
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,150
Song Sanchuan got

650
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,630
the second match point of the round.

651
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,550
(Song Sanchuan 7)
(Okaibara Ito 6)

652
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,550
(Song Sanchuan 7  Okaibara Ito 6)
(This scoring situation)

653
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,870
(Song Sanchuan 7  Okaibara Ito 6)
(is rather uncommon)

654
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,830
(Song Sanchuan 7  Okaibara Ito 6)
(in official matches.)

655
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,990
(It also exerts a lot of pressure on Ito.)

656
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,950
Out.

It hurts, right?

686

It's alright.

687
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,790
We'll be there soon.

688
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,710
What's wrong?

689
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,750
Why are you smiling?

690
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,350

Well?

692
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,590
Did I look cool?

693
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,990
Yeah. Super cool.

694
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,310
What was that for?

695
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,870
Is it worth it to give up your leg?

696
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,670
Yes.

697
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,830
This match is worth it.

698
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,150
Doctor, are we there yet?

699
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,230
We're almost there.

700
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,430
Thanks.

701
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,150
We're almost there.
Hang in there.

702
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,430
Grab my hand if it hurts.

703
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,030
You will be alright.

(Shenzhen General Hospital)
(Liang You'an, great work.)

705
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,510
(It was worth it to get the wild card.)

706
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,310
(Simply winning)

707
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,790
(wouldn't have had the same effect.)

708
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,470
(I know it's a bad time to say this.)

709
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,950
(There are already three investors)

710
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,630
(who sent me messages of inquiries.)

711
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:11,910
Hello?

712
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,590
I know.

713
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,070
It's too late to intercept the articles.

714
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,270
I sent you a list of the media outlets.

715
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,430
Contact all of them.

716
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,470
Be humble.

717
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,270
Do not focus on his injury.

718
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,550
After four hours,

719
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,150
we defeated a foreign athlete.

720
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,870
Make sure the media

721
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,870
focus on covering this.

722
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,790
Never mind.

723
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,630
I have to leave the rest to you guys, okay?

724
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,070
I'm here to pay the bill.

725
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,710
Doctor, how is he?

726
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,630
My initial diagnosis is

727
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,790
damage to the medial meniscus.

728
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,670
There could be ligament lacerations.

729
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,070
As for the actual condition,

730
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,190
we need surgery to find out.

731
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,310
But he is...

732
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,550
against having surgery.

733
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,990
It's not that.

734
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,430
Can't we try

735
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,470
other less invasive treatments?

736
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,310
Let me finish

737
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,110
the matches this year

738
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,950
before the surgery.

739
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,990
You are in no shape

740
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,270
to play in any matches.

741
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,310
You only take aesthetic shots
and get joint aspiration.

742
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,830
Things will get worse.

743
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,750
But if we go for surgery immediately,

744
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,790
the damage can still be mended.

745
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,870
If you don't ease up on

746
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,030
your training and matches,

747
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,110
if your ligament is torn,

748
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,710
the damage is irreversible.

749
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,270
Think this through.

750
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,590
Doctor.

751
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,230
We won't take that risk.

752
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,430
We choose surgery.

753
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,230
Wait.

754
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,230
It doesn't mean

755
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,910
I can recover from the surgery.

756
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,790
No one can guarantee that.

757
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,990
But as I said,

758
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,710
we must check the damage during surgery.

759
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,350
Even if it was successful,

760
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,390
the athlete's recovery ability

761
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,470
plays a pivotal role.

762
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,950
They are professional athletes.

763
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,710
They rely on their bodily functions

764
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,870
more than people like us.

765
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,150
After he's recovered,

766
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,470
you have my word you can walk

767
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,470
with no problem.

768
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,990
But can you return to your prime?

769
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,230
That's hard to tell.

770
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,590
Dr. Huang, Mr. Li wants to see you.

771
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,230
Sure.

772
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,510
You may discuss it.

773
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,630
If you agree,

774
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,030
sign in this agreement.

775
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,270
In the operating theater,

776
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,790
I have control over nothing.

777
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,910
When he opens up my knee,

778
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,110
no matter how bad the injury is,

779
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,510
he will carry out his duty

780
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,950
and finish the surgery.

781
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,870
I might never play again.

782
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,830
Trust me. I'm serious.

783
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,230
After they treated my knee,

784
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,150
it doesn't hurt as much.

785
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,150
We don't need surgery right away.

786
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,430
Let me finish the matches this year.

787
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,190
Are you kidding?

788
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,590
You just won a wild card match.

789
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,990
You have a promising future.

790
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,630
What if my knee is lost for good?

791
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,310
If I can't even play,

792
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,790
