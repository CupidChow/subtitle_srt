00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,000
=Nothing But You=

2
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,100
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,980
(We're Already Acquaintances?)

4
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,360
18-18. It's a tie.

5
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Look.

6
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,040
This is what I meant.

7
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,440
Since two years ago,

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,120
his performance has become unstable

9
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,440
once his score reaches 18.

10
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,120
He can lose to anyone on the court.

11
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Athletes can overcome injuries

12
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,920
and improve their skills.

13
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,320
But it's difficult
to untie a knot in one's heart.

14
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,680
I've seen lots

15
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,480
of talented kids fail

16
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
because of this.

17
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,240
Two years ago

18
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
was when Jin Yi joined the team.

19
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,080
This is great.

20
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Jin Yi is the one we want.

21
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
Look at his dominance on the field.

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,720
He carries the aura of a victor.

23
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,320
Doesn't he?

24
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,920
Yes.

25
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,520
Get his information from the coach.

26
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,360
The more detailed, the better.

27
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,360
I trust your eye.

28
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,440
If you think he is a good candidate,

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
discuss a long-term contract.

30
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,280
All right.

31
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,960
Remember. Time is of the essence.

32
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,800
No problem.

33
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,040
Use mine this time.

34
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,520
Now I know

35
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
why you have band-aids

36
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,800
in your bag.

37
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
I collect balls. You collect fun.

38
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,760
You don't need to do this.

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,960
No wonder you said

40
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
you didn't work in a cubicle.

41
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,880
So playing badminton is your job.

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
I get paid for playing.

43
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,720
How is it not a job?

44
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
How many years have you been playing?

45
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
I started when I was 10, so 12 years.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
22 years old.

47
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,480
That does make you a bit old.

48
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,520
Tell me how old you are, then.

49
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
32.

50
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
You're good.

51
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,200
If you keep up your performance,

52
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
you'll definitely beat him.

53
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,480
Song Sanchuan.

54
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,120
Sorry.

55
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll let you do your job.

56
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,160
I'll leave.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,080
Down it in one.

58
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
I guarantee

59
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,360
you'll feel better.

60
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,080
(Down it in one.)

61
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
(I guarantee)

62
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
(you'll feel better.)

63
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,200
Please come again.

64
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,280
You came right
before closing time again.

65
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm about to close the shop.

66
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
I won't take long.

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,360
The new goods arrived.

68
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,600
Baby!

69
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Baby!

70
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,520
Baby!

71
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,640
Mo, where's my Corgi?

72
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
The owner returned,

73
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,800
so they brought it back with them.

74
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,720
That Corgi was good-natured and clingy.

75
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,000
I only fed it twice.

76
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,280
Hello.

77
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,760
You must be new.

78
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,720
Miss,

79
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
if you liked it so much,
why not get one yourself?

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
I can't even

81
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,200
guarantee I can feed myself

82
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,600
or where I'll be the next day.

83
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm not qualified to keep a dog.

84
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,400
Can this Shih Tzu

85
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
eat this canned food?

86
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,880
Its name is Molly.

87
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,720
It's a glutton.

88
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,920
It loves that thing you're holding up.

89
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,640
So you're Molly? Hello.

90
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,440
Don't rush.

91
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,240
Be patient. Calm down. Be good.

92
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
Easy there.

93
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,600
Here. Not too much for you.

94
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,440
You're so small.

95
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,680
This feels so healing.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,680
I can't have a dog,

97
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,560
but I can have a whole pile of them.

98
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm not losing out.

99
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
All of them

100
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
are my batteries.

101
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,720
Batteries.

102
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Mini batteries.

103
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,160
You're my mini battery.

104
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,680
Hello, I'm Liang You'an.

105
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
It's nice to meet you.

106
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,480
(That child on the other side is)

107
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
(Song Sanchuan.)

108
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
(He is)

109
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,480
(a gifted athlete.)

110
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
(Since two years ago,)

111
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,920
(his performance has become unstable)

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,080
(once his score reaches 18.)

113
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
(He can lose to anyone on the court.)

114
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
So you're basically saying

115
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,160
you want a monopoly.

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll say this now.

117
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,520
If there can only be one wig shop

118
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,880
across the cancer hospital,

119
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,280
it's going to be Ancong Wig Shop.

120
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,600
How about this?

121
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll leave you my business card.

122
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,160
If you change your mind,

123
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
you can call me at any time.

124
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,860
(Wu Lifang)

125
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,600
What does this mean?

126
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,280
Who is that?

127
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
That's the boss.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,440
Well, there's no discussion about this.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,480
Please show yourselves out.

130
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,920
I thought

131
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,760
I was the only one dumb enough
to believe that.

132
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,960
It doesn't matter to me where she is

133
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,280
or if she's coming back.

134
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
But you, on the other hand,

135
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
you're a certified stringer

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,480
for the national team.

137
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,520
What?

138
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,600
Are you going to string wigs

139
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,920
for the rest of your life?

140
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
Well, my job isn't something
to be ashamed of.

141
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
And I'm doing good deeds.

142
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,080
Let me have one…

143
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,920
Steamed dumplings.

144
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,080
Did you order this for me?

145
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
I ordered it for my son.

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,160
See?

147
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Always a son who wants to be a dad.

148
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,160
Get me some vinegar.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,040
All right.

150
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
You wanted to see me?

151
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,840
All right.

152
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Notify them according to this list.

153
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,880
All right.

154
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,200
Chuan,

155
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,360
I told you to go
to the provincial team competition

156
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,120
next month, but…

157
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,960
I know.

158
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
You changed the lineup.

159
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,760
Jin Yi told me.

160
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Don't take it to heart.

161
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,080
Actually…

162
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,920
I don't mind.

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,520
I mean it.

164
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,040
Oh, it's a lot of work

165
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,520
talking to you.

166
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,080
What do you want to hear instead?

167
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,960
There are lots of people
who know how to flatter you

168
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,640
on this team.

169
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,120
Don't put your hopes on me.

170
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,800
I saw your match

171
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
with Jin Yi yesterday.

172
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,960
You still haven't gotten over it.

173
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,680
You'll be turning 22

174
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
this year, right?

175
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,280
If you haven't made any results

176
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,480
by 22 as a professional athlete,

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,560
there isn't much hope

178
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,800
for your career anymore.

179
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,520
Your contract will be up

180
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,440
next year.

181
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,720
You know

182
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
there are only
so many spots on the team.

183
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,240
I know.

184
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,640
I know how the team elimination works.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,080
It's

186
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,800
the team round-robin tournament.

187
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,280
The one that comes out
at the bottom leaves.

188
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,560
Doesn't it feel frustrating

189
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
to barely make it every time?

190
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,040
Well, it's an achievement
to be able to make it, even if barely.

191
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,920
Don't worry.

192
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,960
If I come out last, I'll leave.

193
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I won't cling.

194
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
I'll let you know something, too, then.

195
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,320
The new kid I recruited

196
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,240
will join the team training tomorrow.

197
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,480
His skills and condition

198
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,800
are on par

199
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
with you and Jin Yi back then.

200
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
If you continue

201
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,960
to take things easy,

202
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
be prepared for the consequences.

203
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,520
I don't usually compete.

204
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
I teach the kids

205
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,880
and make some extra money.

206
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,120
You started playing
when you were around their age,

207
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,880
right?

208
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,640
Huang!

209
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
Mind the angle.

210
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,720
Okay.

211
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,320
Athletes are the ones

212
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,560
who have the most anxiety
about their age.

213
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,760
Every day,
you have younger and better athletes

214
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,360
joining the competition.

215
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
When someone enters,
someone else leaves.

216
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,120
We call this

217
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
the two hurdles of life and death.

218
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,960
I went through your file.

219
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
From the junior category competitions

220
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,120
until the team,

221
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,200
your results have been outstanding.

222
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,240
My best record
in the past two years is…

223
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,160
21 consecutive losses.

224
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,560
Only one thought crossed my mind.

225
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,800
"I suck.

226
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
Why am I still here?"

227
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,400
Did you consider leaving the court?

228
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,000
You can win if you enter the court.

229
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,760
Who wouldn't want to enter the court?

230
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,720
I lose every match,
but I still want to enter the court.

231
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,840
Maybe I'm just that determined to win.

232
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,960
What do you think about Jin Yi?

233
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,040
You've seen it yourselves.

234
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,960
I can't win against him.

235
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,840
Look at this backhand net shot.

236
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Your wrist should be like this.

237
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,280
One more time.

238
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,600
How's the scouting going?

239
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
The boss likes Jin Yi.

240
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,200
He is making me go through his file.

241
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,040
Isn't that good?

242
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,080
What's the problem?

243
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,360
Jin Yi is too good.

244
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
To me,

245
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,120
he doesn't fit the bill

246
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,160
for the typical underdog.

247
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,160
Why do you think

248
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,400
he still hasn't unleashed

249
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,640
his full potential

250
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,600
at his age?

251
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,040
He was injured.

252
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,160
He didn't have the best of luck.

253
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,800
Those are distinct reasons,

254
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,360
aren't they?

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480
My current stage of work

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,240
is pretty easy.

257
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm just helping my boss
eliminate risks.

258
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,040
Of course, I know

259
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,200
that good professional athletes come

260
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
with all sorts of problems.

261
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
So I need to ensure

262
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,040
that the issue of the person

263
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,040
my boss chose is

264
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,520
within my control.

265
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,560
I think that's a good take

266
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,600
you have there.

267
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,960
In fact, Jin Yi doesn't have

268
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,320
any deal-breaking problems.

269
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,400
He is short-tempered at most.

270
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,480
Not the easiest to get along with.

271
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
But I think that depends

272
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,200
on the person, too,

273
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,320
doesn't it?

274
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,160
Jin Yi is

275
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
the one my boss chose.

276
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,600
But the one I can't get out of my mind

277
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,800
is Song Sanchuan.

278
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,080
Hello. Excuse me.

279
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,160
Your coffee. Please enjoy.

280
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Of course, it's not him.

281
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,480
Jin Yi has excellent skills.

282
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,680
(Jin Yi's key achievements)
He has strict expectations of himself

283
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,480
during his training as well.

284
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,520
20 years old.

285
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,319
If all goes well,

286
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,200
he should be producing results
in two years.

287
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
Very good.

288
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Have you discussed a contract yet?

289
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,200
The long-term underdog contract

290
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,240
you wanted

291
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,480
is a minimum of five years.

292
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,920
I want to make it eight or even ten.

293
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,640
So we will need to take

294
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,200
not only performance

295
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,240
but also discipline,
character, and mental state

296
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,720
into consideration as well.

297
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,280
From what I've seen of Jin Yi so far,

298
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,560
I recommend extending
his observation period.

299
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,440
We don't have that much time.

300
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
So many are eyeing

301
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,840
this potential rising star.

302
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
If you don't make a move now,

303
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
someone else's going to snatch him up.

304
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
We have to move fast, got it?

305
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,720
What's wrong?

306
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,200
Do you have reservations

307
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,240
about this candidate?

308
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,360
You saw through

309
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,520
my thoughts.

310
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,800
I want to reconsider

311
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,720
Jin Yi and Song Sanchuan.

312
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,960
Did Alex

313
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,600
recommend anyone else?

314
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,920
She made it very clear

315
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,240
that it wasn't Song Sanchuan.

316
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,800
Then why are you still hesitating?

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,640
Efficiently and discreetly

318
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,880
sign Jin Yi.

319
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Didn't you mention

320
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,160
that his sponsorship with Oscom

321
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,160
is expiring?

322
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,320
Snatch him up.

323
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,600
Badminton is my first shot

324
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,360
at getting my product line

325
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,160
in order.

326
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,280
I want to make a loud debut.

327
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Okay. I'll do my best.

328
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,360
Don't worry about going to Shanghai.

329
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,200
Stay

330
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,680
and get that contract signed.

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Understood.

332
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
A penalty of three glasses.

333
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Drink three glasses.

334
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
Sorry, I'm late.

335
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
Sorry.

336
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,760
You'an. Come. Sit.

337
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
Take a seat.

338
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
Sorry.

339
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,560
Just sent my boss off on his flight.

340
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,080
Why is the boss

341
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
going to Shanghai all of a sudden?

342
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,880
I heard that the venue
of this year's supplier conference

343
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,240
has not yet been decided.

344
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,800
Last year, the North China conference

345
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,080
was held in Beijing.

346
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,720
So this year, we and North China

347
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,240
should be in Shenzhen

348
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,200
somehow.

349
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't worry, Mr. Eddie.

350
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,520
It doesn't matter

351
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,880
where the supplier conference is held.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,400
What matters is who the boss is willing

353
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
to give the best suppliers to.

354
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,480
I mean this sincerely, You'an.

355
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,840
I would love to have you join us.

356
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Once you're free,

357
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,440
the position of my head of marketing

358
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,600
is all yours.

359
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,920
The supplier conference

360
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
isn't difficult to handle.

361
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,960
When the boss asks for your opinion,

362
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,840
put in a good word for me,

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,560
all right?

364
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
Don't worry.

365
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll do everything I can for you

366
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,160
within my capability.

367
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,000
Here.

368
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,400
How could you let You'an

369
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
drink beer?

370
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,160
Yoyo? Yoyo!

371
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,520
I've already prepared it.

372
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm fine with anything.

373
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
This is You'an's favourite.

374
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,480
Thank you.

375
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,240
See?

376
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,600
Even I don't get such special treatment.

377
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm hoping to ride on her coattails.

378
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,480
You'an,

379
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,800
a toast to you.

380
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,320
Let's give a toast to her together.

381
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,360
Come, You'an.

382
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,520
You'an.

383
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,920
Thank you.

384
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,760
Sorry.

385
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,720
I was on the phone for so long.

386
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,640
Something urgent came up

387
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,800
in Singapore that needed to be handled.

388
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,800
Tonight is also a reception for Nate.

389
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,560
I dragged him here
right after he got off his plane

390
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,520
this afternoon.

391
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,400
It has been a while.

392
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
It hasn't been that long.

393
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,120
After all,
you're just like a migratory bird.

394
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
You fly back every year.

395
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
Come. Let's drink.

396
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,920
Let's drink. Come.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Cheers.

398
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,360
Drink.

399
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
It's fine. Just send it

400
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,160
to my email.

401
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,760
It's not a big deal.

402
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,600
Just focus on your job.

403
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,200
Yes, keep Mr. Jie happy.

404
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,160
Tell me if anything comes up.
I'm hanging up.

405
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,200
How do you feel?

406
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,680
You're not drunk, are you?

407
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,600
I think it's hard to get drunk

408
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,680
on this stuff.

409
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Every time I come back,

410
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,400
somehow, the first impression I get is

411
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,800
your alcohol tolerance

412
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,040
seems to have gotten even better again.

413
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,440
By the way,

414
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,640
thanks

415
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
for the birthday present.

416
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,480
I love it.

417
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,120
Thank you.

418
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,040
I'm glad you like it.

419
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
I gave you that set of tableware

420
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,360
to use at home,
maybe when you drink coffee

421
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,120
or eat some fruit.

422
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,000
Very practical.

423
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,960
It is indeed

424
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
my most frequently used item

425
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,240
now.

426
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,400
I can stay

427
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,200
for about two months this time.

428
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
Is that long?

429
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,160
Did the company say

430
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,480
when your outstation ends

431
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,520
and you can come back to Shenzhen?

432
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,800
I put in a request

433
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,320
to stay in Singapore for the long term.

434
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,840
That's good.

435
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,960
That's nice.

436
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,400
Let's head inside.

437
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,040
They'll probably be done

438
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,280
after another round of drinks.

439
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,120
Jin Yi.

440
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,400
Be serious.

441
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,120
All right.

442
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,960
You've seen him

443
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
in this afternoon's training.

444
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,240
Jiang Chenglin.

445
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,880
Present.

446
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,280
He will be joining us

447
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,720
from today onwards.

448
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,840
Your new teammate.

449
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,160
He is the youngest

450
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,360
and new here.

451
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,960
Look after him.

452
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,560
That's all
for this afternoon's training.

453
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,560
Dismissed.

454
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,280
Thank you, sir.

455
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,520
Clean up the court.

456
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,680
What are you waiting for?

457
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,880
All right.

458
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,040
I'm not talking about you.

459
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
That's his job.

460
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
You don't need to do it.

461
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,600
Get some good rest.

462
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
Work hard, kid.

463
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,480
Okay.

464
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,160
Chuan, I'm new here.

465
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,200
I know the rules.

466
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,920
Your rules

467
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,960
don't apply here.

468
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,680
Don't bother.

469
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,280
But this isn't something
you should do, either.

470
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,720
It's fine.

471
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,160
At least let me help you.

472
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
Stay away from me.

473
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm not used to having
someone beside me.

474
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,080
Trio with single.

475
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,680
No.

476
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,280
I heard you're sharing a dorm

477
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,560
with that new kid.

478
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
Yes, we are.

479
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,760
A pair of Ks.

480
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,480
No.

481
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,080
Keep an eye on him.

482
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,480
Don't stay blind and deaf.

483
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,160
I know, I know.

484
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Not for me.

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,960
You're back.

486
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,680
The court is ready.

487
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Did that new kid

488
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,120
help you?

489
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,480
He isn't that perceptive.

490
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,640
Neither do I need him.

491
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,600
Bomb.

492
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,720
How much longer are you guys
going to keep playing?

493
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
This is my dorm too.

494
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,600
We're just playing for a bit.
Who are you to tell us what to do?

495
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,880
Who let you play those cards?

496
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,160
Pair of As.

(An adult's social circle)

511
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,120
(is filled with codes.)

(Things that you don't understand,)

513
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,840
(but someone else can.)

514
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,160
Trio with single.

(Liang You'an)

516
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
Drinking coffee
in the middle of the night?

517
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,240
She's not worried
about being unable to fall asleep, huh?

518
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,280
Pair of threes.

519
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
I can't match up.

520
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,120
Pair of eights.

521
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,160
Pair of twos.

522
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
The stakes are high in this game.

523
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,120
It's almost 11:00 p.m.

524
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,040
Four sevens!

525
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,160
Got something better?

526
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,280
No.

527
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
If not, then it's all mine.

528
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,160
It's a no from me.

529
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,160
What are you talking about?

530
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
Don't you have four tens?

531
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,000
Peepers get stitches!

532
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,560
As if I need you to go easy on me!

533
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,600
No, Yi…

534
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,360
Shuffle the cards and start over!

535
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,520
Still playing?

536
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,400
If not, get out.

537
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,080
(Liang You'an:
Will you be there tomorrow?)

538
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,120
(I'm going to see
your team tomorrow for work.)

539
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,320
(Song Sanchuan:
Training starts at 8:00 a.m.)

540
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,360
Okay. See you tomorrow.

541
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,120
Let's play a game. You and me.

542
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,520
Are you in?

543
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,800
What are the stakes?

544
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
Save time.

545
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,960
Draw and flip. The bigger one wins.

546
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,720
Loser

547
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,720
will be the winner's ball boy for a day.

548
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,760
Bring it on.

549
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,120
Let's get started.

550
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,200
Go and pick up the balls at the back.

551
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,920
Start.

552
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,600
Xiong, you're here.

553
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,680
Thank you

554
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,640
for the tech support.

555
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,080
It's all right.

556
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,080
Focus on

557
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,680
Jin Yi's technique and playing style.

558
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,600
I've spoken to the coach.

559
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,000
We've arranged to do
a data collection session

560
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,000
with him

561
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,760
this afternoon.

562
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,280
Then, we'll have a set of training wear

563
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
and shoes tailor-made for him

564
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,600
so he can get a feel

565
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
of our products.

566
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,960
Okay. No problem.

567
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,480
Okay. I ordered you an Americano.

568
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,360
You're too kind.

569
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,200
Xiong,

570
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,320
the one in the red training wear

571
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
is Jin Yi.

572
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,920
Okay.

573
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,800
What are you doing?

574
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,840
I almost sprained my ankle!

575
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,520
How are you so bad at being a ball boy?

576
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,960
How are you so bad at playing?

577
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,440
You can't receive a ball like this!

578
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
Isn't that what you told me?

579
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,680
That my techniques are too bad,
and I have too many unsolved issues.

580
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,600
Go easy on me.

581
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,320
You're doing this on purpose.

582
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,400
A sore loser, are you?

583
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
Don't want to make good on your word?

584
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,000
No wonder everyone lets you
get away with things.

585
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,880
Fine. I'm not practising today.

586
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,440
I'll serve you

587
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,480
until you're satisfied.

588
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,720
Talk. What is it?

589
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
It has been like this all morning.

590
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,160
Tell me.

591
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,040
What's going on between you and Jin Yi?

592
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,960
He lost a bet.

593
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,920
He's my ball boy for the day.

594
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,120
I went through a lot of trouble

595
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,080
to get two colleagues
from the Information Department

596
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,600
to come and collect data on Jin Yi.

597
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
How are we supposed to do that

598
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
if you're making him retrieve balls?

599
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,160
So?

600
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
I sent you a message last night,

601
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,640
hoping

602
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,640
that having a familiar face on the team

603
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,120
might be able to help me out.

604
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,880
Or, at the very least,

605
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,040
not give me trouble.

606
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,840
Since when did we become

607
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,800
familiar acquaintances?

608
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Okay. Fine. We're not.

609
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,760
Pretend I never said anything.

610
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,080
I'm not trying to cause trouble.

611
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,000
I just have nothing else to do.

612
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,120
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

613
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,600
I thought

614
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,040
lessons were taught on the court

615
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
among athletes.

616
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
I'll be collecting data

617
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,160
this afternoon as well.

618
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,600
No more messing around.

619
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,880
Fine.

620
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,560
Since a familiar acquaintance of mine
has spoken,

621
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,920
I'll dismiss my ball boy

622
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,360
from his duties.

623
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,640
These two sets of machines
we brought today

624
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,720
are the most advanced
evaluation instruments

625
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,080
of Young Space.

626
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,360
This set is used

627
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,320
to evaluate

628
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
hand and foot reflexes.

629
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
This other set…

630
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,320
That's enough.

631
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,920
Mr. Yu told me.

632
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
I know everything.

633
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,000
The one I can't get out of my mind

634
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,200
is Song Sanchuan.

635
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
Of course, it's not him.

636
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,360
Eric.

637
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,320
Since we already brought

638
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
the machines here,

639
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,120
I would like to evaluate everyone

640
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,120
if the time

641
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,480
allows for it.

642
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,720
We have no problem with that.

643
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,760
All the machines are already here.

644
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Thanks.

645
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,280
Letting everyone enjoy

646
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,560
this opportunity

647
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,560
will show

648
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,160
your leadership.

649
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,120
What do you think?

650
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,440
Of course.

651
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
This is a good thing.

652
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,800
It wouldn't be right of me

653
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
to refuse.

654
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,680
Hurry!

655
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,960
Over here!

656
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,760
Okay.

657
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,640
Over here!

658
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,880
Song Sanchuan.

659
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
You two should get tested too.

660
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,680
Sure.

661
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,320
Why should someone who can't compete

662
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,400
even bother with the evaluation?

663
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't waste everyone's time.

664
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,360
We would like to have everyone

665
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,440
get evaluated if possible.

666
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,320
He doesn't need to do it.

667
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
My phone's out of battery.

668
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,360
Rent a powerbank for me.

669
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,640
It's fine, Yi.

670
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,040
I'll do it.

671
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,320
No.

672
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,320
You're the one who should be
doing this the most

673
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,720
so everyone can know

674
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,000
what you're capable of.

675
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,080
Go on.

676
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,280
Next.

677
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,160
This set of tests evaluates

678
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,000
your core stability,

679
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
joint flexibility,

680
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,880
neuromuscular control,

681
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,960
range of motion,

682
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,800
balance, proprioception,

683
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
and other abilities

684
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,720
as a whole to provide accurate results.

685
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,640
Then it is used to determine

686
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,880
the athlete's risk of injury

687
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:14,391
and potential problems.

688
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,240
Miss,

689
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,000
you sound so professional.

690
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,560
Can you do it for me?

691
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,000
I trust you.

692
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Sure.

693
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,760
Let me do it, Eric.

694
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,480
Thanks.

695
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,680
Good work today.

696
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,400
Can you not be so indecent?

697
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,360
What's your problem?

698
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,719
Where were you looking?

699
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
I've never seen you stand up for anyone

700
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,679
in all the time we've been teammates.

701
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,239
I thought

702
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,520
you didn't care about anything at all.

703
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,360
I'm done with this.

704
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,200
Jin Yi.

705
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,560
What?

706
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,400
I'll be honest with you.

707
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,280
I've always had reservations

708
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,920
about having you

709
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,520
as our long-term spokesperson.

710
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
The only reason I could convince myself

711
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
was I could see

712
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,720
that you work hard on the court.

713
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,240
You qualify
in all professional qualifications,

714
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,680
but I have to take a gamble
on everything else.

715
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,200
No, what… What do you mean?

716
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,560
I'll make Young Space's stance clear

717
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,120
to you.

718
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,840
If we are able to trust and cooperate
with each other,

719
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,320
Young Space

720
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,160
will make you the brightest star
in no time.

721
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,360
But if you can't treat others equally,

722
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,280
you can forget about it.

723
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,240
There's a practical saying at work.

724
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,720
To make things difficult for others is

725
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,920
to make things difficult for yourself.

726
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm definitely
more professional than you

727
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,480
when it comes to making things
difficult for someone.

728
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,960
So I'm giving you

729
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,920
two choices right now.

730
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,680
One.

731
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,400
You turn me down.

732
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,520
My people and machines
will withdraw immediately.

733
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,440
Or

734
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll go back to my car
and get some rest,

735
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
but I'll only leave

736
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,960
after my colleagues

737
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,120
have collected

738
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,840
everyone's data.

739
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,720
Brat.

740
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,520
You don't even have
a fully grown moustache yet,

741
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,680
and you're trying to pull
that lewd act on me?

742
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,840
Hello?

743
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,960
All right.

744
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,520
As long as he cooperates.

745
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,160
You guys can take a break

746
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,800
and

747
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,120
leave those two machines

748
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,080
for me.

749
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,760
Begin.

750
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,720
Did you stay behind by yourself

751
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,720
just for me?

752
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,160
Focus on the test.

753
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,920
Okay. That's enough.

754
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,380
(Song Sanchuan)

755
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,820
(Average: 0.94)

756
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,820
(Jin Yi)

757
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,100
(Average: 1.52)

758
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,040
(His results are better than Jin Yi's.)

759
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,240
(He's the best candidate)

760
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,720
(for the underdog.)

761
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,480
How did I do?

762
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,520
Quite well.

763
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,360
I'll send you the report

764
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,560
for these two tests

765
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
once it's ready.

766
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,400
Thank you for earlier.

767
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,120
Just "thank you"?

768
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,680
We're done here,

769
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,920
Eric.

770
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,280
Could you pack up the machines?

771
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,120
Thanks.

772
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,800
I am busy today.

773
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,440
I'll treat you to wontons next time.

774
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,680
Wontons.

775
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,840
Mr. Jie.

776
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
What's the matter?

777
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,120
I would like to ask you

778
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,080
to assign me Mr. Eddie's secretary,

779
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Yoyo.

780
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,800
Why?

781
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
She's meticulous

782
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,960
and responsible at work.

783
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,440
She's optimistic and cheerful.

784
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,040
She possesses the qualities

785
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,320
of a good assistant.

786
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,880
I know

787
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,000
I was too impatient.

788
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,360
I didn't consider
what difficulties you might be facing.

789
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,520
That was wrong of me.

790
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
I will do my best

791
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
to make this underdog project

792
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,480
a success,

793
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,480
and I will train

794
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,000
a qualified successor myself

795
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,080
in the meantime.

796
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,840
Please make good

797
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,040
on your promise

798
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,920
when the time comes

799
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,480
and transfer me to business operations.

800
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,880
What is this?

801
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,880
Don't you trust me?

802
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,040
All right.

803
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,240
Request approved.

804
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,600
Thank you, Mr. Jie.

805
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,040
That woman from Young Space.

806
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,080
Liang something?

807
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,560
You know her?

808
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,160
So you're the one

809
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,440
who brought me that sponsor.

810
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm not capable of such a feat.

811
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,880
I wondered

812
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,600
why you suddenly

813
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,040
wanted to make a bet with me last night.

814
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,240
So this is what you were after.

815
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,440
She's her, and I'm me.

816
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,760
We're not related.

817
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,760
So you deliberately made me look bad

818
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,720
in front of a sponsor.

819
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,800
Listen up.

820
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,160
There is no next time.

821
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,680
Let's go.

822
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,600
