1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,040
I am thirty-two years old.

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,480
I worked for six years straight
at the same company.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,640
It's a pretty stable job.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,280
My net income after tax

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
should be up to your expectations.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
This house was rented under my name.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,600
It's a one-bedroom apartment.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
It's about 70 square metres.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,680
Don't want kids? I am fine with it.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,240
Been single for more than five years.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,960
Please consider me

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,040
as a top priority.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,680
Don't get me wrong though,

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,400
I did say

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,680
I do not plan to have children,

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,400
but I am very fond of them.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Eel-san is smiling at me.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,920
It likes me.

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,240
You like me, don't you?

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
It's not Eel-san,

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,320
it's Ilsa.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,520
Il-sa.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,080
Sha.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,000
Sa. Don't bother. It's fine.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,440
Dear Ilsa

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,920
will be one year old soon.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,760
I can't bring myself to give her away.

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,479
Yet my daughter

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,680
is gravely allergic to dog fur.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,400
I really can't keep it around anymore.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,880
I just wanted to be sure that

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
whoever adopts her

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,280
is someone stable, reliable

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,440
and caring.

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,720
That's me you're describing.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,400
I took some time to make this for Ilsa.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a schedule.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Have a look.

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,320
(A day with Liang You'an and Eel-san)
Wake up and get ready at 6:30.

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,480
Morning workout at 7:00.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
(yoyo)
Bring Ilsa along.

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,160
It's alright, go ahead and take it.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,040
Sorry for that.

44
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
Don't worry about it.

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,000
Yoyo, what day is it today?

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,240
Yes, today falls on a weekend.

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,040
If there's anything,

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,480
talk to me on Monday, alright?

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm hanging up.

50
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,230
(Eddie)

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,080
I'll have to take this.

52
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,840
Be right back.

53
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,040
Mr. Eddie.

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Right. No problem.

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,840
I'll send it to your email right away.

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,840
Yes.

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
Yes, bye.

58
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Just a minute, please.

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,360
I just need to send an email.

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
I'll be done right away.

61
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,040
Yoyo,

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
I have sent the file to

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,800
Mr. Eddie.

64
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,880
Have a look on his behalf.

65
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm really sorry.

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
Hello. Mr. Jie.

67
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes, alright

68
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
Please confirm that with Mr. Eddie.

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
What is your take on having a life?

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
What does life

71
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,920
mean to you?

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
(Life.)

73
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,200
(The one taking control of my life)

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,880
(has never been me.)

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,440
(As a director's executive assistant,)

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
(Blue flag)
(from filtering work priorities)

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,280
(Materials for Mr. Jiang's use only)
(to clearing away minor inconveniences,)

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
(To-do list)
(I spent all my energy on becoming)

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,640
(the loyal shadow of my boss.)

80
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,920
(Gold medal employee - Liang You'an)
(365 days a year,)

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
(24 hours a day, always on standby.)

82
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,120
(There's no time off for me really.)

83
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,600
(I don't want to do this anymore.)

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
(Every day, for just 15 minutes maybe,)

85
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,360
(I really wanted to catch a break.)

86
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,560
So I truly, genuinely

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
wanted to have a dog.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,640
In your application form,

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
and I was particularly moved by this,

90
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,760
you said that you longed to

91
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,280
get home and open the door

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,440
to find someone

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,960
welcoming you home.

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,640
Yet looking at you now, I guess

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,400
you won't have the time even for that.

96
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,160

97

(Hi, Liang You'an)

99

(Hi, Song Sanchuan)

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,880
(Liang You'an,)

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
(I thought we were going
to have dinner together?)

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
(Why are you standing me up again?)

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,080
Well you see

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,880
the marathon is tomorrow.

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
My boss called for a last-minute meeting

106
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
and I have to monitor it on his behalf.

107
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,480
(SPACE)
(You are so dedicated,)

108
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
(if I were the boss,)

109
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
(I won't be able to leave your side.)

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
Hold that thought.

111
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
After tomorrow's event,

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
I will apply for a transfer.

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,839
No one can stop me.

114
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,200
(Right.)

115
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,560
Ms. You'an,

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,959
Mr. Eddie is waiting in the office.

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,160
Right.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,520
(Weren't you about to)

119
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,800
(adopt Eel-san today?)

120
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,640
Eel-san thinks I'm too busy working,

121
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,720
so they said, "next please".

122
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
But that's okay.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
Wait till I get transferred,

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,520
I'll apply for adoption again,

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,640
and I will succeed this time.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,960
Mr. Jie,

127
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
let me talk you through

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,640
what's in our contestant goodie bag.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,360
Sure.

130
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,600
Inside the bag,

131
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,120
there will be a pair of

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,600
our sports shapewear

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,560
that will be featured next season,

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,080
a box of energy capsules

135
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,880
and Young Space's

136
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,920
online reload gift card.

137
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,120
This comes up to 300 yuan in total.

138
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
The more noteworthy thing is

139
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,200
this hairband.

140
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,320
Our business team

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,640
with a luxury brand.

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
This is great.

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,240
We must pay attention

145
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
to what female consumers

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
are saying on social media.

147
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,840
Good morning, boss.

148
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,560
Ms. You'an,

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
something came up.

150
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
We'll deal with it later.

is Smarter Finance's vice president,

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
appointed externally yesterday,

163
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,880
Mr. Xu Yan.

164
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,280
Mr. Wang,

165
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
happy birthday to you.

Thank you.

Mr. Xu.

Mr. Jiang, you're late today.

171

No problem.

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,280
So what happened?

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,800
Look,

is the presenting sponsor Bank of Shenxing.

(Xie Ru, Wang Xicheng)
Nothing wrong with that.

177
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,720
However as the event's main sponsor,

178
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
shouldn't we be seated closer to the middle

179
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,520
than Smarter?

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wonder too.

183

By the time I came over,

184

they were already here.

185
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,480
I don't know if they coordinated this.

186
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,160
Change it back.

187
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,360
Can we do that?

188
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
The president Mr. Xu even

189
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
sat there just now.

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
That doesn't matter.

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
Everyone should be properly seated.

192
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
In the official group photo later,

193
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,520
our boss

194
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
should be seated at his deserving place.

195
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,300
(Smarter Finance - Xu Yan
Y-Space Sports - Jiang Jie)

196
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm off to see the pacers.

197
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,920
Watch over this like a hawk.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,040
If the boss asks about anything,

199
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,200
call me anytime.

200
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,840
Do not use WeChat.

201
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,560
I won't be able to hear you.

202
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,480
Alright, Ms. You'an.

203
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,160
Mr. Wang,

204
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,160
let's not stand around.

205
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,780
Let's sit down and chat.

206
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,360
- Sure, sure.
- Have a seat.

207
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,640
Come, sit.

208
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,840
This marathon

209
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,000
that we organised

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,040
would require everyone to

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,880
work closely together.

212
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,480
Yes.

213
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,500
This is great.

214
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,880
The official pacers for the race

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
are all in another tent.

216
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
Over here are Young Space's

217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
(Relaxation area)
sponsored pacers.

218
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
Ms. You'an, I have to say,

219
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,800
your criteria for the selection

220
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,320
set the bar so high.

221
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,800
It's the women's marathon,

222
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,080
and you got them male pacers.

223
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
They all look so good.

224
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
Who wouldn't be going after them?

225
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,000
Only I have to wear this?

226
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,720
Why?

227
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,880
You could choose not to,

228
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
but you can't be the closing pacer then.

229
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,560
What does being the closing pacer

230
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,640
have to do with wearing this?

231
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,400
The wage of a normal pacer is 3,000,

232
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,880
the wage of a closing pacer is 5,000.

233
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
Look,

234
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll give you a minute to decide

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
whether you'll put this on.

236
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,240
Running's what we need to do,

237
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,679
why do I need to put this on?

238
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,520
If your face is that important,

239
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,760
then I guess money isn't.

240
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,000
Liu,

241
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,280
- Ms. You'an.
- I'll take care of it.

242
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,080
Alright.

243
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,040
The time carried on everyone's back

244
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
is pre-arranged.

245
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,800
Once the gun goes off,

246
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
all the contestants will,

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,960
according to their running speed,

248
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
pick the right pacer for themselves.

249
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
The three-hour mark

250
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,640
marathon closing pacer

251
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
will decide the number of

252
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,320
finishers for the whole marathon.

253
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,560
An important role.

254
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
I guess this bow

255
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,520
isn't really appropriate.

256
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,720
This is an oversight on our part.

257
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
This is much better, right?

258
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,800
All pacers,

259
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
please head over and get ready.

260
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Thanks.

261
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,360
Hold on.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
Don't move.

263
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
Stay still.

264
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Okay!

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,880

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,320
Ms. You'an.

267
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,600
What's the matter, Ms. You'an?

268
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,000
Everyone who is providing services

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,080

represents Young Space.

271
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,480
To service others politely and sincerely

272
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,400
are just the basics.

273
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Whether they earn 3,000

274
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,960
or 5,000,

275
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,160
they made it through their efforts

276
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,720
and will be paid by our company.

277
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Do not think that such money,

278
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,120
or even just a banana

279
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,600
from the supply station,

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,760
should you take charge of it,

281
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,240
entitles you

282
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
to disrespect others.

283
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, I understand, Ms. You'an.

284
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,080
Go get busy.

(The 5th Shenzhen Intercity Cup

Thank you.

Hello, Mr. Eddie,

295
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,640
I'll let you take charge of the OB van.

296
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm going over to the

297
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,880
5 km stop supply station.

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,720
Mr. Jie wants

299
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,520
the airtime of Young Space advertisements

300
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,680
during the marathon live broadcast

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,600
to be a total of

302
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,320
not less than 10%.

303
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,840
Alright, good job.

(Half marathon)

305
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,200
They are here.

308

for easy access.

309
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,840
Pinch the lip of the cup together

310
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,040
so that the runners can take

311
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,280
little sips along the way.

312
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,560
Thank you.

313
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,040
Good job.

314
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,480
Mr. Jiang,

315
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,200
the few leading runners so far

316
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,600
are all Smarter Finances'

317

sponsored contestants.

318
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,120
How many did Mr. Jiang bet on this time?

319
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
Just three this time.

320
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,520
I heard that you betted on a dozen.

321
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Your tactics are really to
spend huge capital here.

322
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,560
Regardless of the tactics used,

323
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
landing bets on the champion

324
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
is what really matters.

325
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,080
It's competitive sport,

326
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
and that's how cruel it is.

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,960
When the winners are decided,

328
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
let's see which of us

330
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,000
can present the award

331
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680

Hey handsome, let me add you on WeChat.

334
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
I'll scan you.

335
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,480
Hey handsome,

336
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,000
if we keep up with you,

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,320
we are sure to finish this race, right?

338
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,440
You finish by running, not talking.

339
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,480
So if we run alongside you

340
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,760
up to the finishing line,

341
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,600
will you let us add you?

342
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,880
Alright,

343
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,600
keep up then if you can.

344
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,880
How great it is to be young.

345
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,680
- Let's run!
- Yes!

346
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Mr. Eddie,

347
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,480
I'm at the first supply station now,

348
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,400
our drinking water

349
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,240
and energy drinks

350
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,880
are being consumed faster than expected.

351
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
Please ask our marketing colleagues to

352
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,600
hurry up and send more over.

353
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,480
Alright.

354
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,120
- I'll go to the other stops
- Come on!

355
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,000
- and check on them.
- Go on!

356
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,000
Go on!

357
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Come on! Come on!

358
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
- Come on!
- Hello Mr. Jie.

359
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Liang You'an,

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,760
can those three runners make it?

361
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,800
Press on.

362
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Mr. Jie,

363
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,000
- this is like horse betting,
- Come on!

364
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,520
- it's all about luck.
- Come on!

365
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Let's just wait and see?

366
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,880
Didn't I approve

367
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,280
a budget for five?

368
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,760
Why did we only bet on three?

369
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,680
The money saved

370
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,600
was used to hire male pacers.

371
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,760
Alright, got it.

372
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,850
- That's great! You're doing well!
- Right!

373
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,680
Come on!

374
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,280
We're on our way to the next supply station now.

375
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,160
Go on, good job!

378

411
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,359
our Young Space has

412
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,040
good luck.

413
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,160
Just like that,

414
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,560
we got into the top three.

415

Isn't that obvious?

446
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,960
If it wasn't done to hurt others,

447
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,160
it was done to cause a nuisance.

457
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,280
I would like to rent this space,

458
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
including this space over here.

459
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
How much is the rental fee?

460
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,920
(Due to poor placement,)

461
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,800
(our advertising mannequin
fell onto the marathon route,)

462

to rectify this oversight.)

Our explanation

472
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
still holds some credibility.

473
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,320
You must not let your guard down.

474
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400

475

Our statement addresses the public,

476
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,960
but you still have to find out

477
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,680
where did that mannequin come from.

478
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
I applied for access to
the surveillance footage.

479
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,040
As soon as I find something,

480
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,440
I will let you know.

481
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320

493

he asked me for the money,

494
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,000
but I didn't give it to him,

495
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,600
for he didn't follow his running time

496
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,560
as the closing pacer.

497
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
That makes his wages

498
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,520
deductible by 2,000 yuan.

499
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,480
I'll take over,

500
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,320
you can go now.

501
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm here for the money.

502
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,520
It's true though,

503
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
I didn't follow my time.

504
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
If you want to deduct my pay,

505
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,880
I have nothing to say.

506
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Take it.

507
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,480
It's been a long day for everyone.

508
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,960
Don't want to make this day
more difficult.

509

Why?

510

I wish more than anyone

511
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,880
that today will go well.

512

513

562
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,280
Don't tell mom.

563
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,280
Boyfriend?

564
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Eat up.

565
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,060
(WeChat message)

566
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,480
(Ms. You'an,)

567
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,320
(Mingyu)
(the big boss will be coming tomorrow.)

568
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,920
(Mr. Jie wants you to help Mr. Eddie)

569
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,760
(to prepare the presentation slides for)

570
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,040
(the marathon sponsorship report.)

571
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,760
Baby,

572
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,040
go ahead and eat up.

573
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,760
I'll watch cartoons with you after that.

574
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,360
Alright?

575
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
Did you put it there?

576
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,280
You're home.

577
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm home.

578
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,600
Where's Luo Le?

579
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,920
She's in the room, sleeping.

580
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,520
When I called you,

581
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,000
I wasn't actually expecting anything.

582
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,680
But you did have the time.

583
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,520
The marathon came to an end.

584
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,400
This huge task was done.

585
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,600
I can finally apply for a transfer.

586
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,880
For real?

587
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Congratulations!

588
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,880
Did you give my girl

589
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
fried chicken?

590
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
How come?

591
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,520
Both of us even went downstairs

592
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,040
to sort out the bones

593
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,200
for garbage disposal.

594
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I even opened the window
to air out the room.

595
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,680
There's a smell?

596
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,720
There wasn't.

597
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,360
That's scary.

598
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,000
What are you?

599
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,800
The female version of Sherlock Holmes?

600
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,200
One drumstick,

601
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,480
324 calories.

602
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,640
Chicken breast, 200 calories.

603
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Chicken wing,

604
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
224 calories.

605
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,720
Say,

606
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,680
which chicken part did you

607
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
feed my daughter?

608
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,720
Fine, I plead guilty.

609
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,960
I am simply a malicious

610
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,800
godmother who used fried chicken

611
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,160
to bring happiness to my goddaughter.

612
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,080
I plead guilty. I'll drink.

613
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
After this year,

614
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,800
I will enrol Luo Le

615
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,880
into a boarding school.

616
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,280
Wait,

617
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,520
did I hear you right?

618
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,960
You're out of your mind.

619
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,280
You're putting her in boarding school?

620
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,440
She's so young!

621
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
Look,

622
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,440
my job as a nutritionist

623
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,120
is coming into trend recently.

624
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
Artists wanting to get in shape,

625
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,800
managers wanting to lose weight.

626
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,120
When work comes,

627
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,680
the group that I follow

628
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,080
will go on for one or two months.

629
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,280
If she's in boarding school,

630
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,760
I'll be able to work with peace of mind.

631
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,920
I told you early on

632
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,040
to move to

633
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
my building.

634
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,840
I just happened to

635
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,040
see this agent's social media posting.

636
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,440
There are two units available now.

637
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,760
The price looks alright.

638
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,520
Take your time now to browse through.

639
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,160
I wanted to look for a domestic helper,

640
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,840
when the time comes,

641
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,240
I'll just pay her a bit more

642
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,240
to take care of both of our houses.

643
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,800
She can send Luo Le to school too.

644
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,720
Won't that be great?

645
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,760
Don't feel burdened.

646
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,960
And no boarding school.

647
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,320
Just listen to me.

648
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,680
I've never told you this before,

649
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,440
but the reason I was able to go through

650
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
divorce with such determination,

651
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
half of that courage,

652
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
I got it from you.

653
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,920
Alright.

654
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
I think it over again.

655
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,360
I'll go and check on my kid.

656
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Go.

657
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,700
(Marketing Department Entry Form
Name - Liang You'an)

658
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
An Cong, what's wrong with you?

659
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,200
There, there.

660
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,960
Quiet down.

661
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,280
I just finished tidying this up.

662
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,040
It'll be picked up later by my customer.

663
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Get up.

664
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,120
I have to ask you something.

665
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,080
Why were you late home last night?

666
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,640
I was busy earning extra money.

667
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,760
Earning extra money?

668
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,320
My son,

669
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,160
we shouldn't be doing illegal stuff.

670
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,720
Just shut up already.

671
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,840
Who's this son of yours?

672
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
All you do is indulge in useless fantasies.

673
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,040
Should I really call you father,

674
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,000
would you dare be one?

675
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,200
My good son.

676
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,880
In what universe are there
yolkless salted duck eggs?

677
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,000
Where's the yolk?

678
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,880
My mouth was idling while I was cooking,

679
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
so I just dug into it.

680
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,600
An,

681
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,160
the tea you wanted

682
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,320
last week is here.

683
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,040
Get ready to catch.

684
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,520
Okay.

685
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,960
Thanks.

686
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,360
I'll transfer the money later.

687
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,200
There's no hurry.

688
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,960
Talk later.

689
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,760
Sure.

690
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
Here's your vinegar!

691
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,360
You're leaving?

692
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,160
Slow down!

693
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,200
You slow down.

694
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,780
Please give me a rice noodle roll.

695
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,080
Hui,

696
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,520
give me two salted duck eggs.

697
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,840
Get it from the cabinet yourself.

698
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,440
Come, have one.

699
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,360
That's good,

700
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,880
you didn't take that.

701
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Do you have anything better to do?

702
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,360
Since I was 18,

703
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,960
this is the only trick up your sleeve.

704
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,360
Even dogs could do better you know?

705
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,960
I was just testing you.

706
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,920
I'm telling you,

707
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,760
never smoke for your line of work.

708
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Okay?

709
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
Boss.

710
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,760
Come, come.

711
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,800
Have a seat inside.

712
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,320
(Ancong Wig Shop)
Hey little cutie.

713
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,480
All done.

714
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Let me tell you,

715
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,120
you've had a successful operation,

716
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
your report readings are good,

717
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,440
once done with this round of chemo,

718
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,760
for sure you'll be able to go home.

719
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,960
Hey darling,

720
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,480
come and have a look.

721
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,400
Does mom look good?

722
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,520
Mom looks as good as
before she was sick.

723
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,160
She looks even better than that now.

724
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,400
Actually,

725
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
I shouldn't have spent this money.

726
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
If you hadn't told me that

727
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,440
you will give me the highest discount,

728
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,120
women are the worst
when it comes to discounts.

729
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,880
That's so accurate.

730
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,600
When my wife was around,

731
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,560
she used to say that too.

732
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,920
Your wife...

733
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,960
She left.

734
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,800
Oh no, no.

735
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,440
It's not what you think.

736
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,200
She left me, literally.

737
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
She walked away from me.

738
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
It wasn't a metaphor.

739
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,160
After she left,

740
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,720
it was just me and my son.

741
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,880
That's my son.

742
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,640
What was I saying?

743
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,720
Many people

744
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,840
question my principles,

745
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,320
they say I am profiting off sadness.

746
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,680
Only I know

747
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,600
what I am doing.

748
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,880
People who are sick,

749
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,120
most of them,

750
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,640
their spirits break before
their bodies do.

751
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
So you might as well

752
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,960
tidy up and

753
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,600
walk out with your head held high.

754
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,400
You make yourself look beautiful,

755
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,240
and that's what rebirth is all about.

756
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,120
The total is 300.

757
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,600
I threw in a conditioner for you.

758
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,280
Thank you, boss.

759
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,040
This money here was

760
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
placed in my drawer by some kind soul.

761
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
It might be a patient,

762
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,920
who happened to see that

763
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,640
it's just me and my daughter,

764
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,080
and donated this to us.

765
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,400
You see one's true nature
after falling sick.

766
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,840
Her father sees me as a burden.

767
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
I understand him leaving,

768
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,960
but he left his child too.

769
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,680
What if I pass away someday?

770
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,280
What would happen to her?

771
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,280
You will have to carry on, right?

772
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,000
(Women's marathon pacer recruitment)
Got your eye on any of these?

773
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,000
I'll give you a discount.

774
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,880
How much is this?

775
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,360
You are right.

776
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,480
Every day that I get from now on,

777
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,880
is an extra day earned.

778
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,800
I've got to be happy about it.

779
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,320
Maybe the illness won't come back.

780
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,280
Right on!

781
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,080
Here, this is 300.

782
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,600
200 is enough.

783
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,480
Save the other 100 for your child,

784
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,240
get her some nice food or toys.

785
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,720
Thank you.

786
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,520
Baby,

787
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
come on let's go have fun together.

788
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,960
Let's go.

789
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,040
Look at you,

790
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,800
you sell a wig just to lose 50 yuan.

791
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,560
You're the prime example of a squanderer.

792
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,160
Can't you see she's raising a child?

793
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,800
They don't have it easy.

794
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,640
You're right.

795
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
If she passes away,

796
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,000
the child will have no mother.

797
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,040
We don't need this 50 anyway.

798
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
Take a look at this.

799
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,159
Is this one of your wigs?

800
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,000
No.

801
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,880
Take a good look, is it yours?

802
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,159
I've said it, it's not mine.

803
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't get in my way.

804
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,280
Although Young Space isn't

805
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
the presenting sponsor this time,

806
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
as a solid

807
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Tier 1 sponsor,

808
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,560
our data shows that

809
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
we got higher exposure.

810
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,600
Look at our finishers' goodie bag,

811
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,560
the supply drinks,

812
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,280
and especially the bet successfully

813
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,520
placed on the champion,

814
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,880
our effective reach is

815
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,680
in an absolute lead.

816
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,280
Following that, our department

817
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
will continue to collect

818
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
statistics that are driven by

819
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,480
product sales.

820
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,840
Thanks for your hard work.

821
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,000
Eddie,

822
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,600
Mr. Jie has really trained

823
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
and honed you well

824
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,200
to take on big projects now.

825
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,120
Thank you, boss.

826
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,480
Gao Li,

827
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,360
regarding the mannequin incident,

828
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,720
what does the sales department
think about it?

829
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,040
Was it done by a rival company?

830
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,520
It is very likely.

831
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,840
I mean,

832
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,560
no matter which company,

833
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,480
out of what purpose,

834
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,360
Mr. Jiang's

835
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,640
marketing department handled it
extremely well.

836
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,400
It went viral out of all the chaos,

837
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,080
and was steadily pacified.

838
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,280
We got free publicity out of it.

839
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,520
If you were to search 'marathon' now,

840
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,120
all the keywords will be related to

841
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,160
Young Space Group.

842
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,560
Such publicity might not be possibly

843
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,120
achieved even if we spent money on it.

844
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,400
Thank you for the praise,  Mr. Gao.

845
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,400
Luckily,

846
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,320
the meeting attendees today

847
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,160
are all of our own.

848
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,400
Should anyone hear this,

849
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,320
they might think it's an act all along.

850
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
Of course not.

851
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Everybody knows

852
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,520
Mr. Jiang always
takes the path less taken.

853
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,760
However this development

854
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,240
might go both ways.

855
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,200
I didn't think that
you would be up for it, Mr. Jiang.

856
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,800
Of course not.

857
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,560
If there is a possibility

858
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,160
that it will cost Young Space's image,

859
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,280
I'll never dare to do it.

860
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
This is me.

861
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,240
Timid, conservative.

862
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,840
All these years,

863
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,240
I have the president to thank

864
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,960
for employing me with full trust.

865
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,240
That's for sure.

866
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,280
The branding of Young Space

867
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,400
was built well over the years.

868
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,960
The marketing department led by Mr. Jie

869
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,600
has made the greatest contribution.

870
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,760
The whole company knows.

871
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,120
How did I come to hear then,

872
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,240
that this marathon,

873
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,840
was held together by Liang You'an?

874
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,520
You chose the three runners, right?

875
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,920
And you were still busy going around
to put out fires.

876
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,880
Mr. Gao,

877
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,200
it's all part of my job.

878
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,920
You're being too humble.

879
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
With your current abilities,

880
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,680
fulfilling the EA position

881
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,080
for a long time,

882
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,800
is a waste of talent.

883
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,040
I really appreciate talents,

884
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,240
and maybe you'd want to consider

885
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,640
joining our sales department.

886
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,960
Mr. Jiang,

887
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,560
everyone from our company

888
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
knows Liang You'an and

889
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
praises her for her competence.

890
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,200
I'd like to have her over,

891
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
you'll let me have her, won't you?

892
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,320
You'an is not up to the mark yet.

893
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Maybe two more years?

894
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,840
She needs more training.

895
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,480
Mr. Gao, please go on.

896
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,880
We're sponsoring a marathon

897
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,200
to test the waters.

898
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,920
For the future, whether Young Space

899
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,160
will follow Mr. Jie's suggestion

900
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,080
to streamline our production

901
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,840
and focus on these three fields:

902
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
running, basketball, badminton,

903
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,240
or follow Mr. Gao's insistence

904
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,000
to maintain this brand for the masses,

905
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,160
that is still subject to discussion.

906
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,760
I will still say this,

907
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
it all depends on the data,

908
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
the profit sales,

909
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,720
and which of these two departments

910
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,800
can produce more convincing results.

911
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,040
If it weren't for the mannequin incident,

912
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,320
the marathon

913
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,080
could have ended on

914
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,280
the perfect note.

915
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,400
Yet now it feels like

916
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,000
a luxurious banquet spread

917
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,640
with the appearance of a rat.

918
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,960
Everyone feels disgusted

919
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,320
and cannot enjoy the banquet anymore.

920
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,400
Did you hear that just now?

921
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,320
The president asked

922
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,040
for separate proposals.

923
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,680
Gao Li and I

924
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,920
are back on equal footing again.

925
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,680
I'm not having this.

926
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,040
You'an, look into

927
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,680
the mannequin incident

928
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,120
and find out who's behind all that.

929
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Alright, no problem.

930
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,040
I will do so.

931
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,080
The marathon is

932
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
my project,

933
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,520
I will see it through.

934
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,280
What's wrong?

935
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Is there anything else?

936
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Mr. Jie,

937
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,360
you promised me that

938
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,840
should I finish these four years,

939
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,120
I will be transferred to
the marketing department.

940
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,080
Do you remember that?

941
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,760
I mentioned it several times too,

942
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,880
but you were too busy

943
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,960
so,

944
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,240
I've filled out the forms on my own.

945
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,300
(Marketing Department Entry Form
Name - Liang You'an)

946
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,640
Alright, you can leave it there,

947
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,280
I'll sign that later.

948
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,640
Thank you, Mr. Jie.

949
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,960
What's up with your hand?

950
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,200
I'm fine.

951
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,400
Look,

952
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,120
the organizing committee was giving out

953
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,400
commemorative gold coins.

954
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,120
The marketing department got only one.

955
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,040
Mr. Jie wanted it to be given to you.

956
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,720
Oh and,

957
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
there's someone downstairs

958
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,080
who has been waiting for two hours.

959
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,600
Who's that?

960
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,880
I've never seen him.

961
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,800
I have no idea why he's here too.

962
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
He's just extremely good-looking.

963
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,080
Just handsome, that's all.

964
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
You've met him,

965
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,520
yet you didn't bother to pass a message?

966
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,320
Don't worry,

967
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,440
I sat him down at the

968
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,240
coffee bar for you.

969
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,760
I even bought him a coffee with my card.

970
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
You even used your own card?

971
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,520
I guess he really is good-looking.

972
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,720
