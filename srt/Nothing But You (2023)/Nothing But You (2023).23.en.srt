3
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,980
(I'll Use Ten Trophies To Get A Chance
To Be By Your Side.)

4
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:00,383
Since you used the Peachy Peach account

5
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:01,463
to post news that would negatively

6
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:02,663
impact our company's image

7
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,303
and you insist on terminating
your contract,

8
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,503
I'm now here to talk to you
about your termination.

9
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,063
(New Media Internet Celebrity Agency Contract)
According to the contract,

10
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,583
(New Media Internet Celebrity Agency Contract)
you unilaterally proposed termination,

11
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,863
so you need to pay the company

12
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,823
a penalty of three million yuan.

13
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,343
I have no money to do so.

14
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,383
No problem.

15
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,223
I will have to take this to court

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,423
to claim compensation then.

17
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:20,743
It's written clearly in black and white,

18
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:21,463
you are bound by this.

19
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:23,383
What a pity.

20
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:24,463
Your promising life ahead

21
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:26,183
has ended before it even started.

22
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:28,583
Ms. Kiki,

23
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,783
do you have to do this?

24
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:32,623
Is there no room for negotiation?

25
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:33,303
Liang Tao,

26
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,983
as long as you publicly apologize,
admit your mistakes,

27
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:37,783
make whatever content that

28
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:38,463
the company asks you to,

29
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:39,983
and follow their instructions obediently,

30
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:41,743
then I'll let this incident go.

31
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:43,063
Otherwise,

32
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:45,503
get your three million yuan ready.

33
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:12,863
(Liang Tao is terminating her contract.)

34
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,623
(I think the penalty sum will be huge.)

35
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:16,543
(If you really like her,)

36
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:18,023
(you should follow up on that.)

37
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:19,983
(Her phone number is)

38
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:23,543
(185-2958-772.)

39
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:36,743
Hello, who's this?

40
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,303
(It's me, Jiang Jiaojiao.)

41
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:40,263
Were you required to pay three million?

42
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,903
How did you know?

43
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,383
That's not important.

44
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,663
You signed yourself into
such an inhumane contract.

45
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,463
What were you thinking back then?

46
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:49,663
They told me that

47
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,863
this is the industry template.

48
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,183
It's the same for everyone
joining the industry.

49
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,743
I have consulted a lawyer.

50
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,423
They say the chances of winning are slim.

51
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,343
The best solution now

52
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:58,463
is as Ms. Kiki said,

53
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,583
apologize and go back to hosting.

54
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,623
So I thought about it.

55
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:03,663
I'll accept my fate.

56
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:04,703
I signed the contract,

57
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,783
I did those deeds,

58
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,503
I'll go back to obeying their plans.

59
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:08,983
Don't you do that.

60
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:10,143
Give me some time.

61
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,303
I'll get you out of this.

62
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,303
How would you do that?

63
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,383
I know their boss.

64
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:16,783
When they played tennis,

65
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:17,983
my dad introduced me to them.

66
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:20,142
(Alright, don't worry.)

67
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,303
Hello.

68
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,743
Feng,

69
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,343
it's been a while.

70
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:45,663
How did you have the time to call?

71
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:50,583
What?

72
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:55,463
What did Jiang Jiaojiao say?

73
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:58,023
Girlfriend?

74
00:04:58,663 --> 00:04:59,783
I didn't know about that.

75
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,263
No, don't.

76
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:05,663
Don't mind him.

77
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,063
Do what you need to do.

78
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,143
You don't need to save face for me.

79
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:10,263
No,

80
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,183
Feng, really.

81
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:12,703
That...

82
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,183
Look,

83
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,663
I'm so sorry about that.

84
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:20,103
Alright, alright.

85
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,023
That'll do.

86
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,143
This time around,

87
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:23,663
I owe you one.

88
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:24,943
Dinner's on me next time around.

89
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:25,623
All right.

90
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:27,903
Sure.

91
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:28,783
That's it.

92
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:29,783
Bye-bye.

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,100
(Dad)

94
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,060
(Jiang Jiaojiao,)

95
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,420
(you've really grown capable.)

96
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,060
(You dare go around using my name)

97
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,180
(to get favors from others?)

98
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,020
(You really like Miss Host-and-
Internet-Celebrity, right?)

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,540
(Starting this month,)

100
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,380
(your living expenses, your pocket money,)

101
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,620
(I'm not giving you a single cent anymore.)

102
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,420
(If you really are capable,)

103
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,820
(stand on your own feet,)

104
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,100
(and then we'll talk.)

105
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,063
There goes my money.

106
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:21,063
Jiang Jiaojiao,

107
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,303
thank you!

108
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:23,343
They finally gave in.

109
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,503
I just need to pay them
two months' worth of operating costs,

110
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:26,263
a total of just 200,000,

111
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:27,820
and it will all be over, a peaceful termination.

112
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,283
Is that all?

113
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,023
There's an additional clause,

114
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,503
that is I can no longer be a host.

115
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:35,223
Aren't they just sabotaging
your livelihood?

116
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,623
As long as this is resolved,

117
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:39,263
I no longer want to do this anymore too.

118
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:42,103
This industry and its people
are just too complicated.

119
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,143
It's not somewhere that I thought

120
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,463
I can make it on my own.

121
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,423
In short,

122
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:47,943
I am really grateful to you.

123
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:49,943
It's nothing.

124
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,223
That said,

125
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:55,263
do you have money?

126
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:58,743
I'll go back and ask my mom

127
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:00,783
or my dad for some.

128
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:03,623
It's okay.

129
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,543
That's not a lot of money,

130
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:06,863
I'll lend it to you.

131
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,060
(Go Karting)

132
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,103
Can everyone give me a minute?

133
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:24,263
Today, the reason why all of us
didn't have to travel around

134
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,103
was because Liang Tao found this place for us.

135
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:27,383
Please everyone thank her.

136
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:28,023
Applause.

137
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,383
- Thank you, sis.
- Thank you, sis.

138
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:30,823
You're welcome.

139
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:32,503
I heard Jiang Jiaojiao say

140
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:33,743
you guys were kicked out

141
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:34,943
everywhere for training.

142
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,023
I've been to this court
for video shoots before,

143
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,223
and I'm friendly with
the person-in-charge.

144
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:39,023
It's nothing.

145
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:40,583
Go on with your training then.

146
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,543
There's not much time left.

147
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:42,703
Come on, move.

148
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,623
Two more days until the game.

149
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:45,943
Don't slack off.

150
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:47,983
Liang You'an, come here with me.

151
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:53,663
What is it?

152
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,583
If there's something you can't handle,

153
00:07:55,663 --> 00:07:56,943
you can ask for my help next time.

154
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:59,663
You seem to be quite free recently.

155
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:01,423
Did you lose your job?

156
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:03,743
I was the one who fired them.

157
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,703
The heck?

158
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,103
Who is that tennis player?

159
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:09,223
You better come out.

160
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,503
- Mister.
- Was that you?

161
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,343
Mister, mister.

162
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:12,743
I'm sorry, mister.

163
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,503
Calm down.

164
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,023
I'll handle it for you.

165
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:17,943
Go back to your practice.

166
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:18,903
Liang You'an, you should go too.

167
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:20,223
Can you handle it?

168
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,743
This is nothing.

169
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:25,903
Hello, Alex.

170
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:26,463
Just get back to training.

171
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,143
Time is precious.

172
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:27,903
Don't you dare leave.

173
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:29,623
Mister, here.

174
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,503
Take it easy.

175
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,503
Listen to me.

176
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,102
It was our fault.

177
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:35,543
I'll pay you for the loss.

178
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,703
That ball of ice cream,

179
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:37,543
that's ten yuan,

180
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:38,742
I'll give you this tennis ball

181
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:39,623
as a souvenir.

182
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:41,222
Dry cleaning will cost 20,

183
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:41,943
but you can just go back

184
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:42,903
and wash it by hand.

185
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,703
As a gesture of apology,
I will transfer 100 to you.

186
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:45,863
You're not at any loss here.

187
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,823
Fine.

188
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,183
I'll let it slip this time.

189
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,543
Fortunately, no one was hurt,

190
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,343
else it won't be something
that you can solve with money.

191
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,783
I'll go and speak to
the court manager right away.

192
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:56,743
Don't you worry.

193
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,663
I'll let them increase the net height,

194
00:08:58,743 --> 00:08:59,863
so you can rest assured and

195
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,063
have your ice cream here.

196
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,223
There won't be next time.

197
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,223
I got it.

198
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:05,503
Be careful next time.

199
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,343
Guess you didn't actually handle it.

200
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:16,223
The money did all the work.

201
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:17,743
Don't mention it later.

202
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,343
I want to save some face

203
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,543
in front of Liang You'an.

204
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,423
What's the grudge between you two?

205
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,743
We share the same surname.

206
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,823
You're the one who needs help,

207
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,303
why are you still acting tough?

208
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:28,223
You don't understand.

209
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:29,663
I'm here for business.

210
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:32,903
Understood.

211
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:34,303
It's a secret.

212
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,103
I'll keep it confidential.

213
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:42,663
We've known each other for so long,

214
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:43,743
I don't have your WeChat.

215
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:45,223
Should we

216
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:46,543
add each other?

217
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:51,023
Sure, scan me.

218
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:54,663
Approve me.

219
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,983
How much was it just now? I'll pay you.

220
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:14,023
I won't cook today.

221
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,943
Let's eat better food for the game today.

222
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:18,063
You've been practicing,

223
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,543
so you're sure to be fine.

224
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:21,143
Just relax and focus on playing.

225
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,063
Great breakfast makes

226
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,103
sure champions.

227
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:25,863
Thank you, Uncle An.

228
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:31,383
Uncle,

229
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,023
I'll be honest.

230
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:35,423
Your cooking tastes better than this.

231
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:39,143
I really like honest kids like you.

232
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:41,183
There's someone who knows me now.

233
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:42,383
Enjoy the meal.

234
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,223
There's no hurry.
Fill yourself up then we'll go.

235
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:46,143
What time is the game?

236
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:47,663
I'll pay for it today,

237
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:48,823
you two take a taxi.

238
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,223
Don't count me in.

239
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:53,543
I'm not going.

240
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:03,223
It's fine if you don't,

241
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,543
but then you don't deserve meat.

242
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,423
I have sent the proposal over to you.

243
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
(The 5th "Elite Cup" Tennis Club Tour)
Daniel will be coming to

244
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,863
watch the game too.

245
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,103
I will take you to him.

246
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,343
You two can chat for a bit.

247
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,223
I think he is most likely to invest.

248
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:39,663
I've also recently

249
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,063
made some calls for you

250
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,103
to my good friend.

251
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,023
He is in charge of the Champions Fund

252
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,223
youth sports project.

253
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,783
I think he'll be able to help

254
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:50,303
arrange some training venues
for now, free of charge.

255
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:51,943
This is his business card,

256
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,503
you can just go directly to him.

257
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,703
I've always

258
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,303
wanted to get to know this institution.

259
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,783
Thank you, Alex.

260
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,223
You've been helping me so much.

261
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,583
I'm not helping you for free.

262
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,223
I have something to ask of you.

263
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:06,063
What do you want from me?

264
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,623
I'm still observing, however,

265
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:10,623
if you can secure the bulk of your funds,

266
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,143
I'll put in 10% too.

267
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,263
Is this for real?

268
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:15,663
You want to be my patron?

269
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,623
I've read your business proposal,

270
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:18,943
I think it's great.

271
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:20,423
Really.

272
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,423
Only if it's you running the plan,

273
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,263
then I will have faith in it.

274
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,183
It's not much anyway,

275
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:28,503
about the price of a car,

276
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,943
I can still afford it.

277
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,103
So you're using the 10% as bait

278
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:34,503
so that I'll have to boldly go

279
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,223
ask for the remaining 90%.

280
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,463
I'm just trying to perk you up.

281
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,383
I will look out for

282
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,543
your players' performance today.

283
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
I'll tell you privately now,

284
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:43,943
people have been inquiring

285
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,103
about Jiang Jiaojiao.

286
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:47,023
However, I have yet to mention

287
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,543
Song Sanchuan to anyone.

288
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,063
I was thinking that

289
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:51,103
I really wanted to

290
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:52,783
take a good look at your secret weapon.

291
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,223
I'm here to see especially him today.

We'll go and change now.

You can do it!

298

Let's go. We can do it.

Say, this,

301
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:53,223
my wigs are pretty expensive.

302
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:54,223
If you're not up for it,

303
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:55,583
stop cutting it.

304
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,183
Look at these bangs,

305
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,543
what do they look like now?

306
00:13:58,863 --> 00:13:59,383
Don't touch it.

307
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:04,663
Come, come.

308
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:05,663
Come, let me,

309
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,023
let me use those scissors.

310
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,103
What are you doing?

311
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:19,063
I thought you wanted to quit?

312
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:19,823
I'll need those strings.

313
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:20,543
Don't touch my racket.

314
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:21,703
Why shouldn't I?

315
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:22,263
Give me.

316
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:22,783
Let me ask you.

317
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:24,183
We were sitting there that day,

318
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,303
you drank the shot and

319
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:28,260
you said you're playing tennis
for yourself, right?

320
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:28,943
Not for anything else.

321
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,383
You said that, right?

322
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,023
Right?

323
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,023
Come, give it to me.

324
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:35,983
I'm not giving you.

325
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,023
During that time I thought,

326
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:38,063
you practiced so hard.

327
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:38,663

328
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:39,223

are you going to play tennis for yourself or not?

00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:49,983

It's tiring dating such a young one.

361
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:51,063
You get into an argument,
he stops showing up for games.

362

Let me tell you,

363
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:52,383
that day in my courts,

364
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,943
he was the most boisterous one.

365
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:55,423
He's still just a child you see.

366
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:56,783
When things get critical,

367
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:57,903
he's unreliable.

chat about our relationship life
at the side of the road?

00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:07,463

You're not young anymore,

yet your common sense, I feel,

373
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,903
is worse than a child's.

375

I...

376
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:21,863
Please wait up.

377
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:22,623
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,383
We have another player who's coming.

379
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:25,943
It's already nine o'clock.

380
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,663
A no-show means they forfeited the game.

381
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:29,743
Just give us two more minutes, please.

382
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,423
You'll have to come again next year.

383
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:34,103
Rules are rules.

384
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,423
He trained really hard for this,

385
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,983
so he'll definitely come today.

386
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:40,103
He must have run into
some problems on the way,

387
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:40,903
could you wait for just a while more?

388
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:41,863
If he does not show up

389
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:42,503
in the next two minutes,

390
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,303
you can go.

391
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:44,543
Is that okay?

392
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:45,583
Please.

393
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:50,583
Sorry, I am late.

394
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,503
He's here.

395
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:34,503
Come on, Song Sanchuan.

396
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:48,863
Fifteen-love.

397
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:02,223
Well played.

398
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:04,543
Your net moves are very confident.

399
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:05,983
Keep this up for tomorrow.

400
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:07,703
So for tomorrow's match,

401
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:09,183
pay some attention to these problems.

00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:57,343
I believe that Ms. Liang

405
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,703
won't disappoint me on this one.

406
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,303
I wish us a pleasant cooperation.

407
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,983
Thank you so much.

408
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:01,423
Sure.

409
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:02,183
You guys carry on,

410
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:03,223
I'll go around.

411
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:03,823
Right. Have a pleasant one.

412
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:04,103
Thank you.

413
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:04,663
Sure, sure.

414
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,263
I watched Song Sanchuan play for two matches.

415
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:14,023
He really lived up to our expectations of him.

416
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,143
Initially, I thought that

417
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,103
the reconstruction of power chain in tennis

418
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,223
will be his greatest challenge.

419
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:19,543
I did not expect to see

420
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,543
him adapt those previous skills

421
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:21,943
to play net volleys.

422
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:22,783
He's really not bad.

423
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,543
Actually, Coach Yan corrected him a lot.

424
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,303
Yet of course,

425
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:27,823
he worked very hard himself.

426
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:30,143
Honestly,

427
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:32,983
even though the amount of money that
Daniel is willing to invest

428
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,583
was lesser than expected,

429
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,583
but that 10%,

430
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,223
I'm still willing to give it to you.

431
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,063
Thank you.

432
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:40,823
I am really thankful for that.

When we can gather enough start-up funds,

434
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:45,143
we will overcome the hardest part
of this whole project.

435
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,703
I have faith in you.

436
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,343
I'll talk to Daniel again.

437
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:50,783

441
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,023
I found out that every time he serves,

442
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:30,863
he'll walk five steps towards the scoreboard.

443
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:34,223
Is this what you taught them
at the training camp?

444
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,303
That they design their own

445
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:37,103
inter-shot movements on the court

446
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,663
so when they form a conditioned reflex,

447
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:40,303
it'll help them calm down.

448
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,583
You discovered that too.

449
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:43,103
Yes.

450
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:45,663

I'd say,

486
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:21,383
why don't you and your team

487
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:22,623
just stay in my club?

488
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:23,703
It just so happened that

489
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:25,263
no one was managing the commercial side.

you, a lady,

497
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:50,383
have to mingle amongst those men

498
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:50,863
at the club,

499
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:51,903
that must have been difficult.

500
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:53,663
You now also have to beg around,

501
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:54,183
look for sponsorships,

502
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:55,023
why bother?

503
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:56,623
I have the venue, coaches,

504
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:57,703
I have them all now.

505
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,103
You'an, it's your dream to run

506
00:24:59,103 --> 00:24:59,823
an A-ranked club, right?

507
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:01,223
Your players are also well-qualified.

508
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,063
It's alright.

509
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:04,183
These few days I've been

510
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:05,423
giving out my business cards

511
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:07,343
to the media and the investors
who were watching the game.

512
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:08,823
I told them clearly

513
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:09,903
which of those players were mine,

514
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:11,983
and how they were temporarily leased to you.

515
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:13,463
I welcome all of them to

516
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:15,263
invest in my new club in the future.

517
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:22,863
You're that slick, huh?

518
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:24,303
You've crossed the river,

519
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,183
and now you're burning bridges.

520
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:25,903
Would it be better if I took revenge

521
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,263
instead of taking advantage of you?

522
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,183
No, I thought that

523
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:30,783
we got along quite well these few days,

524
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:31,743
and we could finally turn a page.

525
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:33,543
You really put yourself

526
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,063
on a pedestal there.

527
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:36,863
To me,

528
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:38,383
you don't affect me in any single way.

529
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:40,103
After this is over,

530
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,423
our grievances will be settled,

531
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:42,783
no one will owe anyone in the future.

From now on,

533
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:44,943
I don't want to have

534
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:45,943
anything to do with you anymore.

00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:30,783
I'm sorry.

559
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:31,703
I fell asleep.

560
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,503
Why won't you wait in the car?

561
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:35,663
I'm playing games.

562
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,623
Didn't want to wake you up.

563
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:41,423
Your trophy.

564
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:45,383
How fortunate.

565
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,063
I was still sane,

566
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:49,543
and didn't miss the game.

567
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:52,663
I haven't held one for a while.

568
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:54,503
It felt good.

569
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,623
I knew you would come.

570
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,383
I blocked you out of petulance.

571
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,743
I shouldn't have

572
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:07,303
thought of giving up playing.

573
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,783
Man can't think straight when in love.

574
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,863
When I was focused on playing these days,

575
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:17,223
I understand what you meant.

576
00:29:18,343 --> 00:29:19,903
If we don't separate love and work,

577
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:21,223
it's easy

578
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:23,983
to lose both of them.

579
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:27,383
Also,

580
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,423
Coach Yan told me that

581
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:31,583
you're done with your new plans

582
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:33,023
on operating the club.

583
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:36,423
I've managed to find some investors.

584
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:37,143
I believe

585
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,343
the club will reopen very soon.

586
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:41,543
I also heard that

587
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:42,823
the new club will switch to

588
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:44,103
a player contract system.

589
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:48,943
Do you think I am qualified enough

590
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,983
be your first signed player?

591
00:29:55,223 --> 00:29:56,383
You thought it through?

592
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,223
We're about to sign you on,

593
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:04,903
how could you not have
your manager's WeChat?

594
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,023
Right?

595
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,423
Add me.

596
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:13,583
I scan your code.

597
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,743
Song Sanchuan.

598
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:22,223
Liang You'an.

599
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,103
Actually, I wanted to...

600
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:34,223
I wanted to say...

601
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:37,623
It's okay, you go first.

602
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:40,423
Liang You'an.

603
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:43,823
This, my first trophy,

604
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,263
please keep it for me.

605
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:49,383
This ten-year difference between us,

606
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:54,143
I'll make it up with ten trophies,

607
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:57,383
so that I'll get a chance

608
00:30:57,383 --> 00:30:58,623
to be by your side.

609
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,383
Don't worry.

610
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:04,663
I will adjust my mindset

611
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:08,063
to put playing tennis first.

612
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,543
I'm done. It's your turn.

613
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:16,303
What did you want to say just now?

614
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,423
(I am almost 33 years old.)

615
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,063
I've been pretty used to

616
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:28,623
being single.

617
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,303
The routine of my work days,

618
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:33,103
what to do with my off days,

619
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:34,983
to go to which restaurant, what to order,

620
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:35,903
which is more appropriate,

621
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:37,543
what movie to pick,

622
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,623
leave some time for my mom,

623
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:40,663
for you,

624
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:43,303
I have a very clear

625
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:44,943
and well-thought arrangement for that.

626
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:47,383
Song Sanchuan.

627
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:48,783
Twenty-three years old.

628
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:52,943
He has inexhaustible energy.

629
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:54,623
Think about it.

630
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:56,303
This boy dared to switch from

631
00:31:56,303 --> 00:31:58,623
badminton to tennis.

632
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,943
He is a dangerous risk factor

633
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,343
who will destroy all the

634
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:06,783
routine and stability that I am used to in life.

635
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,343
I never felt that age

636
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:09,343
is an obstacle to love,

637
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:10,063
yet the variable factors

638
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:12,383
present in our age differences

639
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,263
are so, so, so many,

640
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:15,343
it makes me scared.

641
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:20,303
I'm afraid of intimacy.

642
00:32:21,143 --> 00:32:22,343
I'm afraid when people

643
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:23,903
form deep bonds with each other

644
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,263
and break up suddenly.

645
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:29,063
I am this older female

646
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:30,983
who has so much fear,

647
00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:34,143
and I meet this young male

648
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,583
that has so many variables.

649
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:42,383
But,

650
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:44,943
when he blocked me

651
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,503
and said he didn't want to play anymore.

652
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:49,743
It was at that moment where

653
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:51,063
I felt really, really scared.

654
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,503
I'm afraid that after the club is gone,

655
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:56,103
I won't see him again.

656
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:00,743
Yes. I have a hundred reasons

657
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:01,783
to say no to him,

658
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:02,943
but there's only one reason

659
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,263
where I can't lie to myself.

660
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:08,143
I'm reluctant to let him go.

661
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:14,383
If I were given a chance

662
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,623
to meet with the true embodiment of love,

663
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,863
if he is not Song Sanchuan,

664
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:21,703
who would that be?

665
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:29,943
Babe,

666
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:32,623
you're brave now.

667
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:34,663
I am brave now.

668
00:33:36,343 --> 00:33:37,103
You're brave.

669
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:42,583
Right.

670
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:44,103
I've decided.

671
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:45,983
Whether he comes or not

672
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,303
for this tournament,

673
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:48,823
I will, in person, face to face,

674
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,303
tell him all that I have just said.

675
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:53,503
I'll tell him.

676
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:05,983
Nothing.

677
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,623
That's the right spirit.

678
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,783
That's totally right.

679
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:14,342
You've said it well.

680
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,783
I hope we have a good time
working together.

681
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:20,422
Mr. Song Sanchuan,

682
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:23,342
I will do my best in becoming your manager.

683
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:25,263
Sure, Ms. Liang.

684
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:03,343
I'm back.

685
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:04,983
I'm starving.

686
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:05,743
Did you save me some food?

687
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:07,823
Someone's in a good mood.

688
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,303
Was it the winning or the reconciliation?

689
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,743
You're good huh.

690
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:13,023
Open up a fortune-telling business then.

691
00:35:14,943 --> 00:35:16,183
Do you know

692
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:18,823
how to retrieve WeChat's chat history?

693
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,463
Someone deleted someone's chat history?

694
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,183
Tell me how to restore it.

695
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:24,343
Next time,

696
00:35:24,463 --> 00:35:25,863
don't be impulsive.

697
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:42,383
This time around,

698
00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:43,983
none of you came to watch me play,

699
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,223
but I won.

700
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:49,583
Guess no one wants this trophy
during property division.

701
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:53,423
Tomorrow,

702
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:55,423
we'll go to the law firm
for notarization.

703
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:58,663
I agree to the divorce.

704
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:02,663
Sure.

705
00:36:03,743 --> 00:36:04,383
Right.

706
00:36:05,423 --> 00:36:06,383
I'm relieved.

707
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:08,263
Adults, you got your divorce,

708
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:09,423
nothing to be sad about.

709
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:10,983
Let's drink.

710
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:18,943
I'll raise a toast to both of you.

711
00:36:47,423 --> 00:36:48,943
The house in Shenzhen,

712
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:50,303
we'll get one each.

713
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:55,623
The house in Beijing,

714
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:59,023
you had the good sense to insist on buying.

715
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,023
I'll leave that to you.

716
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:05,183
This insurance,

717
00:37:06,943 --> 00:37:09,143
you said the stakes of

718
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:11,023
my investment project were too high,

719
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:14,303
we need to have some cash
reserves to be prepared,

720
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,263
just in case.

721
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,943
I've changed the name

722
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:21,183
of the insured to you alone.

723
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,460
(Life Insurance Contract)

724
00:37:31,263 --> 00:37:32,783
The immovable property,

725
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:35,703
all of it is written in there.

726
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:37,023
We'll split it in half.

727
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:39,543
Are you satisfied with

728
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:42,423
how we're doing this?

729
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,180
(Signature of the husband - Jiang Jie)

730
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,700
(Signature of the wife - Chen Ke)

731
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:03,823
Excuse me,

732
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:06,583
I would like to have a private moment.

733
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,143
We signed the papers.

734
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:22,663
Tell me the truth.

735
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:26,823
Were you up to anything with that cook?

736
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:28,623
Right,

737
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:30,703
we've signed the papers,

738
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:33,783
I have no reason to lie to you anymore.

739
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,423
There was nothing.

740
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:46,063
Am I that annoying?

741
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:47,463
You can't bear to live with me.

742
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:51,303
I just felt like

743
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:53,543
I would live better on my own.

744
00:38:54,663 --> 00:38:55,623
It has nothing to do with you.

745
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,023
When are you coming back?

746
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,063
Don't need to think about me.

747
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:15,503
I'm comfortable at my bro's place.

748
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:17,103
You're living with someone else,

749
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,023
and they don't find you troublesome?

750
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:20,183
I am a very charismatic person.

751
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:21,223
I'm off to train.

752
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,543
You're not bringing these?

753
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:00,303
I thought you cherished them a lot.

754
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:01,863
If you find them taking up space,

755
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:02,983
just throw them away.

756
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:04,783
They have been there for too long,

757
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:05,863
I'm tired of them.

758
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,503
Jiang Jiaojiao.

759
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,303
Hello.

760
00:41:21,663 --> 00:41:22,623
Ms. Chen.

761
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:27,143
What brings you here?

762
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:31,383
You all were playing at these sorts of venues?

763
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,583
The new club is short of money,

764
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:35,703
so we can only afford to
rent these temporarily.

765
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:37,663
We're often moving from place to place.

766
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:38,983
This place still looks decent.

767
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:42,383
I have never seen

768
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:44,423
Jiang Jiaojiao pick up balls for others.

769
00:41:44,743 --> 00:41:46,783
Don't you think he is becoming quite decent?

770
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,063
He is not bad now.

771
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,743
I have finished going through
the divorce with Jiang Jie.

772
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:56,743
We knew.

773
00:41:57,063 --> 00:41:59,183
Jiang Jiaojiao treated us to a meal.

774
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,623
May I ask a question?

775
00:42:03,263 --> 00:42:05,023
I really want to know

776
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,063
the real reason you divorced Jiang Jie.

777
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,743
You'll understand when you experience it.

778
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:17,303
Sometimes,

779
00:42:17,623 --> 00:42:19,583
everything trumps love.

780
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:23,743
But sometimes I feel

781
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,783
love can conquer everything.

782
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,143
First of all,

783
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:32,943
you have to meet the right person.

784
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:35,783
At least I feel

785
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:39,423
Jiang Jie did alright in handling the divorce.

786
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,543
The property was divided

787
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,743
pretty fairly and equally.

788
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:47,623
One day, Jiao asked me

789
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:49,463
who will be paying

790
00:42:50,383 --> 00:42:51,743
for his training fee from now on?

791
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:54,063
I thought about it.

792
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:55,783
The house in Beijing

793
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:57,623
has no use to me.

794
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:58,543
I'm going to sell it

795
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,583
and pay for his tuition lump sum.

796
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:03,223
What does that mean?

797
00:43:03,903 --> 00:43:05,503
I thought you were looking for

798
00:43:05,503 --> 00:43:06,703
the club's biggest shareholder?

799
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:09,303
I can do that.
