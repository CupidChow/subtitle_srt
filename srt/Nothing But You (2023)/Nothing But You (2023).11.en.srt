=Nothing But You=

2
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,420
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:56,380
(If...Let's Go On A Date!)

4
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
Did you manage to ask about the coach?

5
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,160
I wasn't going to help you

6
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,720
initially.

7
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,160
But, I've heard that

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
you managed to get Song Sanchuan

9
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,440
to join your tennis club.

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,240
Yes.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,640
He's playing tennis now.

12
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
It's a fresh start for him.

13
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,560
I remember you asked me

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
if the talent hiding in the badminton team

15
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,240
was Song Sanchuan.

16
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,560
In my opinion,

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
nine out of ten people

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,000
will think highly of

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,760
Jin Yi.

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
I'm just curious about

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
how you made your judgement.

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Of course, I'm not

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
as professional as you are.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
It's all based on

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
the data from their games

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,960
and a little bit of intuition.

27
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
You're being humble.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Jiang Jie said

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
when you were in Young Space,

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
you were always right about the players.

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,040
If I must say,

32
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
I think perhaps

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,040
I like smart people who do dumb things.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,440
Most people

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,400
have a misconception

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,600
about athletes

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
thinking they're just all brawns

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,120
and simple-minded.

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
But I found that

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
many of the top athletes

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,680
in each sports category

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,400
are actually

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,640
very intelligent.

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,160
Of course,

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
training is tough,

46
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,960
repetitive

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,280
and there's no easy way out.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,040
A smart person
who's willing to go through it

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,080
is like

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
the talented and hardworking people

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,280
who are hard to find.

52
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
Jin Yi is very smart

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,320
but I just had a feeling that

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
he depended too much

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,160
on his wits

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,160
in court.

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,760
Unlike Song Sanchuan,

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
he's simple, persistent,

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
and determined too.

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,640
Liang You'an...

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,360
Do your best with the tennis club.

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,920
Don't try to be in my way.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,320
You finally admit it.

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,400
When I asked you

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,240
if Song Sanchuan was

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,000
the underdog,

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
you confidently told me

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,200
that he was not.

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
We weren't that close yet at that time.

70
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,180
I think

71
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,660
Song Sanchuan

72
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,340
is like a crippling horse.

73
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,140
No one would

74
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,540
place their bets on him
with their entire career

75
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,740
that he would come back again.

76
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,700
At this moment,

77
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,460
I will still be telling you

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,260
that your chance for this

79
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,980
wild dream is slim.

80
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,980
It's the horse that is good.

81
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,220
Show me the coaches.

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,460
Zhang Yan.

83
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,900
He had an argument with
the previous tennis club.

84
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,620
(Personal Resume)
One of the top ten

85
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,460
tennis coaches in the country.

86
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,260
He has always been in Beijing.

87
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,460
If you can get him to Shenzhen,

88
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,140
I believe it can
attract many people here

89
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,020
with his name.

90
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,980
Coach Wang is only hired for

91
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,100
400,000 yuan.

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,180
He...

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,740
(Expected salary: 1 million yuan)
He wants a million yuan.

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,340
If you are looking for someone

95
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,100
of Wang's standard,

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,420
you won't be coming to me, right?

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,440
(Expected salary: 1 million yuan)

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,180
You've been working here

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,020
for a month.

100
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,700
I'm happy

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
with your performance,

102
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
especially the incident

103
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,860
with the wig.

104
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,700
Everyone praised you

105
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,340
saying young people are imaginative.

106
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,860
I believe it's not a big issue

107
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,140
for you to become a permanent employee.

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,220
What about you?

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,220
How do you feel

110
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,420
about working here?

111
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,500
Ever since I graduated,

112
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,900
this is my first

113
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,340
nine-to-six job

114
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,860
that I've worked for so long.

115
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,660
Always taking the same route
to and back from the office

116
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,820
to calculate the transport
and meal allowances...

117
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,540
When I arrive,

118
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,980
the repetitive tasks will await me.

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
Although it's only been a month

120
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,420
since I've known everyone,

121
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,980
I'm seeing everyone

122
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,180
more than I see most of my relatives

123
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,740
in my life

124
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,300
because we meet every day.

125
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,180
The feeling I get

126
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,420
from this job

127
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
is consistency.

128
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,900
Doesn't that mean stability?

129
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,660
For a girl,

130
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,420
doesn't stability mean security?

131
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
No.

132
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,180
The sense of security does not

133
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,100
come from stability.

134
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Nothing is constant

135
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,700
in this world

136
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,100
except for one thing.

137
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,820
Except for change itself?

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,060
Except for money.

139
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,940
Ms. Chloe. Listen.

140
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm only earning

141
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,060
5,000 yuan a month.

142
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,340
Following my career progression,

143
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,820
becoming a manager

144
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,180
will probably get me a salary of

145
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,980
less than 20,000 yuan a month.

146
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,780
Why should I be working hard here?

147
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,180
No, Liang Tao.

148
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,900
What do you mean?

149
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,820
Are you saying you're leaving?

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,860
Yes. I want to resign.

151
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,380
This job is not fun.

152
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,380
Why are you here?

153
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
I thought I should let you know that

154
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,020
I've resigned.

155
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,420
Yes.

156
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,060
I'm very sorry.

157
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,900
I know.

158
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,540
Chloe, I didn't expect her

159
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,660
to be so unreliable.

160
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,620
Don't worry.

161
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,620
I won't recommend someone like this

162
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,460
to you anymore.

163
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,420
Sorry for causing trouble.

164
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
Sorry.

165
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,700
Dinner's on me the next time.

166
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,220
The wine that you said was good,

167
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,460
I'll send you a box of it.

168
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,380
You'an. You shouldn't buy her wine.

169
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,580
Okay. That's all. Get back to work.

170
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,940
All right. Sorry for disturbing you. Bye.

171
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,100
I don't like this job.

172
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
It's so boring.

173
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,300
Staying here for the past month,

174
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,780
has enlightened me.

175
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,980
The company benefits

176
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,420
that are great to the people

177
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,060
like free breakfast and dinner,

178
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,300
overtime claims, car allowances,

179
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,020
company facilities,

180
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,860
even manicure services,

181
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,180
do not belong to you.

182
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,940
They're just tools
to make you stay in the company.

183
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,260
It's best if you stay there for 24 hours

184
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,180
without leaving.

185
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm sure you know that

186
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,420
I had to come up with menus at my job.

187
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,500
The company's expectation

188
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,300
for the canteen's supplier

189
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,380
is not just free breakfast and dinner.

190
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,380
It also has to be abundant and rich

191
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,620
to attract people.

192
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,540
That way, people would

193
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,300
come to work early for breakfast

194
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,940
and stay overtime for dinner.

195
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,980
Unconsciously, you give more time

196
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,020
to the company

197
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,540
thinking you've taken advantage.

198
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,340
In a big company like this,

199
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,500
I feel small

200
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,500
just walking in the company.

201
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,380
I also have to spend a few years

202
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,580
to exceed your level.

203
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I can't stand it.

204
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,300
Moreover,

205
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,580
seeing their cold attitudes to you
after you left,

206
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,220
I don't think

207
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,340
you had any success.

208
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,420
All right. I'm not the successful one here.

209
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,700
Come on. Let me hear

210
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,020
your perfect plan.

211
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,980
Of course, I'm going to play

212
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,380
to my strengths

213
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,620
to achieve success in a short time.

214
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,660
The 30,000 yuan you transferred
to me the other day,

215
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,220
I gave it to

216
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,980
an influencer-making company

217
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,620
as training fee.

218
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm now a contracted live streamer.

219
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,820
I beg you.

220
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,420
Do you know how many

221
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,060
influencer-making companies

222
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,420
are frauds.

223
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,060
It's not about the money.

224
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,980
But don't be fooled

225
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,660
into some direct-selling company

226
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,260
causing trouble to other people.

227
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,500
You're humiliating

228
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,700
my intelligence.

229
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,530
When I become a live streamer

230
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,740
who earns an annual salary
with only one show,

231
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,580
I'll pay you back

232
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,940
ten times your 30,000 yuan.

233
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,220
Don't. There's no hurry.

234
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,540
Don't bother me anymore.

235
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,260
When you go back,

236
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,420
tell Liang Shu

237
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,740
you're the one who resigned.

238
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,730
Don't come to me asking for it anymore.

239
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm meeting someone else.

240
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,060
Please go back.

241
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,700
Here.

242
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,260
Go. Hurry.

243
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,260
I just came back from a business trip

244
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,420
and you're asking me to leave?

245
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,210
I even bought your favourite

246
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,380
from downstairs.

247
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,820
Here.

248
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,380
Thanks, Buddy.

249
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,260
Did you see that?

250
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm meeting someone. See that?

251
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,980
Go.

252
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,460
Nian. Got to go.

253
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,180
You lost weight again.

254
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,180
Really?

255
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,700
Come here often.

256
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,380
Sure.

257
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,020
She should go to your house instead.

258
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,540
This tastes amazing.

259
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,820
Food is the only solution to all sorrows.

260
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,700
As well as my sister with different surname.

261
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,060
Of course.

262
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,260
I think it's good

263
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,980
that she resigned on her own accord.

264
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,580
At least

265
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,140
there won't be any other problems
for you in the future.

266
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,220
Tell me why I'm feeling this way.

267
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,980
I think Liang Tao's idea

268
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,300
isn't too bad.

269
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,140
The benefits don't belong to you,

270
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,540
it's just a tool
to sell yourself to the company.

271
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,780
Working hard and giving your time.

272
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,500
What's worse is
that she understands this

273
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,700
at the age of 20.

274
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,380
Don't listen to her.

275
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,860
Her idea

276
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,940
sounds fresh

277
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,940
but she is not

278
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,220
someone reliable.

279
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,980
If she can achieve anything

280
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,740
then she is not

281
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,820
Liang Shu's daughter.

282
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
She got all the bragging
from her mother.

283
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,620
Don't say that. Even though she was

284
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,220
all talk,

285
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,500
there's something there

286
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,940
that gave me some courage.

287
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,940
Forget about

288
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,740
how I came into the club

289
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,980
by chance,

290
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,340
but I did manage to get out of the cage.

291
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,580
I'm still a nobody
no matter how big Young Space gets.

292
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,020
No matter how small the court is...

293
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,420
If only I could

294
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,620
make a champion out of this,

295
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,940
don't you think I'll be great?

296
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,300
Don't forget.

297
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,540
You're also Liang Shu's daughter.

298
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,740
I think this is

299
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,060
the curse of genetics.

300
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,650
(Young Space Tennis Club)

301
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,940
Let's eat here tonight.

302
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,060
Is it far?

303
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,140
No. It's nearby.

304
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,820
Sure.

305
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,780
Sanchuan.

306
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,180
Don't go for training.

307
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,500
Since we're all here today,

308
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,340
I'll take you all for a drink tonight.

309
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,780
How's that?

310
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,260
I...

311
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,060
Jiao. Don't go.

312
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,220
Let's go for a drink together.

313
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,180
Go without me.

314
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,100
I'm not going.

315
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,540
You're being

316
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,500
petty now.

317
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
Sanchuan is cool about it.

318
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,980
Besides, tonight is prepared

319
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,460
for the two of you

320
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,660
so both of you can break the ice.

321
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,020
Just do me a favour,

322
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,660
all right?

323
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,020
All of you acknowledge him

324
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,740
because you don't take tennis
seriously enough.

325
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,140
You're willing to coach anyone.

326
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,900
It doesn't work for me.

327
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,220
Unless he beats me after three months.

328
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,500
I'll toast to him then.

329
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,580
No. That's...

330
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,540
Are we still going then?

331
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,050
It's fine. Go without me.

332
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,900
I am going to train tonight anyway.

333
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Now...

334
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,020
It's fine. Dinner is on me. Let's eat.

335
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,020
Sure.

(Outdoor Tennis Courts)

337
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,500
You're ignoring me, right?

338
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,140
This must be you.

339
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,820
Liang You'an quit

340
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,460
because of this game, right?

341
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,660
Watch what you say.

342
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,340
This is not her fault.

343
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,140
I know.

344
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,660
She was covering for my father.

345
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,180

346
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,980

my father.

348
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,020
Sorry for not recognising you.

349
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,740
Turns out

350
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,460
you're the crown prince of the club.

351
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,460
Shut up.

352
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,380
I hate it when people say that.

353
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,980
If you don't like it, don't say it.

354
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,380
My father said

355
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,820
Liang You'an leaving Young Space

356
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,340
was pre-planned.

357
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,020
Looking at this game,

358
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,700
you're considered an accomplice.

359
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,850
Now that she's here

360
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,340
to take over the tennis team...

361
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,900
Is this the job that she promised you?

362
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,140
Promised what?

363
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,460
A job.

364
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,740
Do you mean this?

365
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,700
Promised me a handyman's job?

366
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
What is this?

367
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,380
A noble job?

368
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,660
Why are you here then?

369
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,740
Don't try to judge others

370
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,780

371
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,540
little brain of yours

372
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,660
and try to think ill of everyone else.

373
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,620
All right, Crown Prince?

374
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,340
No.

375
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,620
Are you thinking

376
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,180
that you've discovered

377
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,580
some top secret?

378
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,620
Let me tell you this. I am

379
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,380
here to work

380
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,380
and play tennis.

381
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,900
Not bad.

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,940
It seems like tennis
is not something tough

383
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,220
for you.

384
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,900
As long as

385
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,060
you mean to do it,

386
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,180
nothing is too difficult.

387
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,420
By the way, I have something to ask you.

388
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,820
I promised you to join the tennis club

389
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,980
not just because

390
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,620
I was listening to your advice

391
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,900
to change my career path

392
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,820
but also

393
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,940
partly because of my selfish intention.

394
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,620
It's because

395
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,220
I defeated Jin Yi

396
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,700
and made you lose your job.

397
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,700
I know.

398
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,820
It has nothing much to do with me

399
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,020
but I still feel

400
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,100
like I owe you something.

401
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,060
I only found out today

402
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,340
that leaving the job
was a part of your plan.

403
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,220
So, leaving the company

404
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,860
was pre-planned?

405
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,540
Yes.

406
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,620
I planned to leave a long time ago.

407
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
If you feel

408
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,980
guilty about this.

409
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,180
You don't have to do it.

410
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,860
This incident

411
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,740
affects you only

412
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,860
because you're strong enough

413
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,020
to win against Jin Yi.

414
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,220
So giving me the racquet

415
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,820
and encouraging me to train

416
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,540
is just the first step
of this trap you set.

417
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,100
Is that so?

418
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,820
How it turned out today

419
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,340
is not

420
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,140
what I initially expected.

421
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,660
Since it has come to this,

422
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,140
I have nothing much to say.

423
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,660
If you feel that I've used you,

424
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm sorry.

425
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,340
You do have a lot

426
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,580
up your sleeves, You'an.

427
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,780
But it's fine.

428
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,180
You played me like a chess piece before.

429
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,780
In three months,

430
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,540
I'll make you

431
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,540
call me a man.

432
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,620
If I made it

433
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,780
in three months,

434
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,140
I want to raise the bet.

435
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,660
What bet?

436
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,740
If I can transition successfully
from badminton to tennis

437
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,980
and stay in the team,

438
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
we'll go on a date.

439
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
A date?

440
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,620
A date.

441
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,580
It's just

442
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,460
having a meal, going to the movies

443
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,620
and playing some games.

444
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,420
Anything will do.

445
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Just for one day.

446
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,380

Get up.

465
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,060
It's my turn.

466
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,180
Take a break.

467
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,780
Take a break.

Don't you want to drink some water?

472
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,620
Again.

473
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,220
Play. Here.

474
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,060
Hurry up, Mr. Wang.

475
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Aren't you tired?

476
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,460
Not thirsty?

477
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,540
Again.

478
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,300
Coach Wang.

479
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,260
Come here for a while.

480
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,980
Coming.

481
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,620
Go.

482
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,860
Here. Take my place.

483
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,820
Coming.

484
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,940
Are you all right?

485
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,980
I'm fine.

486
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,660
What is it?

487
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
I noticed that everyone

488
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,820
has been training hard lately.

489
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,980
Yes.

490
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,980
Jiao

491
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,860
is thinking about

492
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,180
defeating Song Sanchuan every day.

493
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,580
Chen Zhe and Dai Yi

494
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,780
are making time for training

495
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,220
on their own too.

496
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
Bringing Song Sanchuan here

497
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,380
is a good idea.

498
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,500
You shouldn't celebrate too early.

499
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Badminton uses
the movement of the wrist.

500
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,340
For tennis, the wrist has to be locked.

501
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,980
The power chain is different

502
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,060
for both sports.

503
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,260
If he can transition,

504
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,100
he'd have an advantage

505
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,580
over the others.

506
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,620
If he can't

507
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,700
his wrist will be gone

508
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,060
in no time.

509
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,740
You have definitely

510
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,980
turned the club

511
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
around.

512
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,340
It's great.

513
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,860
I won't be

514
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,580
coming along.

515
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,980
What do you mean?

516
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,740
You should look for a new coach.

517
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,860
I can't do it anymore.

518
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,180
All right. I understand.

519
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,220
You didn't even try to ask me to stay.

520
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,540
Not even trying to be nice?

521
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,140
Have you been waiting

522
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,540
for me to say this?

523
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Coach Wang.

524
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,260
Let me tell you the truth.

525
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,860
I gave you time

526
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,220
to get used to

527
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,220
the pace of the club.

528
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,740
But it's evident

529
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,540
that we're not adjusting well to it.

530
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,500
In the long run,

531
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
we'll only get more uncomfortable.

532
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,660
Honestly,

533
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
I have been thinking about

534
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,580
the candidate for the new coach.

535
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,980
If the club

536
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,380
wants to do well,

537
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,260
it requires everyone

538
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,660
to work harder.

539
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,660
You...

540
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,580
None of the previous managers

541
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,340
was as ambitious as you are.

542
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,900
I was comfortably

543
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,380
hanging around here for so many years.

544
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,100
A good retirement club

545
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,580
has become a military training ground

546
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,300
because of you.

547
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,780
I'll leave it to the young people.

548
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,740
I can't do it anymore.

549
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
I quit.

550
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,620
Coach Wang.

551
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,700
I have to thank you.

552
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,100
You've worked hard.

553
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,100
It's better to skip the polite words.

554
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,260
Goodbye.

555
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,140
Goodbye.

556
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,340
With the high intensity
that you're training at,

557
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,060
you have to be careful
not to injure yourself.

558
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,100
It's fine.

559
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,100
I know I won't be on par with anyone

560
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,940
in three months.

561
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,300
But at least

562
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,460
we have the same skin tone.

563
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,980
How is it?

564
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,100
Are you confident about staying now?

565
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,660
To be honest,

566
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,980
I don't really know.

567
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,340
I just want to get to the club

568
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,180
every day when I wake up

569
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,740
hoping to become better

570
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,780
than yesterday

571
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,740
to learn a few more

572
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,660
technical moves.

573
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
The feeling

574
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,700
of getting better every day

575
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,100
is addictive.

576
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,020
Getting better every day.

577
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,500
Many people

578
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,100
will be envious of that.

579
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,300
I do like

580
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,180
playing on an outdoor court.

581
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,740
Did you know? Coach Wang used to say

582
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,140
that tennis

583
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,220
is a romantic sport.

584
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,740
It's closely related to the four seasons

585
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,980
and the changes in the weather.

586
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,780
The same open stance forehand

587
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,500
has a different temperature
during summer and autumn.

588
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
The sunlight in the morning
and evening is different.

589
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,620
The speed of the wind is different too.

590
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,620
So every stroke

591
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,780
is one of its own.

592
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,060
It sounds right.

593
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,140
I've never

594
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,420
thought about it this way.

595
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
I wasn't expecting something so romantic

596
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,100
to come from Coach Wang.

597
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
After hearing from him,

598
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,660
I cherish every stroke

599
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,260
that I play.

600
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,340
Coach Wang has just

601
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,500
tendered his resignation.

602
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,660
Why?

603
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,820
Lately, I have been considering

604
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,060
a change of coach.

605
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,820
If I don't want the team

606
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,980
to be weak,

607
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,460
I can't have

608
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,100
a coach

609
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,220
who is weak too.

610
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,740
It's true. I don't know

611
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,980
if the corporate management style I have

612
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,580
is suitable for this club

613
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,620
but I know

614
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,460
that if the club

615
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,300
is not working hard,

616
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,620
it will never get better.

617
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,820
Coach Wang's techniques and styles

618
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,300
are obsolete.

619
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,740
We will never

620
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,100
move forward

621
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,020
if we stayed the same.

622
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,820
I understand.

623
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,180
I support your decision.

624
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,100
It's true.

625
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,900
What?

626
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,860
Wang. Is this a joke?

627
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,860
The one who caused the club

628
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,580
to be in such a chaos

629
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,700
is Liang You'an.

630
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,300
She should be the one to leave.

631
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,140
You're...

632
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
No, Jiao.

633
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,220
Since last year,

634
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,300
I've been feeling

635
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,940
that my body
is not like how it used to be.

636
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,420
I've been considering retirement.

637
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,980
This is just the right time to do it.

638
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,260
I don't care.

639
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,540
I learned tennis from you.

640
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,980
If you can't do it anymore,

641
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,980
just stay here for your retirement.

642
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,300
I'll see if anyone

643
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,020
has anything to say.

644
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,380
You're talking big now.

645
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,860
You kept stopping others

646
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,020
from calling you

647
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,100
the Crown Prince of the club

648
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,300
but you keep telling people about it.

649
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,900
You need to change.

650
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,700
You said it yourself.
You're not as strong as you were.

651
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,140
You're 50 years old now.

652
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Where are you going to find another job?

653
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,900
You don't have to worry about it.

654
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,660
I have my retirement funds

655
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
and my salary.

656
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,940
I can survive.

657
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,700
Besides,

658
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,460
I should enjoy life

659
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,500
when I'm not too old yet.

660
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,900
Don't you think so?

661
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,900
On the other hand,

662
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,100
I'm worried about you.

663
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,500
Let me tell you this.

664
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,900
Liang You'an

665
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,820
is different from

666
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,780
the previous managers.

667
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,420
You have to do your best.

668
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,100
You might achieve something.

669
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Don't think about it.

670
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,100
This...

671
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,740
She only joined the club for a month

672
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,740
and she has kicked you out of the place.

673
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,260
She's not going to have it easy here.

674
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,140
You...

675
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,820
You...

676
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,260
Why can't you

677
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,580
understand?

678
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,940
This has nothing to do with her.

679
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,220
It's about me.

680
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,620
It's me.

681
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,420
That's...

682
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Let it go.

683
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,580
This...

684
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,700
Go. To the back.

685
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,540
Let me play one last round with you.

686
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,100
Wang Guochao.

687
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,660
Are you going to just leave me

688
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,340
and our club like this?

689
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,900
I won't let you have it easy.

690
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,780
Don't make me break you.

691
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,940
Who turned off the lights?

692
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,500
It's already 10 p.m.

693
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,820
Ms. Liang said

694
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,420
we should save electricity.

695
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,900
Song Sanchuan! Wait there!

696
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,620
I'm waiting for you.

697
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,380
I'll lock the door after you leave.

698
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,380
(Peachy Peach)

699
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,980
The number of your followers

700
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,380
is 4,800.

701
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,380
To be honest, it's too little.

702
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,540
The video with the most likes

703
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,420
is this unboxing video.

704
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,780
Next is

705
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,100
the birthday party of the little prince.

706
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,980
Stand up. Let me take a good look.

707
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,700
Sit down.

708
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,050
I think you have

709
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,140
a decent overall image.

710
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
You can try

711
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,740
being a lifestyle influencer,

712
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,940
not the luxurious type,

713
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,100
but you do have a certain expectation

714
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,380
of the standard of living.

715
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,980
Do your best.

716
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,580
You can work on
selling goods with this setting.

717
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,620
Sure. Ms. Kiki.

718
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,940
As long as you can sign me,

719
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,940
I'll trust your arrangements.

720
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,300
With your current follower count,

721
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,340
you can only

722
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,500
be in the first stage of incubation.

723
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,380
How about this?

724
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,900
Let's sign for a month.

725
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,380
If you can reach

726
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,260
10,000 followers

727
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,220
in a month,

728
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,580
we'll sign a long-term contract.

729
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,260
You don't have to worry

730
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,020
about content

731
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,900
I'll send you the collection,

732
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,900
just follow them.

733
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,260
No problem.

734
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,980
I've attended

735
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,460
videography and editing classes.

736
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,540
I know the basics.

737
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,780
These are some new clothes
prepared for you.

738
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,780
There are different styles here.

739
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,500
Try them on.

740
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Take a look around here
when you have the time.

741
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,300
Since you've decided

742
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,140
to take this path,

743
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,860
your image, persona

744
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,580
and taste

745
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,460
is part of your character set.

746
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,980
This is the most direct communication

747
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,900
between you and your fans.

748
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,100
Sure. No problem.

749
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,300
I'm the best at shopping.

750
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,900
Many people think that influencers

751
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,340
are living the easiest life.

752
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,580
The money comes so quickly.

753
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,820
But they don't know

754
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,620
the creativity, competition

755
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,380
skills, and pressure in this industry

756
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,220
is no better than the other industries.

757
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,580
All right.

758
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,700
I will do my best.

759
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,100
Take a seat.

760
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,060
I'm going to ask you

761
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,260
a serious question.

762
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,540
You have to answer me seriously.

763
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,820
Do you have any dark secrets?

If you do,

765
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,380
better let me know now.

766
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,340
Because the character set

767
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,380
for your account

768
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,300
will be jeopardized by a bad image.

769
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Nothing like that.

770
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,580
I've never done anything

771
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,580
against the law

772
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,500
or against morality.

773
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,860
As someone who isn't on the top yet,

774
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,060
you have to watch your behaviour.

775
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,860
Otherwise, a tiny little mistake

776
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,540
can cost you everything.

777
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,620
What if,

778
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,860
for example,

779
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,620
there are a couple of anti-fans?

780
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,820
Could that be alarming?

781
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,900
It depends on how bad they are

782
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,780
and how much information
they have about you.

783
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,940
What's wrong? Do you have any?

784
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
No. Not at all.

785
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,060
I was just asking.

786
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,020

789
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,260

790
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,300
The coach isn't around anymore.
Why should I train?

791
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,380
Do you think I'm like Song Sanchuan

792
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,620
who can even learn from you?

793
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,060
Why are you throwing a fit now?

794
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,700

800

that you're too tired.)

806
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,780

She'll surely find someone

even better than Wang.

815

No way.

Relax slowly. Relax.

Control your breathing.

introducing our club

00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,380
I'll be there.

948
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,220
You won't be at a disadvantage.

949
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,540
I must have done something bad
in my past life

950
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,140
to be sent here.

951
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,100
(Liang You'an. I left my house late.)

952
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,340
(I'll be late for sure.)

953
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,260
(Go in first. I'll find you later.)

954
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,780
To a successful collaboration.

955
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,260
It's been a long time.

956
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,300
It's been some time.

957
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,380
It's been a long time.

958
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,860
Sure.

959
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,700
Please carry on.

960
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,860
David.

961
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,540
Mr. Liu.

962
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,380
Over here.

963
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,780
That must be Liang You'an.

964
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,820
Why are you here?

965
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,180
Getting a budget for the club.

966
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,980
I came to say hello.

967
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,620
If you wanted money,
you can get it in the office.

968
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Why are you here?

969
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,570
Don't feel bad.

970
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,940
I didn't come here because of you today.

971
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,140
Isn't Mr. Gao here?

972
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,100
For such a small matter,

973
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,140
do you need to go to the president?

974
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,260
Why don't you

975
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,020
look at my proposal?

976
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,700
Mr. Jie,

977
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,740
today is

978
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,340
the company's fiscal year meeting.

979
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,900
The only day in the year

980
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,460
when everyone can talk about money.

981
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,700
If you want to stay out of the rumours,

982
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,140
you can ignore me.

983
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,140
All right. Go to your seat then.

984
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,660
Right here,

985
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,020
I want to thank Mr. Gao.

986
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,260
The change to
the office space arrangement

987
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,780
is every department's
responsibility to bear.

988
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,180
Many departments don't understand

989
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
the expenses of office space.

990
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,100
Where are you?

991
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,540
(Liang You'an)
But President Gao supported us.

992
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,900
In the new year,

993
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,500
the administration department
will do our best

994
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,980
for everyone!

995
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,580
That's enough. It's good.

996
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,220
The administration department

997
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,300
has struggled this year.

998
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,460
We're aware of that.

999
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,940
On this occasion,

1000
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,180
let's relax.

1001
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,460
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

1002
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,420
Which department

1003
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,540
is speaking next?

1004
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,900
Did I see

1005
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,060
Liang You'an just now?

1006
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,700
Liang You'an.

1007
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,940
Are you here?

1008
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,940
Why is Liang You'an here?

1009
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,580
She couldn't find a job.

1010
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,180
I gave a chance to young people.

1011
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,060
That's good.

1012
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,460
That's good.

1013
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,340
Mr. Gao.

1014
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,180
You're back?

1015
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,100
Mr. Jie.

1016
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,580
Liang You'an.

1017
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,980
Didn't you leave the company?

1018
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,700
Yes.

1019
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,740
I'm now the manager of the tennis club

1020
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,340
of Young Space.

1021
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm here today

1022
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,780
to apply for funding.

1023
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,940
Apply for funding?

1024
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,100
I see that you brought your glass here.

1025
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,140
Drink to show your sincerity.

1026
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,380
I'll drink three glasses

1027
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,860
