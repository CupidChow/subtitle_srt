00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,250
=Nothing But You=

2
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,580
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,980
(Stubborn... That Are You?)

4
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,225
Ms. Luo. Please take a look.

5
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,505
Would it look better
to display them like this?

6
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,020
(REC)

7
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,585
It does look better like this.

8
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:14,225
I thought so too.

9
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:16,705
Then we'll rearrange the blue ones.

10
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,625
You're quite attentive.

11
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,145
Ms. Liang said

12
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:24,625
these energy drinks can be
the club's selling point.

13
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:27,825
So it's better to set these up properly.

14
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,745
Okay, you can take them
in this arrangement.

15
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,345
You know I'm rooting for you, right?

16
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:41,465
Do you mean tennis?

17
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,825
I'm talking about entering
Liang You'an's heart.

18
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:50,545
She and I have been friends
for many years.

19
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,025
Her previous experiences

20
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,385
turned her into someone

21
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,385
who always does the right thing.

22
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:57,825
I feel sorry for her.

23
00:02:57,985 --> 00:02:59,105
But she wouldn't listen to me.

24
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,425
But since she came to this club

25
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,025
half year ago,

26
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,305
I can see she's happier now.

27
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:07,425
So do your best, kid.

28
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,465
She'll definitely open her heart

29
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:10,825
one day.

30
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,985
So you already knew

31
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:16,985
that I like her.

32
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,985
In any case, I've got your back.

33
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:24,945
Okay.

34
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:26,345
I'll do my best.

35
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,770
(Liang Tao)

36
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:37,745
What is it?

37
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:38,545
Is anyone training

38
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:39,745
at your club today?

39
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,185
I want to shoot some footage there.

40
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,345
You want to shoot some footage
at my club?

41
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,625
You sure are good

42
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:47,345
at getting a free space to shoot.

43
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:48,385
I'm also helping

44
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,665
to promote your club for free.

45
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:50,905
I guarantee

46
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,345
to feature your club's sign

47
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,225
in close-up shots

48
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:54,505
and give a shout-out for your support

49
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:55,705
in providing the court
in the post-credits.

50
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:56,265
So what do you say?

51
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:58,545
How many views

52
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:59,825
does your channel have now?

53
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:00,945
The number of people

54
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:01,745
who have liked

55
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,865
and pre-registered
for the live stream

56
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,345
has already surpassed
my account's record high.

57
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,425
It's definitely

58
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,105
a profitable deal for you.

59
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:08,385
Besides,

60
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,065
I can come

61
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:10,385
when no one's training

62
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:11,825
and recruit another member for you.

63
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:12,785
So I'm not using
the court for free either.

64
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:15,105
All right.

65
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,264
I'll see you in an hour.

66
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:25,905
We'll have an extra practice later.

67
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:27,105
You two will be on a team,

68
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,945
and whoever loses treats
the other to an ice-cream.

69
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,425
- No problem.
- Sure.

70
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,865
How charming.

71
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,985
Your muscle definition looks amazing.

72
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:39,865
Is our court that popular

73
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,585
for couples to check in?

74
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:42,545
Tao,

75
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,745
film me from the perspective
of a girlfriend.

76
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,465
Okay.

77
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:47,145
Unbelievable.

78
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:49,745
They're so absurd.

79
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:50,865
I'll take a few more shots
of your profile.

80
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:51,945
Isn't

81
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,465
that Peachy Peach?

82
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:55,065
What Peachy Peach?

83
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:57,345
Jiang Jiaojiao's electronic pet.

84
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:58,545
Come on, let's go and play.

85
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:01,060
Sure, give me a profile shot.

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,665
Why does she look familiar?

87
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,425
You look so charming.
That was a great shot.

88
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:07,905
I didn't know your boyfriend knows
how to play tennis.

89
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:10,185
I thought

90
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,225
you guys weren't training at this time.

91
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:13,305
Why are you everywhere?

92
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,065
Me? Everywhere?

93
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,305
I belong to this club.

94
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,385
I come and go as I please.

95
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:20,545
But he assumes

96
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,545
he can play tennis

97
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:23,545
just by making some poses.

98
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,305
He should learn how to hold

99
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:25,945
a racket first.

100
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,465
You should watch what you're saying.

101
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:29,665
If you can't be nice,

102
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:30,545
you can just leave.

103
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,105
Don't get in the way of our work.

104
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:33,785
Do you know where you are?

105
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,025
If anyone's leaving,
it's going to be you.

106
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,585
The door's right there.

107
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,345
Don't get in the way of our training.

108
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,225
Must you hog all of the courts here?

109
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,025
What? Are you playing football?

110
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:48,665
There are plenty of other courts.

111
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:51,225
You don't have to be here.

112
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,585
It's fine if you don't want to leave.

113
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:56,825
If you can beat me, then we'll talk.

114
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,425
So?

115
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,305
Do you want to leave or play?

116
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:04,265
What do you mean?

117
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,465
Are you really going
to have a match with him?

118
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,665
This guy looks like

119
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:09,785
he's here to make himself look good

120
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:10,745
with his fancy moves.

121
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:11,465
Are you serious about the match

122
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:12,545
or putting on an act?

123
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,145
Well, excuse us then.

124
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:16,225
We're a professional club.

125
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,265
We never welcome those

126
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:19,225
who come here to look good.

127
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:21,225
Fine, let's compete.

128
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,505
He's really a professional player.

129
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,985
We don't have to respond
to his provocation.

130
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,425
We're here to shoot footage.

131
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,265
With professional players here,

132
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:30,185
it'll definitely have a better effect.

133
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:31,705
So when we start the match,

134
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,065
you can start with your live stream.

135
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:34,705
It'll definitely attract more views.

136
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,465
What is it that we can't hear?

137
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:46,345
Jiaojiao,

138
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:47,665
let's get this straight.

139
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:48,665
You're a professional player.

140
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:49,905
It won't be honorable

141
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:50,425
even if you beat him.

142
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:51,385
He won't be satisfied with it either.

143
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:52,985
For the sake of fairness,

144
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,145
I suggest

145
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,625
you both compete

146
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,305
in something else.

147
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:58,745
Compete in what?

148
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:04,905
I'll explain the rules.

149
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:05,785
First,

150
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:06,545
each of you

151
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,625
will drink five bottles of energy drink.

152
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,265
Then, you'll wedge a bottle
behind your knee

153
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,265
and another two bottles

154
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:12,345
between both of your shoulders and neck.

155
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,145
Yeah, just like what he does.

156
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:15,545
If you drop any bottle

157
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:17,585
or you can't hold on anymore,

158
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,665
you'll lose.

159
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,265
This game

160
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:21,505
isn't about skill,

161
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,545
but willpower.

162
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:26,545
Are you okay with this?

163
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,585
Sounds interesting.

164
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:30,305
Let's bring it, then.

165
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:31,705
Whoever loses

166
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,225
has to crawl around the court once.

167
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,065
Okay, let's begin.

168
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,225
They're done with the first bottle.

169
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,785
They're evenly matched for now.

170
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,865
Come on, Su Ke.

171
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:56,785
Su Ke.

172
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:57,745
Don't lose, Jiaojiao.

173
00:07:57,865 --> 00:07:58,585
Come on, guys.

174
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:04,985
Hey, wig seller.

175
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,945
I didn't know you were an athlete.

176
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:11,665
What are you guys doing?

177
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:13,905
My friend is playing

178
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:15,145
against your player in a friendly match.

179
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:16,865
He's pretty considerate

180
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:17,985
to suggest a drinking game

181
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:19,825
as a friendly match to make it fair.

182
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:21,745
Look at this.

183
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:22,505
Look at my live stream.

184
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,145
Come on.

185
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:24,385
(Peachy Peach)
Look at the viewers

186
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,025
and the bullet comments coming in.

187
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,385
It's blowing up.

188
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,345
Just look at it.

189
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:30,345
Everyone is commenting on it.

190
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:32,945
Hey, is it okay for them to drink this much?

191
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:33,705
Yes.

192
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:34,865
They'll be fine.

193
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:35,904
I've asked Ms. Luo about it.

194
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:39,225
What? They'll be fine.

195
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,265
This works really great.

196
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,345
This is a great material

197
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,784
for promoting our energy drink.

198
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:44,505
Where can you find two people

199
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,625
to act like

200
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,265
they're risking everything like this?

201
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:57,785
You seem to be enjoying this.

202
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,065
Why wouldn't I be?

203
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,185
I never knew

204
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,425
you were such a bad boy.

205
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:04,945
What do you mean?

206
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:07,625
Do you like bad boys?

207
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,145
Thank you all for tuning in.

208
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:15,705
The live stream

209
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:17,025
is now being featured on the homepage.

210
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:18,625
Thank you for your gifts.

211
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:21,505
This is the last bottle.

212
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:22,065
It's the last one.

213
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:22,905
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

214
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:23,585
You can do it, Su Ke.

215
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:24,745
You're doing great!

216
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:31,905
Don't spill it, don't spill it.

217
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:38,865
Nice!

218
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:39,545
Awesome.

219
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:41,465
Why are you not drinking?

220
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:42,265
Su Ke, one last shot.

221
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:42,945
Hurry, you can do it.

222
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,665
Come on, Su Ke!

223
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,985
Amazing, isn't it?

224
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,945
This is awesome. I got another gift.

225
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:29,385
Did you see that?

226
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,345
This is the one.

227
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:46,905
Can he hold on?

228
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:47,665
Don't wobble, Jiaojiao.

229
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:48,585
You can do it.

230
00:10:58,505 --> 00:10:59,705
You're good at pretending.

231
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:01,305
He's going to lose.

232
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:02,065
He's going down.

233
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:03,105
Su Ke.

234
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:04,865
Hang in there, Su Ke.

235
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,145
Where are you going?

236
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,505
Not bad, Jiaojiao.

237
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,545
Your willpower sure is awesome.

238
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,890
(Male)

239
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,865
Did you go to the bathroom for so long

240
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,825
because you were trying
to avoid crawling around the court?

241
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,305
What are you so proud of?

242
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:41,625
Do you think

243
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,145
Tao will like you because of this?

244
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,705
They say athletes are simple-minded.

245
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,185
It turns out to be true.

246
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,545
I could tell
from the last time I saw you.

247
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:55,185
She's clearly ignoring you.

248
00:11:55,225 --> 00:11:56,745
Yet you keep following her around

249
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:57,705
to prove your presence.

250
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,185
Don't you feel shameful?

251
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:01,145
You should know

252
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,345
who Tao likes.

253
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:09,465
My personal favorite

254
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:10,545
(Peachy Peach)
is the blue one.

255
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:12,465
It has a fruity taste

256
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:14,305
with a hint of sweetness.

257
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,785
You want to see the court?

258
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:20,585
This is a bonus content.

259
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,025
So keep following us,

260
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,065
the Ke and Tao CP.

261
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:24,105
In the next video,

262
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,505
we'll do the reveal.

263
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,105
Who said you'll do it next time?

264
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:29,465
We had a deal that the loser
will crawl around the court.

265
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:30,585
We have so many viewers watching here.

266
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:31,945
Why wait until the next video?

267
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:33,745
If you're a man,

268
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:34,865
keep your word.

269
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,225
You can start crawling.

270
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:41,305
Why are you just standing there?

271
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,185
Crawl.

272
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,025
Since everyone

273
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,425
wants to see us crawl around the court,

274
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:45,865
I'll do it on Su Ke's behalf

275
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,865
because Su Ke is tired from the match.

276
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:53,225
It's just one round.

277
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:54,425
What's the big deal?

278
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:55,465
Tao.

279
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:56,865
It's just for show.

280
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:58,105
You don't have to crawl for real.

281
00:12:58,985 --> 00:12:59,905
Get up.

282
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,425
Are you sacrificing your dignity

283
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,865
for someone who's a sore loser?

284
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,745
Who are you talking about?

285
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:08,905
He's my CP.

286
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:10,025
If it weren't for him,

287
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:11,865
would the live stream
exceed 50,000 viewers?

288
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:12,305
I think

289
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:13,745
you've been hanging out
with this kind of people for too long

290
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,985
that you're muddle-headed.

291
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,465
You even talk

292
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,705
about relying on your ability
to make a living.

293
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:19,545
So is this your ability?

294
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:47,305
Just ignore him.

295
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,145
(Lu Xinya: That looks refreshing.)
(This energy drink is too delicious.)

296
00:13:59,185 --> 00:13:59,745
(Where can I buy them?)

297
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:00,545
(Peach, can you make
the arrangement for us?)

298
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:01,865
(I want to drink it too.)

299
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:02,825
(Is it only for the club members?)

300
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,740
(Shenzhen Hot Topic: Club's in-house nutritionist
personalized energy drink for the players.)

301
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,940
(Weekly Hot News: The energy drink
has no purchase channels.)

302
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,340
(Breaking News: Many recommend energy drink
that attracted a lot of attention from netizens.)

303
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,540
(Energy Drink Formula Transfer Agreement)

304
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,505
Should I sell it?

305
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,305
Of course.

306
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,465
This fast-moving consumer goods agency

307
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:21,625
is well-known in the industry.

308
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:22,785
They're offering one million yuan

309
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,985
for the production and sales rights

310
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:24,905
of the energy drink.

311
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,105
So why not sell it?

312
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:27,145
I really didn't expect

313
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:28,385
the new consumer market

314
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,505
to be so popular now.

315
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:31,705
They even sent the contract over.

316
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,265
With this money,

317
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,545
we don't need to go to the group

318
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:36,265
for budget approval anymore.

319
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,105
Sell it.

320
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,385
Okay, Nian.

321
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,145
When this deal is done,

322
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:43,585
you'll get

323
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:44,345
a 10% bonus from this sale.

324
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,425
Just save it.

325
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,025
After you paid the taxes

326
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,745
and additional fees imposed
by the group,

327
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:51,625
you won't have much left.

328
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,145
How are you going to reward me?

329
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,785
I appreciate your intention.

330
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:55,945
Keep it on hold for now.

331
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,905
All right, I'll hold on to it for now.

332
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,585
When my club

333
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,745
turns losses into profits

334
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:03,865
and I'm making my first big bucks,

335
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,305
I'll return what I hold for you.

336
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,385
Okay.

337
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,825
If you really want to thank someone,

338
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,745
there's one person

339
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,665
who deserves your gratitude.

340
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:24,025
Who came up with the idea
of drinking energy drinks?

341
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:27,625
That was the point
that made the whole thing viral.

342
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,105
I'll just be honest with you.

343
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:33,705
Don't you think

344
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:34,625
the photos of our energy drink

345
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:36,665
on the official account look nice?

346
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,985
It was all Song Sanchuan's idea.

347
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:39,825
He knows

348
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,785
you were particularly concerned
about the energy drink's selling point.

349
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:44,225
He put a lot of effort into
trying various methods.

350
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,585
He knows what you wanted.

351
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:48,425
So he did it quietly

352
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:49,745
without showing it

353
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,305
and asking for any credit.

354
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,865
Isn't that charming of him?

355
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,105
I think I've figured it out.

356
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:59,345
He must have been helping you
a lot recently.

357
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,465
You're switching sides so quickly.

358
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:03,945
But the direction I'm switching to

359
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,065
is for the happiness of my best friend.

360
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,545
Look at this.

361
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:12,825
It's for two years.

362
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,825
Isn't two years too long?

363
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,545
Whether it's long or not,

364
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:17,625
I think you two

365
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:18,825
have been getting along long enough.

366
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:20,185
It's about time.

367
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,945
Do you have
so much free time on your hands?

368
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:23,665
Get back to your work.

369
00:16:23,705 --> 00:16:24,945
Why are you still here?

370
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,505
I'm serious.

371
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:31,185
Luo Nian,

372
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:32,825
I won't give you your money

373
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,745
if you keep this up.

374
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:38,665
Look at this.

375
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,265
I think you guys look good together.

376
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:53,260
(Rest Area)

377
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:56,625
Song Sanchuan!

378
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:15,184
Do you know

379
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:16,745
the energy drink you're having

380
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,305
isn't the same as before?

381
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:21,464
Did you take a sip?

382
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:24,545
What you're drinking now

383
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,464
is a million-yuan energy drink.

384
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:28,825
A fast-moving consumer goods company

385
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,145
approached us

386
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:31,465
and they want
to offer us one million yuan

387
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,905
to buy our energy drink.

388
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,225
With this money,

389
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:35,745
a lot of things will be easier.

390
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,505
That's impressive.

391
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,265
This costs one million yuan?

392
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,625
You and Luo Nian
were the impressive ones.

393
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:49,105
It's all thanks to you

394
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,625
to think of such a brilliant idea.

395
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,745
So with this money,

396
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,905
does that mean
you won't have to ask for funds

397
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,545
from the company anymore?

398
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:55,385
Of course.

399
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:56,945
But our club

400
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,145
doesn't have this kind

401
00:17:58,225 --> 00:17:59,945
of commercial contract yet.

402
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:00,865
This is our first one.

403
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,545
So I still need to go back
to the company

404
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,225
to get the procedures done.

405
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,945
There'll be
some bureaucratic red tape involved.

406
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,145
Well, it's all good.

407
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:09,425
At least we can repay the advance money

408
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:10,385
we received before.

409
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:11,985
You can breathe a sigh of relief now.

410
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:22,985
I'll go tomorrow.

411
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:27,585
One million yuan...

412
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:38,425
You have to continue training, right?

413
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:41,225
Yeah, I have

414
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:42,505
about half an hour left.

415
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:43,625
All right, then.

416
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:44,865
I came here just to tell you

417
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,145
about this.

418
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,265
Now that I've told you,

419
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:49,185
I'll be heading home.

420
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,025
Okay, so drive safe

421
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:52,465
when you go home.

422
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:54,985
- I...
- Then...

423
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:55,745
Then I...

424
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:56,385
I'll get back

425
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,065
- Get back to training.
-  to my training.

426
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:58,945
Go along now.

427
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,625
One million yuan!

428
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,580
(Linglong Mansion)

429
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:01,985
(Young Space)
Ms. You'an,

430
00:20:02,105 --> 00:20:03,785
look how stylish you look.

431
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,385
It's like your whole charm

432
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,465
has changed from the inside out.

433
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,225
You've become beautiful now.

434
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,265
You're such a sweet talker.

435
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,665
Did you get some kind of injection?

436
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:12,905
No, I didn't.

437
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:14,065
Do you know why?

438
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,465
Because I came to ask for funds

439
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:16,585
in my past visits.

440
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:17,665
But this time,

441
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:18,545
I came to deliver money.

442
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,985
This look comes from my confidence,
do you understand?

443
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,065
All right. I need to go and see Ms. Li.

444
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:23,545
I won't be in your way anymore.

445
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:23,985
- See you.
- Okay.

446
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,145
Done.

447
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,185
So the company's decision

448
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,385
about the one million yuan

449
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:34,745
is splitting it in half.

450
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:35,665
Both parties will get half.

451
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:37,065
So on your side,

452
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:38,305
it happens to clear off the payment.

453
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:39,505
So everything is settled.

454
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,465
What? Wait a minute.

455
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:42,945
I can accept to use it
to clear the payment.

456
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,545
The company is even deducting our money?

457
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,505
For the company,

458
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:47,585
this amount of money means nothing.

459
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,025
It's a significant loss to us.

460
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:50,865
Ms. Li,

461
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:52,025
they don't know.

462
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:52,665
But you know

463
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:53,865
how hard it is for us, right?

464
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,185
Can you leave some money for us?

465
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:56,705
Don't complain that your club is poor.

466
00:20:57,385 --> 00:20:58,945
Your performance these past few months

467
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:00,225
has been progressing well.

468
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:01,505
How is it hard for you?

469
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:02,905
It was because of your support.

470
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,345
If you hadn't been righteous

471
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,145
and generously given us

472
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,785
the budget in advance,

473
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,505
we wouldn't have come this far

474
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:10,305
and wouldn't have gotten

475
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:11,385
this contract.

476
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:12,505
Ms. Li,

477
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:13,705
I'm grateful

478
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:14,985
for your kindness,

479
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:16,345
not the company.

480
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,505
You can stop there.

481
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:19,105
Stop trying to flatter me.

482
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,505
Do I not know you?

483
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,145
Is that the attitude
of giving up easily?

484
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,105
I've already applied

485
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:25,465
for the training fees in advance
for you.

486
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,945
With this money as a foundation,

487
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:28,305
I've already approved it.

488
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:30,945
I worked so hard

489
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:32,305
just to earn a training fee.

490
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,225
If it weren't for this money,

491
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:35,505
it wouldn't have been approved.

492
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,305
The company

493
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:37,585
has never set this precedent.

494
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,105
Anyway, this is all I can do
within my capabilities.

495
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:40,705
You can return it if you don't want it.

496
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,705
Of course, I want it.

497
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:43,505
Thank you.

498
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:45,145
All right, Ms. Li.

499
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,185
I won't get in your way anymore.

500
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:49,425
If you want to do
some sports activities,

501
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:50,265
you can come to my club.

502
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:51,625
I'll arrange a trainer for you.

503
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,065
Liang You'an.

504
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:55,785
What's the matter?

505
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:57,505
I've noticed

506
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,345
you've been getting

507
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:00,185
more flippant lately.

508
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:05,585
When I go,

509
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,625
I'll text you.

510
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:09,265
Okay.

511
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:11,305
Thank you, boss.

512
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:13,705
At this rate,

513
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:14,985
I'll be able to deliver

514
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:16,305
the promise I made to you earlier.

515
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,340
(Club's Official Account Performance)

516
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:20,665
(Club's Official Account Performance)
I've never doubted

517
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:21,865
(Club Membership Update)
your abilities.

518
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:23,105
But I didn't expect things

519
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:24,985
to go so smoothly and quickly.

520
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:26,465
You're being too modest now.

521
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,865
Earlier, you said

522
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:29,265
I've never worked on the front lines

523
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:30,785
and wouldn't be able to handle it.

524
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:31,625
Jeez, Liang You'an.

525
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:32,825
What's your zodiac sign?

526
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,465
Why are you holding a grudge?

527
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:35,785
All right.

528
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,065
I'll give some encouragement
to your club members.

529
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:39,345
I'll treat everyone

530
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,825
in the club to a meal.

531
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:41,665
Pick something expensive.

532
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:42,705
Don't try to save money for me.

533
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,425
Please don't.

534
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:45,785
When you treat the employees,

535
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:46,345
it's the company's way

536
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:47,825
to motivate the teams.

537
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,625
It won't work with the athletes.

538
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:50,425
Those kids

539
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,945
won't be willing to eat with you.

540
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,745
What do you mean by that?

541
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:55,545
Am I that scary?

542
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:57,185
It's not that.

543
00:22:57,385 --> 00:22:58,865
I know because I've had meals
with you before.

544
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,545
I'm doing this for your sake.

545
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:01,985
It'll cost a lot

546
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,065
to buy them expensive meals too.

547
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:04,585
They'll have to eat in discomfort.

548
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:05,905
If you really want to rack up points...

549
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:07,065
I mean swipe your card.

550
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:09,905
You can just cash it
for their meal expense.

551
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:12,305
Hold on.

552
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:13,825
Liang You'an,

553
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,505
you're getting more petty now.

554
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:19,025
Why are you being calculative
over a meal?

555
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:20,545
I had no choice.

556
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:22,945
We've been preparing for so long

557
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,105
for the annual club tour

that is about to take place.

559

As long as we
can make it into the top ten,

560
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:31,145
the club can put up an A-rank signboard.

561
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,025
Do you have the confidence
to make it into the top ten?

562
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,385
We're almost there.

563
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,465
I've talked to Coach Zhang Yan.

564
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,625
We're planning

565
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:41,665
to hold a closed-door training camp.

566
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:42,665
He'll coordinate

567
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:43,825
with the clubs in Beijing

568
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:45,345
(Club Training Program)
and we'll all train together

569
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,585
in simulated combat.

570
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,225
The budget for this training camp

571
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,305
can be more or less,

572
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,185
and the training duration

573
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,585
can be long or short.

574
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:53,425
It all depends on

575
00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:55,145
whether you're willing
to add more to the budget.

576
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:00,665
You've picked up bad habits.

577
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,665
You're trying to trick me

578
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,465
and putting me on the spot now, huh?

579
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,745
What I said

580
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:07,745
won't be taken back, right?

581
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:09,585
Boss,

582
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,625
there will be returns
for every investment.

583
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:15,545
Okay, it's settled then.

584
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:17,065
The club will cover half

585
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,145
of the training expenses,

586
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:19,705
and I'll personally
cover the other half.

587
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,105
Thank you, boss.

588
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:22,505
Well, I'll be going now.

589
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,025
Everyone, stop for a moment!

590
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,305
Guys! Can I have a moment please?

591
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,465
Hear me out!

592
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,985
The company

593
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:43,625
has officially approved
our training plan.

594
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:44,985
So go back and pack your bags.

595
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,545
In three days, we'll embark

596
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,905
on a seven-day training

597
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,705
facing the sea.

598
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,350
Good.

599
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,545
That's all for today!

600
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:01,505
You're dismissed!

601
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:05,825
Hooray!

602
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:23,025
You said you'd never wear them.

603
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:25,105
But you wear them secretly.

604
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:27,625
Is this what you really are?

605
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:32,265
Yeah.

606
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:34,385
I think these shoes look nice.

607
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:36,265
They match

608
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:37,065
my clothes very well today.

609
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:38,785
So I'll wear them on any occasion.

610
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:40,425
Wear them every day.

611
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:44,425
I do think they look nice.

612
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,025
I'll keep an eye on you from now on.

613
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:53,385
Are you still trying
to serve a curve ball?

614
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:59,065
I didn't wear them in secret.

615
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:15,785
The business quarter has just ended.

616
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,545
It should be considered

617
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,225
a small peak season for sales.

618
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,185
However, Young Space's sales

619
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:22,865
have once again

620
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:25,545
been pushed out
of the top five sports brands.

621
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:27,825
I've always supported

622
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:29,305
Mr. Gao's proposal

623
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:30,865
to maintain a strategy

624
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:32,025
of covering all areas of mass sports.

625
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:33,985
However,

626
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:35,585
the problem we're facing now is

627
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:36,945
that there is too much uniformity

628
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,145
in our online and offline

629
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:41,025
sales strategies for consumers

630
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,665
in first-tier, second-tier,

631
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,905
third-tier, and fourth-tier cities.

632
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:47,945
Previously, Mr. Jie provided us

633
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,945
with comprehensive marketing data

634
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:51,545
that clearly showed

635
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:52,465
the significant differences

636
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:53,825
in consumer shopping habits

637
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:55,745
between first-tier
and second-tier cities

638
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,385
and third-tier and fourth-tier cities.

639
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:59,585
I don't understand

640
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:00,425
why the sales department

641
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:02,385
has not followed up
with a strategy adjustment.

642
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:10,625
Well, what happened was

643
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:12,425
the marketing data

644
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,865
we received

645
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,105
and what Mr. Jiang gave us

646
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:17,865
had some discrepancies.

647
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:19,145
There was no way for me
to implement them.

648
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:21,185
Of course,
there are discrepancies for you.

649
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:23,025
That's why

650
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:24,625
your sales have been declining.

651
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:26,065
It's especially noticeable
from the online data.

652
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:28,065
You've lost sales from most cities.

653
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,305
After discussing
with other shareholders,

654
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:38,025
I'd like to make an announcement

655
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:39,905
in this meeting today.

656
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:41,985
Starting next quarter,

657
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:43,985
we'll have a restructuring

658
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:45,665
of the online and offline sales.

659
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,065
The online sales

660
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,985
will be under the supervision
of Jiang Jie,

661
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,025
while Gao Li

662
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,985
will continue to oversee
the area distribution channels

663
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,865
in which he excels.

664
00:27:59,025 --> 00:27:59,945
That's all for today's meeting.

665
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,345
This announcement will shake things up.

666
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:17,785
Such a takeover

667
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:19,705
of the sales department

668
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:20,505
shows a strong signal

669
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:21,625
to groom the next CEO.

670
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:42,785
Mr. Gao,

671
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:44,585
the announcement
of the division of online

672
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:45,985
and offline sales

673
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,065
has been sent to all employees' emails
in the company.

674
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:48,465
Is Mr. Gao finally going

675
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,025
to take some serious action?

676
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:51,905
Unless he's getting old

677
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,465
and giving the company to outsiders.

678
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:03,505
How's the club doing lately?

679
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:04,865
I heard

680
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:05,865
an investment was made lately.

681
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:07,265
And there was a video

682
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:08,705
that went viral not too long ago,

683
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,985
with a lot of views.

684
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,465
Here it is, Mr. Gao.

685
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:19,385
(Come on, Su Ke!)

686
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:22,545
(Peachy Peach)
(Amazing, isn't it?)

687
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:24,505
(This is awesome.)

688
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:25,705
(I got another gift.)

689
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:26,185
(Did you see that?)

690
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:27,225
(This is the one.)

691
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:31,105
It's Saturday.

692
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:31,705
You promised

693
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:33,265
to watch my game together.

694
00:29:33,545 --> 00:29:34,265
Not only you broke

695
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:35,465
your own rule,

696
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:36,985
but you also had
to bring my mom with you.

697
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:38,825
Jiaojiao,

698
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:39,945
calm down.

699
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,385
This is a special occasion.

700
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:42,425
The president wants

701
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:44,265
to throw a celebration banquet for me.

702
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:45,785
Your father is the main lead here.

703
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,385
Is it inappropriate for me not to go?

704
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:49,465
I know it's Saturday today.

705
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:51,225
We can go and have our meal there.

706
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:51,905
Later,

707
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,105
your mom and I will head over first.

708
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,625
After your match is over,

709
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:55,705
you can come right away.

710
00:29:57,745 --> 00:29:58,705
Take some fruit with you.

711
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,025
Remember to eat them.

712
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:07,945
Today's match is important to me.

713
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:08,905
If I win,

714
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:10,945
I'll be in the top 100 players
in the country.

715
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,025
Mr. Jiang,

716
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:16,425
you're not the only one

717
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:18,265
who's the main lead in this house.

718
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:19,905
Listen.

719
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:20,865
I'm not going

720
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,025
to that lousy dinner of yours.

721
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:29,945
He's always so unaware of the importance

722
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:31,505
and unable to understand the situation.

723
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,105
The sales department

724
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:34,385
is the company's lifeline.

725
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:35,785
Now the president

726
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,945
has put online sales
under my responsibility.

727
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,105
In Young Space,

728
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,225
my position at the company
is now second to the president.

729
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:41,385
Our family is about

730
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,705
to make a successful leap.

731
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:46,265
The president has invited so many people

732
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,745
to celebrate my success.

733
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,945
It's no less important
than his silly match.

734
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:50,745
Okay.

735
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:52,145
Since you say it's so important,

736
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:53,745
you should go.

737
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:54,665
There's no need

738
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:56,385
to treat us like a burden.

739
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:59,825
We won't blame you

740
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,825
if we skip the family dinner this week.

741
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,025
Actually, I'd rather go

742
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:05,345
and watch my son's tennis match.

743
00:31:06,585 --> 00:31:08,265
Why are you

744
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:10,025
getting emotional?

745
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:12,145
Look.

746
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:13,065
You were the one

747
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:14,225
who suggested the family dinner
in the first place.

748
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,705
You often grumbled
that I'm too busy with work

749
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:17,425
and don't have time for you guys.

750
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:19,905
Since we started doing this,

751
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:20,865
haven't I

752
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:21,705
been canceling

753
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:22,945
all my other engagements

754
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:24,145
every Saturday?

755
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,825
Today is a special circumstance.

756
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:29,305
Why do you say I have a burden?

757
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:30,625
What kind of burden could I have?

758
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,785
I have none.

759
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:35,025
Yes, you don't have any burden

760
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,225
because you mentally released yourself

761
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:38,225
from the burden

762
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:40,345
whenever it's Saturday.

763
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:42,385
Every time this day comes,

764
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:44,225
you're physically present
but mentally absent.

765
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:46,105
You just spare a few hours for us.

766
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:48,865
And for the rest of the time,

767
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:50,505
you can come

768
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:51,825
and go as you please.

769
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:54,505
When you need to go on a business trip,

770
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,865
your assistant would come
to pick up your luggage

771
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:56,825
and off you go
without even informing us.

772
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,785
Other people would make a call
to inform others

773
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:00,185
when they were not
coming home for dinner.

774
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:01,505
You only remember to inform us

775
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,145
when you were coming home for dinner.

776
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,065
You indeed don't have any burden at all.

777
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:14,545
Come on, girls.

778
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:15,665
Let's have a drink.

779
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:16,625
You're finally here.

780
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:17,785
Come.

781
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:19,705
Yao,

782
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:20,825
is this your first time here?

783
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:21,545
Yes.

784
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,985
You must come always.

785
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:23,465
Okay.

786
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:24,625
Cheers.

787
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,265
We'll continue
with our conversations then.

788
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,450
The other day, you mentioned...

789
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,105
Why are you sitting here alone?

790
00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:36,345
What are you watching?

791
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:37,665
I'm sorry.

792
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:39,385
I'm a bit preoccupied.

793
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:40,465
So I was replying to some texts.

794
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:43,425
Let's keep what I said between us.

795
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,745
For this promotion,

796
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,385
Gao looks highly

797
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:47,425
at someone's character.

798
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:49,385
Gao's wife

799
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:50,985
is already his third one.

800
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:52,785
You see loving husband
and wife relationship

801
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,705
is truly precious.

802
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:56,105
You let Jie

803
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:57,665
work with Gao

804
00:32:57,865 --> 00:32:59,545
and everything will turn out fine.

805
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,105
Why are you two chatting so intimately?

806
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:05,985
We're

807
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,425
all envious

808
00:33:07,425 --> 00:33:08,465
of Mrs. Jiang here.

809
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:10,105
Jiang Jie is not only

810
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:11,465
outstanding in his work,

811
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,345
but also cares deeply

812
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,425
about his wife and family.

813
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:14,945
Yes.

814
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:16,825
Everyone in the company knows

815
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:18,785
about their family banquet.

816
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:20,905
Gao even said

817
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,905
it's impossible

818
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:23,865
to meet Jiang Jie for work

819
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:25,305
on a Saturday.

820
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:27,225
That's right, I can attest to that.

821
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,385
This is the first time

822
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,865
he agreed to come out on a Saturday,

823
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:32,545
and he even insisted
on bringing his wife.

824
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,625
Chen Ke, did you hear that?

825
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,145
The president is blaming me

826
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,585
for only caring about my wife

827
00:33:38,665 --> 00:33:39,425
and not the company.

828
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:40,945
I didn't say that.

829
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:42,625
I just want to say

830
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:44,745
that men with strict family values
are good men.

831
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,505
They are our role models,

832
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:47,145
right?

833
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:47,385
Right.

834
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,025
Let's all raise

835
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:49,425
our glasses

836
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:50,265
to this model couple.

837
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:51,305
Come on, raise your glasses.

838
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:52,145
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

839
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:52,945
Ladies, let's raise
our glasses together.

840
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:53,665
Thank you, thank you.

841
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:54,145
Mr. Jiang, cheers.

842
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:55,065
Thank you.

843
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,585
Thank you.

844
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,305
Dear,

845
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,265
I forgot to ask you something today.

846
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,945
How did Jiaojiao's game go?

847
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,024
Did they win?

848
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:17,665
Yes, they won.

849
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:18,905
Not bad.

850
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:20,544
This kid

851
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,865
always wants to outdo me.

852
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:24,104
I told Liang You'an

853
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:25,104
I'll pay for all the expenses

854
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:26,584
for this training camp,

855
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,465
so the players don't have
to worry about money.

856
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:29,865
So

857
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,064
please tell Jiaojiao

858
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:32,425
about this tomorrow morning.

859
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:34,825
Okay.

860
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,504
Today's situation

861
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:39,064
was all thanks to my wife.

862
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,945
Is there anything you want
to buy lately?

863
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:42,504
A handbag or jewelry?

864
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,265
How about

865
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:44,865
I get you a new car?

866
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:46,985
Well, there's something

867
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:49,625
I've been wanting lately.

868
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:52,465
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

869
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:53,544
Okay.

870
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,225
What kind of bird is it

871
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:00,785
on this plate?

872
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:05,745
You draw pretty well.

873
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:07,105
I'll get to bed now.

874
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,260
(Divorce Agreement)

875
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,465
Mr. Wen.

876
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:57,665
I'm ready to file for a divorce.

877
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,425
You can start getting things ready.

878
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:10,745
Where's the coach?

879
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,665
The coaching staff
have already gone ahead

880
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:13,825
to the training grounds.

881
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:15,585
Beijing Club will be there soon.

882
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,105
Where's Chen Zhe?

883
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:19,705
Zhe said he'd be here soon.

884
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:20,265
Go, go.

885
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:20,905
Okay, get on the bus.

886
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:21,625
Get on the bus.

887
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:31,905
It's cool in here.

888
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:41,905
Chen Zhe,

889
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:42,945
hurry up.

890
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:44,185
Everyone's on the bus waiting

891
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:45,145
for you.

892
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,585
(It's a four-hour trip.)

893
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,025
(Song Sanchuan)
(I won't bother you.)

894
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:11,665
(Rest well.)

895
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,105
This stuff looks

896
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:43,865
pretty good.

897
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:47,905
Try it.

898
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:56,185
I didn't see you at breakfast
this morning.

899
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:57,865
Did you oversleep?

900
00:38:58,825 --> 00:39:01,185
You must be hungry for food.

901
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:05,185
You're observing me too closely.

902
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:07,145
I have to understand the coach

903
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:07,745
to cooperate better

904
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,425
with the training plan.

905
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:12,105
And by observing you,

906
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:13,905
I can tell that without tennis,

907
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,105
you'd be a night owl,

908
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,065
smoking and drinking heavily,

909
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,265
a very unhealthy person.

910
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,225
Is that also ready?

911
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,185
Can I have one more?

912
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,145
Sorry,

913
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,545
you'll have to wait
until we all eat together.

914
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,340
(Dai Yi  Tian Xin)

915
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,465
This...this is really good.

916
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:08,385
They're here.

917
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:10,865
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

918
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:11,545
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

919
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:12,625
Sit according to your name tag.

920
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:13,385
Don't sit randomly.

921
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:14,225
Sit according to your own name tag.

922
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:15,105
Hurry up, hurry up.

923
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:15,865
Find your name tag.

924
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:16,825
Hey, Jiaojiao.

925
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:18,305
It's the first time we've had name tags.

926
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:19,185
Double Jiao.

927
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:20,305
Your seat is here.

928
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,905
While we have the time,

929
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:22,825
let me explain

930
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:24,665
about nutrition intake

931
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:25,545
and why your menu

932
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:26,825
was designed this way.

933
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:27,345
It's so little.

934
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,185
(Song Sanchuan)
How are we supposed to eat this?

935
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:28,865
Each person gets one per day.

936
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:29,345
Song Sanchuan,

937
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,305
I want to eat yours.

938
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:31,385
Why?

939
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:32,985
Why? Because yours looks delicious.

940
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:34,905
Stop making a fuss.

941
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:37,585
Ms. Luo is speaking.

942
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:39,705
Coach,

943
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,465
Ms. Luo is clearly playing favorites.

944
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:42,505
Stop making trouble.

945
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:43,785
Do you want extra training?

946
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,105
Let me continue.

947
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:52,305
Each of us needs

948
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:53,425
to consume

949
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:54,545
six major nutrients a day,

950
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,425
which are carbohydrates,

951
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:58,545
protein, fat,

952
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,865
vitamins, minerals, and water.

953
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:02,545
However, the amount

954
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,665
of each nutrient intake varies

955
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:04,865
from person to person.

956
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:06,865
For athletes,

957
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:07,985
carbohydrates

958
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,665
are the main source of muscle energy.

959
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:10,625
If you exercise

960
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:12,545
for more than four hours a day,

961
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,705
you need to increase
your carbohydrate intake.

962
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:20,545
Therefore,

963
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:21,825
your demand
for carbohydrates is greater than

964
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:22,505
that of ordinary people.

965
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,425
As everyone has different body weights

966
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,745
and different needs
for muscle gain or fat loss,

967
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,025
the meals

968
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,465
on your plate

969
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,345
are specially customized

970
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,425
based on your characteristics.

971
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,585
Now that I've explained this,

972
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:34,105
do you feel like

973
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:35,745
your own food is the most delicious?

974
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:45,785
Good.

975
00:41:45,985 --> 00:41:49,425
Nice.

976
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:54,065
Protein

977
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:55,825
is very important

978
00:41:55,905 --> 00:41:56,985
for strength training athletes.

979
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:58,905
Considering your current situation,

980
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:00,625
I recommend yogurt,

981
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,505
in addition to steak.

982
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,745
You all see them

983
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:04,585
on the table,

984
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:05,625
and it's also prepared

985
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:06,745
for you in your room.

986
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,465
You can drink during break time

987
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:09,385
if you feel hungry.

988
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:10,265
Later on,

989
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:11,545
I'll also work hard

990
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:13,825
to ensure everyone
has a balanced diet, okay?

991
00:42:13,985 --> 00:42:15,745
That's all I have to say for now.

992
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:22,665
- Good!
- Nice!

993
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:24,025
Okay, guys.

994
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,865
Dig in.

995
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,465
Listen.

996
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:36,945
You know Coach Yan

997
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:37,745
is usually

998
00:42:38,545 --> 00:42:39,465
a troublesome guy.

999
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:41,025
But I just saw

1000
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:41,985
the way he looked at you

1001
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:43,265
and he was completely impressed.

1002
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:44,785
Really, I'm serious.
He was impressed by you.

1003
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:45,625
Really?

1004
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,825
Even I'm starting to feel

1005
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:50,025
this is fun.

1006
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:51,505
I really want to see

1007
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:52,305
if I can turn all the expertise

1008
00:42:52,425 --> 00:42:53,945
I've accumulated

1009
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:54,705
over the years

1010
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,145
into results.

1011
00:42:57,385 --> 00:42:58,185
Okay, then.

1012
00:42:58,585 --> 00:42:59,545
Ms. Luo,

1013
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:00,505
from now on,

1014
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:01,665
you'll have to strictly follow

1015
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:02,505
the key performance index

1016
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:03,385
I've set for you.

1017
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:05,945
No problem, Ms. Liang.

1018
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:07,505
Enjoy your meal.

1019
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:09,825
Ms. Liang.

1020
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:11,105
