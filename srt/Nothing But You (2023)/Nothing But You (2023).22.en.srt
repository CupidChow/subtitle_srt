come back last night...

You didn't pick up your phone.

I am... asking you a question.

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,440

we had a sudden boost of followers.

It's not necessarily a good thing.

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,860

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,860

I have asked around, Liang Tao.

93
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,860
For an influencer with tons
of followers like you,

94
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,620
you can easily earn

95
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,900
30 to 40 thousand yuan per month.

96
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,380
But you only

97
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,060
give me 2,000 yuan for the monthly expenditure.

98
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,260
Where did the rest go?

99
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,580
Those influencers

100
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,220
either do shady endorsements

101
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,020
or drink and party with rich businessmen.

102
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
I manage my account with integrity.

103
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,100
If I'm lucky, I can get 10,000 yuan.

104
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,980
If I do poorly, they will deduct my pay.

105
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,740
10,000 yuan is pretty good.

106
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,900
Where are your savings?

107
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,620
I spent them all.

108
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,140
I have to buy costumes and props

109
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,740
and everything else.

110
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,220
I want you to give me your money

111
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
so that I can look after it.

112
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,220
It's not to misappropriate it.

113
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,700
You are a woman.

114
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,980
You need your own savings

115
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,180
to be independent.

116
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,380
Otherwise, when you get married,

117
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,740
you will suffer.

118
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,700
Look at me.

119
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,020
I'm the cautionary tale.

120
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,420
Do you not get it?

121
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,260
You know,

122
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,980
back then,

123
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,300
many men tried to date me.

124
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,380
I don't know what got into me

125
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,540
and I picked a loser to be my husband.

126
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,940
You know

127
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
what's the real thing?

128
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,780
Be independent.

129
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,980
Once you're independent,

130
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,580
you won't be taken advantage of by men.

131
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Do you hear me?

132
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,220
Why can't you

133
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,740
do better?

134
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Liang You'an and her mother

135
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,060
will look down on you.

136
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,020
Mom, enough already.

137
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,100
You either complain

138
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,220
about dad or make me feel bad
about myself.

139
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,180
You're not the only victim here.

140
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,100
Yes, it's a miserable life.

141
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,140
Why live it?

142
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,300
Darn it.

143
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,900
Why are you barefooted?

144
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,380
It has nothing to do with you.

145
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,940
Your boyfriend bullied you?

146
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,740
No.

147
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,740
I left my parent's place
to get some air.

148
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,820
You fought with them?

149
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,820
Parents, they mean well.

150
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,180
But gosh, they are annoying sometimes.

151
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Don't take them too seriously.

152
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,700
Why are you playing here?

153
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,380
You were expelled?

154
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,700
Hell no.

155
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,180
I am the top seed of my club.

156
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,620
They will never kick me out

157
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,020
even if they are going bankrupt.

158
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,580
Besides,

159
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,180
we just took part in a tournament

160
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,660
and we won.

161
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,100
Well,

162
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,620
the club did go bankrupt.

163
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,900
So Liang You'an and you

164
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,380
lost your job then?

165
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,900
No way.

166
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,940
The club was disbanded

167
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,940
but the group isn't.

168
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,300
After playing tennis for many years,

169
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
I finally know

170
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
what teamwork means.

171
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,260
Although it's challenging

172
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,900
to find a practice venue every day,

173
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,700
everyone is in it together.

174
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,980
We are very motivated.

175
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,860
Jiaojiao.

176
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,300
We can't play now.

177
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,220
They asked for an extension.

178
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,140
Check the chat group where else we can go.

179
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,860
Okay.

180
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,940
I have heard about low-budget companies

181
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,300
but this is my first time seeing
a low-budget club.

182
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,780
I feel bad for you.

183
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,140
Bye.

184
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,580
Go look for your tennis court now.

185
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,180
Go fix your slippers too.

186
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,540
You're sick again?

187
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,220
I caught a cold.

188
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,500
The cold medicine

189
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,140
is on the cupboard.

190
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,340
Don't forget to take it.

191
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,180
We need to stock up on cold medicine.

192
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,460
All right?

193
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,460
Do you hear me?

194
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,940
Yes.

195
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,540
No touchy touchy.

196
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,300
I don't need your help.

197
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,580
Why are you drawing now?

198
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,420
Grinding the ink, laying a draft,
drawing, seeking inspiration...

199
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,460
I couldn't draw many prawns
this morning.

200
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,980
Just one would take me 30 minutes.

201
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,180
Time flew by just like that.

202
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,140
Living alone

203
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,580
is boring you?

204
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
You know what

205
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,820
my neighbors were doing

206
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,540
when I was drawing prawns?

207
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,460
The lucky ones drove their grandkids to school.

208
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,340
Some have to look after

209
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,660
their children

210
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,660
and their husbands.

211
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,020
And the worst is Miss Wang.

212
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,620
Whose son refuses to work

213
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,100
and leeches off her.

214
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,540
Get up.

215
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,020
Stop it.

216
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm not in the mood.

217
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,100
Don't nap in the afternoon.

218
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,700
Otherwise, you'll wake up at night.

219
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,860
Are you trying to gaze at the moon?

220
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,260
I sleep and eat whenever I want.

221
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,980
No one can stop me.

222
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,300
Yes, you were dumped.

223
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,620
That doesn't mean

224
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,540
you can lie in the bed for three days.

225
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,170
Are you trying to hatch an egg?

226
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,300
If not, get up.

227
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,130
I don't care.

228
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,200
(Tennis 4EVER)

229
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,360
(I shouldn't have said that.
I don't mean it.)

230
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,980
You never liked drawing.

231
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,140
What?

232
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,100
My prawn was all alone

233
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,780
so you drew it a companion.

234
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,140
Why?

235
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,180
You're seeing someone now?

236
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,460
Ever since your previous relationship failed,

237
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,860
we have never talked about
this kind of thing again.

238
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
For years,

239
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,900
I told you

240
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,300
to focus on your career

241
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
instead of your love life.

242
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,220
But you never told me if you

243
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,420
ever looked for another boyfriend.

244
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,340
Mom.

245
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,500
I have a question.

246
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,340
Do you want me

247
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,780
to remain single forever?

248
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,420
Or do you not

249
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,860
mean it seriously?

250
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,340
I was sick

251
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
and I had to be operated on.

252
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,980
You were so worried that it would
affect my pregnancy rate.

253
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,100
Isn't it great to be single?

254
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,900
When you're single,

255
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,580
your work, your life, your friends,

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,620
they are your business.

257
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,780
No one can judge you

258
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,660
as long as you're happy.

259
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,540
If you have a significant other,

260
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,140
he will meddle with everything.

261
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,460
At first,

262
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,740
everyone might get along with each other.

263
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,860
But when cracks show up,

264
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,820
you will have so much to lose.

265
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,900
You're pessimistic

266
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,020
because of your subjective experience.

267
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,380
There are healthy relationships too.

268
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,740
One where both parties

269
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,340
help each other become better.

270
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,660
Maybe the relationship will not last.

271
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
We take a part of each other

272
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,140
and we split up.

273
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,700
But we still come out the better person.

274
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,940
Give me an example then.

275
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,820
Do you know someone like that?

276
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,780
That short moment of bliss

277
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,140
might turn into a long period of grief.

278
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,460
Think about your previous relationship.

279
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,140
What did you get in the end?

280
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,220

But you told me

306
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,780
last night you...

307
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,100
It was a mistake.

308
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,140
I shouldn't have done it with him.

309
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,100

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,500
he blocked me.

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,740
Wait. I don't get it.

314
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,420
It went sour so quickly.

315
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,940
He blocked you now?

316
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,660
I was trying to wait

317
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,380
until it died down.

318
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,100
So I told him

319
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,940
that last night,

320
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,780
we were drunk, intoxicated.

321
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,660
I told him it was a normal thing between adults,

322
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,980
and that he shouldn't take it seriously.

323
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,860
What the heck?

324
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,940
Why did you tell him that?

325
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,700
You're not a playgirl.

326
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,500
You even rejected Nate,

327
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,740
who you liked.

328
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,380
Why did you say those hurtful things?

329
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,620
Why are you so toxic?

330
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,100
I don't know.

331
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,900
I don't know why.

332
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
I was...

333
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,900
It was a lapse of judgment.

334
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,460
Everything just came out of my mouth.

335
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,420
And when I realized the mistake,

336
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,220
I already said

337
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,420
what I shouldn't have said.

338
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,260
Liang You'an, you're a coward.

339
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,700
Do you know

340
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,060
what your problem is?

341
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,020
You come up with tons of explanations

342
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,660
so that you can tell yourself that you

343
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
don't have feelings for him.

344
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,020
But

345
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,500
you and he took this leap of faith.

346
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,180
I am happy for you.

347
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,740
You are just brainwashed

348
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,380
by the love-phobic doctrine.

349
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,980
Remember the dark cabin

350
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,260
you told me?

351
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,860
It won't consume you.

352
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
You're not

353
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,940
going to die right away
when you enter it.

354
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,100
You know what
you should tell yourself now?

355
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,860
You should tell yourself

356
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,340
that there is another cabin.

357
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,620
When you go inside,

358
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,180
lights will be turned on.

359
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,740
Oh, I should have come inside sooner!

360
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,740
Why didn't I?

361
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,860
Do you see it?

362
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,220
We are friends for many years.

363
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,380
I can claim to be your confidant.

364
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,220
In the past six months,

365
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
you have changed a lot.

366
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
You rebelled against Jiang Jie.

367
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,340
You threw away the good position

368
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,900
you were offered.

369
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,740
From last year

370
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,860
you would have never imagined that you

371
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,340
would do this this year.

372
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,700
Because I met Song Sanchuan this year.

373
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,140
See?

374
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,700
You know better than anyone else

375
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,220
who made you change that much.

376
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
So why resist it?

377
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,380
Stop shouting at me.

378
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,820
I was born this way.

379
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,340
Liang Tao.

380
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,940
How many times

381
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,860
have we had this talk?

382
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,860
Have you looked at your own analytics?

383
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,660
Do you not feel desperate?

384
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,220
You have no followers.

385
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,060
No views.

386
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,380
You didn't do anything new.

387
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,940
I asked you to get a microsurgery

388
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,900
and you said no.

389
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,220
Fine,

390
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,940
give me the result

391
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,900
that can prove your worth.

392
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,940
I did release more videos.

393
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,420
I made sure I talked about

394
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,580
interesting topics and that the quality is good.

395
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,100
Tell me now then.

396
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,580
All the popular videos you have.

397
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,340
The swimming center one,

398
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,180
the energy drink one,

399
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
and the Japanese restaurant one.

400
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,900
Which one pulled in more views
because the video quality

401
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,420
was amazing?

402
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,300
None.

403
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,020
Daring is your image.

404
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,300
Give me something out of the box.

405
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,900
Anything.

406
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:25,940
I don't care how

407
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,940
innocent of a girl

408
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,500
you are off camera.

409
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,420
But when the camera is on,

410
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,660
you will be
the daring girl you are.

411
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,420
I signed you

412
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,820
because you are willing to take risks.

413
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,780
Not because you're good at editing.

414
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,700
Do I make myself clear?

415
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,780
Here, for you.

416
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,860
Are you sure?

417
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,500
What?

418
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,220
No need to play dumb.

419
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,020
I saw

420
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,220
Ms. Kiki and you just now.

421
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,500
I am not playing dumb.

422
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,220
It's consensual anyway.

423
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,620
What?

424
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,140
You know she's married.

425
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,940
You know very well

426
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,100
what you're doing here.

427
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,540
That's only one way to see it.

428
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,820
I'm not ambitious like you.

429
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,060
I don't want to have a breakthrough

430
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,820
on my own.

431
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,700
If I can please Ms. Kiki,

432
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,660
I will receive more investments.

433
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,580
And my career will be smoother.

434
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,860
You are frank.

435
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,820
In that case,

436
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,940
why pretend to be my boyfriend on stream?

437
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,420
I didn't expect

438
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,500
sanctimony from you.

439
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,700
You want to be popular
but you are not willing to grovel.

440
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,260
You think shooting a video with a pretty face

441
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,220
is enough to make you go viral?

442
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,020
I don't need a lecture

443
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,340
from someone who takes shortcuts.

444
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,860
Liang Tao.

445
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,220
It's fine if you sneer

446
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,940
at my choice now.

447
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,900
But after two years,

448
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,300
you might not be more successful
than I am.

449
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,300
Sorry then.

450
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,380
I'm on my period today

451
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,820
so we can't shoot.

452
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
Have fun.

453
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,140
The ball bounces back

454
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,420
when you hit it to the ground.

455
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,340
It does this over again and again.

456
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
I find solace in the mundane.

457
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,220
But you are a streamer.

458
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,860
You want followers and views.

459
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,700
Are they worth it?

460
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,420
You have been hanging out way too long

461
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,060
with people like him.

462
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,820
I signed you

463
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,220
because you are willing to take risks.

464
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,180
Not because you're good at editing.

465
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,020
Do I make myself clear?

466
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,940
It's fine if you sneer

467
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,700
at my choice now.

468
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,300
But after two years,

469
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,660
you might not be more successful
than I am.

470
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,660
Is it too much to ask you

471
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,780
to buy something for me?

472
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,580
You won't spend

473
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,140
several hundred yuan for me.

474
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,460
Liang Tao and you

475
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,060
are the same. Stingy.

476
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,280
(No Smoking)

477
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,860
Here.

478
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,860
What are you doing?

479
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,340
One of us definitely killed

480
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,700
the other in our previous life.

481
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,660
I killed you, of course.

482
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,380
I don't usually play this.

483
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,780
It was just to change things up.

484
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,700
Shouldn’t you be streaming now?

485
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,540
Aren't you supposed

486
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,780
to flirt with your fake boyfriend?

487
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,260
So nosy.

488
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,860
You don't look like someone

489
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,380
who visits a cheap internet cafe either.

490
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,220
I don't want to go home.

491
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,380
Me too.

492
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,820
That's something we have in common.

493
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,620
Have you eaten?

494
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,500
My treat.

495
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,540
Let's go.

496
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,140
Come. Try it.

497
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,540
I mean how serious can it be?

498
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,340
You're old enough to be independent

499
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,620
even though your parents are getting
a divorce.

500
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,820
I'm just mad.

501
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,180
I have a selfish father.

502
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,300
I asked around.

503
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,940
He sold the tennis club

504
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,820
for no reason at all.

505
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,580
All he cares about

506
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,220
is his career.

507
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,220
Can you blame him though?

508
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,220
He needs to feed you.

509
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,620
If you're not financially independent,

510
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,900
you lose your grounds for argument.

511
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,260
You were born

512
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,020
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

513
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,340
So you find

514
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,700
minor inconveniences unbearable.

515
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,820
I was born to a modest family.

516
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,540
Every day I wake up,

517
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,460
it's a 80-20.

518
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,380
80% of the time, the day sucks.

519
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,540
20% of the time, it's a good day.

520
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,140
If it's a bad day, I suck it up.

521
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,380
If it's a good day, I enjoy it.

522
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,460
I don't buy it.

523
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,940
You have fallen out
with your fake boyfriend.

524
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,220
So you're here to run away from reality.

525
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,580
But it's not a bad thing per se.

526
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,860
Come.

527
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,340
Cheers.

528
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,900
You're one step closer

529
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,260
to seeing through the world.

530
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,260
Come.

531
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,820
That reminds me.

532
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,980
I should do something about it.

533
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,120
(No more couple stream.
This account will cease getting updates.)

534
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,740
Wow.

535
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,820
You're very determined.

536
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,140
You have done it.

537
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,300
Now I have to teach my dad a lesson too.

538
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,100
I hope we can come to an agreement today.

539
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,460
Will you sign this divorce agreement or not?

540
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,340
I don't get it.

541
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,940
Why do you want a divorce?

542
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,250
I want to stop pretending.

543
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,820
You say all women want a man

544
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,730
who can work and look after a family.

545
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,210
It's almost impossible to find one.

546
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,540
But you did it.

547
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,730
Or at least, you act like one.

548
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,420
Unfortunately, my acting skill

549
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,340
is not as good as yours.

550
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,940
So let's call it quits.

551
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,940
I don't want

552
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,290
to spend the rest of my life

553
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,940
in this pretense.

554
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,980
I agree.

555
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,780
Dad.

556
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,700
You always say

557
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,740
that I give up easily.

558
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,260
I got an offer letter

559
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,340
but refused to study abroad.

560
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,380
I'm here to tell you why.

561
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,300
It was because I knew back then

562
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,220
that if I left home,

563
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,460
this family would collapse.

564
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,580
Do you think

565
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,980
I am an idiot

566
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,900
who knows nothing?

567
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,620
Mom was on anti-depressants.

568
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,740
I know that.

569
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,700
I thought by staying here,

570
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,780
I could keep this family together.

571
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,820
Apparently, I just wasted

572
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,220
several years of Miss Chen here.

573
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,700
Dad.

574
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,980
Sign it.

575
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,100
Mom has had enough with you.

576
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,080
(Divorce Agreement)

577
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,020
(Ancong Wig Shop)
An, what's the matter?

578
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,780
(Ancong Wig Shop)
You fought with Chuan again?

579
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,860
(Ancong Wig Shop)

580
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,140
(Ancong Wig Shop)
I don't care about him.

581
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,460
Mr. An.

582
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,380
I ran away from home.

583
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,580
Can I crash at your place
for a few days?

584
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,580
What happened?

585
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,020
She said

586
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,900
that I was born with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

587
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,900
So I have got to suffer a bit
to balance things up.

588
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,100
She also said

589
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,980
without financial independence,

590
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,460
you lost your grounds for argument.

591
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,220
So I get it now.

592
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,500
I will start
training very hard tomorrow.

593
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,580
I'll prove it to her
on the tennis court.

594
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,900
And you.

595
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,580
Are you quitting for real?

596
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,780
We drank that day for nothing then.

597
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,140
Liang You'an coddled that prick for nothing.

598
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,540
Honestly, what happened after drinking?

599
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,980
How did you two argue?

600
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,540
Stop scratching your head.

601
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,580
Answer me.

602
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,380
Sleep on the couch.

603
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,300
Well...

604
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,780
The tournament is around the corner.

605
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,740
You'll be the captain.

606
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,580
I won't go.

607
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,300
Wait.

608
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
Why me?

609
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,100
You're the captain.

610
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,260
How can you ditch

611
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,740
such an important tournament?

612
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,740
You skipped
all the recent training as well.

613
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,620
Do you know?

614
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,340
Liang You'an

615
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,580
has been working tirelessly.

616
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,180
She keeps looking for funding.

617
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,220
For practice venues.

618
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,620
All so that we can train

619
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,060
before the tournament.

620
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,460
Have you eaten?

621
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,220
I'll cook something for you.

622
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,380
Come.

623
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,460
Stop dodging

624
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,540
my question now.

625
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,220
Sit.

626
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,500
Think about it.

627
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,540
Even though the points

628
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,580
will all go to Pegasus,

629
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,100
the victory is still ours.

630
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,100
This is your first serious tournament

631
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,460
after you made the switch from
badminton to tennis.

632
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,540
Are you going to give up like that?

633
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,620
I have been playing tennis for years.

634
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,220
Before Liang You'an came,

635
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,780
I had never thought

636
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,300
that I would ever bring any result.

637
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,700
But look at us now.

638
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,900
Even Chen Zhe
wants to practice seriously now

639
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,820
and get the gold medal.

640
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,140
Don't take our fighting spirit for granted.

641
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,140
Why drop out?

642
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,740
Look.

643
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,060
You don't know what happened

644
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,620
between us.

645
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:38,860
I...

646
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,660
I don't know who crossed who first.

647
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,020
And frankly, I don't care.

648
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,700
But Song Sanchuan,

649
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,500
if you give up on a tournament

650
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,060
because you are in a bad mood,

651
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,620
then don't blame anyone
when we all look down on you.

652
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,020
I have made up my mind.

653
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,860
In this tournament,

654
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,340
I plan to get a gold medal in Group B.

655
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,020
At your level,

656
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,820
you can strive to get a medal

657
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,260
in lower brackets.

658
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,300
We trained so hard

659
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,940
for this day.

660
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,380
Think about it.

661
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,220
Go to sleep.

662
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm talking to you.

663
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,260
Do you hear me?

664
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,620
Jiaojiao.

665
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,860
Mr. An.

666
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,740
Have a good rest here.

667
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,460
Are you hungry?

668
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,060
No.

669
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,020
Let me cook you a bowl of noodles.

670
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,260
I...

671
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,620
Is this family

672
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,980
hard of hearing?

673
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,580
Or is there a problem
with my enunciation?

674
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,940
One, two, three.

675
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,500
Did I slur?

676
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,360
(Ancong Wig Shop)

677
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,860
Wake up.

678
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,580
It's late.

679
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,780
Coach Yan said

680
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,700
that today, we would do some sprinting practice.

681
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,380
Stop bothering me.

682
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm sleeping.

683
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,420
Hurry up.

684
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,060
There is no practice venue in the city.

685
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,980
We have to take the bus to the outskirt.

686
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,460
Don't just sit there.

687
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,300
Stop bothering me.

688
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
I said, I'm sleeping.

689
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,260
Rot in there.

690
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,140
Here.

691
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,300
This is the place.

692
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,300
Ms. Liang.

693
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,340
It's such a secluded place.

694
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,740
How did you find it?

695
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,220
The tennis courts in the city

696
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,980
are always booked.

697
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,660
The tournament is about to begin

698
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,300
so I try to stick to our training schedule.

699
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,300
Bear with me, guys.

700
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,140
And all the best.

701
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,100
Okay.

702
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,260
This is tough.

703
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,780
Where is Sanchuan?

704
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,820
He's skipping again?

705
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,900
He won't listen to me.

706
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,940
What is wrong with him?

707
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,780
Is he forfeiting the match then?

708
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,780
Get changed now.

709
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,100
Then do ten laps around the tennis court.

710
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,380
Why are you standing here?

711
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,420
Where is Jiaojiao?

712
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,180
He isn't awake?

713
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,980
Have you looked at the time?

714
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,260
He already left.

715
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:25,980
I...

716
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
He is absurd.

717
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,940
He has never been this eager
to train before.

718
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,740
He didn't even tell me.

719
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,460
Oops. Sorry.

720
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:44,780
Sorry.

721
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,140
Watch what you are watering.

722
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,060
My hand slipped.

723
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,340
Where are you going?

724
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,940
You want to know where we practice?

725
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,220
Tell me now.

726
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,020
Will you come with me or not?

727
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,100
No! No!

728
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,300
I already said no.

729
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,220
Stop asking.

730
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,980
I shouldn't have asked you,
Song Sanchuan.

731
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,020
Just let me win for once.

732
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,860
Oh my gosh.

733
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,260
Enticed?

734
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,020
You can still make it if you run now.

735
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,820
No, you.

736
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,540
