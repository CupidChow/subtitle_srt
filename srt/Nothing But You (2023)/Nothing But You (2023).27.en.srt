(Ancong Wig Shop)

5
00:01:58,248 --> 00:01:59,608
You sure know how to cook the lamb.

6
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:01,608
It's so salty that I don't even need
to dip it in the sauce.

7
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,048
Don't try to change the subject.

8
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,048
Liang You'an asked you
to avoid suspicion.

9
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,248
Yet, you're smug about it.

10
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,448
Why do you think
I need to avoid suspicion?

11
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,688
That's because
there's suspicion to avoid.

12
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:14,528
Suspicion, get it?

13
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,368
You have a point there.

14
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:20,888
You've progressed, kid.

15
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,728
After coming back this time,

16
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,368
I can't quite put it into words.

17
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,288
But it feels

18
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:28,368
like our relationship has changed a lot,

19
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:29,928
even though it hasn't changed that much.

20
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:31,448
Of course.

21
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:32,728
You guys went through

22
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:33,688
such difficult times together.

23
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,688
Your relationship
must have gotten closer.

24
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,368
Am I right?

25
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:37,728
You're right.

26
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:39,688
You think the same way too, right?

27
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,328
But listen.

28
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:43,728
About this thing,

29
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,128
you'll need to follow her pace.

30
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:47,408
You can't rush her.

31
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:49,968
No.

32
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,568
At least, I'm not that anxious anymore

33
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:54,328
because I have a better understanding
of the situation.

34
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,808
I even have followers

35
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:06,608
who like and comment on Chen Zhe's short videos

36
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:07,688
that I post every day.

37
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,488
As long as you maintain
a consistent frequency

38
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,128
of showing a person's face and visuals,

39
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:12,168
anyone will like that person

40
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,688
in less than a month.

41
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,208
The feelings will develop from liking
to some kind of emotional attachment.

42
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:18,488
Isn't this the best way

43
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,808
for us to attract and keep the member's loyalty?

44
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:23,848
Look,

45
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,568
I even made some fan merchandise.

46
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,528
Now the number of club members
has increased.

47
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:32,568
Can't this prove the effectiveness
of my operation?

48
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,208
If you put it that way,

49
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:35,768
there's indeed an increase

50
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,928
in female members
from corporate membership.

51
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:42,928
Now, all those who support Song Sanchuan

52
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:44,008
are young girls.

53
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,768
Do you have any issues with this?

54
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:47,528
Don't be ridiculous.

55
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,048
If I have any issues,
they are issues about making money.

56
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,288
Since more people are supporting him,

57
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:53,808
make more videos featuring him then.

58
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,488
Maybe we can attract more members.

59
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,328
Coach Xu,

60
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,848
I made some adjustments

61
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:05,608
to the class schedule for members.

62
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,008
You can take a look when you have time.

63
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:08,048
Okay, no problem.

64
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:08,608
- Okay.
- All right then.

65
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,207
Where are you going, Jiaojiao?

66
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:21,408
I'm not feeling well.

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,220
(Top Smash)

68
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:55,768
You are really dedicated.

69
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,488
You're always following the first place.

70
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,008
You're either filming or editing,

71
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,168
don't you get tired of it?

72
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,208
Many people have signed up
for membership lately.

73
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,208
They're all here
because of Song Sanchuan.

74
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,088
I have to take advantage of the trend

75
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,048
and attract more traffic.

76
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:09,688
You have a mentality
of admiring the strong.

77
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:10,728
You're too materialistic.

78
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,248
How am I being materialistic?

79
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,248
This is all for the good of the club.

80
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:16,128
If one day,

81
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,328
people also come to sign up because of you,

82
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,888
I will definitely promote you.

83
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,408
What are you doing here anyway?

84
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,688
Why are you wandering around
instead of training seriously?

85
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,448
All right. Do whatever you need to do.

86
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:30,368
Don't distract me from my work.

87
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:32,528
Why don't you keep editing?

88

(Top Smash)

89
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:41,328
Chuan,

90
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:42,928
your performance
this season is too good.

91
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,128
It's like you're cheating.

92
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,128
I felt the same way.

93
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:46,648
After playing tennis for so many years,

94
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,288
I've never seen such a talented player.

95
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:49,048
You can cut it out.

96
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:50,648
Did Jiaojiao leave

97
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:51,888
after he just started training?

98
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:53,768
It seems like it.

99
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:57,252
Since his portrait was hung up behind yours,

100
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:58,568
he has been a bit distracted.

101
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:03,728
Should I talk to him about it?

102
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:05,528
No need.

103
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:07,688
You should let me and Yi
handle something like this.

104
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:10,048
It might be awkward if you go.

105
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:11,448
It's not that serious.

106
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:12,808
We're all buddies here.

107
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,368
It's fine, I'll go talk to him.

108
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,568
That's pretty heavy.

109
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,528
I want to be alone for a while.

110
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,328
You're not leaving, are you?

111
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:43,408
All right.

112
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:45,168
I'll give you some space.

113
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,208
Come on, are you mad at me?

114
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:48,768
If you have any problems,
don't hold them in.

115
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:49,048
Just say it.

116
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,528
Yes, I'm upset with you.

117
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,928
I've been eyeing Tao for a long time.

118
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:54,688
But look what happens now?

119
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,608
She's following you around
because you're number one.

120
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,848
So this is what it's about.

121
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:01,968
I thought

122
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,048
you couldn't handle losing

123
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:03,968
because I surpassed you in the rankings.

124
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:05,088
Ridiculous.

125
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:07,128
Listen here, Song Sanchuan.

126
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:09,048
You only temporarily surpassed me.

127
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:10,248
Next time,

128
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,448
you'll be behind me.

129
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:13,288
All right, that's fine.

130
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:14,488
I feel assured

131
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,408
now that you've said that.

132
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:16,408
Keep training.

133
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:17,248
Give your all.

134
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,248
202,

135
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,368
we've been training together

136
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,328
since we were in Young Space.

137
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:30,768
Do you think I'm someone

138
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,448
who can't handle losing?

139
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:35,288
(Double Jiao, you're not someone
who can't handle losing.)

140
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,968
(You're just a bit unhappy.)

141
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:38,128
I admit

142
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:39,848
I'm unhappy.

143
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:42,408
But with myself.

144
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:43,648
(Double Jiao,)

145
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,208
(stop thinking about anything else.)

146
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:46,368
(Just focus on training.)

147
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:47,768
(If you train hard,)

148
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:49,208
(you'll be stronger than anyone else.)

149
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,888
(Come on, let's train together.)

150
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:59,768
(One. Two.)

151
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,960
(Top Smash)

152
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:04,168
Currently, we have two indoor courts

153
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:05,128
and four outdoor courts.

154
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,888
On the third floor,
there's a central court.

155
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:09,408
Regarding membership fees,
we offer discounts

156
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,768
on class packages

157
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,088
with different amounts stored on them.

158
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:12,808
Of course,

159
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,528
if you want to further improve your skills,

160
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,008
you can purchase a private coaching card

161
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,248
where the coaches
will give you private coaching.

162
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,848
It'll be charged at different rates

163
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,208
based on the coaches' level.

164
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:24,768
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,128
No photos are allowed

166
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:28,648
during private coaching sessions.

167
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,488
However, you're welcome

168
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,168
to observe the coaching sessions.

169
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:31,768
Okay.

170
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:38,408
Hello.

171
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:40,607
I'd like to ask
if I can select the coach I want

172
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,368
with the membership card here.

173
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,328
Yes.

174
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,448
But we also need to coordinate

175
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:46,288
with the coach's schedule.

176
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,928
Then are the ten professional players

177
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,168
also able to teach classes?

178
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,568
If the players are willing,

179
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,488
we have no rules saying
they're not allowed to.

180
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:57,888
Can I pay the membership fees now?

181
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,008
I'd like to apply for a membership card.

182
00:08:59,488 --> 00:08:59,968
Of course.

183
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:01,088
After you finish looking around,

184
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:02,728
you can come to my office to pay.

185
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,408
I also want to know

186
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:06,248
the maximum amount
that can be stored on the card here.

187
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:07,928
The maximum is 100,000 yuan,

188
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,008
valid for three years.

189
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:10,208
It's not that expensive.

190
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,408
Then I'll store that amount.

191
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:13,048
And I'd like to register

192
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:14,008
for the private coaching card
you mentioned just now.

193
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:15,888
Okay.

194
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:23,888
A big client.

195
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
(Top Smash Tennis Club Member Profiles)
Huang Yike.

196
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,488
Your date of birth?

197
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,368
April 16th, 2002.

198
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:51,208
Okay.

199
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:55,768
Here's how it works.

200
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,048
We'll have a dedicated coach

201
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,368
who will evaluate your skills.

202
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:02,488
Then we'll create

203
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:03,888
a personalized training plan for you.

204
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:05,208
With a credit of 100,000 yuan,

205
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,928
you'll be considered
a VIP member of our club.

206
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,048
You'll also have priority access

207
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,208
to our member activities,

208
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,688
training sessions, and seminars.

209
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:13,208
This is Liang Tao.

210
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,408
She'll be in charge of notifying you
of any upcoming events.

211
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,608
Other than her work number,

212
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:16,848
you can add her WeChat.

213
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:18,768
So you're considered
as my personal customer service.

214
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:20,128
You can see it that way.

215
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,288
Ke,

216
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,248
if you need anything,

217
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:23,408
you can contact me anytime.

218
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,568
Is it convenient for me
to have the training schedule

219
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:28,728
of your professional players?

220
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:32,488
I want to plan my schedule accordingly.

221
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:34,368
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,248
The training schedule
of our professional players

223
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,488
involves the arrangement

224
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:38,528
of their matches and training.

225
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,328
So it's not convenient to reveal it.

226
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:43,968
I see.

227
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:45,608
I'll text you through WeChat after this.

228
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,288
Okay.

229
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,128
What was that about?

230
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,688
She didn't even join any trial classes

231
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:55,728
and she's already paying such

232
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:56,568
a large membership fee.

233
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:58,528
She even wanted
to see our training schedule.

234
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:01,008
Is she a spy from a rival team?

235
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:03,128
What rival team would send a spy

236
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,408
and spend as much as 100,000 yuan
the moment she arrives?

237
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:06,768
Wouldn't it be too clumsy of her

238
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:08,048
for us to find out when she didn't say much?

239
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:08,928
I would love to have the rival teams

240
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:09,928
send me several more spies here, then.

241
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:11,448
You're right.

242
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,448
But my instinct is telling me

243
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:16,848
to watch her.

244
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,688
Her name is beautiful, and she's pretty.

245
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:21,568
Why can't she be here

246
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:22,848
for the sake of playing tennis?

247
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,448
He's looking at me. Look at me.

248
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,168
Oh, my. He's amazing.

249
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:38,728
He's awesome and handsome.

250
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:39,688
You're handsome!

251
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:47,648
Ms. Liang.

252
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:48,488
Gao,

253
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,368
I'd like to see

254
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,608
this month's sales record.

255
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,128
Okay, I'll get it for you.

256
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:52,928
Thank you.

257
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:01,888
It's very hot.

258
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,568
It is indeed hot.

259
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:08,848
Ever since Song Sanchuan
topped the photo wall,

260
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:10,288
have you noticed

261
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:11,968
that the club suddenly

262
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,128
has a lot of mediocre members?

263
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:16,048
In competitive sports,

264
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,408
strength is all about halo and filters.

265
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,848
Don't you think Sanchuan looks

266
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,968
more confident and handsome lately?

267
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:24,968
We can see it.

268
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:26,808
So can other people.

269
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,408
It's a good thing to be able to connect

270
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,128
with more people

271
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,168
and this world with warmth.

272
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,528
This brings us back to the classic topic
of the age-gap relationship.

273
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,888
You used unlimited tolerance
and patience

274
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,368
to wait for a boy to graduate from you.

275
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:44,928
But after he graduates,

276
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,928
it's another story

277
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:48,808
if he goes into your field.

278
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,888
Isn't this unrelated to age?

279
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,008
No matter you fall in love with anyone of any age,

280
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,808
he always has an idea
that wants to change careers.

281
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,408
Fine.

282
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,288
I shall see

283
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,088
if you're just talking tough

284
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:04,088
or if you're really tough.

285
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,048
Where's the sales record?

286
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,688
Why is she not here with it yet?

287
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,448
I'm so busy.

288
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,608
Why am I the only one who's busy?

289
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:25,848
Why aren't you working?

290
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,448
I've finished my work.

291
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,340
(Top Smash)

292
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,168
Okay, it's Chen Zhe's turn.

293
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,648
Hello, I'm a new member.

294
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,168
My tennis ball rolled over to your side.

295
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,568
Can you help me find it?

296
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:07,728
What brand?

297
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:08,848
Team.

298
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:11,128
Our club doesn't use this brand.

299
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,368
Did you bring it yourself?

300
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,528
Yes, so it's hard to find it.

301
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:15,488
Sorry for troubling you.

302
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:17,008
How about this?

303
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:18,208
After we finish our training,

304
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:19,448
I'll send it to you after I find it.

305
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:19,968
You should continue with your training.

306
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,688
It's okay. I'm not in a hurry.

307
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,888
You're charged by the hour
for using the court.

308
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:26,088
It'll be such a waste.

309
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,848
I'll send it over to you
after I find it.

310
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,248
Okay.

311
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,008
Then remember to give it to me

312
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,088
after you find it.

313
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:34,248
My name is Huang Yike.

314
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:35,648
You must give it back to me.

315
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:36,928
Okay.

316
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,520
(Top Smash)

317
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:47,768
Jiang Jiaojiao,

318
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,048
do you know what's the time now?

319
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,688
All the players are already training.

320
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:53,568
Why are you only here now?

321
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:54,648
Where's your racket?

322
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,048
If you keep having this attitude,

323
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,448
you can stop coming.

324
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,408
Who are you trying
to show you're being passive here?

325
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:03,848
I'm not trying to be passive.

326
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,088
I just feel a lack of energy.

327
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,408
Eat something if you lack energy.

328
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,528
It's been one week.

329
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,128
If you want to quit,

330
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,128
you should give away your rank.

331
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,208
Many people
would want to take that spot.

332
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,848
What are you going to do
if I don't want to train?

333
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,128
Coach Yan didn't even say anything.

334
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,328
Who are you to discipline me?

335
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:20,248
What?

336
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,248
Who do you think you're talking to?

337
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:31,608
Give me another pack of biscuits.

338
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:36,648
It's a total of 18 yuan.
Just scan this code.

339
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:39,648
All done.

340
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,768
Who taught you math at school?

341
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:51,168
The biscuit is seven yuan,

342
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:52,368
and two bottles of the beverage
are 12 yuan.

343
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:53,328
It's a total of 19 yuan.

344
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,408
Gosh.

345
00:15:58,488 --> 00:15:59,808
Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,848
Is it my fault if you miscalculate?

347
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,848
Cover the losses.

348
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,368
Do you get it now?

349
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,048
You can't even manage a side business

350
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,008
of running a small shop
besides playing tennis.

351
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:13,568
Yet you sit here selling things.

352
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,008
Gao went to the restroom.

353
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,088
I'm just watching it for her.

354
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,368
Not only I lost one yuan
from helping others,

355
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,328
but you also humiliated me.

356
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:22,928
What's wrong?

357
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:25,048
I'm fine.

358
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,008
Speak properly.

359
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:28,368
Don't be so annoying.

360
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:30,248
I said I'm fine.

361
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:31,688
I don't need you to be concerned.

362
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,648
Jiaojiao, I'm back.

363
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:34,968
Thanks.

364
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,288
Look at this.

365
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,448
Is this the ball?

366
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,328
You really found it.

367
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:52,208
It's nothing.

368
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:53,088
We just finished training.

369
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,008
So it was nothing.

370
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:55,088
Thank you.

371
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:58,128
Ms. Liang said

372
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:01,448
any professional players who are interested,

373
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,928
can arrange
for private coaching sessions.

374
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,208
Private coaching from the players?

375
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:07,488
Did Ms. Liang say that?

376
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:17,448
Look at this.

377
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
(Membership Class Schedule)
This is Huang Yike's schedule

378
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,848
(Membership Class Schedule)
for all her coaching sessions.

379
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:20,688
I finally understand

380
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:22,368
why she came to our club.

381
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,488
(Classes Schedule)
All her class schedules

382
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:25,608
(Classes Schedule)

383
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,527
(Classes Schedule)
coincide heavily with Song Sanchuan's.

384
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:31,488
What does that mean?

385
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:34,168
She's not here for the tennis,
she's here for the person.

386
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,008
She even asked me yesterday

387
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:38,328
if it's possible to choose Song Sanchuan

388
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,328
for the private coaching sessions
you mentioned before.

389
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:41,608
Isn't it obvious?

390
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,768
What's obvious or not?

391
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:47,328
You can arrange it.

392
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:48,288
I can't control it.

393
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:53,448
In any case,
Ke is coming at him aggressively.

394
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,128
If you agree,

395
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,648
I'll arrange for Song Sanchuan's
private coaching sessions.

396
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,768
If you shake your head,
I'll try to find someone else.

397
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:01,648
I don't think

398
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:02,688
you should be asking me about this.

399
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:04,128
You should ask him.

400
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:05,768
I have no problem with that.

401
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,008
Okay.

402
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:08,768
If you're okay with this,

403
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,648
I'll promote

404
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,288
the service of professional players

405
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:13,328
coaching corporate members.

406
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:14,488
Liang You'an.

407
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:18,848
A member just asked

408
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,928
about booking a private lesson with me.

409
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,168
Does our club offer
this kind of service?

410
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:30,568
Yes, we do.

411
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,368
After all, we are a corporate club

412
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:33,568
and we need to generate revenue
and save costs.

413
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:36,408
Well,

414
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,848
you're quite shrewd

415
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:39,288
with your schemes.

416
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:40,888
All right then.

417
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,968
I'll help the club and take on the job.

418
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,048
Generate revenue and save costs, right?

419
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,168
Would other players be willing
to do the same?

420
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:46,968
If they're not okay with it,

421
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:47,648
I'm okay to do it.

422
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:49,808
I'm okay with it too.

423
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,820
(Top Smash)

424
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,568
Let's make your swing even more perfect.

425
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:02,768
Do you still remember

426
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:03,688
the twisting movement
I taught you just now?

427
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,208
I still didn't quite understand it.

428
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,608
Can you teach me again?

429
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:07,928
Sure, let me show you again.

430
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,288
Make sure to position yourself
and the racket correctly,

431
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,008
and then follow through
with the swing completely.

432
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:14,688
Okay, watch this.

433
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:16,248
You can better control the direction

434
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:17,288
and landing of the ball this way.

435
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:18,488
Now you try it.

436
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:20,288
Is it like this?

437
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:22,248
Your hand needs
to be slightly straighter.

438
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,568
No, not like that.

439
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:24,848
Yes, that's right.

440
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,648
Then spread your fingers

441
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:27,808
and aim at your hitting point.

442
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:28,848
What comes after?

443
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:32,888
Hold your racket toward the end.

444
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:34,608
During your swing,

445
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:35,688
hold the racket facing downwards.

446
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:38,608
I'll feed the balls for you

447
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:39,688
and try swinging it out.

448
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:41,728
(What is he teaching?)

449
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:45,128
Not bad.

450
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:46,408
Pretty good.

451
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:47,768
You have a good aptitude for this.

452
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:49,408
Did you practice before?

453
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:50,968
I used to play for fun.

454
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:51,848
But I didn't expect

455
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,568
to become addicted to tennis.

456
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,208
I played badminton in high school.

457
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:59,048
So I have some basic skills.

458
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:01,288
Did you also play badminton before?

459
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:02,448
Don't tell me you did too.

460
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:03,488
What are the odds?

461
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:04,608
That's great.

462
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:05,968
Actually, these two types of sports...

463
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,008
(Why is he smiling?)

464
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:08,768
Ms. Liang.

465
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:10,768
I noticed that sometimes you compensate

466
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:11,808
with your wrist when hitting the ball,

467
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,088
and that's probably why...

468
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,408
Gao,

469
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,528
I want to see this month's sales record.

470
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:21,168
Didn't you see it the other day?

471
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,408
I want to see last month
and the month before that.

472
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:26,488
Okay, I'll go get them for you.

473
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,248
Can you get the sales record
from three months ago too?

474
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:28,688
Okay.

475
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,328
Thank you.

476
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:29,968
It's okay.

477
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,168
Can you also take a look at my racket

478
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,168
and see if it's suitable for me?

479
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,128
Your racket is too good.

480
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,408
To be honest,
it's a waste for you to use it.

481
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,648
Do you always speak
so straightforwardly?

482
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,248
I speak the truth.

483
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,568
Is this natural gut string?

484
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,128
The feel of this string is indeed good.

485
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,848
But it's not practical and too expensive.

486
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,048
I recommend you use
this polyester string.

487
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,048
It's softer

488
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,008
and can protect your wrist,

489
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,768
and it doesn't tear and wear easily.

490
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,528
Can I see your racket?

491
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:03,768
One Oreo, please.

492
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,288
Six yuan.

493
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,368
Scan here.

494
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:16,808
Okay, I'll change it after I get home.

495
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,648
Can I add you as my WeChat contact?

496
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:20,648
When I buy a new racket,

497
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,488
I can ask you.

498
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:24,328
(They're adding each other's WeChat?)

499
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:24,888
Okay.

500
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:27,808
Then after I add your WeChat,

501
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,488
I'll forward
our stringer's contact to you.

502
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,848
You can ask him
for any professional advice.

503
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:31,808
Okay.

504
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,208
Thank you, Coach Song.

505
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:38,048
Okay, you can practice for now.

506
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:39,088
I'll go get a drink.

507
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,008
What are you doing here?

508
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,008
Well,

509
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,768
Gao went to get something.

510
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:57,048
I was watching the store for a bit.

511
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,048
Would you like a drink?

512
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:01,448
No, no, no.

513
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,808
I'm busy and you're busy.

514
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:03,528
I'll twist the caps for you.

515
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,888
Play well and teach well.

516
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:07,848
Who'll watch the store if you leave?

517
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:16,728
I'll do it.

518
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:25,808
You finally have some time off.

519
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,088
Why are you still at the club?

520
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:30,888
I have some free time to myself

521
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,408
now that everyone's gone.

522
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:37,048
You're acting strange.

523
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:38,088
What's wrong?

524
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:39,248
I'm doing well.

525
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:41,208
Don't I know you well?

526
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,168
How about relaxing together
this weekend?

527
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,448
You can relax on your own.

528
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,088
I'm not going.

529
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:49,848
Fine, I'm leaving now.

530
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:51,488
Call me if you need anything.

531
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,008
202,

532
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:07,408
it's just the two of us now.

533
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,440
(FITURE Interactive Magic Mirror)
(Double Jiao.)

534
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:11,008
(Lonely times are a good opportunity)

535
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:12,448
(because no one)

536
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:13,728
(can affect your speed of improvement.)

537
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:16,008
(Come, let's practice together.)

538
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:17,648
I'm impressed

539
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,408
with what you said.

540
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:26,008
(One. Two.)

541
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:27,728
(One.)

542
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,940
(Top Smash)

543
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,448
The club was clearly closed.

544
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:07,248
But then I heard

545
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,688
the sound of a ball
being hit while editing.

546
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:10,128
I thought it was a ghost.

547
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,008
Why haven't you gone home yet?

548
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,768
I was working

549
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:15,728
on scheduling new training times
and locations all day.

550
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:17,008
I didn't have time
to edit the film I needed

551
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,528
to submit for Sunday.

552
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:19,208
I just finished it.

553
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:22,528
You're really a strange person.

554
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:24,768
You came to the club

555
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:26,088
after doing all sorts of things

556
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:28,008
and pretending
to be dedicated to your work.

557
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:30,608
I need to pay you back your money.

558
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,048
Those are all small matters.

559
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,768
Didn't you ask me

560
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:48,008
about my relationship with Liang You'an?

561
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:50,528
We have the same dad

562
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:51,608
with different moms.

563
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,888
So, you two are really siblings.

564
00:24:54,848 --> 00:24:56,528
When my parents had me,

565
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:58,208
her parents had just divorced for one year.

566
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:00,768
Then...

567
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,728
Are you saying that you're...

568
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,488
No, I'm not.

569
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:07,288
At least, they have assured me

570
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,408
that I'm not the child of a mistress.

571
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:13,528
But just like your reaction,

572
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:14,808
no one believes it.

573
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,568
In everyone's mind,

574
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,968
there's no difference
between being born out of wedlock

575
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:21,808
and being a result of an affair.

576
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:23,288
Of course, not.

577
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,248
The difference is huge.

578
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:29,008
As far as I can remember,

579
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:30,528
there has always been a comparison

580
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,128
between me and Liang You'an,

581
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:34,048
which was not spoken of

582
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:36,128
but everyone knows.

583
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,288
I didn't understand it.

584
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,168
Later, I gradually realized

585
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:41,888
that we must compete with each other.

586
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:43,768
The more outstanding she was,

587
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,008
the more I wanted

588
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,448
to prove my existence in front of her.

589
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,168
I don't know what she thinks of me.

590
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:50,568
Maybe she finds me annoying.

591
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,408
But one thing I know

592
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,768
is that my existence has at least given her

593
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:56,768
some pressure and motivation.

594
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:58,408
Otherwise,
she wouldn't be working so hard.

595
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:00,648
You said you have a good mentality

596
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:01,448
because you started from a low point.

597
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:02,368
Are you not lying to me?

598
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:03,968
Don't change the subject.

599
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,888
What I'm trying to say

600
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,168
is that you can try to use this mentality

601
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:09,488
to look at the fact that Song Sanchuan

602
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,408
has surpassed you.

603
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,568
I saw it from the moment

604
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:19,448
we switched positions in the photo,

605
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:21,288
you lost your sense of place.

606
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:28,048
I've always been the one leading

607
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:30,488
the pack since my time with Young Space,

608
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:33,608
and others have looked at my back
and worked hard.

609
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,088
I never thought about how to be second.

610
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:37,488
It's not that I can't admit

611
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:38,728
that my skills
are not as good as others.

612
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:41,328
I just don't know what to do now.

613
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:42,368
A few days ago,

614
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,048
I tried to learn Sanchuan's
playing style on the internet.

615
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:44,688
But

616
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:46,848
it didn't work out.

617
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,528
Why are you trying to copy his style?

618
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:50,768
Your own playing style

619
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:52,488
is already unique.

620
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:54,208
Yeah,

621
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,168
the comedian style.

622
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,288
You think I haven't seen

623
00:26:58,328 --> 00:26:59,328
those videos you posted?

624
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,648
It's all my fault, okay?

625
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:02,848
That's not what I meant.

626
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:05,008
Wait.

627
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,808
Did you listen to what

628
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:07,968
I just said about my dark history?

629
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:09,328
I wanted to say

630
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,368
from sports to the club.

631
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:12,888
Having only one strong player or team

632
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:13,768
will eventually lead to failure.

633
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,848
The twin stars are the most dazzling,

634
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,328
and having a worthy opponent

635
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,008
is more fun
than being a crown prince in a club.

636
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,728
I thought

637
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:28,608
no one in the club noticed

638
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:29,928
that I couldn't catch my breath.

639
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,128
I've been through more

640
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:35,128
in this period of time

641
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:36,328
than in my entire 20-something years.

642
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:39,968
I often think of what you said before.

643
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,768
I've had it too easy before,

644
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,408
so all the good things
have been used up.

645
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:54,568
Didn't you say

646
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,928
candies from the opening
bring good luck?

647
00:27:58,088 --> 00:27:58,888
Eat it to replenish your good luck.

648
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:01,368
You still have some left.

649
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,608
One for each of us.

650
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:06,768
I also need some good luck.

651
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:00,048
Tao.

652
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:09,448
Stop right there.

653
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:11,888
You better explain this.

654
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:14,288
Why did you kiss me?

655
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:15,968
There's a cost
for taking advantage of me.

656
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:18,528
I didn't take advantage of you.

657
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:19,608
I...

658
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,448
I really like you.

659
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:25,048
Can't you even tell?

660
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,008
Do you know
what it means to like someone?

661
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:30,288
Don't tell me

662
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:32,048
no other girls have ever looked down on you.

663
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,448
And I'm the only one
who finds you unpleasant,

664
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,248
it's too vulgar.

665
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:36,128
I don't have a masochistic tendency.

666
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,568
I really wanted to compete with you before,

667
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,848
but who knew as we competed,

668
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,728
I... I fell for you.

669
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:46,688
Now everything I see about you is perfect,

670
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,408
just like you're staying in my heart.

671
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:50,488
I don't believe you.

672
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:51,848
Who knows

673
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:53,688
if you'll come up with new tricks
to pull a prank on me?

674
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,008
I know.

675
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,448
Yes, I tricked you into going
to a fancy restaurant

676
00:29:58,448 --> 00:29:59,528
and then made you pay the bills

677
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,208
and made a fool of yourself
in front of the waiter.

678
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,168
And then on the rooftop,

679
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:05,208
I took a shower
while you were live streaming.

680
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:08,048
I was really being foolish.

681
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:09,368
But Tao,

682
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,168
I really do like you now.

683
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:14,968
You acted foolishly

684
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:16,288
and wanted me to accept
when you say you like me.

685
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:17,328
What do you take me for?

686
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,488
Those cliches from idol dramas might seem fun.

687
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,568
But they only lead to heartbreak in real life.

688
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:22,928
You need to calm down and think clearly.

689
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:23,608
I'm leaving.

690
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,168
What do you mean?

691
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,648
This isn't how a confession should go.

692
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:34,488
I'll pursue you seriously.

693
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:46,208
(I really like you.)

694
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:49,448
(Next time,)

695
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:50,968
no matter what your motives are,

696
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:52,448
don't casually

697
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:54,088
give your room key to a man, okay?

698
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:55,128
(Are you driving?)

699
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,088
Can you drop me off somewhere?

700
00:30:57,128 --> 00:30:58,248
The car is over there.

701
00:30:58,968 --> 00:30:59,968
I'll help you with your luggage.

702
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,408
Let's celebrate that you're close

703
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,048
to see through the world.

704
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:05,208
Here.

705
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:07,128
Look at this ball.

706
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:09,128
Throw it on the ground

707
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:10,768
and bounce,

708
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,728
then swing it again.

709
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:14,888
Life feels so real and sweet.

710
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:16,688
These are candies
from the opening ceremony

711
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:18,128
which I took from the front desk.

712
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,528
They bring good luck to you.

713
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:26,568
Is he serious?

714
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:29,168
Liang Tao,

715
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:30,168
come to your senses.

716
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:31,448
Don't be so impulsive.

717
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,088
Pay back what you owe
and he's not yours.

718
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,480
(Ancong Wig Shop)
Hold it steady.

719
00:31:58,608 --> 00:31:59,128
Okay.

720
00:31:59,368 --> 00:31:59,808
Okay.

721
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:01,608
By the way,

722
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:05,648
if you follow this public account,

723
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:07,728
I'll give you a five-yuan discount.

724
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:09,248
Of course.

725
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,920
(Top Smash)

726
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:14,768
Why is this a tennis club?

727
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:15,608
Well,

728
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:18,408
my son plays tennis here.

729
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,008
Tell you what.

730
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:20,288
This club is really great.

731
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,168
If you have friends who want to play,

732
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:23,608
I'll give you a discount.

733
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:24,848
That's good.

734
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:26,088
I'll help you share it.

735
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:27,168
What? You'll share it too?

736
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:27,528
Okay.

737
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:28,448
That's great.

738
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:29,728
Then I'll be more generous

739
00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:30,528
and give you a ten-yuan discount.

740
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,368
Okay, thank you.

741
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:32,808
Okay.

742
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:33,448
I paid.

743
00:32:33,528 --> 00:32:34,688
Okay, please come again.

744
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:35,488
Okay, see you.

745
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:36,408
See you.

746
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:39,968
When did we have this code?

747
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:44,208
I was just browsing
here and there before.

748
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:46,608
Isn't your news and reports in it?

749
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:48,048
Later, I found

750
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,848
that the content is done very well

751
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,088
and has a positive energy.

752
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:53,288
I thought everyone should follow it,

753
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:55,088
and advertise it for you.

754
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:58,048
No wonder.

755
00:32:58,408 --> 00:32:59,408
I heard that our public account

756
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:00,848
has gained a lot of followers recently.

757
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:02,408
So it was because of you.

758
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:03,368
Really?

759
00:33:04,168 --> 00:33:05,808
Is it really effective?

760
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,248
Then I have to print more
and stick them at the door.

761
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:10,248
Then let the neighbors help to spread it.

762
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:12,408
Why do you care so much

763
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,088
about our club?

764
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:17,488
I understand the ways of the world.

765
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:20,328
We received
such great kindness from her.

766
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:23,408
We cannot ignore her affairs.

767
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:27,008
I was talking
about you and Liang You'an.

768
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,368
Why haven't you made any progress?

769
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,008
Your birthday is coming up next week.

770
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:36,008
How do you plan to celebrate it?

771
00:33:36,408 --> 00:33:37,488
I'll pass.

772
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:38,648
A professional athlete's getting older

773
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:39,968
isn't really something
worth celebrating.

774
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:41,248
But

775
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,168
you have to eat a meal, right?

776
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:44,488
Well,

777
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:45,808
how about I transfer you 500 yuan

778
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:46,848
as a birthday gift?

779
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:48,488
Take the initiative

780
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:49,928
and take her out for a meal.

781
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:52,688
I'm still talking about Liang You'an.

782
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:56,608
What's going on?

783
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:57,848
Are you having difficulties?

784
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,288
Come on, tell me about it.

785
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:02,648
I'm bad at sports.

786
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,368
But I do have
some experience in this area.

787
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:07,288
I don't know

788
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:09,567
what's the matter.

789
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,728
Something seems off

790
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:12,368
about her lately.

791
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,728
It's like all she cares about is work.

792
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:19,808
Does she often

793
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:22,647
treat you coldly for no reason?

794
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:26,248
I'm busy, and you're busy too.

795
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:26,968
I've already twisted the cap...

796
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:27,928
Play well,

797
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,167
and teach well.

798
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:34,248
I get it now.

799
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:35,728
This is just like

800
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:36,888
you're going through
a bottleneck in tennis.

801
00:34:37,528 --> 00:34:38,528
But in a relationship,

802
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:39,167
what do you call this?

803
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:40,567
It's called a period of fatigue.

804
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,408
Don't use that analogy, please.

805
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:43,808
It is what it is.

806
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:45,328
Think about it.

807
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:46,008
You both have been in the same club

808
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:47,248
for a long time,

809
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:47,768
right?

810
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:48,968
She's the manager

811
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:50,248
and you're the player.

812
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:51,928
The relationship is too dull.

813
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:55,248
What does love need?

814
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,688
It needs that kind of excitement.

815
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,408
Jeez, stop it.

816
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:01,648
I think you're the one
who's looking for excitement.

817
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,888
Just listen to me. I'm right on this.

818
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:05,488
Rather than

819
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:06,488
guessing her thoughts

820
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:07,928
while staying in the club,

821
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:09,728
why don't you take the initiative

822
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,808
to create some opportunities

823
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,088
for just the two of you

824
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,128
and seize the right moment

825
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:14,848
to make a move?

826
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:16,448
An!

827
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:18,808
Coming!

828
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:21,848
Think about what I said.

829
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:23,008
Just go and sell your wig.

830
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,088
You're inexperienced but still...

831
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,088
I'm coming.

832
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,300
(Top Smash)

833
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,960
(Recent Overview of Top Smash Tennis Club)

834
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:41,248
(Recent Overview of Top Smash Tennis Club)
Sorry for making you come

835
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:42,808
all the way here, Alex.

836
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:44,488
I wanted to consult

837
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:46,208
your professional advice on something.

838
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:48,608
Top Smash is now

839
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,768
one of the hottest clubs in the city

840
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,568
and I feel like my 1% stake
is too small.

841
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,128
Professional advice is fine.

842
00:35:57,808 --> 00:36:00,408
Then I'll have to consider it
as a technical investment.

843
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,888
Do you even realize how you sound?

844
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,208
How can a boss bargain

845
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,648
with an employee like this?

846
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,808
What do you think is the greatest value

847
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:12,008
of a talent scout's job?

848
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,648
Discover the best-hidden potential

849
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,368
of players below a certain level.

850
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:20,488
Create the best professional environment

851
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:22,648
for players at or above a certain level.

852
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:23,928
The two you mentioned

853
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,208
are surface-level jobs.

854
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:26,288
But in reality,

855
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:27,568
we're doing the same thing,

856
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:28,928
which is creating stars.

857
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:31,288
Look at it this way.

858
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:32,928
Among professional sports

859
00:36:33,288 --> 00:36:34,408
that are more mature

860
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:36,048
and developed globally

861
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:38,768
like basketball, football,

862
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:39,928
rugby, and tennis,

863
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,448
none of them can do
without star players.

864
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:43,648
The value of commercial sports

865
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:45,848
must ultimately be reflected in this.

866
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:48,728
Actually, I already know
what you want to ask.

867
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:49,608
You want to know

868
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,808
about his professional development, right?

869
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:55,648
He's in good shape now.

870
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,608
So I hope he can take one step forward.

871
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,848
How can I help him?

872
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,768
The biggest factor in creating stars

873
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,328
in competitive sports
is their competitive strength.

874
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:09,088
Song Sanchuan has already ranked first

875
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,368
this month.

876
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,488
So this is the best opportunity.

877
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:13,928
You've been promoting his switch

878
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:15,608
from badminton to tennis,

879
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,528
which I think is a great story.

880
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:18,408
But if you continue

881
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:19,808
to use this promotional campaign

882
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,608
to convert members,

883
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:23,288
it's a marketing victory,

884
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,728
not a professional one,

885
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:26,128
and it won't last.

886
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:32,368
Can I understand

887
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:34,168
that people know Song Sanchuan

888
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:36,408
because of his switch to tennis?

889
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,008
In the next stage,

890
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:39,328
we want everyone to forget

891
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:40,728
that he came from badminton

892
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:44,128
and see him as a true professional tennis player.

893
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:46,808
That's right.

894
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,888
I like working with smart people.

895
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,248
It makes things so much easier.

896
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,928
Do you think he has a chance

897
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,688
to play in an international event this year?

898
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:57,968
That's a bit too optimistic.

899
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:01,088
But I think improving his tournament level

900
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,808
is the right direction.

901
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:04,528
Okay.

902
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:06,088
I'll start planning.

903
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,408
(International match.)

904
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:15,248
(What international matches
are coming up recently?)

905
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:27,208
It's my birthday this Saturday.

906
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:28,488
So...

907
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:29,688
Are you free?

908
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,008
I want to buy you a meal.

909
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,168
Just us?

910
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:36,688
We can do something else

911
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,928
if you don't want to eat.

912
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:39,968
Chuan,

913
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:41,848
your birthday is coming up
this weekend, right?

914
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:42,928
I'll plan a celebration for you

915
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:44,528
and get you a big gift.

916
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:47,568
No, it's okay.

917
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:49,168
I don't really celebrate my birthday.

918
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:50,288
Forget about it.

919
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,248
You don't like celebrating it
because they were not the right friends.

920
00:38:52,368 --> 00:38:54,888
Now, you have us this year. Am I right?

921
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:56,888
Listen. Just do as we say.

922
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:57,928
No, I'm serious.

923
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,168
Don't bother.
I'll take care of everything.

924
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:00,808
Let's have a meal, go singing,
and hit the nightclubs.

925
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:01,768
We'll do all three in one go.

926
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:02,568
What do you say?

927
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:03,408
You don't have to go to any trouble.

928
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,608
I'm not celebrating.

929
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,328
I'm serious. I'm not celebrating.

930
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:06,008
How boring.

931
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:07,608
It's not even your birthday.

932
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:09,088
Of course, he doesn't like it.

933
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:10,608
Then do you have any fun ideas?

934
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:14,888
Playing Frisbee is really popular right now.

935
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:17,288
I know this.

936
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:18,208
I've heard classmates talking about it

937
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:19,408
and I've been wanting to try it out.

938
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:20,048
That's right.

939
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,608
I've watched some videos

940
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:23,568
that say playing Frisbee
uses the same power chain

941
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:24,488
as playing tennis,

942
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:26,528
like swinging your arm
and rotating your body.

943
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:27,568
Really?

944
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:28,688
Is it that much fun?

945
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:29,688
Of course.

946
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,968
Song Sanchuan,

947
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,488
can I join too?

948
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,048
I happen to have a friend

949
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,648
who runs a Frisbee club.

950
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:37,328
Why don't we go there?

951
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:38,368
I'll go.

952
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:39,328
I think it's a good idea.

953
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:41,168
I'll go then.

954
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,048
Okay, then. When that time comes,

955
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,168
you can come too.

956
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,408
Let me check

957
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:48,968
if I have something on my schedule.

958
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,008
Ms. Liang,

959
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,888
we've been running the club for so long

960
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:55,128
and haven't organized an event yet.

961
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:57,208
Can you take a day off for yourself?

962
00:39:57,888 --> 00:39:59,088
Yeah, Ms. Liang.

963
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:00,768
Are you going to skip Song Sanchuan's
birthday party?

964
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,688
Come on, just join us.

965
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,248
Come on.

966
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,448
Is this the style of your club?

967
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,168
Do you all like to play
with the boss like this?

968
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,368
Will it become a team-building activity?

969
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:10,448
I heard playing Frisbee requires

970
00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:12,928
a high level of physical fitness.

971
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,728
Ms. Liang, can you manage?

972
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:15,768
Why don't you youngsters go ahead?

973
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:16,968
I won't be going.

974
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:18,288
I'm occupied that day.

975
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:21,208
Then you can come after you finished work.

976
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:22,848
We don't have to play Frisbee.

977
00:40:22,848 --> 00:40:23,648
We can go singing.

978
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:24,928
It's okay. We'll talk about this later.

979
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:27,848
Then...

980
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:30,208
Let's create a group chat.

981
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,248
Don't forget to come.

982
00:40:31,568 --> 00:40:32,008
Come.

983
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:32,648
What's the password?

984
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,048
Four zeros.

985
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:35,648
