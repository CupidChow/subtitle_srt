00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,000
=Nothing But You=

2
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,660
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,740
(It's hard to approach you.)

4
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,320
Liang You'an, huh?

5
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Hit me.

6
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,680
Hit me!

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
Next time,

8
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,360
I'll give

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,560
your so-called sponsor a warm welcome.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
Seems like

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,320
you do know her after all.

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,600
Let's go!

13
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,840
You want to save a damsel in distress
when you're just a dufus?

14
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

15
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,920
Sorry for being late.

16
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,240
This place is pretty nice.

17
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
It's so far away from the company.

18
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
How did you find it?

19
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,960
My friend recommended it to me.

20
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,520
To be honest, I'm not really

21
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,880
familiar with the area yet.

22
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
This bar is great.

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,480
It has a great atmosphere.

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,720
The music here is nice too.

25
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,920
Come.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Cheers.

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,440
Cheers.

28
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,840
Where will you be staying this time?

29
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
In a hotel.

30
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,240
I sold my house

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,000
in Shenzhen.

32
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
I heard that you might

33
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
move to Singapore.

34
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,120
What about you?

35
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
What future plans do you have?

36
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,520
Do you mean work?

37
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,880
Right now, I'm still working

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,480
as Mr. Jie's personal assistant.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,080
If there's an opportunity for you

40
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,360
to head to Singapore,

41
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
will you take it?

42
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Although personal assistants

43
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,400
work in the president's office,

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
we're actually isolated

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,040
from other departments.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Singapore?

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Forget about getting a promotion.

48
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,760
I think it'll be difficult for me
to apply for a normal transfer.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
What if you're not
heading there for work?

50
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
What if you're there to live with me?

51
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,680
I think you should know

52
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
that I like you pretty much.

53
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
And, I can feel

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,440
that you have feelings for me.

55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,640
I worked as an expatriate
for the past two years.

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
So we worked at different cities.

57
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Don't you think

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,960
we haven't seen

59
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,680
each other for a long time?

60
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,120
So?

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
I plan

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,800
to settle down this year.

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
At my age,

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,520
it's time to consider marriage.

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,400
I like how mature

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,000
and intelligent you are.

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Marriage between adults

68
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,080
is

69
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
just about the right timing.

70
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
Just like what you had said,

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,960
you have reached

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,320
an awkward phase

73
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
in your career.

74
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,400
If you're considering marriage as well,

75
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,440
would you like to give it a try?

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,920
I...

77
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
I truly didn't expect us

78
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,320
to discuss such a deep topic

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
during our drinking session.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
We're not young anymore.

81
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,399
It's better to be frank.

82
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
It's easier on everyone,

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,320
don't you think so?

84
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
But of course,

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,480
I don't expect you to
give me a reply immediately.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
I need to stay here
for another two months.

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
really take marriage seriously.

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,080
It's just that I never expected someone

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,880
to discuss this topic with me

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
in such a situation.

92
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,040
Don't misunderstand me.

93
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm not saying

94
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,240
that we need to skip

95
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
the "falling-in-love" phase.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
I just mean

97
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
that we can treat marriage

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,080
as our highest goal.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
And now,

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm also expressing my stand

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,560
with a sincere attitude.

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,840
I thought the competition

103
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
Jin Yi joined today was
just a commercial act?

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
Why should we spectate him?

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
Signing a potential
spokesperson like him

106
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,600
is different from

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,360
signing a short-term spokesperson
with short exposure.

108
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,440
Companionship and care

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,600
are the core values here.

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Think about it.

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,280
When Nike sponsored Li Na,

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,040
she was only 16 back then.

113
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,160
After they signed her,

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
they almost went to every competition

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,520
she competed in

116
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,360
until they witnessed it
as she won the French Open.

117
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
Half an hour before

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,360
the victory press,

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,040
they gave her

120
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,600
a T-shirt that wasn't for sale yet.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
That year, Li Na was
already 30 years old.

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,280
After hearing that,

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,680
it does seem like a long-term project.

124
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,180
(Shenyue Cup Badminton Challenge)

125
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,420
(Shenzhen City
15th Shenyue Cup Badminton Challenge)

126
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:51,020
(Fight for your dream, time to shine)

127
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
Nice! You can do it!

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Aren't you the one...

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
What's your name again?

130
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
We saw him at the cafe last time.

131
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,480
Song Sanchuan.

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,600
That's right.

133
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,800
He's Jin Yi's teammate.

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,040
He's also a badminton player.

135
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
This is my colleague, Ming Yu.

136
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,280
Are you here to deliver
the sponsored goods?

137
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,320
You don't need to look around.

138
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,400
Oscom won't show up

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,680
at a competition of this scale.

140
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,800
You can deliver your goods
without any worries.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
Aren't you playing today?

142
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,360
It doesn't matter to me anyway.

143
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
I just treat it as a job.

144
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,120
It's fine as long as they pay me.

145
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,120
I heard from the coach

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,840
that you had great techniques.

147
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,960
It's just that you don't perform well

148
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
during competitions.

149
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Could it be that you still haven't found

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
the cause of your issue?

151
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Psychological counseling,

152
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,440
increasing the intensity of training,

153
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,800
changing techniques,

154
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
I've tried everything I could.

155
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm known as the bench warmer,

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
Song Sanchuan.

157
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
Liang You'an, huh?

158
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,560
Next time,

159
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,720
Next time, I'll give

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,560
your so-called sponsor a warm welcome.

161
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,920
Do you play badminton?

162
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
Me? I don't.

163
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,120
If so, you should stop pretending
that you know

164
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,080
how to bring me to my senses.

165
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,000
You're here?

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,440
This competition is nothing.

167
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
It's not even good enough
to be an appetizer.

168
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,360
You guys don't need
to come here personally.

169
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,560
We should be here.

170
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,440
It just so happens that your custom

171
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,920
jersey and sports shoes
have arrived too.

172
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,160
Take them back and try them on.

173
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
You can wear them

174
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,920
for your training next time.

175
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,480
Don't say that.

176
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,640
Since you already brought them here,

177
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,000
you should show them to me.

178
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,080
What the heck?

179
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,720
Not bad at all.

180
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,240
It fits you perfectly.

181
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,200
Didn't you bring any drinks?

182
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Sorry about that.

183
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,200
We were negligent.

184
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,440
I'll buy them right away.

185
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
Do you know how many teammates I have?

186
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,440
Can you bring all the drinks back

187
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,040
by yourself?

188
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
You're right.

189
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,720
I'll join you.

190
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
We can buy more.
After that, we'll tell them

191
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,120
it's Yi's treat.

192
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,840
Let's go.

193
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,580
(Song Sanchuan, Shenzhen Xinyi)

194
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,800
Chuan.

195
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,640
Chuan,

196
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,880
I think

197
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,520
you shouldn't

198
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
change your play style and strategy.

199
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,040
Your net shot is impeccable.

200
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,280
Why did you give up

201
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,640
in the last two years?

202
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,680
Why can't you

203
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,000
just take one more step ahead?

204
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,440
Why did you study my play style?

205
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,880
I didn't.

206
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,120
I...

207
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,280
I saw you winning the championship
when I was very young.

208
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,720
You were always my role model

209
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,960
in the youth team.

210
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,040
I tried so hard to get into
the youth team

211
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,160
so that I could become your teammate.

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,480
But I never expected you

213
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
to end up like this.

214
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,720
Go and do your warm-ups.

215
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,560

233
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
(I tried so hard to get into
the youth team)

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,680

(Could it be that

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,560
(Song Sanchuan,)

240
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,880

241
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240

242
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,720

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,280
(Must you make me angry?)

245
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,200
(If you commit another mistake,)

246
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,920
(you have to train until)

247
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
(you won't commit that mistake again.)

248
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
(Player, please resume the competition.)

249
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,800
(Player, please resume the competition.)

250
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,900
(Shenzhen Xinyi Sports Training Base)

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,840
Regarding the signing bonus

252
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,920
for next year,

253
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,560
the company doesn't have
any issues with it.

254
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,240
I think it's fine too.

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,360
Okay.

256
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Mister.

257
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,920
If so, may we have
a pleasant cooperation.

258
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,840
Likewise.

259
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,640
You let him wear the jersey
of Young Space

260
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
during a competition?

261
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,080
I don't think that's appropriate of you
to do so.

262
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
Oscom's sponsorship deal

263
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,680
hasn't ended yet.

264
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
It's rare to find a talent like him.

265
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,240
That's why we wish to hold
a fair competition for him.

266
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
You're right about that.

267
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,680
But I still need

268
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,840
to remind you guys of this.

269
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,800
We've been working together
with Jin Yi for a long time.

270
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,640
He's more at ease when he works
together with people he knows.

271
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,240
Send my regards to Mr. Jie.

272
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
Take care.

273
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm sure he gave this to Oscom.

274
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,360
He does know

275
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
how to raise his own value, huh?

276
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,720
We have plenty to discuss.

277
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,960
Let's go.

278
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,000
Yi,

279
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,920
Young Space wants to sign you

280
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,400
while Oscom isn't willing to let you go.

281
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,120
You're so popular.

282
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,680
Oscom even has a picture of you?

283
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,040
Did they plant a spy

284
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,840
inside the training court?

285
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,720
Are you guys dumb?

286
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,040
Yi, don't tell me you...

287
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,440
You're business-minded indeed.

288
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
You used Young Space
to your advantage, huh?

289
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,360
They're the ones who want to sign me.

290
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,040
It's not like
I'm begging them to sign me.

291
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,080
You see,

292
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
I only work together with people I like.

293
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,200
Who told her

294
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,920
to be Song Sanchuan's friend?

295
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,400
That's right.

296
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,760
So what if I tricked her?

297
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,880
There's no issue with that.

298
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,079
Let's go!

299
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,040
Time to have lunch.

300
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's go and have lunch.

301
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,599
- Yi!
- Yi!

302
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Yi!

303
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,119
I'm helping you to cool yourself off.

304
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,160
Song Sanchuan!

305
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,839
Stop pretending to be tough!

306
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,280
Why does Liang You'an want to sign me

307
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,120
instead of you

308
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,880
if you're truly that capable?

309
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,680
- Yi!
- Yi!

310
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,360
Yi,

311
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,440
I'll pull you up.

312
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Song Sanchuan!

313
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,160
You didn't need to do that.

314
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
I have plenty of ways to deal with him.

315
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,880
It's fine if he tries to offend me.

316
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,320
But he's putting you on the spot
using me as his excuse.

317
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,280
He's out of his mind.

318
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
Have you two always been like this?

319
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
It's the same for everyone.

320
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,400
The entire world is filled
with their imaginary rivals.

321
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
It's either you win, or you lose.

322
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
It's the same for everyone.

323
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960
When I was reviewing

324
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,440
your profile,

325
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,200
I watched the video of your match

326
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
with Jin Yi two years ago.

327
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Back then,

328
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,960
you began to flop

329
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,200
when Jin Yi made a comeback

330
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,440
and made it 18 all.

331
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,480
So, 18 all,

332
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,360
is that the cause of your trauma?

333
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
Did it start from that competition?

334
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,080
There's no trauma.

335
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,440
There are endless reasons

336
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,080
as to why one loses a competition.

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,280
But in the end,
it all boils down to this.

338
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,040
You're just not good enough.

339
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,640
So, you don't need

340
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,760
to analyze my situation for me.

341
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,920
I know my own condition

342
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,040
the best.

344
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,480
(Youth Badminton Competition Medal)
(So, 18 all,)

345
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,320
(is that the cause of your trauma?)

346
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,840
Say,

347
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,000
why did Mom leave us?

348
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,560
It's fine.

349
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,120
We can do well by ourselves.

350
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,280
I'll care for you.

351
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
You got the silver medal?

352
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:37,960
It's fine.

353
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,840
Clarify yourself.

354
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,920
Is she abandoning me?

355
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,160
What nonsense are you saying?

356
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,520
There's an opportunity

357
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
for her to be a coach overseas.

358
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,920
Your mother was in a bad mood.

359
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,720
She wanted to have
a change of environment.

360
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,360
That's why she left me

361
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
to you, my stepfather.

362
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
What's the matter?

363
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,000
Are you troubled by something?

364
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
I don't feel like playing
badminton anymore.

365
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,040
It's no fun.

366
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,240
Did you lose?

367
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,000
Have I ever won before?

368
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,720
Look at what you're saying.

369
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,040
You won plenty of competitions.

370
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,800
Besides,

371
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,560
it's common for you to lose.

372
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,600
Even top players

373
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,240
lose their matches

374
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,480
all the time.

375
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
If you want to quit,

376
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
what do you want to do then?

377
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
Don't tell me you want
to make wigs with me?

378
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,000
An Cong.

379
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,920
Forget it.

380
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,640
It's nothing.

381
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,720
What is it? Out with it.

382
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,080
You're a man...

383
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
I want to move out.

384
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,560
Wait.

385
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,960
Are you going to part ways with me?

386
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,640
Your wig shop

387
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,880
smells terrible.

388
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,200
It has a strong smell.

389
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,440
And, I don't know
who the scent belongs to.

390
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,520
I only see

391
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
unlucky people here.

392
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,680
I hate it the most

393
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,480
when you tell everyone

394
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:31,920
that I'm your son.

395
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Am I?

396
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,160
I was never your son.

397
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,200
I don't understand at all.

398
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,680
Haven't you had enough

399
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,600
of being my fake father?

400
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,600
I...

401
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,840
I was always

402
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,160
an outcast.

403
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,240
People hated me.

404
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,680
Don't let your imagination run wild.

405
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,520
No one dares to say that about you.

406
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,560
Chuan,

407
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,600
compared to those

408
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,880
who are trying their best
just to survive,

409
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,120
the obstacles we face

410
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,760
are nothing.

411
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,040
But if you truly wish

412
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,680
to move out,

413
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,000
I...

414
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,160
I won't stop you.

415
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,560
Coming.

416
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,840
Hello. Do you need me

417
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
to help you move them?

418
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,280
No thanks.

419
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
I can do it myself.

420
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,680
Okay.

421
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,160
Have this.

422
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,640
Mom,

423
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,920
there are only the two of us.

424
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
You don't need to
prepare so many dishes.

425
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
I can't finish all of them.

426
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,920
You lost weight.

427
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Was it because of work?

428
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,320
Did I?

429
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,600
I'm still the same.

430
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
You shouldn't go on a diet.

431
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,440
Many girls out there

432
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
want to go on a diet

433
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
just to pretend to be beautiful.

434
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,280
My daughter is slim and beautiful.

435
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,640
You don't need to do that.

436
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,360
But I realize

437
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,160
that I have to control my food intake.

438
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,240
Do you know something?

439
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,680
I'm at the stage

440
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,600
where I'll grow fat from drinking water.

441
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,640
As we grow older, our metabolism rate

442
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,720
does slow down.

443
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,880
If so, mine is even slower.

444
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,960
If so, next time,
you shouldn't come here

445
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,760
bringing bags and bags
of food supplies with you,

446
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,480
as if you're a party leader visiting
and consoling

447
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,720
those who are living in poverty.

448
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,560
I live alone.

449
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
I can't finish all of them.

450
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,400
I didn't buy anything expensive.

451
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,120
They're just heavy.

452
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,360
I can buy them,
but I can't move them myself.

453
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,480
Who can I blame then?

454
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,320
I can only blame myself for being blind

455
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:47,960
when I was young.

456
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
Now that I'm old and alone,

457
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,000
I have to find someone
to deliver the rice sack I bought.

458
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
I'm done with him.

459
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm completely done with him.

460
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,240
But you're different.

461
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,200
That's the thing

462
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,360
I can never forgive myself for.

463
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,080
Mom,

464
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm doing good.

465
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,240
I'm serious.

466
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,640
I didn't suffer any grievances.

467
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
Eat up.

468
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Eat up.

469
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,800
I assume Liang Shu and his daughter

470
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,760
didn't ask you for any money, right?

471
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,560
Fish begins to stink at the head.

472
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,240
They're a pair of scoundrels indeed.

473
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,800
In modern terms,

474
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,120
we call it a seamless transition.

475
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,160
He only divorced me for one year,

476
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
yet his mistress
already gave birth to his child.

477
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
Who would believe it if he said

478
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,000
that it wasn't an extramarital affair?

479
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,960
Come.

480
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,080
Let's enjoy our meal.

481
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,760
Don't bring them up, okay?

482
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,160
Let's eat.

483
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,880
Eat up.

484
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,240
You'an,

485
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,440
don't fall in love,

486
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,600
don't get married,

487
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,320
and never get a child.

488
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Everyone in the world might harm you

489
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,280
except for yourself.

490
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,440
Even I'm doing harm to you right now.

491
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,800
When I think about it,

492
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
I feel like I've let you down.

493
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,840
Mom,

494
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,480
you mustn't think of it that way.

495
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,280
Liang Shu can never hurt me

496
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,920
no matter what he does.

497
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,920
However, whenever

498
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,640
you say things like these,

499
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,400
I feel

500
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,640
very uncomfortable.

501
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
And,

502
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,600
I don't

503
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,360
expect anything from a marriage.

504
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,320
You don't need to worry about me.

505
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,120
I knew it.

506
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
My daughter

507
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,440
is smarter than everyone else.

508
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,640
Eat up.

509
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
(Liang You'an,)

510
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,800
(didn't I remind you to keep a low
profile and maintain high efficiency)

511
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,400
(when it comes to Jin Yi?)

512
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Now, Oscom

513
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,640
knows that we're trying
to steal him from them.

514
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,080
They're readjusting their offers.

515
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,720
Now, we have to increase

516
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
our signing bonus

517
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,080
because of you.

518
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,400
Mr. Jie,

519
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,440
I wish to report it to you

520
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,800
on Monday.

521
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,960
Regarding Jin Yi's long-term contract,

522
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,840
I think we should
consider it thoroughly.

523
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,560
That's Monday.

524
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,040
Draft up a new contract

525
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,640
within the next two days.

526
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I've already mentioned Jin Yi

527
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,560
to Mr. Gao.

528
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,880
We must close the deal within one week.

529
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,600
Okay.

530
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,600
I understand.

531
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,940
(Young Space Underdog Project Exclusive
Sponsorship and Brand Cooperation Agreement)

532
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,940
(A link shared by Peachy Peach,
take note of this before buying shoes)

533
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
(I didn't take a sip)

534
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
(or grab a bite.)

535
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,560
(However,)

536
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,280
(I did get myself)

537
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,720
(plenty of beautiful clothes.)

538
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,360
(I'll show them to you guys)

539
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
(one by one later.)

540
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,760
(I just finished my meal.)

541
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,120
(Now, I'm taking a walk downstairs.)

542
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,440
(Back then, when
I was viewing this unit,)

543
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
(I loved)

544
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,160
(its green landscape the most.)

545
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,760
(It's safe and comforting.)

546
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,280
(It's great for walks.)

547
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,320
(This is my newest work.
Please support me.)

548
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,400
(You're welcome to
save, like, and share it.)

549
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,120
Liang Tao.

550
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,160
It's your business if you wish
to become an influencer

551
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,960
and make a persona.

552
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
But please don't use my house

553
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
as your setting

554
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,160
and film the entire thing.

555
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,840
I don't want

556
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,600
to perish together with you

557
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,160
when people cyberbully you

558
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
after they found out what you've done.

559
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,000
And,

560
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,520
I've changed the password to my house.

561
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,240
Tell Liang Shu

562
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,040
that he'll never be able

563
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,160
to guess it again.

564
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Hello, Miss.

565
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,480
This is a private party.

566
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,960
Please show me

567
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
your online invitation.

568
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,160
Okay.

569
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,520
Please go inside.

570
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,320
I was waiting for you to ask me that.

571
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,480
Mister, you're professional indeed.

572
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,360
What are you

573
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,280
doing here alone?

574
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
This is no fun.

575
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,480
I'll leave in advance later.

576
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
You should say hi to the birthday guy

577
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,080
before you leave.

578
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,840
Let's go.

579
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,120
I just said hi to him.

580
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,320
So, are you joining me?

581
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,240
There are so many hot girls here.

582
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,200
You want me to leave with you?

583
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
I haven't lost my mind, you know?

584
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,040
Just look at you.

585
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Anyway, I already drank a little.

586
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,560
Hold my car keys for me.

587
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm not your chauffeur, you know?

588
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,120
Were you filming me just now?

589
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,000
Nope.

590
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,360
Is this a new trick?

591
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,080
You film me and wait for me
to ask you to delete it.

592
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,120
After that, you can
get my contact, right?

593
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,040
I didn't film you.

594
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Show it to me if you dare.

595
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,200
You must be a newbie then.

596
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,600
You didn't manage to film my face

597
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,760
even though you were close to me.

598
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,160
You should practice your shots.
You still have a long way to go.

599
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,920
(Peachy Peach)

600
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,480
(Happy Birthday.)

601
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,880
Stop the car.

602
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,560
It's you again?

603
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,240
Do you think I'm a taxi?

604
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,200
Take a look.

605
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,680
Someone scratched the back of your car.

606
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,880
The back of my car?

607
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,200
Where?

608
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,720
Were you filming me in secret again?

609
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,040
I wasn't filming you.

610
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,320
You liar.

611
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,920
I was wondering.

612
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,600
How could you know the back
of my car was scratched

613
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,000
when you were in front?

614
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Listen.

615
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,480
I've seen

616
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,560
too many people like you.

617
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,360
You just want to take a shortcut, right?

618
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,320
You want to be close to rich people.

619
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,520
What?

620
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,360
You won't give up

621
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,480
until you take a photo of my face, huh?

622
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,840
Your watch

623
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,320
is the most valuable thing you have.

624
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,920
I guess you're just not ugly.

625
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,280
I wonder where
you get your confidence from?

626
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,800
I'm just not ugly?

627
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,840
Wait, stop right there.

628
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,520
Delete the photos!

629
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,880
Stop right there!

630
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,400
You cannot park here.

631
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,120
Yes, he's parking it there!

632
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,159
She took photos of me!

633
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:54,920
Mister, please cooperate with us.

634
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,840
You cannot park here.

635
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,560
Please move your vehicle.

636
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,800
Just you wait!

637
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm just not ugly?

638
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,440
That's a great car.

639
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,560
But he just had to show his face.

640
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,600
(Peachy Peach)

641
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,320
(I didn't have my fill.)

642
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,400
(Time for supper.)

643
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,760
(I wonder if today's bluefin tuna)

644
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
(is fatty or not.)

645
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,820
(Peachy Peach)

646
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,360
Alright.

647
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,240
Tonight's trip wasn't in vain.

648
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,380
(Shenzhen Xinyi Sports Training Base)

649
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,840
Everyone, distribute

650
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,280
the equipment to them.

651
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,560
Song Sanchuan

652
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,680
is practicing.

653
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,720
Young Space are distributing these
to you guys

654
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
on behalf of Yi.

655
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,480
Take them.

656
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
In the new contract,

657
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,360
we've already

658
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,120
raised the signing bonus

659
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,160
to its limit.

660
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Logically speaking,

661
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,680
such sponsorship

662
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,520
only caters to an individual.

663
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,720
However, Young Space is willing

664
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,960
to sponsor your team

665
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
for one year under your name

666
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
unconditionally.

667
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,240
Yi,

668
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,440
this is great.

669
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,880
The jersey is nice.

670
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,200
Actually, after spending some time

671
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,400
with you,

672
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,120
I can feel

673
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,760
that you're concerned about

674
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,600
your position in the team.

675
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,000
Therefore, Young Space is willing

676
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,240
to support you

677
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
with everything we have unconditionally,

678
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,120
no matter if it's during practice,
competitions,

679
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
even your daily life.

680
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
Of course, we're doing it

681
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,440
so that you can

682
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,560
perform better in competitions.

683
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,360
You made such a huge deal out of it.

684
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,400
If I say no,

685
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,640
people will say

686
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,680
that I'm not looking
at the bigger picture.

687
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,240
This is a win-win situation.

688
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,000
After all,

689
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,760
when you perform better,

690
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,360
when you do well,

691
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,600
Young Space will do well too,

692
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,320
isn't it?

693
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,520
Did you bring a pen?

694
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,980
(Jin Yi)

695
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,600
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

696
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,400
Everyone

697
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,880
will have 12 pairs of shoes

698
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,800
and 12 jerseys.

699
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,560
They're outside.

700
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,960
Everyone, come with me.

701
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,760
Okay!

702
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,000
Please send this
to our legal department.

703
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,640
Okay.

704
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,320
Hello, Mr. Jie?

705
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,240
He already signed the contract.

706
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,240
As for the latter procedures,

707
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,720
I'll do a follow-up with him
as soon as possible.

708
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,040
And...

709
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,040
I know you're hesitating about

710
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,080
our player choice.

711
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,760
(But to me,)

712
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,080
(this is competitive sports.)

713
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,120
(The winner takes all.)

714
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,240
(Now, the fact)

715
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,160
(is that Jin Yi)

716
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,280
(is the best player)

717
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,960
in his category.

718
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,720
I was just

719
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
giving my suggestion.

720
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,480
After all,

721
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
you're the decision-maker here.

722
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,160
(I'm fine with it.)

723
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,120
Are you sure about that?

724
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,680
Why do I feel like you're upset with it?

725
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,360
Being upset

726
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,960
cannot solve issues.

727
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,040
It'll only create issues.

728
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,840
Don't worry.

729
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,560
I understand that completely.

730
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,360
So,

731
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,960
I will do my best

732
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
regarding Jin Yi

733
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,440
and the badminton team.

734
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
What are you doing?

735
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,320
Are you helping me one to one?

736
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,400
Signing the contract is my job.

737
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,560
It doesn't represent my will.

738
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,360
So, you're seeking your conscience

739
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,760
by picking up shuttlecocks for me?

740
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,480
That's right.

741
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,720
I understand now.

742
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,000
You guys are just like
these shuttlecocks.

743
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,640
You're stuck in the machine.

744
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,960
You have to go
wherever it directs you to.

745
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,040
You have to drop according to
the direction it's pointing toward.

746
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,440
Am I right?

747
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,760
Wait, the beans aren't cooked yet.

748
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,440
Let me cook them a little longer.

749
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,840
Come.

750
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,840
Let me tell you something.

751
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,720
I've already filled up
the retirement application.

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,720
What do you mean by that?

753
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,840
I'm going to retire from badminton.

754
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,840

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,760
except for playing badminton.

756
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,200
Are you serious?

757
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,160
I've submitted the application to Yu.

758
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,800
I won't extend the contract

759
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,800
once it ends.

760
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:52,960
