=Episode 24=

3
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,980
(Don't Worry, Let Me Carry You)

4
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,590
I thought you were looking for

5
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,950
the club's biggest shareholder?

6
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,630
I can do that.

7
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,110
You just had a divorce with Jiang Jie.

8
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,430
Are you trying to prove
something by rebuilding

9
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,430
the club he shut down?

10
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,870
Am I that petty in your eyes?

11
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,110
I have always thought

12
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,230
that you don't like me.

13
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,950
I minded you for a long time.

14
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,190
Jiang Jie and you

15
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,190
had teamwork going on

16
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,230
tacitly at the office.

17
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,670
That's something I don't have

18
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,310
with him at home.

19
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,190
But it doesn't matter anymore.

20
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,550
It's in the past.

21
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,110
I admit Jiaojiao is part

22
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,830
of the reasons why I'll invest.

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,350
And I'll invest because of you.

24
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,150
In six months,

25
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,270
you show everyone

26
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,030
that you are a competent club manager.

27
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,830
I'm doing this

28
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,590
because I see potential in this investment.

29
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,710
Hence, whether I get

30
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,070
to live comfortably

31
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,710
for the rest of my life

32
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,870
or not depends on your decision here.

33
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,590
I will work very hard for you.

34
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,110
It's cumbersome to come inside.

35
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,070
You need to register.

36
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,070
But I still want to show it to you.

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,790
The price-performance ratio
is pretty decent.

38
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,510
Didn't you say your head coach

39
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,430
will be here?

40
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,190
Where is he?

41
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,510
(Tennis Center)
He texted me on WeChat

42
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,510
(Tennis Center)
that he is on the court now.

43
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,070
Come.

44
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,390
Su, we're here.

45
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,350
Go inside.

46
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,950
Thank you.

47
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,870
No problem.

48
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,990
Everyone assumes that this place

49
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,350
is for professional athletes only.

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,790
But it is open to the public
a long time ago.

51
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,630
You can rent it out too.

52
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,430
It's a catch, if I can say so.

53
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,150
Come.

54
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,070
Let me show you the outdoor courts.

55
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,630
We have four outdoor courts

56
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,230
and two indoor courts downstairs.

57
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,670
There is a swimming center opposite us.

58
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,910
And that is Xinyi Sports Training Base.

59
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,350
Overall, it's a sporty place.

60
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,630
It has clear strengths and weaknesses.

61
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,310
The location is good.

62
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,790
The rent is reasonable.

63
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,790
But we are planning

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,910
to recruit club commercial members.

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,750
The courts here might not be enough.

66
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,030
Just enough for me

67
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,110
to conduct daily training.

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,190
Think it through.

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,910
Take a look.

70
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm going inside to check
the indoor courts.

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,470
No need to wait for me.

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,590
So?

73
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,270
We have evaluated several sites so far.

74
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,190
This one is the most cost-efficient.

75
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,990
I know what you're doing here.

76
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,710
You must have a favor to ask.

77
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,590
Tell me now.

78
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,870
What do you want?

79
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,030
Don't play dumb.

80
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,390
I want to work with you.

81
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,190
Will you give me a chance?

82
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,030
Are you being serious

83
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,430
or is this a whim of yours?

84
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,830
I don't need an employee

85
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,550
who can't commit fully.

86
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,590
I'm serious.

87
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,470
I want to prove it

88
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,590
to everyone else.

89
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,470
I heard

90
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,750
Jiang Jiaojiao settled your problem?

91
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,430
I owe him a favor

92
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,590
and money now.

93
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,150
I need a stable job.

94
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,390
If I turn you down,

95
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,630
people will think
that I'm afraid of you.

96
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,070
Come.

97
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,670
Let's do the opening of the club.

98
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,990
Sure.

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,150
What about the venue?

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,590
Should we decide it?

101
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,870
Let's get it over with.

102
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,710
We can decide later.

103
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,590
Let me think.

104
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,510
I told you to wait in the car.

105
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,470
Why come alone?

106
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,150
No.

107
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,990
It is a short distance.

108
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,310
I didn't want to bother you.

109
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,790
You're all soaked.

110
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,350
It rained so heavily out of a sudden.

111
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,470
Careful. It's slippery.

112
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,470
Careful.

113
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,550
Go inside.

114
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,630
Oh, no.

115
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,750
You're drenched.

116
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,150
You'll catch a cold like that.

117
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,510
Wait.

118
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,270
You need to get changed.

119
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,990
I can use the heater

120
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,070
to dry your clothes.

121
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,310
I...

122
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,790
Get changed?

123
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,750
Yes.

124
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,190
I'll lend you my shirt.

125
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,150
- OK?
- Sure...

126
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,110
Come.

127
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,350
Wait.

128
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,590
I need an umbrella.

129
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,470
It's raining at my house too.

130
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,190
Come.

131
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,830
I'll hold the umbrella.

132
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,390
I'm fine.

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,150
No, you're not.

134
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,390
I'm fine. Wait.

135
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,190
I'm soaked.

136
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,110
Have some warm water.

137
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,750
It's late now. What's so urgent?

138
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,470
I need to tell you something.

139
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,510
Liang Tao has been helping me look

140
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,430
for a location.

141
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,070
We found three options so far.

142
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,630
I need your advice.

143
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,070
The first option.

144
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,230
It's inside a park.

145
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,510
The environment is beautiful

146
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,190
and it was previously a tennis club.

147
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,750
It's a popular spot.

148
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,670
But the rent is expensive.

149
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,390
And during rush hour,

150
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,110
it might be congested.

151
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,310
The environment is amazing.

152
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,790
Not bad.

153
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,630
The second option is in a commercial district.

154
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,710
It's surrounded by huge corporations
and a famous hospital.

155
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,270
It's perfect for our target audience

156
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,630
and the club's future plan.

157
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,470
That's good.

158
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,150
But within a 3km radius,

159
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,670
there are several tennis clubs.

160
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,590
It'll be competitive there.

161
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,510
The third option

162
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,950
is surrounded by other sports centers.

163
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,310
It's also where white-collar workers stay.

164
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,030
In the future,

165
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,910
we're more likely to get teen members

166
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,910
so it should be great too.

167
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,470
The rent is also reasonable.

168
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,470
It sounds like

169
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,910
you already made a choice.

170
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,550
Is there anything bad

171
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,190
to the third option?

172
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,990
This is its location.

173
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,940
(Address: Lot 99, San'an Street,
Nangang District, Shenzhen)

174
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,870
It's situated diagonally
from the badminton club.

175
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,070
I don't know if it'll bother you.

176
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,230
Maybe you mind it.

177
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,230
If it affects you,

178
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,790
you won't be able to perform well.

179
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,190
If I say

180
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,510
it bothers me,

181
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,910
will you give up

182
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,230
on the best option for me?

183
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,550
Truth be told,

184
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,830
I believe I can convert the drawbacks

185
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,950
of all these three options into plus points.

186
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,870
But I cannot decide alone.

187
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,430
Song Sanchuan, stop laughing.

188
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,990
I'm not joking with you.

189
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,230
I am serious.

190
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,430
I want to hear your honest answer.

191
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,110
Does it still bother you?

192
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,590
I don't know.

193
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,750
But I do see myself improving in tennis.

194
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,350
My performance is getting better.

195
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,510
I don't really care about badminton

196
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,710
or my previous team anymore.

197
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,950
The fact

198
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,270
that you do care about my feelings...

199
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,390
That's enough to dispel the curse.

200
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,550
Childish.

201
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,630
You're superstitious.

202
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,910
You're not cursed.

203
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,750
What is this rain?

204
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,630
The street is all jammed.

205
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,150
Uncle An.

206
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,150
The Ministry of Transport is
so efficient nowadays.

207
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,790
I get home in three hours.

208
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,390
Did I interrupt something?

209
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,950
No, nothing.

210
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,350
I...

211
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,110
We were talking about our thing.

212
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,270
We're done.

213
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:49,750
Have a seat.

214
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,030
I...

215
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,150
You...

216
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,670
You should have told me.

217
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,390
I could go somewhere else.

218
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,190
You...

219
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,470
Stop it. We were talking about our stuff.

220
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,350
I just didn't want

221
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,750
to disturb your cuddling session

222
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,310
after that thing.

223
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,550
W... What?

224
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:10,950
I...

225
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,830
She changed into your clothes.

226
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,310
Because her shirt is all wet.

227
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:13,750
I...

228
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,670
I get it. I get it.

229
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,750
- No need to explain.
- It was an emergency.

230
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,110
It's not what you think...

231
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,190
I will let you know

232
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,030
when I come back now.

233
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,350
Can you be more normal?

234
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,390
You're making it awkward.

235
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,990
You know what?

236
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,750
I'll... I'll

237
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,630
make myself scarce.

238
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,150
Don't.

239
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,030
You...

240
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,270
She's here.

241
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,230
Uncle An, I should get going now.

242
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,150
Sure. See you.

243
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,510
Think about it.

244
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,270
Okay.

245
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:32,950
Sure.

246
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,190
Your bag.

247
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,990
Don't forget your bag.

248
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,910
Right.

249
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,390
I... I folded your shirt

250
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,310
and put it there.

251
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,150
Thank you.

252
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,630
Let me walk you back.

253
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,190
No need.

254
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,830
Let me.

255
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,230
No need.

256
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,430
It's not raining.
No need to take the umbrella.

257
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,710
Shut up, please.

258
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,430
I need to slap myself.

259
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,630
Your food is here.

260
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,990
Hold on.

261
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,390
I'll place it on your doorstep.

262
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,950
Thanks!

263
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,340
(Order Remark:
Hurry up, please. It's urgent!)

264
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,240
(Song Sanchuan)
(Pick the third option.)

265
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,630
(I want to prove them wrong.)

266
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,350
(Remember to take your med.)

267
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,750
I'm a pervert.

268
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,070
I wired her the money.

269
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,030
Ms. Kiki and I are done now.

270
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,270
So I want to treat you

271
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,470
to something fancy.

272
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,630
To thank you.

273
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,990
I'm not that fussy.

274
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,990
Two bowls of noodles will do.

275
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,110
No need to pick somewhere fancy.

276
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,350
Well, the hotel is above this restaurant.

277
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,190
What are you doing?

278
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,110
I can't repay you right away.

279
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,070
So

280
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,150
to thank you, I...

281
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,270
Liang Tao.

282
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,830
Who do you think I am?

283
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,830
I meant it when I said I would help you.

284
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,310
It's not a lot anyway.

285
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,790
It was like a small gesture.

286
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,190
You...

287
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,510
Yes, you owe me a favor

288
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,110
but you don't need to pay me back
with your...

289
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,550
You...

290
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,830
Do you get it now?

291
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,470
Why are you like this?

292
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,310
What's wrong with you, Jiang Jiaojiao?

293
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,190
What do you mean?

294
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,150
What kind of people are you and me?

295
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,870
I remember you said that you

296
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,230
used to take a holiday in this hotel.

297
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,230
So I saved up

298
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,950
and finally booked the ocean-view suite for you.

299
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,390
You think I want to sleep...

300
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,470
I...

301
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,030
I'm gutter-minded.

302
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,110
Sorry.

303
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm so sorry.

304
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,630
But

305
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,590
you don't need

306
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,630
to use the money I lend you

307
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,910
to reserve the ocean-view suite

308
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,390
to thank me.

309
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,230
It's counter-intuitive.

310
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,470
Money is not that important to me.

311
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,590
I don't care if money is important
to you or not.

312
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,670
But I saved up a long time to get this.

313
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,950
Ask for a refund.

314
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,390
I don't want you to lead a frugal life.

315
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,950
Fine.

316
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,150
If you won't take it,

317
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,470
take this.

318
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,070
Why do you have so many cards?

319
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,750
I found a new job.

320
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,670
Each month,

321
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,870
I'll send the money to this account.

322
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,190
You can use the credit card.

323
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,470
This feels wrong.

324
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,550
As if I'm a sugar baby.

325
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,790
It's fine.

326
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,070
I know you don't have a lot of money.

327
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,950
This place is very expensive.

328
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,750
Let's leave this place

329
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,910
and have some noodles.

330
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,670
Hi.

331
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,430
Your meal is here.

332
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,110
Please enjoy.

333
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,990
Thanks.

334
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,230
You ordered two bowls of noodles here?

335
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,550
The booking fee for this cabin is more
expensive than the food.

336
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,110
I try to save money.

337
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,990
Besides,

338
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,750
I took all the money
to the suite reservation.

339
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,430
Right.

340
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,630
Speaking of which,

341
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,510
I need to give you a piece of advice.

342
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,910
Regardless of your intention,

343
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,390
never ever give a room card to a man,

344
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,950
all right?

345
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,750
Yes.

346
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,670
Eat now.

347
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,350
Come.

348
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,310
(Top Smash)
Today

349
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,710
(Grand Opening)
is the grand opening

350
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,390
(Top Smash Tennis Club)
of Top Smash Tennis Club.

351
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,470
So you work

352
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,870
for our club now?

353
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,870
Yes, I'm in charge

354
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,510
of the club's and the member's marketing.

355
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,670
Wow.

356
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,590
You're the director of marketing then.

357
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,830
I did the math.

358
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,870
If I give you all my salary
and year-end bonus,

359
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,430
plus a side gig on the weekend,

360
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,790
I can settle my debt to you
in three years.

361
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,470
If you need the money urgently,

362
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,470
I can find a way to advance the payment.

363
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,950
Don't worry.

364
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,350
It's not urgent at all.

365
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,830
The candies from the grand opening.

366
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,430
I got some from the front desk.

367
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,110
They bring good luck.

368
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,310
What?

369
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,630
The candies from the grand opening.

370
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,030
They bring good luck.

371
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,150
(Today is the grand opening)

372
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,070
(of Top Smash Tennis Club in Shenzhen.)

373
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,590
(They have announced)

374
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,270
(Top Smash) (To A Prosperous Future)
(a new business model,)

375
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,910
(Grand Opening)
(the trainee program.)

376
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,150
(The top ten athletes of the club)

(will be signed and their coaching fee,)

378
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,630
(training fee, and tournament fee
will be waivered.)

379
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,830
(Grand Opening)
(If the athletes)

380
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,070
(Coaching Team)
(win any prize)

381
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,550
(Coaching Team)
(or award in the future tournaments,)

382
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,110
(Coaching Team)
(the profit will be shared with the club.)

383
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,550
(Will putting all the eggs)

384
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,150
(Top Smash)
(in the athletes' baskets)

385
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,350
(become a more efficient way)

386
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,110
(to discover more sports talents?)

387
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,430
(Let's interview the club manager,
Ms. Liang You'an.)

388
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,070
The trainee program aims to discover
to cream of the crop.

389
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,430
We hope to motivate the athletes to do better

390
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,390
and lower the entry barrier
for tennis enthusiasts.

391
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,870
What I can tell you is that

392
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,190
our investors, managers, and athletes

393
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,710
are all very passionate

394
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,710
towards the sport we love.

395
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,630
Even if it's a small contribution,

396
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,870
we strive to make China's tennis scene the best.

397
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,910
If this model works out,

398
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,830
I believe

399
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,350
more and more people will pick up tennis.

400
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,940
(Top Smash Tennis Club)

401
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,310
(Guo Zhendong, Jiang Jiaojiao)
Among the top ten players,

402
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,270
(Dai Yi  Song Sanchuan)
the male athletes

403
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,510
(Dai Yi  Song Sanchuan)
are veteran tennis players

404
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,910
from Young Space.

405
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,030
The female athletes are chosen
from the new recruits

406
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,630
based on their performance.

407
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,230
I brought all of you here

408
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,710
to tell you that the contract
will be renewed on a yearly basis.

409
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,230
If your performance drops

410
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,950
or if someone defeats you in this club,

411
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,310
you will be kicked out.

412
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,510
And then, you will have to make a choice.

413
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,630
Either you stay in Top Smash

414
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,950
and shell out the coaching fee yourself

415
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,910
or you find another tennis club
that suits you better.

416
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,950
This is cruel.

417
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,870
I barely signed the paper

418
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,990
and you're already stressing us.

419
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,910
I can't perform under pressure.

420
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,670
I have another announcement.

421
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,870
Think of it as a bonus.

422
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,150
The coaches and I agreed

423
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,270
to let all of you stay in a dormitory.

424
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,150
We hope

425
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,030
that it can foster teamwork

426
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,230
within ourselves.

427
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,390
Ke, can we speak alone?

428
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,230
We'll stay in the same room.

429
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,470
I have to go out?

430
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,790
No more single room left?

431
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,910
Wait.

432
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,830
Congratulations.

433
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,670
I'm 207 too.

434
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,870
All three of us will be roommates.

435
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,070
What, three?

436
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,950
Why am I 206?

437
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,710
You live next to us.

438
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,430
Come hang out with us tonight.

439
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,150
Okay.

440
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,870
You must come.

441
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,550
Which room did you get?

442
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,070
206.

443
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,830
We're roommates.

444
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,590
Yes!

445
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,430
The press does question

446
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,110
the feasibility of the trainee program.

447
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,910
I don't want you to worry

448
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,750
so I want to talk to you first.

449
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,150
To tell you my next step.

450
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,430
Actually I know

451
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,790
you're taking a huge risk here.

452
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,390
But I think you should forge ahead.

453
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,110
To be honest,

454
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,630
I am only 50% sure of this plan.

455
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,470
Because it isn't a program

456
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,070
that can rake in the profit right away.

457
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,550
I need a lot of time to nurture the athletes

458
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,230
and to grow their popularity.

459
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,630
So during the very first year
of business operation,

460
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,670
I will keep our budget under control.

461
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,990
We will use the commercial membership

462
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,110
to draw in the profit.

463
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,750
To put it simply,

464
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,630
normal members will fund
the cost of our star players.

465
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,950
When someone in the professional team
becomes famous

466
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,550
and the club becomes lucrative,

467
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,590
it will then prove the feasibility
of this business model.

468
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,070
When that time comes,
more investors will show up.

469
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,830
I see it now.

470
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,150
You mean that

471
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,630
either we make a great coup

472
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,230
or have nothing at all, right?

473
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,470
Liang You'an, this is the first major decision

474
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,150
I made for myself after the divorce.

475
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,150
And you are giving me the thrills.

476
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,750
Don't let me down now.

477
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,270
I invest in my freedom.

478
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,270
Don't make me lose everything.

479
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,710
What is this smell?

480
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,750
I just have one question.

481
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,470
Is there a toilet?

482
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,350
Is there a living room?

483
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,830
Please, not that extravagant.

484
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,310
There's a toilet, but no living room.

485
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,190
We do have a balcony.

486
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,550
Open your eyes already.

487
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,550
It's not that scary.

488
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,150
This is quite good.

489
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,870
Indeed.

490
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,550
I have the right to comment.

491
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,630
And I must say

492
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,790
this is pretty good
for a professional athlete's dormitory.

493
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,870
It's pretty good.

494
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,910
Wow, there are welcome gifts too.

495
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,190
I think

496
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,910
we underestimated Liang You'an.

497
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,830
She really did a good job here.

498
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,830
I'll call dibs then.

499
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,150
The one next to the window is mine.

500
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,790
I bet she paid the rent in tears.

501
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,910
No way.

502
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,630
She isn't that stingy.

503
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,630
Chen Zhe.

504
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,350
Do I look like it?

505
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,350
It's too smart for you.

506
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,750
This one is more like you.

507
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,230
No, it isn't.

508
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,750
This is pretty delicious.

509
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,460
(Workspace)

510
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,030
All of you have seen

511
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,070
the conditions of the dormitory.

512
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,270
It's all thanks to Ms. Liang here.

513
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,510
We just established this club.

514
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,750
And we are running low on cash.

515
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,070
We need to pay for a lot of things

516
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,590
but this is the best

517
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,670
Ms. Liang can provide us.

518
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,990
However, be clear on one thing.

519
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,950
Living in the dormitory is not

520
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,030
the welfare the club providing.

521
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,630
It's your honor winning by yourself.

522
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,070
Only the top ten players of the club

523
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,310
can move in.

524
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,070
So I want you to cherish

525
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,310
what you have now.

526
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,590
The office will always welcome you.

527
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,710
If you need to check some documents,

528
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,750
just come in.

529
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,790
If you are hungry or thirsty,

530
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,830
go to the pantry to pick the snacks.

531
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,430
The coaches will work on different shifts

532
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,470
to look after you.

533
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,030
In a word, from now on,

534
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,030
this is your second home.

535
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,870
- Good!
- Good!

536
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,710
Enough.

537
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,910
No need to make a ruckus.

538
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,150
This is your second home

539
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,670
so make yourself at home now.

540
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,830
Do what you have to do.

541
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,230
- Yes!
- Let's go.

542
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,110
What do you want?

543
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,830
The apple.

544
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
(Song Sanchuan)
(Liang You'an,)

545
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,510
(do you want to eat together?)

546
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,230
Slow down now.

547
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,750
The club's current business model...

548
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,470
I know you're thinking about work.

549
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,590
I understand

550
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,670
that you are under a lot of stress now.

551
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,510
But I want to say, Ms. Liang,

552
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,550
you

553
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,270
have worked overtime today.

554
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,270
Do you know why I asked you
to eat together?

555
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,550
Because I want you to take a breather.

556
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,990
Get some air. Calm yourself down.

557
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,670
All right?

558
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,470
I am anxious.

559
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,910
I'm scared

560
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,190
that the plan will fail.

561
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,350
I'm scared

562
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,230
that I will let the investor down.

563
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,950
I pretend to be confident.

564
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,030
After I left Young Space and its tennis club,

565
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,910
I realized this is the first time

566
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,470
that I'm taking the helm.

567
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,310
I will be liable for my own project.

568
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,990
I don't know...

569
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,230
I don't know

570
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,190
if I can make it.

571
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,750
But you shouldn't think about it now.

572
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,310
You just have to believe that we can.

573
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,070
We can.

574
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,430
Your athlete contract and trainee program

575
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,910
are very special.

576
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,830
Now,

577
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,910
it's our turn to bring in the results.

578
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,150
Trust me.

579
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,830
I'll make your promise

580
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,990
a reality one day.

581
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,390
So confident of you.

582
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,670
Because Ms. Liang told me

583
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,070
that I am a talented athlete.

584
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,870
And I know myself very well.

585
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,190
And most importantly,

586
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,590
I want everyone to acknowledge you.

587
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,430
You persuaded me

588
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,630
to join the tennis club.

589
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,030
You came up with all these plans.

590
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,070
In my eyes,

591
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,230
they are all meaningful and important.

592
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,830
What you need to do now

593
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,350
is to have faith in yourself.

594
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,630
Don't worry.

595
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,150
Let me carry you.

596
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,870
You're too likable.

597
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,510
What?

598
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,990
What did you say?

599
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,790
I was saying

600
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,110
that today is a great day.

601
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,030
Song Sanchuan,

602
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,390
I'll remember

603
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,710
what you said just now.

604
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,710
Don't let me down now.

605
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,710
I'm full now.

606
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,180
(Shenzhen Xinyi Sports Training Base)

607
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,790
You messaged me on WeChat

608
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,150
and asked me to come here.

609
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,230
What's up?

610
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,830
We are not that far apart anymore

611
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,390
and I want to congratulate you.

612
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,430
Also can you help me practice

613
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,550
several techniques?

614
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,710
Sure.

615
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,790
Which techniques?

616
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,630
Just net shot.

617
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,990
I just can't get the hang of it.

618
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,910
Chuan.

619
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,510
Teach me your secret.

620
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,590
It's not that I don't want to.

621
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,430
But you know

622
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,310
I switched to tennis now.

623
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,750
We use different power chains there.

624
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,350
If I teach you,

625
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,630
it might mess with your training.

626
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,510
Impossible.

627
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,230
I can never forget my flashy techniques.

628
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,110
Chuan.

629
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,390
Let me demonstrate.

630
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,590
Check if there's any problem

631
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,670
with my posture and rhythm.

632
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,790
Okay.

633
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,670
I'll serve.

634
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,390
Backhand.

635
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,390
Your posture and rhythm

636
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,230
are great.

637
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,630
It's your wrist.

638
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,910
My wrist?

639
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,750
Do you have an extra racket?

640
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,030
Yes.

641
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,990
Here.

642
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,590
Now, look.

643
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,710
When doing a backhand,

644
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,550
your elbow points to the ground.

645
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,630
Don't move your forearm.

646
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,030
It's all about your wrist and fingers.

647
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,420
(Top Smash)

648
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,310
I don't know how good he was.

649
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,110
Are you sure?

650
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,070
Let's have a match later.

651
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,630
Sure.

652
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,270
You're early today.

653
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,910
You...

654
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,430
That shot...

655
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,630
Did I see it right?

656
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,270
Wait, how did you do that?

657
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,510
No, I...

658
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,670
I used my wrist.

659
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,470
Well, I don't know.

660
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,270
Maybe I played badminton for a while last night.

661
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,550
You called out

662
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,950
and I subconsciously did a flick.

663
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,990
It's the perfect shot.

664
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,870
No one can take it.

665
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,070
Do it again.

666
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,350
Not like this.

667
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,310
I thought this was your secret technique.

668
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,510
But it was just a lucky shot I guess.

669
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,270
All right.

670
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,590
Let me try.

671
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,510
You sure you can do it?

672
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,630
Chuan said that he shook his wrist.

673
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,910
Forget it.

674
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,750
You do it.

675
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,630
I'll do the warm-up.

676
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,230
Mind the tennis balls on the ground.

677
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,670
(What technique)

678
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,470
(is he trying to develop?)

679
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,230
Coach Yan.

680
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,190
I have come up

681
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,190
with the latest tournament planning.

682
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,990
Can you have a look?

683
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,110
Coach Yan.

684
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,350
Did you hear me?

685
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,190
Yes, go ahead.

686
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,830
Tennis tournaments

687
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,910
mean we have to go all around the country.

688
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,230
It's the biggest expense of our trainee program.

689
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,390
I have been filtering through
the tournaments lately.

690
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,310
I researched on

691
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,310
our member's personal playstyle,

692
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,990
their opponents' match records,

693
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,630
the local climate, and geography.

694
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,630
I noticed that

695
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,590
some people prefer to play
in the northern region

696
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,590
while some win more games
in the southern region.

697
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,670
So I decided to let all of them

698
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,830
play three matches in total.

699
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,910
I know it's not a lot.

700
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,950
But at the moment,

701
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,990
we need to focus on tournaments

702
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,190
that have high returns.

703
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,950
What do you think?

704
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,830
You researched on ten players alone?

705
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,950
Mingyu helped me look
for the tickets and hotels.

706
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,030
He found cheap tickets

707
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,230
and did mass booking for the hotels.

708
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,550
All right.

709
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,030
Proceed with your plan.

710
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,550
Thanks, Coach Yan.

711
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,270
You did it again.

712
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,670
What was that?

713
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,030
How did you do it?

714
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,670
It's beautiful.

715
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,870
What the heck?

716
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,830
Amazing.

717
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,750
Coach Yan, did you teach him that?

718
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,830
I have never seen it before.

719
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,030
Coach Yan, you were looking for me?

720
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,950
Come in.

721
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,030
Have a seat.

722
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,070
This is your personal

723
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,470
tournament planning Liang You'an made.

724
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,470
I took a look.

725
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,110
You can follow it to accumulate points.

726
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,950
I have a question.

727
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,630
The shot you made just now.

728
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,830
That one.

729
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,150
How long have you been practicing it?

730
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,350
I started recently.

731
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,870
I only discovered it by chance.

732
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,710
I have been trying to replicate

733
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,590
the same movement.

734
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,150
I think I have the wrist advantage

735
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,190
as I was a badminton player.

736
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,110
Are you planning to make it

737
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,310
your secret technique?

738
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,670
Do you think it's possible?

739
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,350
It'll be challenging.

740
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,430
You have the cross-chain advantage with you.

741
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,870
But it feels more

742
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,110
like a lucky shot.

743
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,950
You can pull it off once

744
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,750
but that doesn't mean you can pull it off
consistently.

745
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,430
You know very well

746
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,230
that consistency is key.

747
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,150
Are you certain

748
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,270
that you can pull it off

749
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,470
when you need it?

750
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,150
If I practice more to increase the consistency?

751
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,750
You know,

752
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,470
now is not the time

753
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,990
for you to develop a secret technique.

754
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,430

(Top Smash No. 1)
(Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing)

781
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,310
Coach Yan.

782
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,030
My tournament planning is
quite efficient, isn't it?

783
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,190
Their ranking points

784
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,110
are increasing very quickly.

785
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,390
Liang You'an.

786
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,510
Who do you think is the reason

787
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,470
they improve so quickly?

788
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,430
Me

789
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,590
or you?

790
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,270
You,

791
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,710
of course.

792
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,910
No, no, no.

793
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,590
I don't take credit for other's work.

794
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,630
I know

795
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,990
you have done your research.

796
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,270
You analyzed the athletes

797
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,270
and the tournament.

798
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,470
It is a popular strategy
on the international stage

799
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,990
so I bet you borrowed it.

800
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,030
Your aggressive tactics might work

801
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,390
for the first few tournaments.

802
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,270
But have you

803
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,070
thought about a problem?

804
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,910
When their ranking points are higher,

805
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,350
they'll meet stronger opponents.

806
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,670
Knowing what they are capable of,

807
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,790
do you think they will keep winning?

808
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,950
Also,

809
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,150
this strategy doesn't improve

810
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,430
their mentality.

811
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,230
On the contrary, when they
blazed everything through,

812
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,350
they might have the illusion of power.

813
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,870
In my opinion,

814
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,390
it will do more harm than good.

815
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,110
Is it that serious of a problem?

816
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,910
In a tournament,

817
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,790
competence and luck
are equally important.

818
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,070
She did her research to make sure

819
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,310
that luck is on our side.

820
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,750
No need to defend your bestie.

821
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,270
She can tell if what I said

822
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,510
makes sense or not.

823
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,750
Why do you mean I'm defending her?

824
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,470
You are blunt, almost rude.

825
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,790
Isn't it great

826
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,670
that their ranking is higher now?

827
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,190
Besides, our club is poor and difficult.

828
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,710
And we need to quickly increase
our athletes' popularity.

829
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,590
Do you have another better strategy?

830
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,110
Look.

831
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,590
I'm not saying that...

832
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,270
Can't you respect what she has done?

833
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,430
My tummy starts grumbling at night.

834
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,870
I'm starving.

835
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,710
I'm not hungry anymore.

836
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,750
What happened?

837
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,830
Did we

838
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,550
come in at the wrong time?

839
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,750
It's fine.

840
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,150
I was discussing with Coach Yan

841
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,510
about your future tournament planning.

842
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,990
We did well, didn't we?

843
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,310
We won.

844
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,990
Exactly.

845
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,910
It's late.

846
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,790
Why are you up?

847
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,070
I'm hungry.

848
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,550
You said that we could visit the pantry

849
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,870
so we came.

850
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,430
What do you want to eat?

851
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,070
There's only instant noodles.

852
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,990
I don't mind.

853
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,590
Let's...

854
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,230
Oh.

855
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,150
Coach Luo.

856
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,110
Can we eat something?

857
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,230
Go ahead. I'm hungry too.

858
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,310
Yes!

859
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,430
Instant noodles!

860
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,590
Time to feast!

861
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,150
I'll prepare a dessert for everyone.

862
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,990
Sure.

863
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,060
(Top Smash)

864
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,390
Ladies and gentlemen.

865
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,470
The noodles are ready.

866
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,150
Dig in.

867
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,230
Calm down now.

868
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,230
Coach Luo.

869
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,990
It's thanks to you that we can eat.

870
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,590
If you said no,

871
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,790
we wouldn't be able
to have instant noodles.

872
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,390
So let me serve you a bowl.

873
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,310
Thanks.

874
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,950
Nothing happened between Coach Yan
and you just now?

875
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,430
No, nothing at all.

876
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,830
It's hot.

877
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,950
Do you want the broth?

878
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,990
No need.

879
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,030
Careful, it's hot.

880
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,870
Thanks.

881
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,790
You're dismissed.

882
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,310
Noted, Your Majesty.

883
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,110
It's delicious.

884
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,110
Look at the dessert.

885
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,310
Eat first.

886
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,550
It's so yummy.

887
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,630
I don't eat instant noodles.

888
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,750
I got carried away just now.

889
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,190
I know you mean well.

890
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,590
I'm sorry.

891
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,110
It's such a trivial matter.

892
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,830
I...

893
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,510
No woman has ever apologized to me.

894
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,350
Because you have never met a kind woman.

895
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,070
Can I have the dessert too?

896
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,830
This is yours.

897
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,270
Here.

898
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:47,870
This dessert...

899
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,430
Try it.

900
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,550
The presentation is all right

901
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,230
but it tastes good.

902
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,870
Really?

903
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,070
Yes, try it.

904
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,830
Drink mine first.

905
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,910
What do you think, Coach Luo?

906
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,110
Not bad.

907
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,750
With friends...

908
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,310
Come together...

909
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,190
Free instant noodles...

910
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,990
And desserts!

911
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,590
High five!

912
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,670
So many people shared
the instant noodles just now.

913
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,670
Did you manage to eat?

914
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,270
Yes, I'm full now.

915
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,870
Sure enough,

916
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,230
instant noodles without an egg
remind me of youth.

917
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,430
You know you're old

918
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,940
when you start to add eggs, veggies,

919
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,350
and luncheon meat to the instant noodles.

920
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,750
I've been busy with my training

921
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,990
and the tournaments.

922
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,070
And you

923
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,550
are busy managing the club.

924
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,710
It feels like

925
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,550
after the inauguration of Top Smash,

926
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,990
we have never had the chance to talk.

927
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,430
It's okay.

928
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,470
I will make sure I come
to the instant noodles party

929
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,110
just to reminisce about my youth again.

930
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,430
Okay. I'll stock up on instant noodles.

931
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,870
If you want some, I'll cook for you.

932
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,110
By the way,

933
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,230
you perform very well

934
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,990
in recent matches.

935
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,470
Did you use your secret technique?

936
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,990
No, not at all.

937
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,670
Coach Yan told me
not to practice it first.

938
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,990
It should wait

939
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,790
until I get the foundation down.

940
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,790
Good luck then.

941
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,310
So, uhh...

942
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,030
I'm heading to Nanjing tomorrow

943
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,870
for a tournament.

944
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,510
I know.

945
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,630
I booked your ticket and your hotel.

946
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,430
You will meet a lot

947
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,590
of talented players this time.

948
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,670
Don't get cocky.

949
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,710
If I lose a round,

950
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,750
I'll come back after two days.

951
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,030
If I win,

952
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,790
I'll come back after five days.

953
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,310
I wish you can win it.

954
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,110
No need to help me save
the accommodation fee.

955
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,230
Liang You'an.

956
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,350
Give me your phone.

957
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,950
After I won the match yesterday,

958
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,710
the organizer gave me a gift bag.

959
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,990
It contained this.

960
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,270
Here you go.

961
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,500
(Tennis)

962
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,790
I said that I would carry you.

963
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,950
So wait for me

964
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,150
as I carry all trophies back to you.

965
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,030
Okay.

966
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,510
I'll wait for you.
