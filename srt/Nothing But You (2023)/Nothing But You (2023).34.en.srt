00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,060
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,980
(I'll Provide For You, For This Family)

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,280
Here.

5
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Thanks.

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,760
So...

7
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,960
Jiaojiao is

8
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,079
marrying your sister,

9
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
do you know that?

10
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
I mean no disrespect.

11
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm simply curious about

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,920
your take on the matter.

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
I only found out recently.

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,080
However,

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
this is their marriage.

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
I shouldn't interfere.

17
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
Judging by the tone,

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
you're not very supportive of this.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,640
I was hoping

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
you could talk some sense into Jiaojiao

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
or perhaps your sister.

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,120
Those two are not thinking straight.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
May I know

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
why you're against it?

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,440
They are too young

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,320
to know the meaning of marriage.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
They can't take on
the responsibilities of marriage.

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,720
And You'an...

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll be honest with you.

30
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Liang Tao's background is too complicated.

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
If Jiao...

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
I don't think you and your sister

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
are very close, am I right?

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
You are too polite.

35
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,120
Yes. My sister and I are not very close.

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
But she's not born by a mistress,

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
like the rumor says.

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,160
So, you had to hear it from me

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,480
to believe it, right?

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,480
I totally understand your concern.

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,160
I mean it.

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,400
But regarding their relationship,

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm in an awkward position to intervene.

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
Please be considerate.

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,880
Don't ask any favor from me.

46
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Chuan.

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
Are we your friends or not?

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
You can't leave me to my own fate

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,720
while you're in love.

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm getting married, Chuan.

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,080
Marry whoever you want.

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
I can't help you with that.

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,400
I know you can't help.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,960
But Ms. Liang can help.

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,760
My dad listens to her.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
Ask Liang You'an

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
put up a few good words for me.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,280
Do you want one?

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't interrupt.

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,400
You'an?

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
That's not her concern.

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,560
Take care of your own marriage.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,480
Put this on the tab!

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,680
Boss, how much was that?

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
I'll pay for him.

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,000
That's six yuan.

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,920
I transferred the money. Check it.

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
When you made a comeback,

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
I didn't bother you.

70
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,640
I tried everything I could think of

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
without anyone's help.

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,640
But my dad wouldn't say yes.

73
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
In other words, your dad thinks

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,080
you can't get married
when you can't make a living.

75
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,880
He's right to be worried.

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,920
You can't ask for money from your parents

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
to provide for you and Liang Tao.

78
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,680
Your career is taking off.

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,160
You won another match.

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,200
You got enough points.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
You can make a living
with the prize money.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
But I can't keep Liang Tao

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
waiting for me forever.

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,040
Listen.

85
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,040
It boils down to your attitude.

86
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,800
Show your father

87
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,600
you can create your own future

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
no matter

89
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,480
how much money you make.

90
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Is that clear?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Fine.

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm going all out!

93
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
I will join as many matches as you do

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,480
from now on.

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,680
Good. I admire the spirit.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,960
There is no way

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
I can't get married.

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,200
You can't have mine.

99
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,960
Boss.

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
I want another cone.

101
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,240
I'll transfer the money.

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Scan the code.

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,120
Six yuan, right?

104
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,720
Yes.

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,760
(Hello? Are you free now?)

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
(Meet you at my place.)

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,960
(Sure. I'll be there in 30 minutes.)

108
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,360
I made the ice

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
by freezing the wine

110
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
with fruits.

111
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,640
Try it out.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
It's good.

113
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,800
It's delicious.

114
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
Eat heartily.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
Did you tell Liang Shu and the rest?

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,640
Yes.

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,920
How did they react?

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,400
At first, it felt like nonsense.

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Then, they asked about

120
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,280
Jiang Jiaojiao's family background.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
When they learned
he was the son of your former boss,

122
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,160
my mom even got
the household register ready.

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
That's good.

124
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,720
What about you?

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,600
Have you thought it through?

126
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,200
Why are you getting married?

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
Because I like him.

128
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
You're in love too.

129
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
Don't you know that joy?

130
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,480
Are you getting married?

131
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,760
The four of us can hold

132
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
a group wedding.

133
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,640
Thanks but no thanks. I'm still sane.

134
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,480
You'd go insane for love anyway.

135
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,880
You'an. Don't be mad when I ask.

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,080
You're already in your 30s.

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,840
You met a man you love.

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,480
Don't you want to get married?

139
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
Not at the moment.

140
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
I have a question for you too.

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm curious.

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,480
You're in your early 20s.

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,040
Why would you think marriage is

144
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
the ultimate goal of love?

145
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,480
I don't think

146
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,840
I have to reach the goal.

147
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm getting married
because I don't mind a divorce.

148
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
Now that I want to get married,

149
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,040
I should get married.

150
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,320
I might think otherwise

151
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
when I'm in my 30s.

152
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,520
That makes sense.

153
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,000
It feels like

154
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
I've finally reached

155
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
the bus stop after a long walk.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,800
But the ride to marriage

157
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,800
just left.

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
I get it.

159
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,480
If I chase after it

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,680
and wave my hand at it,
it will stop for me.

161
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
It will let me get in.

162
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,360
But I don't feel like doing so.

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,960
It leaves. So be it.

164
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,600
I am genuinely worried about Song Sanchuan.

165
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,760
I'll tell him

166
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,600
to make a round trip

167
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
and get you on the bus someday.

168
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Don't you think

169
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,800
the reason the two of us take marriage

170
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,080
so lightly is because of Liang Shu?

171
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,039
You invited me to dinner.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm delighted.

173
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Actually,

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
I've admired you since we were little.

175
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,960
You're brave and big-hearted.

176
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,080
You had great grades.

177
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
You're capable at work.

178
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Everyone likes you.

179
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,480
It may seem like
I had a happy family

180
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,760
while you had a single-parent.

181
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,640
But who do you think

182
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
had a tougher life?

183
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,640
I am grateful for Jiang Jiaojiao.

184
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,240
He is sweet and lovely.

185
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,480
He doesn't think

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
badly of my family.

187
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,720
He never asks

188
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,720
anything from me.

189
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,880
He doesn't see any flaw in me.

190
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,920
I don't have to

191
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
change myself in any way

192
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
to be in love with him.

193
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,200
So, I believe it.

194
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,680
Love is perhaps the fairest thing

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
we can ever have

196
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,360
in this world.

197
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,640
When fate gives out love randomly,

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,480
your wealth,

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,680
educational background,

200
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,760
family, and personality

201
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
are not taken into account.

202
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,480
Even someone as mediocre

203
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,440
as insignificant as me

204
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,920
might stumble upon

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,280
the greatest miracle.

206
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,120
I don't want to lose him.

207
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,400
Come.

208
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,640
I wish you happiness.

209
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,440
(Liang You'an)
(Oh no.)

210
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,280
(Liang You'an)
(I kind of feel like going after that bus.)

211
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,000
(Song Sanchuan)
(What bus?)

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Where are you?

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,880
(Do you need me to pick you up?)

214
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,120
Sir, madam, hello.

215
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,880
I am Liang Tao.

216
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,200
Take a seat, miss.

217
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
Don't be so formal.

218
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,120
Liang Tao.

219
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,680
Please accept this.

220
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,760
For me?

221
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
I made it this morning.

222
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,920
Seeing how young people
don't like drinking tea,

223
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,440
you could have some coffee with it.

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
You made this yourself?

225
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
This is amazing.

226
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
It's so delicate.

227
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,880
I won't drink coffee with it.

228
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,840
It could get stained.

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,520
Liang Tao.

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
I didn't prepare a welcome gift for you.

231
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
I'll prepare it next time.

232
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
It's okay, sir. Never mind.

233
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
You are getting married.

234
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,400
Does your family know?

235
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,840
Yes, sir.

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,600
I heard

237
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
you and Jiaojiao
work in the same club.

238
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,160
Are you aware of his situation?

239
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
Dad, what do you mean?

240
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,280
See?

241
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,680
You two are getting married,

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,120
shouldn't you tell her

243
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
your background?

244
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,480
Liang Tao.

245
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,120
I'll be honest.

246
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,560
When Jiaojiao said
you were getting married,

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,200
I was against it.

248
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,360
You are both very young.

249
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't want you to get married on a whim.

250
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,240
However,

251
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
I've listened to a lot of opinions.

252
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,800
My view on the matter

253
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,400
changed a little.

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,800
I think

255
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
getting married now

256
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,160
might give us an opportunity.

257
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,320
Really, Dad?

258
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
You agreed?

259
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,720
Yes. I agreed.

260
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,800
However,

261
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,320
I want you to find a job.

262
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,640
You must at least provide for yourself,

263
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
and the family

264
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,680
you two are going to build.

265
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,160
If you find a job,

266
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,240
you have my permission to get married.

267
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,080
If I want to get married,

268
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,400
I have to stop playing tennis?

269
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm not stopping you from playing.

270
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Play if you want.

271
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,640
It's good for your health.

272
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,360
But Jiaojiao,

273
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,560
if you

274
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,920
want to play tennis for a living

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and make it your career,

276
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,240
I don't think that's a good idea.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
It's been proven after so many years.

278
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,320
Can you survive

279
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,040
with just playing tennis?

280
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,080
Jiaojiao.

281
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't worry about the job.

282
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,400
Whether you come to Young Space or not,

283
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,000
I can make the arrangement.

284
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,000
Liang Tao.

285
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,640
This kid told me

286
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,320
he'd rent a house after you get married.

287
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,280
You want her to make do with that?

288
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,840
If you find a proper job,

289
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,080
I'll buy you a house.

290
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
Let's eat up.

291
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
We can discuss it over the meal.

292
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,160
Yes, madam.

293
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,760
Are you going to consider the terms

294
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
your father proposed?

295
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,280
You've just met a real businessman.

296
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,600
He made a very tantalizing offer

297
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,960
in exchange.

298
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,680
He thinks I wouldn't turn it down.

299
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,120
Don't you dare.

300
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Is playing tennis

301
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,160
your dream or not?

302
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,040
Of course.

303
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,560
You'd trade your dream for me?

304
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
I can't be responsible for that.

305
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,160
If we ever get into a fight,

306
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,640
you'll say I've ruined your dream.

307
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
We'll become enemies.

308
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,720
I'll never stop playing.

309
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,160
But I will marry you.

310
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,720
I don't care if my dad
stops supporting me financially.

311
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,120
I don't want you

312
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,720
to feel mistreated.

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,040
Let's not

314
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,720
think about another way out.

315
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
We face it head-on.

316
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,520
Sell this.

317
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,240
Return the money to your dad.

318
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
We can earn our own living.

319
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,280
Don't you dare give up
on your tennis dream.

320
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,760
You only look cool
when you play tennis.

321
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,760
That's about it.

322
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,640
Come on.

323
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm not full yet.
Let's grab some food.

324
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,720
I'll work hard to get better.

325
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
You have my support.

326
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
I'll show them

327
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,800
I can get married
using the prize money.

328
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
Time for some food!

329
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,400
(Top Smash)

330
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,560
Jiaojiao is working too hard.

331
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,200
He's won ten matches in a row.

332
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,280
He's going all-out
to save up for his wedding.

333
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,960
Pay close attention

334
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,040
to his training schedule.

335
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,200
Adjust accordingly.

336
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,320
Excuse me.

337
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,240
There is a technical
seminar this month.

338
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
It's the coaches' turn
to give the speech.

339
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,920
Which of you is going?

340
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,880
I'll go.

341
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,520
I've been studying a topic

342
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,000
called unforced error.

343
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
I know a thing or two.

344
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,720
A mistake that's

345
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,480
attributed to

346
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,080
one's failure rather than the skill

347
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,400
of the opponent.

348
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,360
Right?

349
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
It's time we compile

350
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,400
our mistakes and experiences.

351
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,520
I...

352
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
What's so funny?

353
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
Was I laughing?

354
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,880
Sorry, my bad.

355
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,640
Mingyu, get over here.

356
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,760
You haven't passed me the files

357
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
of the new members.

358
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,600
But I did.

359
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,480
Are you sure?

360
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah.

361
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,760
No.

362
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
Didn't I?

363
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,520
Who did you pass it to?

364
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,080
Didn't I pass it to you?

365
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,880
Are you sure?

366
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm certain of it.

367
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,600
We never laughed.

368
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,440
I didn't laugh.

369
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,040
Look at yourself.

370
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
You look a bit pale lately.

371
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,920
We should start
our physical training now.

372
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
I'll get you some food.

373
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,000
We're out of food.

374
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,960
We replenish our stamina.

375
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
Then, we do the physical training.

376
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,880
Teach me how to swing a racket.

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
I can teach you the Nine Yin Scripture.

378
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,360
How about Zen of Sword?

379
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
I can unlock your inner potential.

380
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,400
You won't make any errors again.

381
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Nuts.

382
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,680
If you've made up your mind,

383
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,239
inform Liang Tao.

384
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
She will promote it
on our official page.

385
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,040
Sure.

386
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,920
So, Xu Lexi has

387
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
gone back to Beijing on a flight.

388
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,640
As for alcoholic drinks,

389
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,840
I've disposed of them.

390
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,640
Zhang Yan.

391
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,640
Don't tell me about your personal life.

392
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,960
I have a lot of things
that require my attention.

393
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Your inability

394
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,800
of self-care isn't one of them.

395
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
Excuse me.

396
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,640
What's with the error anyway?

397
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,600
Unforced error!

398
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,560
Where is everyone?
We have a meeting!

399
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,480
Jiaojiao has a match tomorrow!

400
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,640
Unbelievable.

401
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,640
(Dad, I have a match tomorrow.)

402
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,000
(If you're free,)

403
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,560
(you and mom should come and watch it.)

404
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,240
All the best!

405
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,440
He's been avoiding me for a month.

406
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,240
Why did he suddenly invite me to the match?

407
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,160
Jiaojiao is playing very well now.

408
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,480
Are you surprised?

409
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
It's only because

410
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,560
you rarely watch his matches.

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
He's won ten matches in a row.

412
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,800
Don't you think

413
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,000
there's something
about the look in his eyes

414
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,040
that seems different now?

415
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,760
Well played! Jiang Jiaojiao!

416
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,080
He even has an assistant

417
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,520
to film the match for him.

418
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,240
That's how he got so much better.

419
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
Jiang Jiaojiao!

420
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,120
I finally get it now.

421
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,800
You wanted me to watch the match

422
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,360
to convince me.

423
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,080
Dad!

424
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,480
Was I awesome or what?

425
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,840
I won!

426
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,040
Don't be so smirky. Be discreet.

427
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
This isn't a high-stakes match,

428
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,280
but at least

429
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,240
it was sponsored.

430
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,120
If I win the final,

431
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,560
I get the prize money.

432
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,080
It was 15,000 yuan!

433
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,520
Fifteen thousand yuan?

434
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
That's a lot.

435
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,680
Tao.

436
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,560
See?

437
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,440
A ledger of my matches

438
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,600
for recent months.

439
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,720
(Tennis Tournament)
The first few pages

440
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
(Tennis Challenge Tour)
are my training, matches, and trips.

441
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,720
The pages afterward

442
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,720
record the money I won.

443
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Dad, we are even.

444
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,840
It's more than that.

445
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,040
I checked the number.

446
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,560
We made a profit of

447
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
122 yuan.

448
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,120
Really?

449
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,280
I'm already making a profit!

450
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,680
Mr. Jiang.

451
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,280
The weather is hot.

452
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,840
I have 122 yuan.

453
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,080
Let me buy you some soft drinks.

454
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,200
I don't buy it.

455
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,320
What do you want?

456
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,160
Look at you.

457
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
I invited both of you

458
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,560
to the match

459
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,880
so you could witness

460
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,960
with your own eyes

461
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,200
that I am serious

462
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,800
about playing tennis.

463
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,320
And judging by the progress,

464
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
in the coming year,

465
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,960
I can make a living with prize money

466
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,680
just as Song Sanchuan did.

467
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,600
Sure, you have 122 yuan.

468
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,640
You will do well.

469
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
Mom!

470
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,560
It's only 122 yuan for now.

471
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,560
That number will be
times fold next year.

472
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,680
No one can be sure.

473
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,840
Dad.

474
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
I don't want to give up on tennis.

475
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,000
Playing tennis is exhausting.

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm always covered in sweat.

477
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,080
But when I take up my racket,

478
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
I get this...

479
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,760
It feels like

480
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm alive, okay?

481
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,640
If you forced me to put on

482
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,720
suits and ties,

483
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,480
I'd die on the spot.

484
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,240
Jiang Jiaojiao.

485
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,200
Enough with the sentimental speech.

486
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,120
Come clean.

487
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,880
How long have you been
memorizing this speech?

488
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
You also had me convinced.

489
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,640
You asked us to come here

490
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,120
on a hot day to send a message.

491
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,280
You want me to know
you will keep playing

492
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
and you won't
give up on getting married.

493
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,840
Yes.

494
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,680
Okay.

495
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
You just lost the house.

496
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,520
You can rent a room with your 120 yuan.

497
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,840
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

498
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,240
When I make enough money
to support myself next year,

499
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,840
I'll invite you over for dinner.

500
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,120
Bye, Mr. Jiang!

501
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,860
(Jiaojiao)

502
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,120
(I'm letting him go.)

503
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
(He's all yours now.)

504
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,940
(Liang Tao)
(No problem. Leave it to me.)

505
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,600
Look at him smiling.

506
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
He should get a new name.

507
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,680
He should change his name to "delicate" instead.
[*Delicate and Jiao are homophones.]

508
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
It suits him.

509
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Buddy.

510
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,280
You are the only one left.

511
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,160
Don't provoke me.

512
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,720
If you did,

513
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
I'd get depressed.

514
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,840
Don't say that.

515
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,120
Getting depressed as soon
as Jiaojiao gets married?

516
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
People might get the wrong idea.

517
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,320
Where did you learn to talk like that?

518
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Take a look.

519
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,320
How festive.

520
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,560
The kid looks suave in this photo.

521
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,000
See?

522
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,960
He looks like me when I was young.

523
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,720
Are you blind or are you silly?

524
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,360
That's a blatant lie.

525
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,120
Liang Tao.

526
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,920
You've really

527
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,560
made me proud this time.

528
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,280
You got married

529
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,080
before Liang You'an did.

530
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,840
My girl has redeemed

531
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,000
my honor for me.

532
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,000
Mom.

533
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,280
Can we not talk about that?

534
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,280
When are you going to forget about

535
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,480
your false enemy?

536
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
I just did.

537
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,240
It's all behind us.

538
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,560
Liang Shu.

539
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Where is the thing?

540
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,120
You mentioned

541
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,520
you owed Jiaojiao money

542
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
when you terminated the contract.

543
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,000
We talked it over.

544
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,840
You have to pay him back.

545
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,040
What's owed should be paid.

546
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,240
My daughter is getting married.

547
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,920
She shouldn't feel any shame.

548
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Mom, dad.

549
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,240
You're being very supportive.

550
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,920
We can tell

551
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,720
Jiaojiao really loves you.

552
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,920
We are glad

553
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
that he is the man you're marrying.

554
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,480
Had I known

555
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,200
I could get rich when I got married,

556
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,160
I should've done it sooner.

557
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,080
Silly kid.

558
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,920
Liang Tao.

559
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Don't worry.

560
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,920
We'll always be there for you.

561
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,400
From now on,

562
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,080
you must live with pride,

563
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,000
is that clear?

564
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,760
Yes.

565
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,000
Good.

566
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
Now that you're married,

567
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,640
I get an empty room.

568
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
Where are you going?

569
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,200
It's dinner time.
I'm making some noodles.

570
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,000
Forget it.

571
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,760
Forget about noodles.

572
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,320
The three of us will eat

573
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,120
at a restaurant.

574
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Let's go.

575
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,000
Let's go.

576
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,020
(Ancong Wig Shop)

577
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,320
What's with the silly smile?

578
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,560
I smile because my girlfriend is pretty.

579
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,880
Why are you smiling?

580
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm looking

581
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,800
at the wedding photo
of Liang Tao and Jiaojiao.

582
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,520
The couple looks lovely. See?

583
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,520
Not a bad shot.

584
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,880
It's great.

585
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,120
After going through so much,

586
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,960
they finally get married.

587
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,920
Yeah. It's been tough for them.

588
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,600
There's something

589
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,200
I wonder

590
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,480
if it's time to tell you or not.

591
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,720
What is it?

592
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,960
I had a small surgery

593
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,560
over at your place?

594
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,240
I even visited you.

595
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,520
It wasn't a major surgery.
It was very successful.

596
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
However,

597
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,920
there is a side effect.

598
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,920
The doctor says

599
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
my chances of having a child

600
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,280
are slim.

601
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,040
I knew it.

602
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,800
It's too early to discuss this.

603
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
Why are you telling me now?

604
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,880
I don't know.

605
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,280
Personally,

606
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't think this is

607
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
too big of an issue.

608
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,280
But also think

609
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,200
this matter

610
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
is somewhat important.

611
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,240
You should know this.

612
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,880
Well...

613
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,280
I know now.

614
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,000
Not bad.

615
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,760
What do you mean?

616
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,760
Well...

617
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,800
You're willing to tell me.

618
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,600
It means

619
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,240
you're thinking about our future.

620
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,520
I have a question for you.

621
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,440
Have you ever
considered or thought about

622
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,840
having a child?

623
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,840
I'll tell you the truth.

624
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,560
Honestly,

625
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
before you told me,

626
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,600
I'd never thought about it.

627
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,400
It never crossed my mind.

628
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,200
I knew it.

629
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,600
So, I've kept it to myself.

630
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,240
for a long time.

631
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
I didn't know

632
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,160
how to bring it up to you.

633
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,280
Do you know what kind of person

634
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
is the silliest?

635
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,400
It's the kind

636
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,320
that always go after

637
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,160
the measly accessories.

638
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,480
I love Liang You'an,

639
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,480
not the child she gives birth to.

640
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,400
Right now,

641
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,200
the only thing I know for sure

642
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,360
is that I want to spend every day with you.

643
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,920
You are at the center of it all.

644
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,040
Everything is pointless without you.

645
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
The rest are all accessories.

646
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,720
If you get a child, great.

647
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,000
If not, you don't lose anything.

648
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,640
You're good at maths.

649
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,800
You know what I mean.

650
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,760
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

651
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,200
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

652
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,920
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

653
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,280
Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

654
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,720
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

655
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,240
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

656
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,720
See that?

657
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,760
The young people's activities

658
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
are lively.

659
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,320
They are filming a promotional video.

660
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
So what am I doing here?

661
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,840
I have a meeting this afternoon.

662
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,240
You can go if you're busy.

663
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,640
I'll treat our in-laws to lunch later.

664
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,240
Great. It's nice to finally meet you.

665
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,160
I asked Liang Tao

666
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,800
to arrange a meeting

667
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,800
with you to discuss their wedding.

668
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,280
The girl

669
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800
doesn't seem to be in a hurry at all.

670
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Having a good husband

671
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,680
is better than anything.

672
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,240
We don't need much

673
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,200
for the wedding.

674
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,920
Of course we need a proper wedding.

675
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,240
A marriage

676
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,960
is a matter of a lifetime.

677
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,680
The form of the wedding,
the scale of it,

678
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,640
all of these should be discussed.

679
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,680
Indeed.

680
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,760
Wedding is the most

681
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,560
important part.

682
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,760
It boils down to one thing.

683
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,200
Respectable.

684
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,760
What if your dad beats you up?

685
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,000
My dad has been a businessman for years.

686
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,920
He can handle the pressure.

687
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
We are having our wedding today

688
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,880
one way or another.

689
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
Yeah. Your determination is unwavering.

690
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,760
You got me to come this far

691
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,720
for the promotional video

692
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
just to get yourselves

693
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,080
a free wedding venue.

694
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,960
Impressive.

695
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,480
Are you that needy?

696
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,440
I thought you got
the money you needed.

697
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,640
I didn't ask for the money.

698
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,520
I don't want to owe any favor

699
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,480
when I get married.

700
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,440
We talked about this.

701
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,600
We can put together enough
money for the wedding ourselves.

702
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,360
That's nice.

703
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,760
Tao is always so sensible.

704
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,240
Fine. Enough with the comments.

705
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,040
Look at the time. Get changed.

706
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay.

707
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,080
Take care of Tao for me.

708
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,040
Tell me.

709
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,960
He talks about you

710
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
in almost every sentence

711
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,840
he says.

712
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Aren't you tired of it?

713
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,120
You're not any better.

714
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,040
Is it really so nice
to have a younger boyfriend?

715
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,640
It wasn't working well at first.

716
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Really?

717
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,200
Yeah.

718
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,960
He's young and youthful.

719
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,000
He had too much passion and energy.

720
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,320
He was too straightforward.

721
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,560
We were two strangers.

722
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,840
We knew nothing about
each other's habits, interests,

723
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,079
and hobbies.

724
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,760
It takes time to get used to things.

725
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,160
By being honest with each other,

726
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,400
we try together.

727
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,160
That's how we make things better.

728
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,960
Well?

729
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,720
Have things gone better for you two?

730
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,200
Of course.

731
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,760
I'm so happy right now.

732
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,640
How do I look?

733
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,680
I didn't know

734
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,240
you'd look so dashing in a suit.

735
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,480
Please.

736
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,559
How could I have married Tao

737
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,640
if I weren't dashing?

738
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,079
Jiaojiao, I mean it when I say this.

739
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,200
Seeing you walking down the aisle

740
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,119
makes me kind of sad.

741
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,079
Don't be gross.

742
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,520
Jiaojiao, the way you get married is super cool.

743
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,640
How about the tossing bouquet?

744
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,960
Should I rig the game

745
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,840
and toss it to You'an?

746
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,760
Never mind.

747
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,960
I don't want to make it awkward for her.

748
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Just how is it going with you two?

749
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,600
Show some confidence.

750
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,560
Of course I'm confident.

751
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,640
We are close, okay?

752
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,200
We're not like you.

753
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,160
It's time.

754
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,120
Get ready. The event is about to start.

755
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Look at this.

756
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,320
This is the invitation
I designed with some inspiration.

757
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,000
Feel free to comment if you have

758
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,920
any thoughts about it.

759
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,120
Sir, madam,

760
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
the event is about to start.

761
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,120
Please go to your seats.

762
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
What seats?

763
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
What is going on?

764
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,720
What is this about?

765
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,320
What...

766
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,600
Let's welcome our bride!

767
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,520
Jiang Jiaojiao.

768
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,760
What is this?

769
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,800
You call this a wedding?

770
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
This is nonsense!

771
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,360
Alright.

772
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,240
Can you quiet down?

773
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,520
What is she doing?

774
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,960
Mom.

775
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,720
I know you have objections to

776
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,560
this wedding.

777
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,080
You find it crude.

778
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,600
I apologize

779
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,240
for not informing you beforehand.

780
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,840
It's very selfish of me to do this.

781
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,960
I've relied on you

782
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,760
ever since I was a child.

783
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
You took care of everything for me.

784
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,320
But when I met Tao,

785
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
she helped me realize

786
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
I had to use my own two hands

787
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
to live a life proudly.

788
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,440
Father, Mother,

789
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,320
with everyone here as my witness,

790
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
I want to express my gratitude to you.

791
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,280
I want to prove to you with this wedding

792
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,680
that I am all grown-up now.

793
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,080
No matter what the future holds for us,

794
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,520
I, Jiang Jiaojiao,

795
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,520
will take full
responsibility for my life.

796
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,800
Yeah!

797
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,920
You have our full support!

798
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,840
You are the best!

799
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,680
Dad, Mom,

800
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,720
everyone I love

801
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,840
is at this wedding.

802
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,240
For me,

803
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,240
this is the perfect wedding I want.

804
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,280
The rest of it is only formality,

805
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,800
but I want to hear it from you.

806
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,480
Lady Liang Tao,

807
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,560
do you take me, Jiang Jiaojiao,

808
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,760
to be my married wife?

809
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,480
I do!

810
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,240
Jiaojiao has grown up.

811
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,320
His speech just now

812
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,040
was quite touching.

813
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
There are a lot of things
you don't know.

814
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,000
When you first transferred Liang You'an

815
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
to the club,

816
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
you never thought it'd come to this.

817
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,160
From Liang You'an resignation to our divorce,

818
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
and now Jiaojiao's wedding,

819
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,360
it seems I was never needed.

820
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I've totally lost control.

821
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,600
Is this a middle-aged crisis?

822
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Let's see.

823
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,240
Why do you

824
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,080
lump the three of us together?

825
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,560
Do you think

826
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,080
what we have now was thanks to you?

827
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,320
You have a strong sense of contribution,

828
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,400
but none of us is thanking you.

829
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,080
Is that it?

830
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,000
Deep down,

831
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,440
we appreciate your kindness.

832
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,760
But somewhere down the line,

833
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,960
we somehow began to lose respect and equality.

834
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,960
I think a relationship

835
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,200
without respect and equality

836
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,560
will eventually fall apart.

837
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,040
Jiaojiao is an adult now.

838
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,080
Your subordinate

839
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,560
can work independently.

840
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,800
Isn't that nice?

841
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,720
- Grab the ball.
- Toss it.

842
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,560
Don't toss it at me.

843
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,360
Well?

844
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,520
Don't throw it at me.

845
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,720
No rush.

846
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,920
Well?

847
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,040
I bet you didn't think your son

848
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,600
would hold a wedding today.

849
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,880
I envy their young age.

850
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,080
They are in their 20s.

851
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,000
Full of spirit and energy.

852
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,560
When they reach my age,

853
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,120
are they going to become
insufferable and self-centered?

854
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,640
I never think

855
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,480
youthfulness is tied to young age.

856
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,120
There are many
who start out with courage

857
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,080
but eventually quit.

858
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,280
But men and women
are the same in this regard.

859
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,760
We should all try our best.

860
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,280
When we still have the courage,

861
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,080
we should stay strong
for as long as we can.

862
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,320
Perhaps when we reach our 40s,

863
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,280
things might get better.

864
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,960
There's something

865
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
I couldn't bring it up to you.

866
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:23,920
Thank you.

867
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,520
Jiang Jiaojiao finally became sensible

868
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,000
thanks to you.

869
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,800
I thought so too.

870
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,520
Almost there.

871
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,520
No way.

872
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,160
Do you like strawberries?

873
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,680
Let's have

874
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,320
a piece of strawberry cake.

875
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,440
Never mind. I have my Mini-Oreo.

876
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,520
See?

877
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,400
I can finish one in one bite.

878
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,040
Impressive.

879
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,480
Is it good?

880
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,960
Yeah?

881
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,320
Here.

882
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,800
I can do better than you.

883
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,480
You can finish one...

884
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,320
- Luo Le.
- I can finish ten.

885
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,160
Okay?

886
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,320
Thank you for babysitting her.

887
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,520
Don't mention it.

888
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Come here.

889
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,560
Have some water.

890
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,120
Go to your mom.

891
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,000
Okay.

892
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,760
Yan, do you want more?

893
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,040
Okay.

894
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,600
This tiny thing is delicious.

895
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,240
Thanks.

896
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
What did you call him?

897
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Where are your manners?

898
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,480
It's alright.

899
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,960
She must have heard it from Xu Tan.

900
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,520
So she picked it up quickly.

901
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,280
She's a kid. Never mind.

902
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,920
He wants to

903
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,280
pretend he is young,

904
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
so we can't stop him,

905
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,120
right?

906
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,880
Call him whatever you want.

907
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,320
Anything you want.

908
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,640
Your daughter

909
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,400
has healthy and strong limbs.

910
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,360
She has potential.

911
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,240
She can be my apprentice.

912
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
I can teach her tennis.

913
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,440
Not a chance.

914
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,120
We're not learning tennis.

915
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,160
You want to make money

916
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,360
from me?

917
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,960
Who says so? I'm teaching her for free.

918
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,640
Free?

919
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,440
All the more reason to say no.

920
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,960
Come, have some orange juice.

921
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,120
