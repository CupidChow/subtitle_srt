00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,580
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,780
(You seem to possess the ability
to create a spark in everyone.)

4
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,729
I'm joining the tennis club.

5
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:01,729
I'm going to turn into a tennis player.

6
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:03,809
Chuan, I...

7
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:06,009
I have to tell you something.

8
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,969
You're trying to change your profession
at 22 years old?

9
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,609
This is unheard of

10
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,569
in the sports industry.

11
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,008
But I'm the first to do it.

12
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,569
Did I sound too arrogant?

13
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,329
Maybe just a little bit.

14
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:26,929
Think of me as being rebellious then.

15
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:29,089
The more I am told I can't do it,

16
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,689
the more I want to prove them wrong.

17
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,009
I've made up my mind anyway.

18
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:34,609
If it doesn't work out,

19
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:35,569
I'll just return and

20
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,929
become a children's coach.

21
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,249
It's not a bad job anyway.

22
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,769
That's right.

23
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,489
When I played badminton,

24
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,089
I was carrying someone else's dream

25
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,529
and pretended that I have this ambition.

26
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:48,849
This time,

27
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,569
I'm picking my own path,

28
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,729
and I would blame no one for the outcome.

29
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:57,809
Right on!

30
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,449
Say no more then.

31
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,129
You thought it through, just do it.

32
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,329
We'll blaze a path through.

33
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,009
Come.

34
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,369
How come?

35
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,169
I lost ten fans in three days.

36
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:22,689
My business is about to die.

37
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:24,529
Hello.

38
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:26,889
Hello.

39
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:27,929
Are you Liang Tao?

40
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,649
Hello, I'm Mingyu.

41
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:31,689
Hi, hi.

42
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,529
What's up?

43
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,689
I used to work together with

44
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:35,529
Ms. You'an.

45
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,329
She asked me to take care of you.

46
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,009
What's your position here?

47
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,369
I'm the secretary of Mr. Jiang Jie.

48
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,409
Mr. Jiang Jie?

49
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,249
President of the marketing department?

50
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:46,289
Yes.

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,380
(President secretary - Mingyu)

52
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,409
Mingyu,

53
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,049
since you hold such a high position,

54
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,289
I bet you have access to many places.

55
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:03,209
Before this,

56
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:04,649
I wandered over here and discovered

57
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,289
that my employee card has no access.

58
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,529
Only higher-ups like
directors and presidents

59
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,129
have access to this area.

60
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,929
There's nothing much to see really.

61
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:12,209
Just a conference room

62
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:13,529
and several bosses' offices.

63
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,849
Hello.

64
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,529
Okay, I'll go get it.

65
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:22,649
Liang Tao,

66
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:24,368
you have a look around and

67
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:25,329
return to your desk, alright?

68
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:26,248
Sure.

69
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,889
Don't worry about me.

70
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,009
A day as the president's assistant.

71
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,849
My family arranged this company for me.

72
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,209
I went incognito to work in the Top 500.

73
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,849
Experience the world through the eyes

74
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:14,689
of a president!

75
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,049
Like and follow

76
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:18,129
to see more updates!

77
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,609
That's a good one.

78
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,409
Come play with me.

79
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,249
I don't want to.

80
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:28,849
You guys go ahead.

81
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:29,769
I'm looking at girls.

82
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:30,969
What a weakling.

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,160
(Rest area)

84
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,049
One more round!

85
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,769
Double Jiao!

86
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:39,409
Hurry up.

87
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,129
Come here.

88
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:42,329
Take my place.

89
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:45,249
If you call me Double Jiao again,

90
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,289
you're bound to get it from me.

91
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:46,889
No, no.

92
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:47,649
Come and see.

93
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,369
Isn't this my car?

94
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,569
Isn't this watch yours?

95
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,569
Take a look.

96
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,980
(Peachy Peach)

97
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,450
(My boyfriend is very shy,
he doesn't want to be seen.)

98
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,649
Send me this link.

99
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:02,689
Alright.

100
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,449
Sent.

101
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:15,609
What are people up to these days?

102
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:17,489
(Last time,)

103
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,329
(I saw a lot of you girls)

104
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,329
(asking these questions
in the public chat:)

105
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,209
(What is Ms. Shuang's skincare routine?)

106
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,409
(What does she eat to keep healthy?)

107
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,529
(What is her exercise gear like?)

108
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:24,769
We share the name Liang,

109
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,489
(I will answer all of that at once.)

110
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,489
bless me with success
for the live broadcast later!

111
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,009
Hello everyone,

112
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,329
I am Peachy Peach.

113
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,620
(Peachy Peach is live, watch now.)

114
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:53,729
So,

115
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:54,089
we're done talking

116
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,289
about the clothes.

117
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:56,489
Right now,

118
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:57,809
if anyone has questions,

119
00:06:57,929 --> 00:06:58,889
you can ask me!

120
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,729
The company that you were previously at,

121
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,009
does it belong to your boyfriend?

122
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,009
Nah,

123
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,369
I begged my father

124
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:05,649
to set me up for the job.

125
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,969
I wanted this learning opportunity.

126
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:08,529
Riding on the fame

127
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:09,929
and faking it too.

128
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,020
(ILovePeaches sent a flower.)

129
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,860
(ILovePeaches sent a sticker.)

130
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,500
(ILovePeaches sent a love.)

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,900
(ILovePeaches sent a glowstick.)

132
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,780
(ILovePeaches sent a love.)

133
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,200
(ILovePeaches sent a flower.)

134
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,329
Welcome!

135
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,809
Welcome everybody.

136
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,649
Thank you ILovePeaches...

137
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:28,889
(My wife wouldn't acknowledge my status.)

138
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,129
(I'm so sad.)

139
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,609
(ILovePeaches)
(I took our BMW out for a drive.)

140
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,129
(Waiting for you to be done!)

141
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,689
(Is this the boyfriend or husband?)

142
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,449
(Is it the one with the sports car?)

143
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,129
(Why are you sending gifts to yourself?)

144
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,529
(Everyone is welcomed
to follow my account.)

145
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,249
(ILovePeaches)

146
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,540
(Welcome everyone,
please follow @ILovePeaches)

147
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,740
(Live has ended.)

148
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,649
You're going to be so scared.

149
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,940
(ILovePeaches)

150
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,489
Oh, it's him.

151
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:20,809
This

152
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,369
is our outdoor training court.

153
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,049
We don't have many members yet.

154
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,889
Some courts are vacant.

155
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,289
You quit your dog-walking job,

156
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,969
would you start running then?

157
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,729
I just started managing this club,

158
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,409
I'll have no time to run.

159
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:35,809
I'm so overwhelmed now.

160
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,209
Same for you.

161
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,528
You don't have much time too.

162
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:40,209
We're heading to

163
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:41,209
the fitness centre.

164
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,289
I'll show you around.

165
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,489
Over here

166
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:44,689
is our club's

167
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:45,409
gym room.

168
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:46,528
Take a look around.

169
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:48,409
Our operating hours are from

170
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:49,409
7 o'clock in the morning

171
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,609
till 8 o'clock at night.

172
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,529
Those piled up there

173
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,649
are massage tools.

174
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:54,969
Use it to relax.

175
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,489
This

176
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,849
is our physiotherapy room.

177
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:00,169
Mr. Zhang, don't let us interrupt you.

178
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,460
(Stringing room)

179
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,089
This is our stringer,

180
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:06,769
Mr. Lu.

181
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:08,129
On Tuesdays and Saturdays,

182
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,249
he's usually here.

183
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,209
Hello.

184
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,089
Hello.

185
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,529
So you went around.

186
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:17,449
What do you think?

187
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:18,409
It's pretty good.

188
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,929
You have all the infrastructure,

189
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:20,289
everything.

190
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:20,889
Have a seat.

191
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:27,769
So this place,

192
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:28,929
unlike the ones for professional teams,

193
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,689
it has no dormitories or canteens.

194
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,169
Our physiotherapist and stringer

195
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,249
are also part-timers.

196
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:34,609
They come in twice a week.

197
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:35,609
The greatest difference is,

198
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:36,369
everyone who plays here

199
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,369
have to pay training fees

200
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,409
and membership fees.

201
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:41,129
That doesn't apply to you

202
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,769
because you're not really our member.

203
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:43,569
You are considered as

204
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,209
someone who is working for the club.

205
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:46,769
The basic salary will be 6,000 yuan.

206
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,609
The subsequent salary increase

207
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,049
will depend on your capabilities.

208
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:51,049
Would that work?

209
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,489
Okay.

210
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,209
These are your work clothes.

211
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,089
This tennis racquet

212
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:00,889
is an entry-level model.

213
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,049
Once you get a hang of it,

214
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,089
if you would like to make adjustments,

215
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:04,009
let me know anytime.

216
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,289
I feel

217
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,609
that I lack the strength,

218
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,609
to drive this ball up.

219
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,769
My hits can't do it.

220
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,529
Let me introduce this guy to you.

221
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,049
This is Song Sanchuan.

222
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,569
Former professional badminton player.

223
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:22,649
He will be officially

224
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:23,729
joining our club today.

225
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:24,969
His job will be to provide

226
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:25,969
on-court support.

227
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:26,849
Ms. Liang,

228
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,049
let me straighten things out.

229
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,089
A badminton player

230
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,609
as a tennis court support.

231
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,609
Are we turning into

232
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:34,689
a badminton club now?

233
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:35,569
Not you.

234
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:36,569
He'll be the one changing.

235
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,489
The job scope of a court support

236
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:39,769
includes but is not limited to

237
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,689
court maintenance, court time allocation,

238
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,569
member records,

239
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,449
and all coaching-related

240
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,689
support work.

241
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,569
Isn't he just an errand boy then?

242
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:48,569
He's more than just that.

243
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,489
He has no experience
as a training partner,

244
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:51,569
so you can leave all the dirty work

245
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:52,769
to him as well.

246
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:53,929
Everyone, feel free to

247
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,809
make use of him and drill him on the court.

248
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:56,929
What do you mean by that?

249
00:10:58,689 --> 00:10:59,969
He's switching from badminton to tennis?

250
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:00,769
Yes.

251
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,329
He has three months.

252
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,329
We will conduct a team vote after that

253
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,529
to see if he would be able to

254
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,369
make it and stay.

255
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:07,689
What a joke.

256
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:13,889
I'm Song Sanchuan.

257
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:15,889
I'll be under your guidance.

258
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,609
Is this the grand trick that

259
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:21,769
you wanted to pull after so many days?

260
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,969
Yes. Coach Wang,

261
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,689
I will hand him over to you now.

262
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,489
Send him wherever you see fit.

263
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,129
Oh no.

264
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,489
Liang You'an.

265
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,009
Who's that?

266
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:40,009
What are you trying to do?

267
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,529
Who are you trying to patronise

268
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,369
with this nobody from nowhere?

269
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,929
He is a professional player,

270
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,889
someone who almost made it
to the national team.

271
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,169
His athletic skills are
better than most of you.

272
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,329
But he's still a badminton player!

273
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,209
I'm telling you,

274
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,889
let that nobody go.

275
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:56,329
Jiang Jiaojiao,

276
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,369
you go around calling others nobody,

277
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,809
does your dad know how impolite you are?

278
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,209
Using my dad's name won't intimidate me.

279
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:02,649
Alright then,

280
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,129
tell me.

281
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,089
You're here comfortably

282
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,329
sitting around in this club

283
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,169
with no results to show

284
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,529
while everyone revolves around you,

285
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,049
that has nothing to do with your dad?

286
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:10,889
Of course not.

287
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:11,809
Then what?

288
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,969
Because I am charismatic.

289
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:18,969
What's there to laugh about?

290
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,129
Stop laughing.

291
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:22,969
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:25,329
I couldn't help myself.

293
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:26,449
Look.

294
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:28,889
Your charisma or

295
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:29,529
your father's name

296
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:30,889
holds no significance at all.

297
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:32,169
In competitive sports,

298
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,329
only one thing matters:

299
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:34,609
your competence.

300
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,249
If you don't think he's any good,

301
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,329
don't drop the ball.

302
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,769
The Song Sanchuan that I know

303
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:40,889
is a very fast learner.

304
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:41,929
Beware, after three months,

305
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,089
he might even surpass you.

306
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:43,929
When that time comes,

307
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:45,329
you'll be patronised real good.

308
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:46,889
Okay.

309
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,929
Three months, right?

310
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,369
He won't be able to stay.

311
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:02,969
Here.

312
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:05,009
Let's eat.

313
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,449
Oh, a new dish.

314
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:09,289
Come,

315
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:10,609
we haven't drank in a while,

316
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,969
drink some Huangjiu with me.

317
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:13,769
You're in a good mood today.

318
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,369
Come, drink up.

319
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:20,449
Well,

320
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,489
Liang You'an has finally agreed

321
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,289
to help me run the tennis club.

322
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,929
I am finally relieved

323
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,169
of this burden.

324
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,809
She promised to run it well too.

325
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,129
I don't get it.

326
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:30,849
Why did you

327
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:31,809
hire her for the club?

328
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,489
Can she play tennis?

329
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:34,969
Does she know how to manage the club?

330
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,089
Do you really

331
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:37,089
dislike our club so much

332
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,049
till you want to ruin our reputation?

333
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,929
I sent her to the club so that

334
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,689
she can breathe new life into it.

335
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,769
How great a sacrifice that you've made.

336
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:46,969
If you let her

337
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,209
come over to our club,

338
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,929
won't there be no one left to help you?

339
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:50,689
Why, you,

340
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,009
can't you think for yourself?

341
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,209
Do you have a brain even?

342
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,929
Of course I do, and that's how

343
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:55,649
I was able to see through

344
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:56,369
your evil plan.

345
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,289
I think...

346
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,289
we should stop having meals together

347
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,969
starting next week.

348
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,449
Every week it ends up like this.

349
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,649
I woke up early in the morning

350
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,169
to shop and to prepare everything.

351
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:15,889
I put in so much effort,

352
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,009
yet none of you

353
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,729
tried my food

354
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,409
or told me that it tastes delicious.

355
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:23,169
I feel that I am the only person

356
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,009
who cares about this meal.

357
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:26,169
Both of you

358
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,769
treated this like a task instead.

359
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:29,969
We should stop

360
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,249
going through the motions.

361
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:32,289
Wait,

362
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,409
Chen Ke,

363
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,529
there's no need to make this a big deal,

364
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:36,609
right?

365
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,849
We're not going through the motions.

366
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,089
I am usually so busy at work,

367
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:42,489
but I gave strict orders to

368
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:43,529
everyone at the company that

369
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,689
on Saturday afternoons,

370
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,809
even when the sky is falling,
no one should contact me.

371
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:47,729
Why?

372
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,769
It's so that all of us

373
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,209
can have a proper meal together.

374
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:52,969
I'm sorry.

375
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,449
Please don't be angry.

376
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,889
Both of us were in the wrong.

377
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,769
We shouldn't have started fighting.

378
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,529
Let's eat.

379
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:01,929
We won't fight anymore.

380
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:02,729

Okay?

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:04,929
We'll stop.

383
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:05,529
We'll stop.

384
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:06,289
We'll eat.

385
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:06,969
Eat, eat.

386
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:07,889
Come, eat.

387
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:08,769
Here, mum,

388
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:09,689
have another,

389
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,129
it's double the love.

What's wrong?

00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:04,849
Did you fix

426
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:05,929
the coach's table?

427
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:06,649
Good.

428
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,289
I went to the warehouse today

429
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:09,209
and saw a toolbox.

430
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,369
I just fixed it on the side.

431
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,249
Not bad.

432
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:12,568
You know what needs to be done.

433
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,249
Have a look at this.

434
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,328
I checked on the

435
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,369
our warehouse inventory.

436
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,328
The number of racquets and balls

437
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:19,449
(Young Space Tennis Club Inventory Check)
are still sufficient judging by the

438
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:20,009
number of bookings

439
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:20,889
for our courts.

440
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,209
We don't need a restock yet.

441
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:23,609
Now the main problem is

442
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,689
our courts.

443
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,169
Each of these courts

444
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,568
has varying degrees of wear and tear.

445
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:28,889
It's time to resurface.

446
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:31,088
When I first came,

447
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:31,889
I saw this problem too.

448
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,249
However, the biggest issue of

449
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,209
our club is

450
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,649
we don't have the money for that.

451
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,129
The other courts are still fine,

452
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,569
but it's mainly

453
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:42,449
the outdoor court 8.

454
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:43,929
Look at this.

455
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,529
(Young Space Tennis Club Inventory Check)
Court 8

456
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:46,249
was booked

457
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,809
significantly less than other courts.

458
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:49,489
It's the same for everyone.

459
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:50,929
If the court surface is shabby,

460
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:51,849
no one wants to use it.

461
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,289
The drinking fountains over there.

462
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,089
This morning,

463
00:17:55,129 --> 00:17:55,929
I cleaned everything.

464
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,609
It's so dirty in there.

465
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:58,609
My team experienced it

466
00:17:58,729 --> 00:17:59,329
last time

467
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,489
where the water dispenser wasn't cleaned

468
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:01,609
and there was serious bacterial growth.

469
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,129
All of us got gastroenteritis.

470
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,129
You did so much work.

471
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,409
What time did you come in today?

472
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,529
Six o'clock.

473
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,889
I can't play tennis yet,

474
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,209
might as well work on

475
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,009
the things that I know.

476
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,689
After all, everyone knows

477
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,609
I came in through your connection.

478
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,449
I don't want to make you look bad.

479
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,169
I'm heading back to tend the numbers.

480
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:31,689
Great.

481
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,009

I've been watching you for days.

495
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,769
You're a pretty peculiar guy.

496
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,889
If it is really as Liang You'an said,

497
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,649
you used to be such a great player,

498
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,129
yet this chore of massaging others,

499
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:34,049
you're still up for it,

500
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,169
don't you have any pride?

501
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:39,289
If I do this,

502
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,129
does it bring me some self-respect then?

503
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,089
That's done now.

504
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,369
You think it's fun, don't you?

505
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:55,649
I will be frank with you.

506
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:58,529
Even if you used to play badminton

507
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:59,809
with the national team,

508
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,169
your worth

509
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,609
at our tennis club

510
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,169
is less than a tennis ball.

511
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:06,569
If you just want to be

512
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,729
an errand boy at this club

513
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,129
to make some money,

514
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,249
I have no problem with that.

515
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,089
Just don't you dare think

516
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:12,089
we'll ever be teammates.

517
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,409
That just shows you

518
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:15,369
know nothing about tennis.

519
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,409
Don't take it to heart.

520
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:42,289
He's not a bad person,

521
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:44,129
just a little mouthy.

522
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,169
By the looks of it, he hasn't really

523
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:47,569
known the harsh realities of society.

524
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,849
He takes playing tennis

525
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:50,689
really seriously.

526
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,369
What he said just now

527
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:53,929
has not an ounce of problem with it.

528
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,649
I know nothing yet, really.

529
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:57,129
I'll admit that.

530
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,209
You can't hide it.

531
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,009
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

532
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:01,569
If three months later,

533
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:02,889
I'm still incapable of playing,

534
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,969
that's when I'll really lose face.

535
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:09,609
You know,

536
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:12,089
when I was working last time,

537
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,049
everyone wants to hide

538
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,569
their weaknesses and shortcomings.

539
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,329
What a coincidence.

540
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,169
When I was playing last time,

541
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:20,569
you will never be able to hide

542
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:22,329
your weaknesses and shortcomings.

543
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,169
If you can't face it,

544
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:27,489
your opponent will use it
to the best of their advantage.

545
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:33,089
Don't worry about me.

546
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,729
What happened just now

547
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,409

589
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:20,929
come here, pair up with him.

590
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:22,209
Sure.

592
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:32,889
come over,

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:33,929
come here.

595
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:41,729
What's the matter, Mr. Wang?

596
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,649
Are you trying to learn from others?

597
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,729
Do you know how to serve yet?

598
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:49,089
Show me.

599
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:50,369
Okay.

600
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:14,329
That's...

601
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:15,329
Do it again.

602
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:31,889
Not bad.

603
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:32,409
Come, come.

604
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:33,409
Come over.

605
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:38,569
It hasn't been two weeks, right?

606
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,089
That's pretty good.

607
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,129
Serving is the hardest skill to master.

608
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,569
I taught him

609
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,209
to serve above the shoulder.

610
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:46,929
The people from our team

611
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:47,849
call him the

612
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,009
'human ball launcher'.

613
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,209
Everyone looks for him to
practice serve and receive.

614
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,489
Maybe they thought

615
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:53,889
I was a little smarter than the machine.

616
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:55,969
Not bad.

617
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,089
Keep practicing.

618
00:25:58,969 --> 00:25:59,529
Okay.

619
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,569
His service is good.

620
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:04,009
There's sidespin and topspin,

621
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,969
it's pretty impressive.

(Young Space Tennis Club Training Records)
(Member - Song Sanchuan)

628
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,209
Is this real?

629
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:23,009
When did he do all this?

630
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,209
I once arrived at 7 o'clock,

631
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,289
and saw him outdoors

632
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,809
practicing his swinging technique.

633
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,609
The janitor told me

634
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,929
that boy has been here since 6 o'clock

635
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,169
practicing his moves.

636
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:36,089
(Every day, after everyone leaves,)

637
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,209
(he will go on and)

638
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:38,489
(practice for another two hours.)

639
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:42,449
That's a force to be reckoned with.

640
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,169
At first, I thought

641
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,569
by having Song Sanchuan here,

642
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:49,769
I could bank on his

643
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:50,929
attitude of a professional athlete

644
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,569
to motivate the whole team.

645
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:54,489
Now I feel

646
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:55,969
the presence of Song Sanchuan

647
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,329
in this club

648
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,769
would be able to ignite

649
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,409
the passion in everyone.

650
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:09,249
Jiao,

651
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,529
I think

652
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,009
you should stop rivalling with Sanchuan.

653
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:13,449
He seems really tough.

654
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,609
He's just showing off.

655
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:17,089
I don't think so.

656
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,089
I just watched him serve.

657
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,209
That seemed pretty legit

658
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,169
and well-served.

659
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:23,089

660
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:26,769

663
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:01,969
Okay.

664
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:02,809
Let's.

665
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:19,209
Again.

666

Newcomer,

667
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,449
do you only know how to serve

668
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:32,649
instead of returning the serve?

669
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:36,529
Look,

670
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:38,649
let's play some friendly shots.

671
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:06,049
Come here.

672
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:06,849

674

This is tennis.

675
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,169
Your posture and footwork,

676
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,489
is just like a badminton player's.

677
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:14,449
No, I mean,

678
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:15,849
the teaching assistants

679
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:17,129
only taught me stationary moves.

680
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:18,489
The footwork in movement,

681
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:19,529
I learnt it all on my own.

682
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:21,169
I didn't pay tuition after all.

683
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:24,809
Do you want to learn it then?

684
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:26,689
I'll teach you, free of charge.

685
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:29,969
Why?

686
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:31,249
For fun.

687
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:32,889
On this pitch,

688
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:33,849
I have never won

689
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:34,569
a match with anyone else.

690
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:36,009
This feels like the best opportunity

691
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:36,809
for me to feel good about myself.

692
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:38,449
If so,

693
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:39,569
that means you're the worst player.

694
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:40,689
To have the worst player teach me.

695
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,329
I am more than qualified to teach you.

696
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:43,449
So are you up for it?

697
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:46,089
Sure, of course.

698
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:47,849
Let me tell you,

699
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:49,489
I'm

700
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:50,489
someone who's

701
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,809
very kind-hearted since young.

702
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:53,129
And I

703
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:54,169
see you practicing every day,

704
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,169
grinding in sweat,

705
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:56,729
with no one to teach you.

706
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,129
So,

707
00:29:58,249 --> 00:29:59,209
I'll teach you like an older brother.

708
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:00,769
Wait a minute.

709
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:02,129
How old are you?

710
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,129
21. What about you?

711
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:06,089
I am 22. I'm older than you.

712
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,209
Going by playing age,

713
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,329
I'm the elder brother.

714
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:10,889
Hurry up, get the ball.

715
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:16,409
I'll serve you some forehand volleys.

716
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,289
I'm serving,

717
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:17,969
get ready.

718
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:18,529
Here.

719
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,129
One two three, go.

720
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,649
You should first step out

721
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:23,569
then forward.

722
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:24,209
Okay now,

723
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,809
one two three, go.

724
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:27,649
Lunge forward,

725
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:28,249
bring your body down.

726
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:29,369
Make sure that your centre of gravity

727
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,769
is directed towards this leg.

728
00:30:58,329 --> 00:30:59,289
Let's take a break.

729
00:30:59,329 --> 00:30:59,929
We'll resume practicing later.

730
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:04,249
Come and drink some water.

731
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:05,689
Replenish some electrolytes.

732
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:21,689
You're not taking a break?

733
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:22,569
Don't mind me.

734
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:23,449
I'll practice a bit more.

735
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:26,569
Are you an alien, buddy?

736
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,009
Why's your stamina so good?

737
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,209
The team you were previously in,

738
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:32,489
how long do you train every day?

739
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,609
Eight or nine hours a day roughly.

740
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:37,249
Eight or nine hours a day?

741
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:41,529
Elder brother that is.

742
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,369
You're my elder brother.

743
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,369
I'll serve you a few more.

744
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:49,409
Sure.

745
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:52,289
Get into position.

746
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,289
Hold your racquet up more.

747
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:56,449
Remember what I told you,

748
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:57,489
step outward,

749
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:00,009
and centre yourself on your left foot.

Come in.

754
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:16,969
I have something to tell you.

755
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:19,009
Chen Zhe's substitute coach told me that

756
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:19,929
recently,

757
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:21,609
as Chen Zhe taught
Song Sanchuan to play,

758
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:23,209
the movements that Chen Zhe

759
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:24,209
couldn't seem to master before,

760
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:25,209
he could do it all now.

761
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,409
He has improved.

762
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,289
These are his latest

763
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,129
training records.

764
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:29,369
His practice hours have gone up.

765
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,089
He can't learn to play well,

766
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,969
but he could teach pretty well huh.

767
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:40,969
As you said before,

768
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:42,129
these kids

769
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:42,729
on their own,

770
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:44,409
they'll have no motivation to practice.

771
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,569
Right now he has an

772
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:46,769
entry-level apprentice,

773
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:47,609
the desire to coach

774
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:48,689
is higher than his own interest

775
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:49,609
in playing.

776
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:51,409
As teaching and learning
go hand in hand,

777
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,929
improvements come naturally.

778
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,729
It will all show

779
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:55,969
on numbers and statistics too.

780
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:56,809
So Coach Wang,

781
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:59,089
do you think maybe the work arrangement

782
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:00,729
of our coaching staff could follow this

783
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,489
system as well?

784
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:03,089
Ms. Liang,

785
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:05,089
I'll admit

786
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,249
that by bringing in Song Sanchuan,

787
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,529
you've made a grand move.

788
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,649
The training atmosphere of the club

789
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:11,569
became quite lively.

790
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:13,009
However,

791
00:33:13,209 --> 00:33:15,129
these forms can't prove anything.

792
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,409
Quite a number of people

793
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:17,249
have given me feedback that

794
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,369
they really can't do this thing.

795
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:21,369
It's nothing difficult.

796
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:22,609
If the club

797
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:23,489
cannot come up with its own

798
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,809
system and standard guidelines,

799
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,809
it will end up like how it was before,

800
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:27,689
poor and backwards.

801
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:28,849
Ms. Liang,

802
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,969
you don't even know how to play,

803
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:33,609
you've never been on a pitch,

804
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,009
yet you try to use your ways

805
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:35,529
of running an office

806
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:36,649
to torture us sportspeople,

807
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:37,769
was that even suitable?

808
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,129
Let's just talk about training content.

809
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:42,529
Our plans can never keep up with change.

810
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:43,729
If today,

811
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,089
the player says their shoulders hurt,

812
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:48,129
then we'll do footwork and
court positioning instead.

813
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:49,649
Your form says

814
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:50,969
we shouldn't change what we filled in,

815
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,769
isn't that all nonsense then?

816
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:53,849
It's not that you can't change it,

817
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:54,649
in fact, you can,

818
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:55,849
anytime.

819
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:57,809
Just put the changes down as well.

820
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:59,289
How do we do that?

821
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:01,489
We don't want to care anymore.

822
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:03,209
Let's not focus on
the players' movements anymore,

823
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,329
we'll just focus on counting numbers.

824
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:07,169
Let me tell you,

825
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,289
everyone has a lot to say

826
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:10,249
about your form.

827
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:12,969
You should think this over.

828
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,769
Think again.

829
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:41,969
Let's do that once more.

830
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,608
Not bad!

831
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:46,329
Right.

832
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,249
Take a break now.

833
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:49,289
You played well.

834
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:51,168
One whole morning

835
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,089
and you're still going.

836
00:34:57,688 --> 00:34:59,049
Do you think that

837
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:00,369
I won't be a good player,

838
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:01,688
but a good coach instead?

839
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:04,849
That said,

840
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,089
I get quite a sense of accomplishment
from coaching you.

841
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:07,929
After correcting your movements,

842
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:08,689
in a few days,

843
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:09,489
you will always be able to

844
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:10,089
play quite well.

845
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,329
You're quite the coach.

846
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:14,769
Thanks, bro.

847
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:16,609
Who's your bro?

848
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:23,089
I...

849
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:27,889
I spoke without thinking.

850
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,009
I never wanted us to be bros.

851
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,329
What do you mean then?

852
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,049
I spent so much time teaching you,

853
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:36,489
I don't even deserve the 'bro' status?

854
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,289
No.

855
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:38,849
What do you want then?

856
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,169
This was what I had in mind.

857
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:43,329
Say,

858
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:44,049
I thought I was

859
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:45,049
a coach who started you off.

860
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:46,209
Yet you're here

861
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:47,169
getting all sensitive and inferior.

862
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,089
Fine, I will call you my bro.

863
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:50,969
I think that

864
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:52,089
you're a pretty decent guy.

865
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:52,929
And...

866
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:56,569
I'll stop here.

867
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:57,809
It's tacky when one speaks too much.

868
00:35:58,169 --> 00:35:58,969
I'll get going.

869
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:08,489
Dai Yi,

870
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:09,969
your forehand topspin

871
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:11,089
swinging is off.

872
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:11,929
Keep practicing that.

873
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:17,689
Dai Yi,

874
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,369
what are you looking at? Go on!

875
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:37,729
Mom, stop picking up balls!

876
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:38,729
Can you just go home?

877
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:42,209
You best pick up your racquet.

878
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:44,009
You're playing so badly yet

879
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:45,289
you still have the audacity to
throw your racquet.

880
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,129
The tennis league selection

881
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,089
is just a few months away,

882
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,409
do you still want to go to school?

883
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,409
Your performance is so inconsistent,

884
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:52,929
if I don't stay and pick these balls up,

885
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:54,529
you won't have more time to practice.

886
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,209
I'm going to turn 18 soon,

887
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:15,169
yet I still have to show up
with my mum for practice.

888
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,329
You don't think it's embarrassing,

889
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,569
but I do!

890
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:27,409
Dai Yi,

891
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,369
go have a look at other clubs.

892
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,969
Any family like ours,

893
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:33,649
as long as

894
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:34,849
they have kids playing sports,

895
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,489
will be spending huge amounts
of money and time on them.

896
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:38,249
You started this since young,

897
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,609
and I've always been around.

898
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:41,449
What's wrong now?

899
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:44,569
What is it about being 18?

900
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:52,889
So you think

901
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,169
I am embarrassing you?

902
00:37:57,729 --> 00:37:59,489
I'm embarrassing you?

903
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:09,529
Dai Yi's mother,

904
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,329
don't work yourself up.

905
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,209
It's too hot today.

906
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,609
Come and sit in my office.

907
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:19,289
Let's talk it over.

908
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:39,729
Come, have a drink.

909
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,569
What's going on

910
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,129
with the club these days?

911
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,169
A new manager every now and then,

912
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:51,729
coaches with outdated training methods,

913
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,249
sometimes we couldn't even fulfil
the required class hours.

914
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,209
I have long wanted to change clubs.

915
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:57,249
Yes,

916
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:00,009
I feel what you feel deeply.

917
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:01,449
The problems you brought up,

918
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:02,609
I will manage it as soon as possible.

919
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,169
Please give me some time.

920
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:05,529
Please trust me.

922
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:11,649
If you don't want me here,

923
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:12,449
I'll go home.

924
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,009
You still

925
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:13,929
have half an hour left,

926
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:15,009
go home after you're done.

927
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:15,849
Dai Yi's mother,

928
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,569
I'm new to the club,

929
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:20,329
I'm Song Sanchuan.

930
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,849
I'd like to discuss something with you.

931
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:38,809
Come forward.

932
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,289
Aunty,

933
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,489
this is the bag you're using?

934
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:47,769
Let me have it.

935
00:40:12,729 --> 00:40:14,169
It's fine if I'm here, right?

936
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:16,689
Carry on yeah?

937
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:24,769
Let's go.

938
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:26,769
Go!

939
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:55,369
Hello, Alex.

940
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:56,729
(Young Space Tennis Club)
(I am currently managing a)

941
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:57,609
tennis club.

942
00:40:58,009 --> 00:40:59,969
I want to ask you for a favour.

943
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:16,489
Your footwork is wrong.

944
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,689
You always sidestep
to get back into position.

945
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:30,489
One two three four

946
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:32,609
five six seven eight.

947
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:34,889
It's a waste of time.

948
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:35,849
However,

949
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:37,009
should you use cross step,

950
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:41,169
one two three four,

951
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:43,689
you can save half the time.

952
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,289
Do you want to learn that?

953
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,529
I can teach you.

954
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:54,809
Actually, I was just

955
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,089
picking up some balls.

956
00:41:57,169 --> 00:41:58,249
You don't have to worry about it.

957
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,449
After all these years,

958
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:03,929
it was the first time that my mum
was off the court.

959
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:05,449
You're not helping me,

960
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,449
you're helping her.

961
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,729
I know she really wanted to sit down,

962
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:11,089
but she can't.

963
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,369
That game yesterday,

964
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:14,329
the last shot,

965
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:14,929
that shouldn't be

966
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:15,769
a mistake.

967
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,489
The problem lies in your footwork.

968
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:19,449
Do a split and lunge step for net play.

969
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:20,089
This is your training today.

970
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:21,809
Do it a thousand times.

971
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:25,889
I fully understand that.

972
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,649
Your mother told us today,

973
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:34,769
she'll sit in for a few more times,

974
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:36,529
and after that,

975
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:38,889
she won't stay anymore.

976
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:46,649
Thank you, Sanchuan.
