1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,280
Why are you staring at me like that?

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,055
Don’t think you can—

3
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:08,980
You can like me.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,830
Hmm.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,455
What’s that called again?

6
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:12,880
That waiter said about me—

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,480
Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking.

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,880
How could a pheasant pair with a phoenix? Even thinking about it is wrong.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,035
Oh.

10
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:21,960
That’s right.

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,560
Which movie is this?

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:24,960
It’s East Meets West.

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,873
Yeah, East Meets West.

14
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:26,510
That one.

15
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,148
He could guess it’s East Meets West.

16
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,610
That’s already impressive.

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,260
You keep staring at me.

18
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,910
Don’t fall for me.

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,310
Even though I’m approachable,

20
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,885
and naturally beautiful,

21
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:35,710
and easygoing,

22
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,160
Where’s a real phoenix with a true heart?

23
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,960
If you let me do this part,

24
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,310
I can recite it word for word.

25
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,800
Go ahead.

26
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,200
Let me do it.

27
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,350
What are you doing?

28
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,100
Staring at me.

29
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,575
Though I’m naturally beautiful,

30
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:48,150
and easygoing,

31
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,500
but how could a pheasant ever fly with a phoenix?

32
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,000
Me—

33
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,550
You, what about you?

34
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,775
You’re just a mere waiter.

35
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:55,700
Why would I even notice you?

36
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,025
Don’t—

37
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,950
Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking.

38
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,325
You think just because I’m staying here,

39
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:01,100
you have a chance?

40
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,190
Even thinking about it is a sin.

41
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,990
This is—

42
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,890
That’s right.

43
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,140
I have both beauty and brains.

44
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,790
The embodiment of heroism and chivalry.

45
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,740
Tang Bohu.

46
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,890
You know who now, right?

47
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,640
Qiu Xiang.

48
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,590
That’s right.

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,390
Second line.

50
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,820
Right, isn’t it?

51
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,270
Third line, more—

52
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,120
Just brushing you off.

53
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,120
Yeah, that’s me.

54
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,470
Thanks.

55
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,070
Yeah, that’s it.

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,870
It’s basically Mandarin, right?

57
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,720
Me and you—

58
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,520
I’m not the same age as you.

59
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,870
Not the same, just different.

60
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,570
Ah.

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,720
Why bother?

62
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,780
Why use knives and guns?

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,830
Knives and guns.

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,680
Hmm.

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Are you begging me?

66
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,830
Begging me?

67
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,030
You’re—

68
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,030
Trying to control me?

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,470
Is there a difference?

70
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Yes.

71
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,620
Sky.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,520
Of.

73
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,820
Ah.

74
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,510
I can't kill you this year.

75
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,660
Today, I killed your

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,710
son.

77
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,910
I killed your son.

78
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,535
Son.

79
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:26,060
Right?

80
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,495
When you just asked if I speak Cantonese,

81
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:33,970
Now let me ask you back,

82
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520
Do you speak Cantonese?

83
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,045
It's fine.

84
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:40,420
No problem.

85
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,670
Describe it properly.

86
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,745
It's just a name plus an action.

87
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:44,220
Right?

88
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,270
How many characters?

89
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,475
12345677 characters.

90
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:49,800
OK.

91
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
Are the first three characters a name?

92
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,500
The first 123455 are names.

93
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,450
Left hand, left hand, right hand, right hand, combine together.

94
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,800
Put it down.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,450
Down, down.

96
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,085
Down, down.

97
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:09,110
Stop your leg.

98
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,510
Right leg, yes.

99
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,810
Stand up straight.

100
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,360
No, no, no, no.

101
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Stand, stand.

102
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,560
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

103
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,010
The wind is coming.

104
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,690
Who are you?

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,440
There's wind.

106
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,065
There's wind.

107
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:33,540
There's wind.

108
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,190
What are you doing?

109
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,415
What am I doing?

110
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:36,990
There's wind.

111
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,890
What's this for?

112
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,740
Butt.

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,615
Butt.

114
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:40,190
Butt.

115
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,640
Stick your butt out.

116
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:43,790
Yes.

117
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,890
Spasming.

118
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,990
Mermaid.

119
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,590
Are you messing with me?

120
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,065
You're messing with me.

121
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:50,365
Yes.

122
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:50,965
The last two.

123
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,140
Right hand.

124
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,140
Right hand.

125
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,140
Left hand.

126
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,890
Left hand.

127
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,690
Alright.

128
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:57,865
Hey.

129
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:58,390
Make a fist.

130
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,840
Make a fist.

131
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,140
Punch forward.

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,290
Boxer.

133
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:04,840
Open.

134
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,890
Hold.

135
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,080
OK.

136
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,380
67344 sports troublemaker.

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,680
Olympic.

138
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,680
Machine.

139
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,370
1234567

140
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,095
12345, someone's left hand, right hand, what, reach out, hands, hands

141
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:44,970
Put your hands together

142
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,570
What are you putting together?

143
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,490
Put them together

144
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,040
Palms facing up

145
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,740
Palms facing down

146
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,590
Down, keep going down, down, down

147
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,890
Right leg

148
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,115
Legs

149
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:03,890
Oh no

150
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,840
Stretch it out, stretch it out

151
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,310
This, oh no

152
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,060
This is getting abstract

153
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,160
Not flying

154
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,310
Blowing wind

155
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,460
Wind, wind, wind

156
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,160
There's wind

157
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,260
Rukawa Kaede

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,850
123455

159
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,350
Whose is this?

160
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,700
That's weird

161
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,500
Who is this?

162
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,375
Do you know?

163
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,100
I don't know either

164
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,700
You don't know the right move either

165
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,550
Are you messing with me?

166
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,350
He doesn't know

167
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,775
No no no

168
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:45,625
He doesn't know

169
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,750
You don't know?

170
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,640
Having "wind" is correct, right?

171
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,790
There's the word "wind"

172
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,003
Right

173
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:50,940
There's wind

174
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,590
OK

175
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,340
Six, seven

176
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,390
Hands

177
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,365
Spread out

178
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,390
Spread out, then clench

179
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,765
Mechanical

180
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:05,190
Mechanical six, seven, fencing

181
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,640
Right

182
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,690
And before that, it's three, four, three, five

183
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,890
Let me try to imitate it

184
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,390
Let's see if he can guess it, okay?

185
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,140
Like this

186
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,840
Everyone, think about it

187
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,465
There's wind, right?

188
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,990
There's the word "wind," wind blowing

189
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,460
Alright

190
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,210
Time's up

191
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:33,810
Reveal

192
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,610
Please say the correct answer

193
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,935
This one is hard

194
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:42,410
Actually, you did it pretty close

195
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,435
But you missed the main idea

196
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:46,810
It's already that person

197
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,910
Wrong

198
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,535
The main idea is similar to this move

199
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,560
Who does it look like?

200
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,035
It already is

201
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:52,410

202
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,360
It's exactly the same

203
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,510

204
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,235

00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,810
Please say answer three

206
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
And blowing wind

207
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,010
Blowing wind

208
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,360
There's wind

209
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
Marilyn Monroe

210
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,870
Me

211
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,970
I couldn't remember
