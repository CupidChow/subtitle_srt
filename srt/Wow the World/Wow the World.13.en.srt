1
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,160
Cheer up, let's eat.

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm hungry.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,720
Let's go.

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,000
We're at the restaurant, everyone.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,680
This planet is so cute.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,840
Come on, let's eat here.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,280
Right?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,320
This restaurant is beautiful.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,960
Please have a seat.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,640
Hello, welcome to Cave Restaurant.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,160
Is everything okay? How are you all?

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,680
What would you like to eat?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
Do you like this beautiful Roman restaurant?

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,120
Got it.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,200
They say this place has a lot of history.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,080
Yes.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,960
Yes, everyone looks great.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,800
Alright then.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,720
I'm just making up the translation.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,160
Can you speak English?

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,400
English, you speak English.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,920
Okay.

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,440
This is one of the best restaurants in Rome.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,320
Today you’ll get to enjoy some excellent food.

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,880
Traditional dishes.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,600
Serve the dishes.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,960
Serve the dishes.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,160
Hey, you haven’t ordered yet.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,200
Do you have a menu?

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:32,920
Okay, thank you.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,600
You can choose the dishes you like.

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,040
Okay.

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
Very good.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Very good, thank you.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,240
So how can we enjoy

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,080
Italian cuisine?

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,880
In a moment, we’ll give everyone a menu.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,920
Each member will order one dish from the menu.

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,200
A dish they want to eat.

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
The waiter will tell you

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,160
the Italian pronunciation of each dish.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,600
Members will go to the ordering counter one by one.

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,320
The waiter will take your order based on what you say.

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
and place the order for you.

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
So the difficult part is for them,

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,480
not for us.

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
Bring up the menu.

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
Thank you.

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,160
Thank you.

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,600
Thank you.

52
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,320
We can't really understand this menu.

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,800
How are we supposed to order if we can't read the menu?

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,480
No.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
The logic of this menu...

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Look, for example, when we go to a restaurant to eat,

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,200
the first few items should be cold dishes,

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
the middle ones are main courses,

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,320
and then desserts at the end.

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,320
That's how it should be organized logically.

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,040
Now, everyone,

62
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,680
we need to work together now.

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:31,960
Okay.

64
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
The best food.

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,320
They're all good.

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Which one is...

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
steak?

68
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,360
Steak.

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,520
Steak.

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,640
I'll order first.

71
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
Steak.

72
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,240
Steak.

73
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,480
Beef

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
You're next to me

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Why are you talking about beef?

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,360
Why are you talking about beef?

77
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
Beef

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,520
He wants beef, he wants lamb

79
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,480
I'll just have some seafood

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,600
That's what it means

81
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,720
How do you say shrimp? Shrimp

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Shrimp is just

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
This is a pun

84
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
How do you say mussel?

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,600
Mussel

86
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
I like mussels

87
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,280
Look, like this

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,080
Lemon

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
And then mussels

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
Look at the gesture, you do mussels

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,760
Close it

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Let's work together

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,680
Sir

94
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
I want this

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,160
Seafood

96
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,520
We don't have it

97
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Mussels

98
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,080
Mussels

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Mussels

100
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,480
You can eat the things on here

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,200
Only these

102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,280
No seafood

103
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,640
Excuse me.

104
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
What is this?

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,560
This is a potato.

106
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,160
Potato.

107
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,680
Potato.

108
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,880
Baked.

109
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Baked potato.

110
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
Baked, baked potato.

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
Baked, baked potato.

112
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,640
Baked potato.

113
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,240
Is it tasty? Is this good?

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,880
Baked.

115
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
Baked.

116
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,960
Delicious.

117
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,680
Delicious.

118
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,800
Perfect.

119
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,280
Alright, baked potato.

120
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,960
Baked potato.

121
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
Baked potato.

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
Baked potato.

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,200
What does this mean?

124
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
Baked potato.

125
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,240
Mushroom and ham pizza dumpling.

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
I can't listen.

127
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,880
Baked potato.

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
It's over.

129
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
Baked potato.

130
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Baked potato.

131
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
Don't talk to me.

132
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,560
Everyone says don't talk to me.

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,880
Uncle Nai.

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,640
Don't talk to me.

135
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,720
Uncle Nai.

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Uncle Nai, Brother Nai.

137
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,160
Uncle Nai, Brother Nai.

138
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,200
Too mischievous.

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,520
Got it.

140
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Oh no, I forgot.

141
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,640
Come on, be serious.

142
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,520
Roasted potatoes with spicy lamb chops.

143
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,480
You picked such a long one, bro.

144
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,880
Sorry.

145
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,960
One more time.

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,480
Okay, understood, got it.

147
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,920
Roasted potatoes with spicy lamb chops.

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Okay.

149
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,120
You just have to pick the long one.

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,280
Picked the hardest one.

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
Okay, thanks.

152
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,880
Just bleat.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,600
All right.

154
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
He gave you the armpit.

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
The three of us shouldn't sit together anymore.

156
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,520
Seriously.

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,080
Lamb armpit, here's a plate for you.

158
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
Lamb armpit.

159
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,120
Sea bass, caviar, right?

160
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:43,200
Sea bass and caviar flavored pasta.

161
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,800
Okay.

162
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Okay, thank you.

163
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,440
Wow, that was perfect.

164
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
Having a talent for languages really makes a difference.

165
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,920
Sea bass, caviar.

166
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,840
Bro.

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
My mind is totally blank.

168
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,680
It's like I blacked out.

169
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll start first.

170
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,760
Start first.

171
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,880
That one takes longer.

172
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,040
Yeah, go ahead and start.

173
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
His word is so easy.

174
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,680
He just needs to "moo" and that's it.

175
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,520
Right.

176
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,320
Steak

177
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,600
Steak

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,920
Steak

179
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Yes

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Okay, how much do you want?

181
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Eight hundred grams, one kilogram, two kilograms, one point six kilograms

182
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,480
One point six kilograms

183
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
One point six kilograms

184
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,840
Do you need it sliced?

185
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,920
Do you need it sliced?

186
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
Medium

187
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, three

188
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Is one point four kilograms okay?

189
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
He's very simple

190
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,320
Steak

191
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,840
That's it

192
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,960
Why is he taking so long?

193
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,840
Right

194
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Talking about a steak for so long

195
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,080
Let's slice it, okay?

196
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,080
Sure

197
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,920
Great

198
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,520
Thank you

199
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,080
Okay

200
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,160
You've finished ordering, right, bro?

201
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,760
A little

202
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,120
A little mistake

203
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
Steak is just that simple

204
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,400
What mistake?

205
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,919
This word is the easiest

206
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,280
You're the first one and you still made a mistake

207
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
After steak

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,840
How would you like it cooked?

209
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
Hello

210
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,040
Hello

211
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Can you give me

212
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,640
some lamb chops?

213
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,320
Do you know this?

214
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,920
I don't understand

215
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,760
What did you say? I don't understand

216
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,960
Do you want me to order for you?

217
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
Would you like to add some fennel salad?

218
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,120
It's very fresh, do you want it?

219
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,520
Okay

220
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,440
And one more thing

221
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,920
We also have piano service, is that okay?

222
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,720
Okay

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,360
Okay

224
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,880
Thank you

225
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
What did he say?

226
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,640
It's simple

227
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,320
Your words are so long

228
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,440
I said okay

229
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
He said okay, so I wrote it down here

230
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,520
Just eat whatever is served

231
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,920
So what should we do?

232
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Sir, it's your turn

233
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,480
Hello

234
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,880
Hello

235
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,120
Hello

236
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,240
Okay?

237
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,760
Do you want lemon ice cream?

238
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,520
Baked potato.

239
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,480
Very good, excellent.

240
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Alright, perfect, thank you.

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,680
Mushroom and ham pizza dumplings.

242
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,680
Okay.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,280
Okay.

244
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,240
Okay.

245
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,200
Very good.

246
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,120
Cheese and black pepper pasta.

247
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,280
What did he say?

248
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Go ahead.

249
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,600
Hello.

250
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,360
How are you? Do you need anything?

251
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,560
Sea bass and caviar flavored pasta.

252
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,200
Okay.

253
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,400
Okay.

254
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,520
Not this one.

255
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,240
I mean...

256
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,440
Cod and caviar flavored pasta.

257
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll write it down for you.

258
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,600
It's not a set meal, is it?

259
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
No way.

260
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Just saying, it might not be anything specific.

261
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
I don't even know what this is.

262
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,800
There shouldn't be anything too much in this, right?

263
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,000
Come on.

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,760
Whatever.

265
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,720
Alright, let's go with this.

266
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
Who can play the piano?

267
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,440
You can do it while waiting for the food.

268
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Yuning.

269
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,680
Go.

270
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Play one.

271
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,760
I'll accompany you.

272
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll accompany you.

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
You play this, then I'll play that with you.

274
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,880
Come on.

275
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,920
One, two, three, four.

276
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,640
Can I play "Neapolitan Dance"?

277
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,720
Great!

278
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
Sure, go ahead.

279
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,640
I'll play an Italian piece.

280
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,760
Okay.

281
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,800
Can you do it?

282
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
You can play it?

283
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,400
Really?

284
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
You need to close the lid.

285
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,760
That way, you show respect to the piano.

286
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,560
Did you know that?

287
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,320
Serve the dishes.

288
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,040
Serve He Ge's steak.

289
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Yours must be delicious.

290
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,040
For you only.

291
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
It's the restaurant's specialty.

292
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,040
The biggest steak.

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,880
Sorry, bro, I made a mistake.

294
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,280
Sorry.

295
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,920
No joking around.

296
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,040
Yu Wen's dish is ready first, serve it.

297
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,280
Sichuan pepper.

298
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,760
Sichuan pepper powder.

299
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,760
I ordered pepper.

300
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,880
You ordered black pepper.

301
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,480
Black pepper.

302
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,600
Black pepper.

303
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,040
Remember to finish it.

304
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
How can I finish this?

305
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,360
She ordered a condiment.

306
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
No, yours is pretty good.

307
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,480
We'll eat it with ours later.

308
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
Eat it with theirs.

309
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
Here, let me help you.

310
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,880
But it smells really good.

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,360
Yeah.

312
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,840
But you guys have to try it first.

313
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,320
Everyone was supposed to share just now.

314
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,200
We tried it, we did.

315
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,840
We ordered this one.

316
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,000
I ordered it.

317
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
This is what Yuwen ordered.

318
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,520
You ordered pepper.

319
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,920
Bro, your reaction time is a bit slow.

320
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,200
Were you even here just now?

321
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,160
No, I thought the steak was coming.

322
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,840
Were you even paying attention or not?

323
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,240
So we said we could eat it with everyone else's food.

324
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,520
Wait a second.

325
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,920
Why is a seasoning even on the menu?

326
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,080
Yeah.

327
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
That's why we didn't order the last few items.

328
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
The last few are probably just seat charges.

329
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,480
Napkins, chopsticks.

330
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
We came to such a delicious restaurant,

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,040
and we're just eating these?

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
It's here.

333
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,240
This is great.

334
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,080
This is the bread before the meal.

335
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
My pasta.

336
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
I want to eat pasta.

337
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
This must be delicious.

338
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,680
I want to eat this.

339
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,040
Share, let's share first.

340
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
Thank you.

341
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
You take this one.

342
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:51,960
This one.

343
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,040
Delicious.

344
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,000
It was still crispy when it just came out of the oven.

345
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,600
That's awesome.

346
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
Eating pizza without garlic

347
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,080
loses half the flavor.

348
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,000
Big dumpling.

349
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,360
This one is impressive.

350
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Pizza dumpling.

351
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
What is this?

352
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Big dumpling.

353
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,680
This is Beijing's Roulong.

354
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,080
Isn't this Roulong?

355
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,840
Ham.

356
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,400
This looks delicious.

357
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,240
This must be delicious.

358
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,960
This is awesome.

359
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,280
Great choice.

360
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,520
Bro, you go ahead.

361
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
I'll take one.

362
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,720
Thanks.

363
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,760
I'll have a corner piece.

364
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,240
This is so delicious.

365
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,080
Honglei, you ordered this because it's tasty, right?

366
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,880
Try it, really.

367
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Give it a try.

368
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,240
This is so good.

369
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,360
This stuffed flatbread.

370
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
Delicious.

371
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,560
What did you order again?

372
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,840
I memorized the Italian name.

373
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Mushroom and ham pizza dumplings.

374
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,040
I ordered pasta.

375
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,560
Pasta with sea bass and caviar flavor.

376
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,440
Jun, that's great.

377
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
One for each person.

378
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,160
Here you go, little sister.

379
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,880
Don't you love eating this?

380
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,480
Let me give you some more.

381
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
Help yourself, take more.

382
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,400
It's fine, I'll just have a bite.

383
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
Take more.

384
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,280
Isn't this just hand-pulled noodles?

385
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,360
It's a bit like hand-rolled noodles.

386
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Right?

387
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Baked potato

388
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Just as I thought

389
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,320
That's the one

390
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,880
Pretty much

391
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,520
It means potato

392
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah

393
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,600
Smells great

394
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
This potato is really delicious

395
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,120
This is a tangerine, not an orange

396
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Thank you

397
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,160
Onion

398
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
Why is there also an orange here?

399
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,080
There is

400
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
Very healthy

401
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,880
Sure

402
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,080
I see it, it's so charming

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,319
Yours is the hardest at this point

404
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
This must be delicious

405
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,839
This smells amazing

406
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,400
That's great.

407
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,839
Yuning just ordered two dishes.

408
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
Goat cheese.

409
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,119
It needs to be squeezed.

410
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,599
The moldy one.

411
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
It smells bad.

412
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,560
Now let's give others a chance.

413
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,320
Do you want to choose

414
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,840
to share Yuning's dish?

415
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,600
Then let's eat, have a little.

416
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Try it.

417
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
We can enjoy it alone or together.

418
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,880
Let's enjoy it together.

419
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Enjoy together.

420
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,840
Bro, are you eating?

421
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,800
I don't want to eat.

422
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,320
Wait a moment.

423
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,360
Let me struggle with myself for a bit.

424
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,080
This goat thing...

425
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,320
I might feel allergic to it.

426
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,720
If I get what Junjun mentioned,

427
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,680
I might have to quit.

428
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
Except for Honglei,

429
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,680
everyone else must enjoy Yuning's dish.

430
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,360
Everyone else eats as usual.

431
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,160
Honglei.

432
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,280
Put down your knife and fork, cover your ears.

433
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,800
Why?

434
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,040
Okay, bring out Yuning's dish.

435
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,560
Did you order fireworks or something?

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,680
Hello

437
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,360
Piano music

438
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,320
You can't listen

439
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
Put down the piano music

440
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Is it really that elegant?

441
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay

442
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,360
Come on, cut the beef

443
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
This feels really nice

444
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm so mad

445
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
What are you doing?

446
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,000
Come

447
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,200
What are you talking about?

448
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
So enjoyable

449
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
I was fooled

450
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,400
I can only watch, just watch

451
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,360
That's enough, bro

452
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
Eat, bro

453
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,720
That's enough

454
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,520
Eat

455
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,080
Right
