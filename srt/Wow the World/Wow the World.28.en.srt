1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,520
Alright, before today's journey begins,

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,040
let's do a warm-up task.

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,640
If some people can't think straight while eating,

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,560
their minds don't work properly,

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,480
and they can't understand the rules,

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,160
that's their own responsibility.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,840
It's their own responsibility.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,560
I'll only explain it once.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,400
No need to repeat it.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,840
Then Naiwen shouldn't eat.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,080
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,160
Why did you kick me?

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,680
Who are you talking about?

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,840
You should pay attention too.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,760
Otherwise, you two should admit defeat.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,800
Do we even need to admit defeat?

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,880
We were already losing.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,640
I can't respond to that.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,320
The name of the task is

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,840
Everyone can form teams freely.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Split into performance and observation teams.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,920
Members of the performance team will act according to the mood of the music

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,160
and say the assigned lines.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,640
One person will have no music in their headphones.

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,440
After the performance, the observation team will first ask questions based on the acting

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,960
and then use the music style

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,000
to figure out who didn't have music in their headphones.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,320
How about playing "palm or back of the hand"?

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,000
Sure, let's do it.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,280
Palm or back of the hand.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,280
You two are a team now.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,480
Continue.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,240
Palm or back of the hand.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,160
Naiwen and Didi.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,120
And Wen and Honglei.

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm thinking of quitting this show.

37
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,240
I'm with them again.

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,160
The property management company is online again.

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
This is fate.

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,320
Let's go over there.

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,320
Doesn't that mean we're guaranteed to win?

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,600
Aren't we guaranteed to win?

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,760
Can we try a little harder?

44
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,880
Bro, winning is really easy for us.

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Wen, let's put in a bit more effort.

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Then they won't stand a chance.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,360
Usually, we do it for the show's effect.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
We let them win.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,760
Can we take it seriously today?

50
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,520
That's right, bro.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,120
Let's show our real strength.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,880
That's right.

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,680
Yes.

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Come on, draw your roles.

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
Has it started playing now?

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Not yet.

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Everyone, listen up.

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,160
Our lines for the first round.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Take it down.

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,440
Take it down.

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
What are you saying?

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,880
You're overacting.

63
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,520
You acted too soon, bro.

64
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,200
Too early.

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
It hasn't started yet.

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,240
I can hear it.

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,920
I heard it.

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,440
Just a little, even a tiny bit?

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,920
I can hear it.

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,520
Now, perform your lines according to the music.

71
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,120
Play the music.

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
Can I just vote directly?

73
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,480
Let's do it one by one.

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Why?

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,680
Vote.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,200
It's supposed to be one by one.

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,080
Who starts?

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,560
Naiwen, stand up.

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Stand up.

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Naiwen, stop acting.

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
That's enough.

82
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,440
Can I just vote for you directly?

83
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,480
Then let's start from Yuwen.

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,240
A little bit.

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
Not even a little bit?

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,960
Next, the second person.

87
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
A little bit.

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
Not even a little bit?

89
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,680
She has music.

90
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Her voice is already amplified.

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,560
Okay, go ahead.

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,040
Naiwen.

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,680
A little bit.

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Not even a little bit?

95
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,520
A little bit

97
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,640
Lemon is here

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,400
Lemon is here

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,600
Even if it's just a little bit

100
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,680
Is this the Lemon family's dance?

101
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,920
It's over

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,560
Okay

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,160
Come on, you can ask them questions now

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
Slow song or fast song, Didi?

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,680
Me?

106
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,920
Wait a moment

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,320
You go first

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,760
You go first, bro

109
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,440
Naiwen, you go first

110
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,680
Slow song or fast song?

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,680
It's not a song

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not a song

113
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Then we'll vote you out

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,480
No problem

116
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,200
It's a tune

117
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,120
Not "bro," it's "uncle," right?

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,360
Honglei

119
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Is it a fast song or a slow song?

120
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,720
Honglei

121
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,240
Tune

122
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
You guys

123
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,920
Double tune

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,320
Double tune

125
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,480
The two of us are crickets

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Cricket duo

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
Didi, slow song or fast song?

128
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,000
Male or female singing?

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
I'll say a really good one

130
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,600
When I was listening

131
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
When I was about to do it

132
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,560
It already

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
became a little bit faster

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,880
Naiwen

135
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,920
Just now, that—

136
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,640
Your performance, right?

137
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,680
You knelt down in your performance just now.

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
That very tragic side.

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
Who were you speaking to?

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
In what situation?

141
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Did you do that performance?

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,760
What was your emotional anchor?

143
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,680
A long time ago.

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,280
And then?

145
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Then, someone who lives by begging—

146
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
A mother.

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,320
She was on the street.

148
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Very vivid.

149
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,800
Really vivid.

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,680
She was helping her child.

151
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,120
Begging for a little money for food.

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
But no one gave her anything.

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Her child was about to starve to death.

154
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,320
Okay.

155
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,760
Yuwen, what era is your song from?

156
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,080
It has to match the context of the lyrics.

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
A long time ago.

158
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,640
Is it from ancient times?

159
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
Or is it from the Republic era?

160
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Somewhere in between.

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Everyone, think back for a moment.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Actually, just now,

163
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,120
to be honest, these three

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
the way these three performed

165
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,680
was rather on the sad side.

166
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,160
Right.

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040
Only one person did the lemon walk.

168
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,680
I feel like

169
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,560
the one who walked like that was

170
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,840
look, it's not quite normal.

171
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Naiwen has been thinking about it.

172
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Bro, it's like this.

173
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,800
He actually dared to walk to that rhythm.

174
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,080
He was confident

175
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,920
that he could hear the rhythm of the song.

176
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,240
You know what I mean?

177
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,880
He goes one, two, three,

178
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,680
two, two, three.

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
He dares to walk like that.

180
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,600
He stepped out.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
Naiwen, you don't need to doubt it.

182
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Naiwen,

183
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,400
okay.

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,600
Play the music.

185
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,080
Naiwen can hear it too, right?

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
The others can hear it as well.

187
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,480
It's him.

188
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm telling you, it's him.

189
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,600
His acting is spot on.

190
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,440
So the song played just now was this one.

191
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,160
I performed it so accurately.

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Every time I look at Naiwen,

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
he looks like a villain.

194
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,120
It's when he's listening to music,

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
it's strange that he has to look at others.

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,120
Vote.

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,560
Come on.

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Seriously.

199
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,560
Come on.

200
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,120
No need anymore.

201
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,840
Come on.

202
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,760
Three, two, one.

203
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,440
Honglei.

204
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
Why?

205
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
That lemon walk of yours.

206
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,320
Is it him?

207
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,120
It's him.

208
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,760
See?

209
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,600
He's the real "lemon spirit."

210
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Naiwen.

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Why do you always...

212
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,880
You always seem guilty.

213
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,440
I don't know.

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
He's covering for his teammate.

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,200
That's right.

216
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,720
If you want to guess, sit on the left.

217
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,280
If you're performing, sit on the right.

218
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,360
Draw your role.

219
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Come on, put on your headphones.

220
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,920
He, you're fine.

221
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,560
Let me see how you act.

222
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Definitely no problem.

223
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
Absolutely no problem.

224
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,880
Here, the lines.

225
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you know I've been waiting for you for a long time?

226
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,040
Three, two, one, play the music.

227
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Right from the start

228
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,400
Why is it this again

229
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
Little hammer pounding your chest

230
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,200
He can hear me talking

231
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,040
Starting with Honglei

232
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,280
It's started

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
Do you know I've been waiting for you for a long time

234
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
Bro, why are you showing

235
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
such an evil vibe again

236
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,200
Feels like it matches the music just now

237
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,840
No problem at all

238
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,520
Still the villain, this time still the villain

239
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,120
Bro

240
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,320
Do you know

241
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you know I've been waiting for you for so long

242
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,960
Kneeling style performance

243
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,840
Do you know

244
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
I've been waiting for you for a long time

245
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
They're all very neutral

246
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,840
Everyone is very neutral

247
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,160
For my performance, I'll just sit here

248
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,840
Playing mahjong

249
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
Draw, pong, win

250
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,160
Do you know I've been waiting for you for a long time

251
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,560
Waiting for the ten-thousand tile

252
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,800
Got it

253
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
That hit right in the feels

254
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Tough, isn't it

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,920
Honglei

256
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,560
When you hear this music

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,400
What comes to your mind

258
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,800
Let me think.

259
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,080
A lot comes to mind, it's complicated.

260
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Right, just say one.

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
Joyful.

262
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Okay, that's fine.

263
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,400
Naiwen, when you hear this music,

264
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,960
what do you think of?

265
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
You can't say "joyful."

266
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,080
Very happy.

267
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,760
Alright.

268
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
But,

269
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,880
when you encounter this,

270
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,520
after meeting the girl you like who is late,

271
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,640
you knelt down.

272
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I knelt down again.

273
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,640
Actually, I'm still happy.

274
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
And also,

275
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
but this thing,

276
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,960
no matter if she's late or not,

277
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,800
or how long I wait for her,

278
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,960
my heart is still joyful.

279
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Gong Jun, same question.

280
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,880
Same question.

281
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,600
It was a hot summer day.

282
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,720
The temperature reached forty degrees.

283
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,800
That's more than just hot.

284
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
You'd be dried out.

285
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Is that what you're talking about?

286
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,480
Is this what you mean?

287
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,040
The temperature reached thirty-six degrees.

288
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,920
I was anxiously waiting.

289
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,000
Waiting outside in thirty-six degrees.

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
Waiting for my beloved.

291
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
And finally, she appeared.

292
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,800
I was in a very joyful mood.

293
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,320
Very happy.

294
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
Waited half the day in thirty-six degrees.

295
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,040
Yeah.

296
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,320
So, just now, I checked the time.

297
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Okay, what about you, He?

298
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,320
I was just waiting for the right tile.

299
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,640
So this song made you hear it.

300
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
It just felt really good.

301
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,960
I was waiting, then I won.

302
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,320
I was just with my buddies.

303
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,280
We finished eating together.

304
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,880
Let me be more specific.

305
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
It was probably in the summer.

306
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,680
On a Wednesday night.

307
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,840
Okay.

308
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,800
Was it hot?

309
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
That kind of mood just now.

310
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,800
It was probably already 10:30.

311
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,560
I lost by a little.

312
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
You think it's him, right?

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,160
Not anymore.

314
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,840
I don't think so now.

315
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,400
He dared to act like that, which is actually pretty specific.

316
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,920
I don't think so now.

317
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,840
Logically speaking,

318
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,920
I don't think it's the first or last.

319
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,280
I don't think it's these two.

320
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
The bad guy is between those two.

321
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,360
We're voting for Naiwen.

322
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Me too.

323
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,280
Yeah.

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,320
Then that's it.

325
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
Let's listen to the music first.

326
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,160
Yeah, let's listen first.

327
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,800
Listen, let's listen first.

328
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,240
Come on, let's listen.

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,520
Alright.

330
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,880
Right now, we think it's Naiwen.

331
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,400
Okay, three, two, one.

332
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,880
Start.

333
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,520
It’s definitely him.

334
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Wait a moment.

335
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,160
Your subtle facial expression changed.

336
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,920
I guessed this song, can you believe it?

337
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,400
I guessed this song.

338
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,560
It was at that moment—

339
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,480
When He Ge was playing like that—

340
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
No, wait a second.

341
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,400
I have to say something.

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
I guessed because we all thought

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,880
it was Naiwen Ge.

344
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,520
Even with my dark sunglasses,

345
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,600
I could see this song.

346
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,360
When it started playing,

347
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,240
the corner of his mouth twitched slightly like this.

348
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
It just twitched a bit.

349
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,360
It’s definitely him.

350
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,080
Honglei Ge was the first.

351
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,120
His tone was right.

352
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
I think he was very accurate.

353
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
I’ve waited so long the flowers have wilted.

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
This is the one played by Gong Jun.

355
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,080
This is “Ting Pai.”

356
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,400
It’s related to Dou Dizhu.

357
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
Those two must be true good guys.

358
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,080
So one of these two

359
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
must be Naiwen Ge.

360
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,640
Naiwen Ge.

361
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,000
Naiwen Ge.

362
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,600
Actually, Naiwen Ge does a lot.

363
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
He was following what Honglei Ge said.

364
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,120
He was in rhythm.

365
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes, Ge.

366
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,360
We just—

367
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Even if we’re foolish,

368
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
we’re voting for you this round.

369
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,640
Guess, come on.

370
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,680
Three, two, one.

371
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,160
Please vote.

372
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,640
Naiwen Ge.

373
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,880
Na Wen, bro

374
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
Was it luck?

375
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,040
Come on

376
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,120
We're not stupid

377
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,800
We're clear-headed

378
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,080
Was it really luck?

379
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,720
It wasn't luck

380
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,360
Not luck

381
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,640
It was really your twitching mouth, bro

382
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,360
No, it was that

383
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
It was thanks to Ning's analysis

384
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,520
We really didn't do much this round

385
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,560
But you're really amazing

386
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,240
Super smart

387
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,880
Let's keep playing

388
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,480
Come on

389
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Draw your roles

390
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,480
Say the word first

391
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,480
Isn't that a line from "Zhe Yao"?

392
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,800
Let's go

393
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,080
Three, two, one, play the music

394
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
Na Shu, it's you again

395
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,320
You obviously have no idea

396
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,600
Alright, come on

397
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,120
Yu Ning

398
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,520
Do you really think

399
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,840
you're so stunning

400
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,760
that you can fool me?

401
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,560
I think Yu Ning is really good at this

402
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Because that's just how he is

403
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,400
I can't tell any tone from it

404
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,800
Na Shu

405
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
A little bit

406
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,480
Do you know I've been waiting for you for a long time?

407
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,720
Here we go again

408
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
This is high

409
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
Do you think

410
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,160
you're truly stunning

411
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,480
and can really charm me?

412
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,960
About to sing it out, actually

413
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,760
So beautiful

414
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
The music is beautiful

415
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,720
So beautiful

416
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,200
So beautiful, the way you performed it

417
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
Those two sighs, that's right

418
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,360
Do you think

419
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,440
you're really gorgeous

420
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,840
and can truly captivate me?

421
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,640
Yes, you performed very well

422
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,840
It matches the music perfectly

423
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,240
Really

424
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
It's so hard for them

425
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
You

426
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Do you really think

427
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,600
you're so beautiful

428
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,920
that you can enchant me?

429
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,760
Awesome

430
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,720
Awesome

431
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,360
Everyone can ask questions now

432
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,560
Didi asks

433
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,840
Uncle Nai

434
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
This song, for you

435
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,760
You asked him who this person is.

436
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,320
The person after kneeling down.

437
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,160
Who was it said to?

438
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,560
This matter.

439
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,400
It's actually quite complicated.

440
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,280
For me,

441
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,720
In my mind, this piece is

442
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,040
rather neutral.

443
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,119
It's very conflicted.

444
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,599
It doesn't want to, but has to.

445
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,040
Yes, brother.

446
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,440
You know?

447
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
Right.

448
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
Well said.

449
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,040
Awesome.

450
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,359
Isn't it?

451
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,640
Really great.

452
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
He, in what situation was this?

453
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
This kind of expression.

454
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,520
He’s right.

455
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
Just anything.

456
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,120
That song just now gave me confidence.

457
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,360
Let me be more precise.

458
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,360
Those two have nothing to do with each other, as said.

459
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,920
Yuning.

460
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,720
You say, brother.

461
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Is it you rejecting others

462
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,880
or others rejecting you?

463
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,840
I reject others.

464
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
Do you enjoy rejecting them?

465
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,240
Very much.

466
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,840
It's not just enjoyable, it's satisfying.

467
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,120
Was the other person male or female?

468
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,040
It doesn't have to be a person.

469
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,160
Jun Jun.

470
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,840
You waved your hand three times.

471
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
In what situation was that?

472
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,200
When you were doing what

473
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,680
did you sigh twice and wave your hand three times?

474
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
I think it's Junjun.

475
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
It's a very

476
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,880
conflicted feeling.

477
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,160
Yeah.

478
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,320
Exactly.

479
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,800
Yes.

480
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,240
I want to get the "lemon spirit,"

481
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,040
but I don't dare to look at him.

482
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
It's very complicated.

483
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
He's right, you described it perfectly.

484
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,280
Junjun, may I ask, what year was that?

485
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,280
That story.

486
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,440
Your eyelashes are so long.

487
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,120
"Eyelash spirit."

488
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,640
They're really long.

489
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,840
Take a picture quickly.

490
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,400
My eyelashes are really long.

491
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,800
Really.

492
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
That's cheating, isn't it?

493
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Blank slate, Jun is a blank slate.

494
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,440
Alright, then in the music,

495
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,000
everyone does their own part

496
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,760
and performs it again.

497
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,680
Do you really think

498
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,120
you're so stunningly beautiful

499
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,520
that you can fool me?

500
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,680
It's definitely in the rhythm.

501
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,840
What rhythm did you give him?

502
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,560
Liu Yuning can match it too.

503
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
He can match it.

504
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,920
Naiwen, music.

505
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,520
Naiwen, I want to see how you perform this.

506
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,320
Going to kneel again.

507
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,120
Modern dance.

508
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,080
You're amazing.

509
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,520
This isn't accurate.

510
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,360
This is terrible.

511
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,360
This performance is awful.

512
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,760
The timing is completely off.

513
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,520
Actually, when I act,

514
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
every take is different.

515
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
I won't take roles like this anymore.

516
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,400
It's not suitable for you.

517
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,400
Play the music.

518
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,760
Do you really think

519
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,080
you're so stunning

520
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
that you can fool me?

521
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
Great acting.

522
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,200
Come on.

523
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,640
This is so hard.

524
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,560
They did it on purpose.

525
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,160
They deliberately acted out of sync.

526
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,160
All of you act very...

527
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
like monsters from Journey to the West.

528
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,560
But you're like a cartoon.

529
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
Do you really think

530
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,680
you're so beautiful

531
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,840
that you can deceive me?

532
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
It's all in the rhythm.

533
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,800
Only Yu Ning is suitable.

534
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,960
I think the two in the middle

535
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,640
Then I think

536
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,800
If it's this piece of music

537
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,360
If it really is this piece

538
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,880
He Ge is the most suspicious.

539
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,840
I think Yu Ning is the most suitable.

540
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,880
Right.

541
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,360
And also Jun Jun.

542
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,240
Yes.

543
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,840
And then the next person

544
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,160
might not perform accurately.

545
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,760
I think He is the least fitting.

546
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
Doesn't match the required scenario.

547
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,920
That music.

548
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,600
But He Ge always does this kind of abstract stuff.

549
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,080
His hip movement

550
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,440
is all in the rhythm.

551
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,920
I think it's Jun Jun.

552
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,800
Because I think Ning Ge also guessed it.

553
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,520
It's Jun Jun.

554
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,800
So whenever Jun Jun performs something

555
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Ning Ge just says "yes, yes, yes."

556
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,840
But the praise is completely unreasonable.

557
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,800
Let's come to a consensus.

558
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,360
Gong Jun or He?

559
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
Jun Jun, I think.

560
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,760
Jun Jun.

561
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,400
Who brought you here?

562
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,920
Wrong answer.

563
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,440
It really is.

564
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
It really is him.

565
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,080
I give up.

566
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,120
It must be him.

567
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
You're amazing.

568
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
You're awesome, bro.

569
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,800
I should have listened to your "lemon essence."

570
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Those three people have something in common.

571
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
I thought he did it on purpose.

572
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,400
Yeah, I thought he did it on purpose.

573
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,880
You acted like that,

574
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,760
and the others didn't even guess.

575
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,040
Let me tell you,

576
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,400
this person is used to being so abstract.

577
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,280
Way too abstract.

578
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,040
Seriously.
