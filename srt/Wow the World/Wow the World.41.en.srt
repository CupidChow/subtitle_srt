1
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,160
Next,

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,120
you'll get a unanimous team challenge.

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,240
We'll ask a question.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,120
Everyone must answer right away.

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,600
If all answers match,

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,720
the challenge is a success.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
Let me give an example.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,760
Everyone, get ready.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,840
Name a song by Zhou Jielun.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,120
Three, two, one.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,360
"Love Confession Balloon"

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
"Rice Field"

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,280
"Silence"

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,200
"Love Confession Balloon"

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,840
"Rice Field"

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,360
"Silence"

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,800
This is really...

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
This is hard.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
If answers don't match, you lose.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,680
You guys...

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,360
You can...

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,960
Can you ask something easier?

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,680
No, listen to me.

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,280
Bro, it's simple.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,959
Whatever he asks, we all say

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,400
"obtuse angle."

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,040
That's it.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,840
What's an obtuse angle?

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,280
It's just, for example,

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,880
it means nothing, no meaning.

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,240
Abstract.

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,800
And...

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,600
And...

34
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,680
We just say "and."

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,600
You get what I mean now?

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,720
"And," right.

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,320
"And" just means...

38
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,800
"And" means nothing.

39
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,320
No.

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,760
But you have to answer correctly.

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,160
So ask something simple.

42
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,200
Like, how many hands does a person have?

43
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,360
Two.

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
How many days have we been in Italy?

45
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,600
Questions like that, right?

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
That's hard, with ten people.

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,840
Or eight people.

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,880
How can eight people all agree?

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
It's impossible to match.

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,840
Let's try it first.

51
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,200
Okay.

52
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,440
Let's go.

53
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,960
How many in the Earth Family

54
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,480
claim to be 1.79 meters tall?

55
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,000
Three.

56
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Two.

57
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,640
One.

58
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Three.

59
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,400
Three.

60
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,960
Here are the three 1.79-meter-tall guys.

61
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
All here, okay.

62
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,760
He didn't say it.

63
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,720
He did.

64
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,160
He did.

65
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,480
He did.

66
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,840
I said it.

67
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,240
See?

68
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Three.

69
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,760
Check the replay.

70
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,840
I definitely...

71
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,680
Three.

72
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
I definitely said it.

73
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,040
Finally got it right.

74
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,640
I definitely said it.

75
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,160
I...

76
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,120
I was the loudest.

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,880
In the Earth Family,

78
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,400
who's the worst at bottle flipping?

79
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Three.

80
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,920
Two.

81
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,840
One.

82
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,560
Chen Xingxu.

83
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
Li Naiwen.

84
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,080
Li Naiwen.

85
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,680
Chen Xingxu.

86
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,480
Yeah.

87
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,800
You told him to flip a pear.

88
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,880
This...

89
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,760
This world has

90
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
After it's over, you take

91
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,400
Take one back to your room

92
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,160
Practice in your room

93
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,680
Okay?

94
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,880
I'll test you tomorrow morning

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,160
Did you get it to stand up now?

96
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,160
I learned it later

97
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,880
I got really good at it later

98
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,640
I really can't remember

99
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Who was it in their team?

100
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,680
No, you just

101
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Why are you shouting so loudly

102
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Calling my name?

103
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
I did such a good job standing it up

104
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,000
Because

105
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,040
No, I thought you were really

106
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,160
It should be Xingxu

107
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
It should be Xingxu

108
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,760
I learned it later

109
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,600
Yeah, later he

110
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
He caught up afterwards

111
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,440
Why did we make a comeback?

112
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
Because we stood the bottle well

113
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
And sang the song correctly

114
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,800
Plus you cheated

115
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,080
And I cheated too

116
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,160
We made a comeback

117
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,080
Mine

118
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
In the Earth Family

119
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Who sings bel canto the best?

120
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,160
How come twenty

121
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Like me

122
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,320
Outstanding person

123
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,160
Go ahead

124
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,200
Quicksand

125
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,240
Outstanding person

126
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
Let go

127
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,800
Worries

128
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
Three, two, one

129
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Liu Yuning

130
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,240
Right

131
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,680
It's me

132
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,880
The shy rose quietly blooms

133
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,640
Red Brother Lei didn't say anything

134
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
I didn't say anything either

135
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
My mind went blank

136
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
My brain

137
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Just like that, it happened

138
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,000
It turned into a mushroom

139
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah

140
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,800
Turned into Second Aunt

141
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,440
Become Second Aunt

142
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,880
Red Aunt

143
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,480
I think He Brother's is more standard

144
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,600
Outstanding people like me

145
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,920
It's fine if it's wrong

146
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
It's already wrong anyway

147
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
When you're in Italy

148
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
And get help from someone

149
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,200
What should you say?

150
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Three

151
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,399
Two

152
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,120
One

153
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,120
Thank you

154
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,280
Thanks

155
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
He said thank you

156
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,760
That's right, isn't it?

157
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,000
Chinese culture

158
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,640
I say thank you everywhere I go

159
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,960
Next, the challenge gets harder

160
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,040
Earth Family members take turns

161
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,720
Doing actions in a different direction than the command

162
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,320
If anyone makes a mistake or is too slow

163
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,360
The challenge fails

164
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
It's just up, down, left, right

165
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Up, down, left, right, me

166
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
Person, up

167
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,000
Me.

168
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,200
What is this?

169
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Left, right, up, down.

170
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,280
What is this?

171
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,760
Me.

172
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,680
What does that question mean?

173
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,120
What was the word again?

174
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,560
Philtrum.

175
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,680
No, what?

176
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,200
Philtrum.

177
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
Outstanding among people.

178
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Outstanding among people.

179
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,600
Wait a second.

180
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,080
Does Red Brother Lei know how to play?

181
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,320
No, I'm just thinking about the rules.

182
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,000
He didn't get it.

183
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Then this...

184
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,440
Then our chances of winning aren't high.

185
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,360
They're high.

186
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,520
Bro, with you we can win.

187
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,040
No.

188
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,200
He just needs to...

189
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,560
All eight of us have to win.

190
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,240
Come on.

191
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,960
Let's play.

192
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,360
Come on, let's go.

193
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,960
Who starts?

194
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,880
Okay, Xingxu can start.

195
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,880
Alright, let's go.

196
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Earth Super Fresh

197
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,960
Okay, failed.

198
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
No more chances left.

199
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Wait, that doesn't count.

200
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Just tried once.

201
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,960
Give it a try.

202
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,120
He thought it was the same direction.

203
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,600
Is it different or the same?

204
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,440
Different.

205
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,160
Different directions.

206
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,080
Different.

207
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,840
Xingxu, got it?

208
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,320
Different.

209
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,920
Got it.

210
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,200
Come on.

211
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,840
Right.

212
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
See, I don't even need to do it now.

213
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
They're all your apprentices.

214
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:53,960
Come on.

215
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Earth Super Fresh

216
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,960
Didi

217
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,960
Earth Super Fresh

218
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,560
Earth Super

219
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,720
Super Fresh

220
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
Super Fresh

221
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,880
Second chance is gone.

222
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,840
What's wrong, bro?

223
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,600
I know.

224
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Bro, I just thought about it.

225
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,280
Is your neck uncomfortable?

226
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
Yeah, my neck felt a bit off just now.

227
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
Uncle Nai's neck isn't feeling well.

228
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,040
Got it.

229
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,120
Something just flew by outside.

230
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
Bro, what was that?

231
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
It really did pass by.

232
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Look, it went by.

233
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,080
So many people walked by, take a look.

234
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,320
Seriously.

235
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,480
Too many people walked by.

236
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,080
Look at all those people.

237
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
No, in a competition like this,

238
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
Can we not have

239
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
outside factors distracting me?

240
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I really wanted to look over there just now.

241
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,400
Seriously.

242
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,440
It's just too much.

243
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
Come on, Uncle Nai, try again.

244
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,200
No one left?

245
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
Everyone, stay still.

246
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,640
Don't move.

247
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
Don't distract me.

248
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,040
Come on.

249
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,040
Come on.

250
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,960
Get ready.

251
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Earth Super Fresh

252
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Xingxu

253
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,160
See, people are still walking.

254
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,200
Can the people outside stop walking?

255
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,960
It's a bit distracting.

256
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,400
Come on.

257
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,160
Like this.

258
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,800
Let's start from Yuning, okay?

259
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Just play.

260
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Go ahead and play.

261
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,000
Alright, come on.

262
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Earth Super Fresh

263
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,480
Red Brother Lei

264
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
Earth Super Fresh

265
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,320
Jun Jun

266
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,600
Earth Super Fresh

267
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Earth Super Fresh

268
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Wait a second.

269
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,280
So nervous.

270
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,080
Feeling a bit of pressure.

271
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,080
The pressure gets bigger as it goes on.

272
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Let me tell you all,

273
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,760
First, check if anyone's outside.

274
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm telling you, we'll win this round.

275
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,400
Trust me.

276
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
He got interrupted by us just now.

277
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,400
He kind of lost it.

278
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,640
His momentum dropped.

279
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,440
Come on.

280
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,800
Really.

281
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,080
Come on.

282
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
Earth Super

283
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,880
Super fresh

284
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,520
Earth Super Fresh

285
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:33,960
Fresh

286
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,720
Beautiful

287
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,640
Beautiful

288
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,240
Cleared

289
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,320
Cleared

290
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,600
Na Wen, don't hesitate

291
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,520
What are you thinking of

292
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Whatever you choose, you'll win, trust me

293
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Uncle Nai, don't hesitate

294
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
What were you just thinking

295
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,640
Tell me

296
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
Uncle Nai, let me tell you

297
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,600
Close your eyes

298
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,200
Okay

299
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,800
Come on

300
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
Earth Super New

301
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,560
Fresh

302
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,280
Super fresh

303
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
You...

304
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Lost

305
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
I shouldn't have closed my eyes

306
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,720
Bad Luck Bro, you...

307
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Bro, it's fine

308
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
Let's try again

309
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Again

310
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,160
One more time

311
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,920
We can do it

312
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
We don't give up

313
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Today, we play until everyone wins

314
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,320
Let's start from Yun Ning, I think that's good

315
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,520
Yun Ning, go ahead

316
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:29,760
Go

317
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,039
Earth Super Fresh

318
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,679
Ning, what's wrong

319
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,200
What's wrong

320
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,159
Raising your hand means...

321
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,840
My head hurts a bit

322
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,799
Want to say something

323
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,440
A bit tired

324
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
A bit tired, right

325
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
See, someone explained for me

326
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
No, you want to say...

327
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,679
You want to speak

328
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,320
If you want to speak, just say it

329
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,080
No, you don't need to do that to speak

330
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,840
Can we...

331
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
No, can we start from that side

332
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,600
Sure

333
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:50,840
Right

334
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Yeah, this doesn't count, right

335
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,520
Makes sense

336
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,200
He raised his hand

337
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
No, from the previous spot

338
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,040
Right

339
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,280
From Na Wen's spot

340
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,760
Get up where you fell

341
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,520
Right

342
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay

343
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
Then turn this way

344
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,080
Turn this way

345
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,440
This way

346
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,680
Okay

347
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,920
Right, let's go

348
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,440
Earth Super Fresh

349
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,480
Okay

350
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,480
Earth Super Fresh

351
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,960
Earth Super Fresh

352
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Earth Super Fresh

353
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,120
Okay

354
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,600
Earth Super Fresh

355
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
Isn't it fine to get up where you fell

356
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
Red Brother Lei, did you get a stiff neck

357
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
None of that matters

358
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,320
My neck twisted for a second

359
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,680
Sorry

360
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,480
Let's go

361
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
Earth Super Fresh

362
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
Earth Super Fresh

363
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
Someone left over there again.

364
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,520
Lightning just struck.

365
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,040
Lightning.

366
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,760
It's raining.

367
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
Let's start with Junjun.

368
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,080
Go ahead, your turn.

369
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,720
Earth Super Fresh.

370
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,560
Earth Super Fresh.

371
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
Auntie.

372
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
Aunt.

373
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,800
Auntie.

374
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,520
Everyone has to lose once.

375
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,200
Please, give us two chances.

376
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,960
Let's try again.

377
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,360
Auntie, are you trying to use your face again?

378
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,800
Help us out.

379
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Give it a try.

380
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,360
Your turn, Yuwen.

381
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Earth Super Fresh.

382
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,040
Earth Super Fresh.

383
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,600
No.

384
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
We still have one more try.

385
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,840
One more chance.

386
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Yeah, one more.

387
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Two chances.

388
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,560
Twice.

389
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,040
Go.

390
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,480
Go.

391
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,120
Go.

392
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
Earth Super Fresh.

393
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,800
Got it.

394
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,040
Earth Super Fresh.

395
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
This scene is too beautiful, I can't look.

396
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,760
One more time, go ahead.

397
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,440
Is half a round okay?

398
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,200
There are too many people.

399
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,760
Half a round is fine.

400
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay.

401
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,680
Alright then.

402
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,360
Na Wen has one more chance here.

403
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,080
Na Wen, you choose.

404
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,600
Which half round starts from you?

405
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,320
This half round.

406
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
Count counterclockwise that way.

407
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,440
Right.

408
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,520
Ends at Yu Ning.

409
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm under a lot of pressure.

410
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
It's okay.

411
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,840
Stay calm.

412
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,520
Stay calm.

413
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,680
Earth Super Fresh.

414
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,880
Go ahead.

415
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,840
Earth Super New.

416
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
Earth Super Fresh.

417
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Two more times.

418
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
You're really into it, bro.

419
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
I don't believe it.

420
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
From Didi to Red Brother Lei.

421
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,080
Go ahead.

422
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,200
Go, Didi.

423
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
From Didi to Red Brother Lei.

424
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,840
Earth Super New.

425
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Fresh.

426
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:31,880
Okay.

427
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,000
Keep going.

428
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
Earth Super Fresh.

429
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
Earth Super Fresh.

430
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,240
Keep it up.

431
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,720
Go for it, bro.

432
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,240
Is it done?

433
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,680
Earth Super Fresh.

434
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Nice one, bro.

435
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Dare to keep going?

436
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,840
Do it.

437
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,400
Bro.

438
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,320
Nice.

439
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,640
We're both under a lot of pressure.

440
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,280
Jun Jun, your turn.

441
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,640
So nervous.

442
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,000
What's this?

443
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,640
Earth Super Fresh.

444
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,280
Go ahead.

445
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,840
Earth Super Fresh.

446
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,520
Earth Super Fresh.

447
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,240
Earth Super Fresh.

448
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
Please give us two more chances.

449
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,080
Two more times.

450
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,320
Today, we have to play until everyone wins.

451
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,480
Earth Super Fresh.

452
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Earth Super Fresh.

453
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,880
Nice.

454
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Nice.

455
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,080
Nice.

456
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Challenge us.

457
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360
You won.

458
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,760
Only then we'll pay for you.

459
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,280
If we lose,

460
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,520
Don't we get punished?

461
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,120
No.

462
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
He just won't pay for you.

463
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,120
And also,

464
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,040
You have to complete the punishment.

465
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,880
After finishing the punishment,

466
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
If you still can't pay,

467
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,040
You challenge him again.

468
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,640
Keep challenging.

469
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,280
Keep challenging.

470
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,040
Challenge until he buys for you.

471
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,400
Challenge him.

472
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,680
Until he pays.

473
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,400
We can win.

474
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,080
Anyway, we

475
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
won't lose much even if we lose.

476
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,600
Doctor Strange.

477
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,480
Of course.

478
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,120
Let me take a look.

479
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,520
Take a look.

480
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,640
Right.

481
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,600
I've done my research.

482
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,280
Actually, we can just order from here.

483
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,480
If you want to eat,

484
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,120
just go for the classic.

485
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,280
Their classic options include

486
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
Maybe, as you said,

487
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
you really do have some luck.

488
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
I'm just really lucky.

489
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
Let's not play Rock-Paper-Scissors anymore.

490
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,720
We'll leave the luck to you.

491
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,080
Rock-Paper-Scissors

492
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,200
Go

493
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Rock-Paper-Scissors

494
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,240
Rock-Paper-Scissors

495
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Stop playing

496
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,080
Let's eat

497
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,840
Stop playing

498
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,440
We're waiting to eat

499
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,920
You just timed it differently

500
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,280
We hadn't started yet, but he already did

501
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,240
Sometimes

502
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
Skill is also part of luck

503
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,440
It's mainly about strength

504
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,840
I know

505
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,320
There's actually skill in Rock-Paper-Scissors

506
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Yeah

507
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Exactly

508
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,080
Come on, I'll guess what you'll play

509
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,440
Rock-Paper-Scissors

510
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Rock-Paper-Scissors

511
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
I'll guess your move, go

512
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
Rock-Paper-Scissors

513
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,440
Go

514
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,240
A battle of the strong

515
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,360
Rock-Paper-Scissors

516
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,040
No

517
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
You're naturally cheerful

518
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
You should play "scissors"

519
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,440
What's this

520
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,680
What is this

521
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,560
Looks like that

522
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,440
It's like regular kimchi

523
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
Strawberry milkshake

524
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,960
Kimchi radish juice

525
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,160
Try a sip and you'll know

526
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Kimchi

527
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,240
Sour

528
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
Kimchi radish juice

529
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,560
Is it kimchi radish juice?

530
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,160
How bad does it taste?

531
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,080
It's sour and salty

532
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,200
See

533
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
He has no sense of taste

534
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
It's really tasty, honestly

535
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Thank you

536
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
This is our main dish today

537
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,920
This dish is tough

538
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,080
Do it like this

539
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,640
Xingxu, do it like this

540
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,600
Hold it with both hands like this

541
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
Then I'll use a wide angle to make the food look huge

542
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,840
Then make that kind of face

543
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,200
Got it

544
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,560
Okay?

545
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:42,880
Got it

546
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,240
I'll take your photo

547
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,600
Then

548
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,720
Hold both dishes

549
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
One on the left, one on the right

550
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,880
And then, wait a moment

551
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,080
Then you can look down at the dish

552
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,480
Looks like a real foodie

553
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,240
Okay

554
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,680
So hungry-looking

555
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,560
Take a normal photo

556
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,400
Take two normal shots

557
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,920
So hungry

558
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,200
"Foodie girl"

559
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
Nice, very cool

560
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,960
It's Lin Yi's turn

561
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,280
Your turn

562
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,240
Do I have to use these two dishes?

563
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,880
You can switch later

564
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,520
You can change to others

565
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,120
But you need to have them

566
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,800
Let's keep one more

567
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,560
Keep a few more

568
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,960
Don't sit over there

569
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,680
It's backlit over there

570
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:13,840
Like this

571
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,920
This angle is too weird

572
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,960
Wait a moment

573
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Wait a moment

574
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,880
This is the normal way

575
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,600
What about the weird way?

576
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,080
The weird way

577
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,960
Really weird

578
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,840
Your turn

579
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,480
My turn

580
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,800
Alright, okay.

581
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,480
Let me see.

582
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,120
Classic.

583
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,440
Normal.

584
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,960
Come on.

585
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,440
Normal.

586
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,680
The first bite is for the audience.

587
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,720
Here.

588
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,680
I think in the future,

589
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,080
if I'm not acting anymore,

590
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,040
I want to become a food critic.

591
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,920
Just like on "Earth Super Fresh".

592
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,680
Travel around and try all kinds of food.

593
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,360
Maybe

594
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,160
I'll eat things that are

595
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,480
not necessarily delicious.

596
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
But I think you should still taste them.

597
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,920
All kinds of experiences.

598
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,120
Life is about trying things.

599
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,920
I want to know what this is.

600
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm a bit curious.

601
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,800
Cheese.

602
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,280
Is it cheese?

603
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
And if it is,

604
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,320
put it on top with this.

605
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,240
That's how you should eat it.

606
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,520
I never expected

607
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,600
the American coffee in Spain is

608
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,440
really American style.

609
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,080
It's just that

610
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,360
it's so bad.

611
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,440
Really terrible.

612
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,880
I...

613
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,600
It's sour, right?

614
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:34,960
No.

615
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,560
Here in Spain,

616
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,800
I've ordered American coffee twice.

617
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
It's awful.

618
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,760
It's very sour.

619
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,480
The one I had last time

620
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,320
was bad, really bad.

621
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,760
This is so delicious.

622
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,360
"Explosive Dragon Beast."

623
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,800
He just rolled up such a long piece.

624
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,440
That's scary.

625
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,480
Finishing every dish is

626
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,680
the one you think is tasty,

627
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,120
is the biggest respect

628
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,040
to the restaurant and the chef.

629
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,599
She gave me a leaf.

630
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,839
And some veggies, you didn't finish.

631
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,680
Take the veggies,

632
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,839
roll them in the sauce,

633
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,760
roll it up.

634
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,000
Alright.

635
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,520
Anytime.

636
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,079
Anywhere.

637
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,359
Super detective, working seriously.

638
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,560
That's how it should be.

639
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,760
Anytime.

640
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,960
Anywhere.

641
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,400
Super detective, working seriously.

642
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,080
Can you talk like this in Spain?

643
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,600
Yes, you can.

644
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,920
I think it actually sounds nice.

645
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,960
Look at the guy next to us.

646
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,000
He's giving me a strange look.

647
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,760
When Red Brother Lei comes later,

648
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,600
how do we explain this to him?

649
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,120
We don't need to explain.

650
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,560
Just say our throats got cold from the drink.

651
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,080
We just drank ice water and it stung.

652
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,480
It's fine.

653
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,040
If it's embarrassing, we just stay quiet.

654
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,240
Talking like this is really noisy.

655
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,000
Why does this sound like a pedicure?

656
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Or maybe a tooth extraction.

657
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,680
It's for fixing lobster claws.

658
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,520
For picking out lobster meat.

659
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,200
Right.

660
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,200
Brilliant.

661
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,520
What happened?

662
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,000
His "brilliant".

663
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
So clever.

664
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,240
Can we finish this meal quickly?

665
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,000
Hurry up.

666
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't take it anymore.

667
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
My vocal cords feel uncomfortable.

668
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,320
Delicious.

669
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,240
So good.

670
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,240
I really need a bowl of cold tomato soup right now.

671
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Yeah, something like that.

672
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,240
Risotto would work too.

673
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,440
This black rice looks pretty good.

674
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,200
Squid ink rice.

675
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,320
Black rice.

676
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,080
I've always wanted to try this black rice.

677
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,560
Black rice.

678
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,600
Tasty.

679
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,720
The squid ink noodles here are good too.

680
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,040
The squid ink noodles are especially delicious.

681
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,520
I think this one

682
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,080
The first one on top

683
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,000
must be tasty.

684
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,120
Honestly, all the risottos look great.

685
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,480
Right?

686
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,960
I really want to eat it, seriously.

687
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,320
We have risotto, right?

688
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,000
We don't.

689
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,160
Even if we don't, we'll eat anyway.

690
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,520
We'll eat it no matter what.

691
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,120
Just eat it.

692
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,640
Go for it.

693
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,200
These are fried green peppers, right?

694
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,680
What does this taste like, guys?

695
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,840
There's basically no seasoning.

696
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,480
Just a bit of salt.

697
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,520
Oil.

698
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,840
This is just fried in oil.

699
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,200
So tasty.

700
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,280
A bit salty.

701
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,360
There's nothing weird about this shrimp.

702
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
No other flavors.

703
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Just salty.

704
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,120
Kind of like the ones we eat at home,

705
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,480
dried shrimp.

706
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,040
Salt-baked shrimp.

707
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Tastes like dried shrimp.

708
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
So salty.

709
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,280
Super salty.

710
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,400
Just like salty shrimp.

711
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,960
Like the ones we cook at home.

712
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,920
That dried shrimp flavor.

713
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,160
But a bigger version.

714
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,680
Want some lemon?

715
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,120
Let's get some.

716
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,440
Sure.

717
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,200
Okay.

718
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,600
Let's play the game.

719
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,160
Come on.

720
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,640
Let's go.

721
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,520
Bro, get him.

722
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,400
Accepted.

723
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,640
Alright, Earth Super Fresh.

724
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,240
Alright.

725
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Earth Super Fresh.

726
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,320
Earth Super Fresh.

727
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,560
That's what I did.

728
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah, that's right.

729
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah.

730
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,440
Let's confirm.

731
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
Because from my angle just now,

732
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,720
Jin Jing really did go down to the right.

733
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,760
She did.

734
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,560
Yeah, that's it.

735
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Because I just had something spicy.

736
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,760
Yeah.

737
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,440
Earth Super Fresh.

738
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,400
So, how is it?

739
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,760
A bet's a bet.

740
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
You have to pay and dance.

741
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,120
Alright.

742
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,800
I'm so mad.

743
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,640
Alright, let's go.

744
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,080
Let's go.

745
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,800
Let's do the dance first, bro.

746
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
Because the sunlight is nice here now.

747
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,120
Okay.

748
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,480
Alright.

749
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,240
What should we dance?

750
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,840
I'll find one.

751
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,440
Jin Jing, make one up.

752
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
This one's easy.

753
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,080
Guys, you know what,

754
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
Are there any other moves?

755
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,800
Sure.

756
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,400
Let's do this one.

757
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,640
Okay.

758
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Thirteen seconds, right?

759
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,040
Very good.

760
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,560
Just like that,

761
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,520
easy.

762
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,080
Easy.

763
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
Left, right.

764
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,480
Left, right.

765
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,040
Don't move.

766
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,520
And then?

767
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
Left, right.

768
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,760
Left, left.

769
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,760
That's it.

770
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,800
Down, up, down.

771
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,000
So embarrassing,

772
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
embarrassed all the way in Spain. Come on.

773
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,280
Okay, sure.

774
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,640
Sure.

775
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,160
Amazing.

776
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,720
Who knows what’s written here?

777
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,160
"Mom," it's fine.

778
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,960
No rush.

779
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,200
Was I rude just now?

780
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,640
Why do I feel

781
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,720
calling you "Mom"

782
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,160
actually made you happy.

783
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,440
What's up with you?

784
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,560
That's called commitment.

785
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,840
Actor.

786
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,920
Right, getting into character.

787
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,400
Alright.

788
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,600
Octopus.

789
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,080
One portion.

790
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,800
How much is it?

791
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,280
Twenty-eight Euros.

792
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,000
Twenty-eight isn’t cheap.

793
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,480
Challenge.

794
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
Challenge, no need to pay.

795
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,320
Come on, challenge.

796
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,760
Do you accept this challenge?

797
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
If you fail,

798
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,840
for the next fifteen minutes,

799
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,560
all three must speak in a high-pitched voice.

800
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,240
Do you accept?

801
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,200
All three what?

802
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
So I have to talk like this?

803
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,400
I have to speak like this now.

804
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,960
So I have to do it too, right?

805
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,680
Yes, we all have to speak like this.

806
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,440
I’m naturally like this.

807
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,520
Come on, they’re all willing.

808
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Then I’m in too.

809
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,920
Let’s do the challenge.

810
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,840
Go find three people on the street.

811
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,080
Play Rock-Paper-Scissors.

812
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,720
Beat all of them.

813
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,840
Then the challenge is complete.

814
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,120
Let’s go.

815
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,160
Let’s go play this game outside.

816
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,320
We’ll find three people.

817
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,560
Hello.

818
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
We’re playing a game.

819
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,160
Okay.

820
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,280
I need three volunteers.

821
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,480
Alright, you three.

822
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,160
Let’s play a game called

823
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,480
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

824
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,800
But we have to win.

825
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,720
You must win.

826
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,280
Yes.

827
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
You can say it in English.

828
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
They always pick rock.

829
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
That’s their rule.

830
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,280
No matter what I pick, you choose rock.

831
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,160
Okay, I can do that.

832
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,080
We’ll pick paper.

833
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,320
Alright, I’ll go first with you.

834
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,200
Rock, paper, scissors.

835
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,120
Paper.

836
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,280
No.

837
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Alright, next.

838
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,840
Come on.

839
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,840
He’ll pick rock too.

840
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

841
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,840
Bro, what’s wrong with you?

842
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,600
No, just once.

843
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,840
Isn’t it best of three?

844
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,720
Best of three?

845
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
Now, kid, kid.

846
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,320
Win three in a row.

847
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,480
Say thank you to them, come on.

848
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,640
Thank you very much.

849
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
Thanks.

850
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
We just had some family drama.

851
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,080
Let’s talk later.

852
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,640
Thank you.

853
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,000
Has the punishment started?

854
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,760
Yes, it’s started.

855
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,320
Let’s go eat first.

856
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,560
Great, let’s eat first.

857
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,160
And we still have to pay, right?

858
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,920
Yes.

859
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
This family could fall apart.

860
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,320
I don’t want to come back to this family.

861
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
If you dare, don’t come back.

862
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,040
Go sleep outside.

863
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
I have the money.

864
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,760
What are you thinking?

865
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,040
I’m going to buy food now.

866
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,800
So much.

867
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,560
So much.

868
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,080
Where’s my daughter?

869
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,560
Don’t ask us about your daughter.

870
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,360
Eat first.

871
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,680
Do you think I still have an appetite?

872
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,120
Did everyone leave?

873
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Her "dad"

874
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
is "dead" inside.

875
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,000
No way.

876
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,280
You're here.

877
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,600
Yeah.

878
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,120
You scared me to "death".

879
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,720
I'm waiting for you.

880
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
Hurry up.

881
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
What are you doing?

882
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,080
What are you doing?

883
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,400
Something happened.

884
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Something happened.

885
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,240
Kid's "dad", come out quickly.

886
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,320
What's wrong?

887
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,400
The kid.

888
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,920
She ran away.

889
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,360
Who ran away?

890
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,280
The kid ran away.

891
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,640
Really?

892
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,960
Is that true?

893
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,560
The kid ran away.

894
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,240
Took the money.

895
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,520
Ran away with the money.

896
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,240
Right now,

897
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,520
I'm starting to question my life.

898
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,320
Tastes good.

899
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
But there's a problem now.

900
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,760
Turned into a high-pitched voice.

901
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,160
But there's a problem now, kid's "dad".

902
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,560
What's wrong?

903
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
Kid's "dad" is using a high-pitched voice.

904
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,400
What's wrong?

905
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,440
Didn't pay the bill.

906
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,640
Where's the daughter?

907
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Still haven't paid?

908
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,560
The daughter ran away.

909
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,320
She left home.

910
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
She really ran away.

911
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,280
She really did.

912
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,520
Didn't even take her bag.

913
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,960
This kid...

914
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,720
That churros shop.

915
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,560
Where are the churros?

916
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
Flatbread with churros.

917
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
I think we both would love those churros.

918
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,680
Delicious.

919
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:47,920
Right?

920
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,480
Definitely delicious.

921
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,160
Yeah?

922
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,560
Otherwise, it wouldn't be

923
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,160
such a famous Spanish snack.

924
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,440
Good thing we didn't bring them.

925
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,160
It's a bit far.

926
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,280
Please recommend a classic Spanish dessert.

927
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,240
Churros con chocolate.

928
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,600
Great, I'll have one.

929
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,280
Okay.

930
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
I want to try it.

931
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,120
I think it's definitely

932
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
Such fragrant chocolate.

933
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,000
Wait, I can't hold back.

934
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,720
I'll try it first.

935
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
Guess who will step down the last stair.

936
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,400
Left foot or right foot?

937
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,320
Left foot.

938
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,840
The one in the red dress.

939
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,360
Left foot.

940
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,960
We won!

941
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,480
Life is really tough.

942
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,520
It's so hard.

943
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Aren't you going to ask where your daughter went?

944
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,040
She can go wherever she wants.

945
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,000
Kid's "mom", give her a call.

946
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,720
That's convincing.

947
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,880
Kid.

948
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,960
Kid, listen to "mom".

949
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,760
"Mom" knows you were tricked by bad people.

950
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,960
We will always be

951
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,440
We are family.

952
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,520
Come back soon.

953
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,280
I can't handle this alone.

954
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,760
Kid.

955
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,440
We are one big family.

956
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,840
We are your forever home.

957
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,360
Yes.

958
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,080
Come back soon.

959
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,600
Come back soon.

960
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,360
"Mom" doesn't blame you.

961
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,640
"Dad" doesn't blame you either.

962
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,800
Are you punishing your "dad"?

963
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,360
Yes.

964
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,520
Welcome home.

965
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,000
Welcome home.
