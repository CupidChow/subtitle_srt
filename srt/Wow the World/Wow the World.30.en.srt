1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,304
Seriously.

2
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:07,554
Didn't film it.

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,350
Let me massage it for you.

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,050
Your shoulders are really tense.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,550
Five, four, three, two, one.

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,150
Stop.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,500
Definitely got it on camera.

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,600
Definitely got it on camera.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,040
He even tried to look cool.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,015
Full face shot.

11
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:45,040
Tough luck for you.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,690
So conflicted.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,290
So conflicted.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,290
All five of them have good looks.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,090
Alright.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,940
I admit it too.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,340
Hey.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,740
We're Benjia, you know we're namesakes.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,840
Come on, don't mess with my good looks.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,515
Actually, if Hel was slimmer, he'd count too.

21
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:15,365
Why are you trying to join the spicy enthusiast group?

22
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:15,840
Right?

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,660
Went the wrong way.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,260
It's the process of elimination.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,160
What do you mean?

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,010
Did you pick the wrong side?

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
No, he just wants to save face.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,385
Even if I admit I'm a spicy enthusiast,

29
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,410
I still want to be good-looking.

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,460
Good-looking.

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,860
These paintings are so beautiful.

32
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,110
Really beautiful.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,090
I really want to buy one.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,140
So gorgeous.

35
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,240
Went into a shop.

36
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,340
Bought two paintings.

37
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,065
I'll show them to everyone later.

38
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,578
This one looks great.

39
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,240
So cute.

40
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,390
So many beautiful little crafts.

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,290
Going to buy something for my kids.

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,790
What should I buy?

43
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,570
These little cups are adorable.

44
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,770
This one looks nice.

45
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,270
Get one for both of them.

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,020
Cute.

47
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:18,020
So cute.

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,270
The puppy is cute.

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,670
Let's film my vlog now, okay?

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,345
Starting now.

51
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:26,320
This is Pure He’s casual VG.

52
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,570
Just this little plate.

53
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,420
It looks great with fruit in summer.

54
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,270
Really.

55
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:44,530
It has a real summer vibe.

56
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,280
So cute.

57
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,780
Super cute.

58
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,855
Two daughters at home.

59
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:56,230
If you buy one, you have to get a second.

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,580
Need to buy another one.

61
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,880
Get a similar one.

62
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,530
Let's go.

63
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,530
I'm happy now.

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,860
Let me touch it.

65
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:47,935
Sure.

66
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:52,460
You can pinch it once, just the first time is enough.

67
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,035
I've been training really well lately.

68
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,635
My muscle definition went from 20%

69
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,460
to 50, then 70.

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,810
This is from my coach.

71
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,460
A Russian coach taught me this.

72
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,645
This muscle training method is totally different.

73
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:02,220
Give it a try.

74
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,520
Do it in three sets.

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,845
When I say "Dadadada,"

76
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,695
you pinch, okay?

77
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:09,220
Let's do 20, 50, 70.

78
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,345
Trust me.

79
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:11,820
But be careful at 70.

80
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,170
Because that's when you're most likely to get hurt.

81
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,420
If you get hurt, it's not on me.

82
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,295
Come on.

83
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,770
See, Dadada.

84
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,070
Be careful.

85
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,720
I came because I heard you were coming.

86
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,920
That's why I joined this show.

87
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,895
So I missed you.

88
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,370
And you were gone for a few days this time.

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,195
I was a bit disappointed.

90
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:34,745
Really?

91
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:35,845
I felt sorry inside.

92
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:36,920
Disappointed and a bit down.

93
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,745
I really didn't mean it.

94
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,070
I...

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,620
I've been toughing it out for four or five days.

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,420
After you arrived,

97
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,570
I feel much more at ease now.

98
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,485
Also,

99
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:44,760
we are, you know,

100
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,410
both surnamed Chen.

101
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,110
We're Benjia—same family name.

102
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,985
I'm really looking forward to Xingxu coming to find me.

103
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,810
I wonder how he'll do it.

104
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,110
Really looking forward to it.

105
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Let's take a stroll.

106
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,915
We can actually split up and walk.

107
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:02,465
Go that way.

108
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:02,790
And then...

109
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,740
Xingxu is up ahead.

110
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,340
Right in front of us.

111
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,690
Do you guys know how strong he is?

112
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Do you know?

113
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,740
First of all,

114
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
let me tell you,

115
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,990
he's like a locomotive.

116
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,815
And also,

117
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:18,590
look here,

118
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,740
this spot,

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,465
it's all defined lines here.

120
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:23,290
It's like this.

121
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,140
Just tap it a bit.

122
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,490
Just a little tap.

123
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,590
That's called being low-key.

124
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,190
If I were like him,

125
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,390
I'd never wear a shirt outside.

126
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,390
All my moves just now

127
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,640
broken down,

128
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,190
you could edit them into a textbook example.

129
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,740
Help me finish it.

130
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,140
Guys,

131
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,790
with Xingxu's level,

132
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,690
if I don't go up and deliver it,

133
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,240
today's over.

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
And then...

135
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,350
Get a shot of his surprised face over there.

136
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,300
He'll think he looks really cool.

137
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,750
Totally seamless.

138
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,150
His confidence will go up.

139
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,450
Now we need someone like me to deliver it.

140
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,650
The third one.

141
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,950
Then maybe he'll do it himself, right?

142
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,250
It's easy to succeed.

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,150
I'm really curious what Brother Honglei will say to him.

144
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,555
The hint I just got was

145
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:26,630
lots of leg hair.

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,280
It must be Brother He.

147
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,280
Brother He has a ton of leg hair.

148
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,480
A few months ago, when I got a hair transplant,

149
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,640
some extra hair follicles appeared.

150
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,390
Hey.

151
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,215
They ended up growing wildly on my legs.

152
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:41,090
A whole patch grew.

153
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,965
No problem.

154
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:42,815
I won't argue anymore.

155
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:43,290
Guys,

156
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm done arguing.

157
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
If you vote for me,

158
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,140
you won't get another chance.

159
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,040
For my spicy boss,

160
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm willing to sacrifice.

161
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,440
I've been blessed.

162
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,840
I accept it.

163
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,590
Vote for me.

164
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,210
You only get one chance to vote for me.

165
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,985
Come on, do it.

166
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,610
Wait a second.

167
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,360
Chen He.

168
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,560
Do you dare say that?

169
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,410
You've been blessed, huh?

170
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,310
I've been blessed.

171
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,460
I've been blessed too.

172
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,760
Bet you didn't expect that.

173
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,610
Surprise!

174
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,910
I'll tell the truth in a bit.

175
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,610
You got me confused.

176
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,410
What are you trying to do?
