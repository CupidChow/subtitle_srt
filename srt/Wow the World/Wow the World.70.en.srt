00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
This restaurant has been awarded

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,240
the "The World's 50 Best Restaurants" honor.

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,040
Really?

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,520
And in 2024,

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,960
it ranked number one on The World's 50 Best Restaurants.

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,080
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,520
Welcome to our restaurant.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,200
We are the partners of this restaurant.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Our cuisine is

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,600
refined haute cuisine.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
It centers on creativity and innovation.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,040
It's a form of creative cuisine.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,080
Today,

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,599
we've prepared our signature dishes.

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,720
We hope you enjoy them.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,200
Thank you.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Thank you for the hospitality.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
This show is amazing, really.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
Now, we want everyone to experience

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,400
how every ingredient matters in the kitchen.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,720
This dish features eleven types of sprouts.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,400
Each one has a unique flavor.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I can describe the flavors for you.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,240
The first one below tastes like cucumber.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,200
Then,

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,680
it's so fresh and sweet.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,240
This flavor is really

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,880
She said cucumber.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,600
I instantly got it.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
It really feels like cucumber.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
What's the fourth one?

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,440
Raw potato.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Black pepper.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,320
Black heat.

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,600
Spicy.

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Black pepper.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,800
Black pepper.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,400
Lin is translating everything next to me.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,880
Black heat.

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,080
Black heat.

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
I'm really looking forward to the sweet one.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,680
It's my favorite, honey.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,640
Honey.

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,520
Honey.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,880
Really.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,960
Why is it sweet?

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,400
No idea.

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,880
We wanted you to finish with something sweet.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,880
This is really special.

50
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,520
This one,

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080
every part of it,

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,960
even the roots,

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,240
whatever it is,

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
it all has that earthy taste.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
Like after the rain,

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
that forest aroma.

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,960
Thank you, this is incredible.

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,080
Thank you.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,120
What's this?

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,840
Is this another natural thing?

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,680
Is this a natural oil?

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,520
Ran Oil.

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,400
He...

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
He asked if this is a natural oil.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,560
He said,

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Ran Oil.

67
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you guys doing?

68
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
It kind of tastes like sesame balls.

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,400
Just try a little.

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
I think it's delicious.

71
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,920
I think it's delicious.

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Such a rich truffle flavor.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,120
This is tasty.

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
Tasty.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,840
Fried food is always the best, folks.

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,440
This is amazing.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Do you know why

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,200
I love it so much?

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
I always like to eat things

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
I've never tried before.

81
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,080
It's like playing a game to me.

82
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,400
Your taste buds

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,000
keep discovering new flavors.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,360
Right.

85
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,200
It's like unlocking new gear.

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Expanding your possibilities,

87
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
in your whole life,

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
your food list,

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
all the flavors and tastes,

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
try them all at least once.

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,520
It's a really fun thing to do.

92
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,720
I think so.

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,120
Yes.

94
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,520
There's also a magnifying glass.

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
There's a little figure here.

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
A little figure.

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,000
Looks like coral.

98
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,680
A whole drawer.

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,360
This looks like jewelry.

100
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,800
It's so good, I almost don't want to eat it.

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
Is there oyster inside?

102
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,520
It has lots of seafood flavors.

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,360
Yes, there's oyster and caviar.

104
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,920
And a seaweed sauce.

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
It feels like being underwater for a moment.

106
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,240
Close your eyes and you feel like you're in the sea.

107
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,240
Really.

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,160
Delicious.

109
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,600
So delicious.

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,600
Amazing.

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,520
So good I want to applaud.

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,280
So good I want to applaud.

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
It's beautiful and delicious.

114
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,520
Fitness superfood, liquid salad.

115
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,080
This one tastes great.

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,160
The crispy layer underneath is tasty.

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,360
This squab,

118
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
I've never had anything like it.

119
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,280
The texture and flavor

120
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
It's truly Michelin three-star quality.

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
There are two more desserts coming.

122
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,640
Seeing how much everyone loves this restaurant,

123
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
we're going to use these desserts

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,360
to make a little bet with you.

125
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,080
No way.

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
You can take my life

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
for these eight desserts.

128
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm so touched.

129
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Friendship.

130
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
Come on, bring it on, hurry up.

131
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Okay, two desserts, two challenges.

132
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,480
The first challenge is a tongue twister.

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm from Fujian.

134
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm not good at tongue twisters.

135
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
What's the "Duke" up to?

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Warming up his mouth.

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
They're definitely going to lose.

138
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,880
No way they'll win.

139
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,600
They're doomed, right?

140
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,960
Hey, we're from Tianjin—

141
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,080
the land of tongue twisters.

142
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,520
No, not the city of tongue twisters.

143
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,920
Who said that?

144
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
Who told you that?

145
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,200
We Fuzhou folks get scared by tongue twisters.

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,920
Terrified.

147
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,840
Red carp and green carp.

148
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,520
And a donkey.

149
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,160
I was born tongue-tied.

150
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,600
I can't do it.

151
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,720
You have to fish on the island.

152
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,640
Still love to play.

153
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,720
Everyone's playing on their own now.

154
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
Feels like I'm back

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,840
in the art exam room.

156
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Getting ready, you know?

157
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Everyone has to prep.

158
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
Looking for the official site.

159
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,080
Official website filming crew.

160
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,840
To the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

161
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,160
Seeking treatment at Nanning Ethnic Hospital.

162
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,160
Come on.

163
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,920
No more talking.

164
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,400
That's about it.

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Let's go.

166
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,960
Like this.

167
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,160
Each person tries once.

168
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,040
See who can go the longest.

169
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,200
Who starts?

170
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,640
Let's go left to right.

171
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,520
I'll go first.

172
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,600
Ning practices every day.

173
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,400
Wrong.

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,960
"And a donkey"—isn't that right?

175
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,840
These carp are really tough.

176
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm telling you—

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm out.

178
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,280
You go, bro. Your turn.

179
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,160
Bro's up.

180
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
King of tongue twisters.

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
Li Naiwen.

182
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,200
From

183
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Tianjin.

184
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,160
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

185
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
What are you doing?

186
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,920
Why are you acting so cool?

187
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,160
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

188
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,720
The top seed trips at the starting line.

189
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,720
That's enough.

190
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,400
Next up, let's go.

191
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,920
Let's have Didi go. Didi!

192
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,080
No.

193
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
We won't get stuck on the first line, right?

194
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
I think Jin Jing can do it.

195
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,720
No.

196
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,840
Good line.

197
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
Nice, that's the sample.

198
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,160
Impressive.

199
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,960
Dead lion, stone.

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,680
You think you're fast?

201
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
Walk out of the hills.

202
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,360
That's pretty good too.

203
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
Not bad, not bad. Impressive.

204
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
Try it again in Cantonese.

205
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,080
Do it fast.

206
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,840
You need to have—

207
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

208
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,840
Loves eating red carp.

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,080
Do it in Cantonese.

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,720
Guangdong.

211
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Cantonese might be easier.

212
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,480
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

213
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,400
A taxi driver who loves red carp, green carp, and donkeys.

214
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,080
Go ahead, try it.

215
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,640
Wait a second.

216
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,280
Guang... Guang...

217
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
Guangxi.

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,440
I can't do it.

219
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
Cantonese might be easier.

220
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
That's good.

221
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,800
Go ahead, He.

222
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Still practicing, bro?

224
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
Still practicing.

225
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,080
I can't let everyone miss out on dessert.

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,000
He's our only hope from Shanghai Theatre Academy.

227
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,200
Top student at Shanghai Theatre Academy.

228
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
Pillar of the stage.

229
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
Mainstay.

230
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,080
Liu, who makes his own drinks for his car.

231
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,560
Sorry, teacher.

232
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
Teacher, sorry.

233
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,080
Are you watching the show, teacher?

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,360
The first dessert challenge officially begins.

235
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,800
Everyone must pass the tongue twister

236
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,920
three times by passing it along.

237
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,720
That's a win. You get five tries.

238
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,200
Let's go.

239
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
You guys are really—

240
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,360
Do you know what we do?

241
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
We're professionals.

242
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,360
We're the pros among pros.

243
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,480
You're running right into the experts.

244
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,800
Come on.

245
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,320
"Wa wa"—this one's tough.

246
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,680
This is hard.

247
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
Wa wa wa, wa wa frog.

248
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
Wa wa wa, frog wa wa.

249
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
Frog digs frog.

250
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,880
Wa.

251
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,080
This one's the hardest.

252
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,440
The kitchen staff look at us like we're weirdos.

253
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,840
Seriously.

254
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,240
Come on, friends.

255
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,480
No more practice, let's just go for it.

256
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
Let's dig in.

257
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,600
Start digging.

258
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
Everyone, get ready.

259
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
This round starts now.

260
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
I'll pick at random.

261
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
Three, two, one—Uncle Nai.

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
What is all this?

263
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,840
That's not right.

264
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,200
Wrong.

265
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,720
Wrong again.

266
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,960
All wrong.

267
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,200
Keep going, come on.

268
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,480
Go ahead, pick another at random.

269
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,960
Come on, come on.

270
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,840
Ready, three, two, one.

271
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,480
Xingxu.

272
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,320
I can't make out these two characters.

273
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,440
I can't recognize them.

274
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,840
Can't tell them apart.

275
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,080
Really can't tell them apart.

276
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,320
This one.

277
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,960
These characters look too similar.

278
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
This is truly hell-level.

279
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,360
One more time, one more time.

280
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,600
Three, two, one.

281
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Jin Jing.

282
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,880
I have another strategy too.

283
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,560
It's my turn.

284
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,320
After I finish reading once,

285
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,720
you all read it out, word by word.

286
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,320
Then it's my turn again.

287
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,600
Because I can't read twice in a row.

288
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:39,880
Okay.

289
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,360
But I...

290
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay.

291
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,560
That's clever.

292
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,080
Okay.

293
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Ready, three, two, one.

294
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,240
Jin Jing.

295
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,240
This is so smart, really.

296
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,160
Jin Jing, you're so clever.

297
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Amazing, Jing-jie.

298
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,000
Great, everyone won a dessert.

299
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,760
Now, let's start the second challenge.

300
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,280
Alright.

301
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,160
Everyone use

302
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,920
"I gaze up at the moon" and hold the note.

303
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,400
If the total time reaches 250 seconds,

304
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,760
the challenge is a success.

305
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,640
Hold the note.

306
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,320
Because for you all,

307
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,240
it's too easy for singers and actors.

308
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
So Xingxu only gets five seconds.

309
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
When I practiced lines before,

310
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,960
I focused on short, explosive sounds.

311
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,800
Each person gets thirty-five seconds.

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,320
Thirty-five seconds is already long.

313
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,200
Let's try.

314
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,080
Let's just do it.

315
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,800
Just do it.

316
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,160
Ready, three, two, one, Xingxu.

317
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,599
I...

318
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,000
Stop.

319
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:25,319
At...

320
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Keep going.

321
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,119
Push your belly out.

322
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,280
Good.

323
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,200
You've hit twenty seconds.

324
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,120
You've done twenty seconds, bro.

325
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,480
Thirty seconds.

326
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,040
Look up...

327
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
Good, twenty-five seconds passed.

328
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,040
Keep going.

329
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,760
Almost thirty seconds.

330
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,800
If each does thirty seconds, we win.

331
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,760
Thirty seconds.

332
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,720
Ten more seconds.

333
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
Thirty-eight seconds, two more.

334
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,400
Gaze...

335
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Bro, why does this line feel...

336
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,120
Bro, it's been ten seconds.

337
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,400
Twenty seconds.

338
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
Ten more seconds.

339
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,360
Have...

340
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,320
Have...

341
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,160
Have...

342
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm out of breath!

343
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Moon...

344
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,720
Keep going.

345
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,160
Twenty seconds.

346
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
Thirty seconds, that's awesome.

347
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,760
Keep holding.

348
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,800
Hold on, you can do forty-five.

349
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,040
Wait.

350
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,480
Wait.

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,680
Bright...

352
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,240
One second.

353
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,360
No, quiet.

354
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,320
Quiet.

355
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
Don't laugh.

356
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,520
How many seconds left?

357
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,080
Ninety left.

358
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,800
Let's not mess ourselves up.

359
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,320
Right.

360
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,080
Okay.

361
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,160
Go.

362
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,320
Of...

363
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,960
It's fine.

364
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:44,840
Have...

365
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,600
Like this.

366
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
I think it sounds like this...

367
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,280
This way is harder, harder to hold.

368
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,280
Ever heard this "dying" sound?

369
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,080
Hurry, can't hold on.

370
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,760
Quick.

371
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,520
Almost there.

372
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,280
How many seconds left?

373
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,760
Fifty seconds.

374
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,000
Fifty seconds, humans can't do that.

375
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,800
That's not humanly possible.

376
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Up...

377
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,080
It's harder without making a sound.

378
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Singer Liu Yuning.

379
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
So awesome.

380
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,080
Impressive.

381
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,080
Awesome.

382
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,840
Almost fainted.

383
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,080
This singer...

384
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,040
That's professional.

385
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,800
He lasted longer than all of us.

386
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Really, yes.

387
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,320
At least fifteen seconds longer.

388
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,080
If you don't give up,

389
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
it shows Yuning's

390
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Yes, totally.

391
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,280
advanced skills, right?

392
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,640
Congrats, everyone gets all the desserts.

393
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,320
Unity.

394
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,000
Unity is strength, alright.

395
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,840
I bet you all look in the mirror every morning.

396
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,800
Yes.

397
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,640
But you've never seen

398
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
how you look when eating.

399
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,560
When you eat,

400
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,280
you haven't seen your own facial expressions.

401
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,800
He'll put in front of us

402
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,800
a mirror for each person.

403
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,480
That's true.

404
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
See how you wolf down food.

405
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
These four snacks are made in a microwave.

406
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,000
Tasty.

407
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,840
This dessert is delicious.

408
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,160
This mirror really looks...

409
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,160
Bonsai

410
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,520
Kind of feels like sushi, right?

411
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,200
Cotton candy

412
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,240
Cotton candy

413
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,240
So beautiful

414
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,160
The last one is a French dessert

415
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,960
The ones on the tree are cotton candy

416
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,320
Cotton candy

417
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,200
Come on

418
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,440
Just take this one

419
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,240
Try this cotton candy quickly

420
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,800
One for each of us

421
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,160
Today

422
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,480
Our fresh journey at this restaurant

423
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
is about to end soon

424
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,400
Let's thank our chef first

425
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,760
and all of the staff

426
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Thank you

427
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Thank you

428
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,000
Thank you

429
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,760
It's an honor for the restaurant to host you

430
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,840
We hope that next

431
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,240
you enjoy your time in Barcelona

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,680
Thank you

433
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,640
Hope this place feels just like home

434
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,040
Hope you come back often

435
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
I can come back often

436
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,840
Okay

437
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,200
We can share together

438
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,880
Thank you

439
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,280
Thank you

440
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
Three, two, one

441
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,640
Let's play a little game here

442
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
The name of the game is

443
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,960
Time to sing again

444
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,680
Two members will be the Deadly Duo

445
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,000
They need to, within five minutes

446
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,040
find the lyric cards hidden around the room

447
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,440
and finish a duet performance

448
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
Each song has two lines, A and B, for the duet

449
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
After A finishes singing

450
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,160
B must continue right away

451
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,480
and not get caught by the others

452
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,400
to complete the task successfully

453
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,360
Each song the Deadly Duo completes

454
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,040
earns them two points

455
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,680
Other members, while blindfolded

456
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,120
if they catch either of the Deadly Duo

457
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,440
and hold them for five seconds

458
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,240
the task is considered successful

459
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,280
and they earn one point

460
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,160
After three rounds

461
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,640
the two with the highest scores win

462
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,160
Search with eyes open

463
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,960
Catch with eyes closed

464
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,880
Right

465
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,760
If you can't sing the lyrics

466
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,360
We can make up a tune ourselves, right?

467
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,440
Yes, that's fine too

468
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,760
That's okay

469
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,160
Just do the duet, that's enough

470
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,680
Alright

471
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,640
But where are the cards hidden?

472
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
We'll hide them in advance

473
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Okay

474
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Just within this small area, right?

475
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,480
Right

476
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,880
Let's start right away

477
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Alright, let's go

478
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,360
Everyone gets it

479
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,880
Where's my teammate?

480
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,600
Yuwen and Brother Honglei

481
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,480
Wen

482
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,160
The duet is what matters most

483
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,680
Our team is solid

484
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
We have to win

485
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Give us a line of lyrics

486
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,880
Let's match up

487
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,600
Don't mess it up again

488
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:37,960
Right

489
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,640
Bro, say we both find this

490
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,240
Right?

491
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,040
Say you get A

492
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,600
I need your love every day

493
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
You guess what's on my mind

494
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,200
I need your love every day

495
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,880
Just be quick, that's good

496
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,640
I love you

497
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Sing and then run

498
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,280
Bro, that's basically the rhythm

499
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,240
I love you

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
I love you

501
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,040
Right, that's it

502
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,280
I know how to make it hardest for them

503
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,680
So he just does it like this.

504
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,880
Looking with eyes open.

505
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,040
Grabbing with eyes closed.

506
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,640
Then it's easy for us to step on you.

507
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,480
We might step on you ourselves.

508
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
Because we're blindfolded.

509
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
That's right.

510
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,600
Yeah, I'm afraid you'll step on me.

511
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,280
I think we should stick to the edge.

512
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,760
Hold hands.

513
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
Then move toward the center.

514
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,480
Let's find the rope first.

515
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,520
After we find the rope,

516
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,240
For example, right here.

517
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,280
Okay, pull.

518
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,120
Everyone finds the rope.

519
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,760
Then sweep like this.

520
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
Ours isn't that big.

521
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,400
It is.

522
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,960
Not necessarily.

523
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,640
Let's try it.

524
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,120
Almost.

525
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,720
Some do, some do.

526
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,200
Pretty much.

527
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,200
Found the rope, right?

528
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,480
Almost there.

529
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,960
Look, here.

530
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,360
Yeah.

531
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah, it's actually that big.

532
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Move forward.

533
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Go.

534
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,680
Yes, that's right.

535
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,720
Let's make some noise on purpose.

536
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,840
But leave that spot.

537
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,520
Trick them into going there.

538
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,720
They can't actually see.

539
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,480
It's tough for them.

540
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,400
Yeah.

541
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,200
Come on.

542
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,240
Come on.

543
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,000
Everyone, put on your blindfolds now.

544
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,120
Spin twice in place.

545
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
Then start the task.

546
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,240
Ready.

547
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,240
Go.

548
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,600
Start spinning.

549
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,680
One.

550
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,360
One turn.

551
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,160
Soon, only Na Wen and I will let go.

552
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,760
Everyone else, don't let go.

553
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,400
Let's find the rope.

554
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,680
Okay.

555
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,200
Come on.

556
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,440
Let's hold hands.

557
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,400
Three, two, one, go.

558
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,400
Where's the rope?

559
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,280
The rope's here.

560
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,920
I've got the rope, come here.

561
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
Okay, come.

562
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,000
Hello.

563
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,520
Someone's here.

564
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,680
Grab her.

565
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Forward.

566
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,040
It's Didi.

567
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,240
It's me.

568
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,000
Didn't catch.

569
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,960
Who is this?

570
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,760
Who is this?

571
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,840
It's you.

572
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,640
Come.

573
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,880
Where are you guys?

574
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
Quick.

575
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
Come, back to the rope.

576
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,960
Okay.

577
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Quick, give me a hand.

578
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,720
Go.

579
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,280
Search.

580
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,040
Go.

581
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,440
While we're still young and blooming.

582
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,400
Who is this?

583
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,200
Who?

584
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
Who are you?

585
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,600
Who is this?

586
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,840
Who is this?

587
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
Who?

588
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,440
Who is this?

589
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,880
Me.

590
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I caught someone.

591
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,400
Me.

592
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,640
Caught the wrong person.

593
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,720
Got them.

594
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,760
It's me.

595
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,120
Did you catch them?

596
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Can we open our eyes now?

597
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,480
Take off the blindfolds.

598
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,120
Did you catch them?

599
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,160
Both are caught.

600
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,960
It's too hard.

601
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,280
You guys were too hasty.

602
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Total wipeout.

603
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,680
Didn't finish a single song.

604
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440
Deadly Duo gets no points.

605
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,960
Everyone else gets two points each.

606
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,360
Come, draw your roles.

607
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,680
I want to find...

608
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,320
You want to find the Duo.

609
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,080
I want to find the Duo.

610
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,360
Okay.

611
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,480
Okay.

612
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,200
Those two are about to win.

613
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,800
Darn it.

614
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,440
Yuning and Jin Jing, right?

615
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,280
Not necessarily.

616
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm too big, bro.

617
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,360
Yuning is big.

618
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,960
Big build.

619
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,560
Come, spin in the middle.

620
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,640
This is

621
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,520
Who is this

622
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,160
Me

623
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Naiwen

624
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,200
You touched me

625
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,640
Bro

626
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,760
Isn't this Xiaodi

627
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,280
Yes, it's me, Xiaodi

628
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,840
This is Wen

629
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,440
Let's go, come on

630
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,320
Clockwise?

631
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,120
Clockwise

632
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,360
Ready, one two three, go

633
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,320
One

634
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,040
Half a turn

635
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,560
Three

636
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,880
Alright

637
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,800
Alright

638
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,760
One full turn

639
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,280
Three two one, start

640
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,240
Let's move back

641
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,120
Back up

642
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Wait, where's the rope

643
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,400
Director team, where are you

644
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,840
Find the sofa

645
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,080
Who hit me

646
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
Someone hit me from behind

647
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,920
Come

648
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,840
Forward

649
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,360
I'm by the rope

650
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,160
I'm here

651
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm at the sofa

652
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,800
Who

653
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Who pushed me

654
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,000
Sorry, I thought it was

655
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,360
Who

656
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,920
Me

657
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,320
Dimples and long lashes

658
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,680
I can't sleep every night

659
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,320
Can't sleep

660
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,440
Who can't sleep

661
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,000
Who are you

662
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,000
Who is this

663
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,800
Who is it

664
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,040
Yuning

665
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,080
Bracelet

666
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Bracelet, bracelet

667
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,480
Got it

668
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,040
Bracelet

669
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,440
Okay

670
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,000
Bracelet

671
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,320
Caught

672
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,800
Done

673
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,360
Not running

674
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,720
Bracelet

675
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,360
Not running, not running

676
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,120
Me

677
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,800
Caught

678
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,040
Finished one song

679
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,840
Deadly Duo gets two points each

680
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,600
Everyone else gets one point each

681
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Alright

682
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay, fine

683
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,280
Me and Xingxu, the two of us

684
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,480
Okay, let's go

685
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,200
I think this round

686
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,040
We'll be safer if we keep quiet

687
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,080
Otherwise, if we get loud

688
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,200
It'll get messy

689
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,160
Let's all stay silent

690
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,520
Okay

691
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,040
Okay

692
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,760
Ready, three two one, turn

693
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Alright, start

694
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,960
Whether it's now

695
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,560
Or in the distant future

696
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
Who's talking in front of me

697
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,320
Okay, like this

698
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,280
Is it Honglei

699
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:56,800
It's me

700
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,680
What are you doing

701
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,240
Who

702
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,480
Me

703
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,840
Sorry

704
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,560
Me

705
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,520
Sorry

706
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,720
There's a sound here

707
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,280
There's a sound here

708
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
Singing your song on the rooftop

709
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,080
The rooftop and the one I love

710
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,760
Naiwen

711
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,480
Congrats to Deadly Duo, awesome

712
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,760
And we sang while it was quiet

713
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I didn't hear any singing

714
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,560
Chen He

715
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,600
You kept sitting there

716
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,520
Kept distracting us

717
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,320
We'll always catch him

718
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,560
Who

719
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,240
Me

720
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,960
Who

721
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,320
Me

722
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,040
I didn't move

723
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,320
You kept touching me

724
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,800
I'm right in front of you

725
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,280
It's you

726
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Two songs finished in the last round

727
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,320
The final winners

728
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,960
Are Naiwen and Xingxu

729
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,560
This win

730
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Was actually not easy

731
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,480
Right

732
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,760
Very hard
