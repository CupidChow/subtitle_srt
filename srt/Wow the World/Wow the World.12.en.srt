1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,280
Next, let's see what surprises everyone has prepared for our foreign friends.

2
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,280
What wonderful surprises have been prepared?

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,240
Mine is really impressive.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,720
Don't underestimate this box.

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,080
Inside,

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,240
there's a lot

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,600
Is yours the hidden edition?

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,360
No.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,720
Yes.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,440
Really?

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,120
Yes.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,400
No, it's this one.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,200
This one is so cute.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,240
Can you open one for me later?

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
Can you help me open one?

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,840
Do you want to see if there's a hidden one?

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,000
Can I help you open one?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,560
No.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,600
I want to give this to my friend from Italy.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,960
Let my sister help me open one.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,040
Then I'll carry it with me.

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,280
I'll open one for you.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,920
No.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,280
It's really satisfying to watch others open it.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,000
Really.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
Then just watch me open it.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Let my sister open it.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,480
I know, isn't there still one left?

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,760
There's still one for my friend from Italy.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,080
Today.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,800
Let him open it.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,880
I won't let him open it.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,120
If he gets the rare one,

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,240
I'll lose it.

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll let him take it home to open.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,600
Don't let me see it.

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,160
Here he comes.

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,560
Come on.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Come on, Captain.

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,280
Bro, what did you bring?

41
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,800
I'll show you in a bit.

42
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,440
It's really cool.

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,840
Did you bring these little seasonings?

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Sachet.

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
This is so cute.

46
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,560
Come on, bro.

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
Your box is pretty big.

48
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
It took a lot of effort.

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
You brought so much stuff.

50
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
I worry about everything.

51
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,120
It's all in here.

52
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,200
With your EQ and IQ, of course I have to worry.

53
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,040
As the BA here,

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,000
Come on.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Come on, show it.

56
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,040
Who wants to go first?

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
This is...

58
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,360
What is this?

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,840
A sock washing machine.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is pretty impressive.

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,760
This is amazing.

62
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
This sock washing machine

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
can not only wash but also spin-dry.

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,600
Then you brought it for nothing.

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,960
Didn't the landlord say it's not allowed?

66
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,400
Hand wash.

67
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,720
Right.

68
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,000
You're being so insincere.

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,520
Take it away.

70
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
Give it away, right? Give it away.

71
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
Take it away.

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
Does this need to be plugged in?

73
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,800
No, it doesn't.

74
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
You put it in and scrub by hand yourself.

75
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,040
Ziwen.

76
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,920
Yuwen.

77
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
Who's Ziwen?

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,480
No, it's because

79
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,400
I need to call Sister Ziwen.

80
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
I want to

81
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
I want to resign.

82
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
Our company isn't warm enough.

83
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,760
There's a problem with our company culture.

84
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,560
It's not just cutthroat competition, it's also exclusionary.

85
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Didn't I just

86
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,880
get a little closer to them?

87
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
No, what he means is

88
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
You're so popular now.

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,240
That's why you're called Ziwen.

90
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Thank you.

91
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,640
Both emotional and intellectual intelligence.

92
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
I accept.

93
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
Boss, I need to get to work.

94
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,600
Okay.

95
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Bro, what else do you have?

96
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,520
What I brought is intangible cultural heritage.

97
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Let me start with the south.

98
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,400
Alright.

99
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,320
We just performed a play.

100
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,520
It's called "Night Walker."

101
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,440
One element in it is the lion dance.

102
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,120
The southern-style lion.

103
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
So cute.

104
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,560
This is a figurine, right?

105
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,080
Yes.

106
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,160
This one is so cute.

107
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,040
This is adorable.

108
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
This is intangible cultural heritage.

109
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,680
That's it for the south.

110
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Now I'll show you something from the north.

111
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,280
From the north, it's Peking Opera.

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,320
Peking Opera masks.

113
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,920
This is from our play's director, Zhao Miao.

114
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
His father, all over the world,

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
collected all kinds of stones.

116
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,120
and then painted them himself.

117
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,640
Painted opera masks

118
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
This one looks really nice

119
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,760
You definitely can't buy this anywhere

120
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
This is so cute

121
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
Looks great

122
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
He said what he brought is

123
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,280
traditional intangible cultural heritage

124
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,880
What I brought is also somewhat related

125
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,200
Because it's traditional

126
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,240
I think it's a scented sachet

127
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Scented sachet

128
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,120
The scent of some unique Chinese plants

129
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,360
I think it's pretty interesting too

130
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
And it's quite cute

131
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,720
You really can't buy this abroad

132
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
I brought all scented sachets

133
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,240
So what I brought represents Chinese culture

134
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Jun Jun brought the taste of China

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
That's right

136
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,320
And usually, for ourselves

137
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,720
We've gotten a bit tired of eating Italian food

138
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
I brought some snacks

139
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,080
Sichuan dried tofu with chili

140
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
And some side dishes for rice

141
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,840
That's awesome

142
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Really great

143
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
We can definitely use this for our late-night snacks

144
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
Are you staying on the second floor or the first floor?

145
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm on the third floor

146
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,920
The third floor

147
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,880
On the balcony

148
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,400
Got it

149
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
When changing the bedding

150
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
I just rolled it up and took it away

151
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
Come on, Didi

152
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
I think what I brought is especially cute

153
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,920
I just thought of a corny joke

154
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Go ahead

155
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,760
The old man cried

156
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
The old man was overjoyed

157
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,480
You sure are having a great time.

158
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
It is a bit cold.

159
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,320
I didn't even understand it.

160
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,960
It's just "old man's joy."

161
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
Then the old man cried.

162
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,040
It's because the old man's joy was ruined.

163
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,120
No one scratched his back anymore.

164
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,560
What's inside here?

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
This is a comb.

166
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,120
But it's very cute.

167
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,440
And there's our national treasure.

168
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,000
And there's also this.

169
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,520
This one is great.

170
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,640
It's for massaging the head.

171
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,120
This is really needed.

172
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
It's for relaxation.

173
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,480
Such a little kid.

174
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,640
Did you notice everything they brought is for health and wellness?

175
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,080
Young people need to care about wellness to stay youthful.

176
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
What else is there?

177
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
It hasn't been opened yet.

178
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
But it's something you open.

179
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
It's a mirror and a comb.

180
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,160
A wooden comb, right?

181
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,880
Did your parents prepare this for you?

182
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,920
Still for wellness.

183
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay.

184
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,840
That's my gift.

185
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,680
Alright.

186
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
That's great.

187
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Who's next?

188
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll go.

189
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Actually, I'm pretty similar to Gong Jun.

190
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,880
I also prepared some things.

191
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Like sachets and such, and then...

192
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,880
You brought sachets too?

193
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,520
Yes.

194
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
When I meet local kids,

195
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,120
or friends, I can share with them.

196
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,440
And our little panda.

197
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,840
Pandas are extremely popular abroad.

198
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,560
And there's another thing,

199
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
I personally really like gourds.

200
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
Gourds.

201
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
They're really cute.

202
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah, anyway, it's just

203
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,320
a small souvenir or something.

204
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,800
If we meet foreign friends,

205
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,440
we can give them one as a gift.

206
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
How do we explain it to them in English?

207
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
The word for gourd sounds like "fortune" and "prosperity" in Chinese.

208
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,400
Fortune and prosperity.

209
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Luck and

210
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Luck and wealth.

211
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Right.

212
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,720
Because there's something I really like,

213
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,440
which is ear cleaning.

214
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,120
So I myself

215
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,640
always carry some ear cleaning tools.

216
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
Ning, join our property management team.

217
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
Or the massage team, and at night we can come to your room for ear cleaning.

218
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Are you serious?

219
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,320
You clean your own ears?

220
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah.

221
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,160
This thing, it has little bristles inside.

222
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
You clean your own ears?

223
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,680
That's amazing.

224
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,120
Show us how.

225
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,200
Jun, lie down here.

226
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,320
I'll clean your ears for you.

227
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
I have a new tool, I'll use it on you.

228
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,720
This is...

229
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,240
You have two, one new and one old.

230
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,320
They're both in the same case.

231
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,840
What's the difference then?

232
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,680
It's fine, doesn't matter.

233
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
I don't have any ear infections or anything.

234
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
So itchy.

235
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,840
It'll be done soon.

236
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,320
Jun Jun won't be able to hear for a bit.

237
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,920
Isn't it relaxing?

238
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,600
Feels so good.

239
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Then I'll give this to you.

240
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,840
Okay.

241
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,120
Alright, it's yours.

242
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,680
Feels so good.

243
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you want to try it?

244
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,760
No, wait a moment.

245
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,560
Bro.

246
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Let me clean your ears.

247
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,880
No.

248
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,920
I'll just wipe it.

249
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,760
Let him do it.

250
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,400
He's a professional.

251
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Let me do it for you.

252
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,440
It's very clean.

253
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,200
It is pretty comfortable.

254
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Isn't it?

255
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,720
It is pretty comfortable.

256
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Honglei's eyes lit up.

257
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Just now.

258
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Let me try.

259
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,160
You try it.

260
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,520
Don't move.

261
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
It's pretty comfortable.

262
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,400
It's different, isn't it?

263
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,160
So itchy.

264
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,680
It's just itchy.

265
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,400
Then it relieves the itch.

266
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,960
Itchy, then relieved.

267
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,320
Yeah.

268
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,040
Alternating.

269
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,880
What's wrong with you?

270
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
What's with that face, man?

271
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,600
Come on.

272
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Don't.

273
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,280
No.

274
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,200
You can use this for your nostrils.

275
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,360
No, this one...

276
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,080
This is something from our country.

277
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,040
It's really popular right now.

278
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,800
It's popular internationally too.

279
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,280
Trendy toy.

280
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,680
Trendy brand.

281
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,600
Trendy toy.

282
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,920
What's it called?

283
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,160
This is the Jasmine series.

284
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
Isn't Labubu the most popular one now?

285
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
I want to see if we can run into one today.

286
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Like, if there's an Italian one.

287
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,680
Even if it's a Chinese friend.

288
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
Or even an Italian friend.

289
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,800
Give one to them.

290
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,560
They really like it.

291
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
Everyone likes this.

292
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,960
Sis, help me open one.

293
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,480
Okay.

294
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
Let's see how lucky I am.

295
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,280
What if it's a secret edition?

296
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,800
I want the secret one, I've never gotten it before.

297
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,480
If it's the secret edition, will you give it away?

298
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,799
No way.

299
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,679
I opened it.

300
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,200
Go ahead, open it.

301
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,039
It's fine.

302
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,640
Not a great start.

303
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,360
It's okay.

304
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,000
Seriously, if you get me a hidden edition,

305
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
It really is! Looks like it.

306
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,360
This one is so cute.

307
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
This is cute.

308
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,480
Thank you.

309
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,680
I'll wear this today.

310
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,800
Fasten this.

311
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,760
Yeah, fasten it.

312
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,560
Let me see.

313
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,840
This is Labubu.

314
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
This is Jasmine.

315
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,080
I also have the Nezha version of this.

316
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
Labubu's Nezha version.

317
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
Labubu's Nezha version.

318
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,040
The Nezha movie right now

319
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,920
is so popular, right?

320
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,560
Yeah.

321
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,520
Labubu did a collaboration with it.

322
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,280
I have that one.

323
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
That one comes in a box with six.

324
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Yours is collectible.

325
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,800
Yours—

326
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,520
This is a cultural creation from the Palace Museum.

327
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
A hairpin?

328
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,120
Yes.

329
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,160
This is a gift from the Palace Museum.

330
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,680
And inside, there's a

331
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
really beautiful pink

332
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
hairpin.

333
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
I think Italy isn't very fashionable.

334
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,720
It's very fashionable.

335
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I think we can teach them.

336
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
Use this girl to demonstrate hair styling.

337
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,240
Sure.

338
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,960
There's also one from the Hubei Provincial Museum.

339
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
It's from the Warring States period.

340
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,400
I want to give them some basic knowledge about China.

341
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
About things from the Warring States period.

342
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,800
Yes, it's quite ancient history.

343
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
Then, can they understand

344
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
how many years ago the Warring States period was?

345
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,200
This is a very beautiful

346
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
comb, or is it a mirror?

347
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,640
Yes.

348
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:50,880
A bronze mirror.

349
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
But beautiful, just like this.

350
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,560
I understand.

351
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,880
It also has a phoenix design.

352
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,160
With this kind of enamel decoration.

353
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,480
475 BC.

354
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,240
Three thousand years ago.

355
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,520
Three thousand years ago.

356
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
You're actually right.

357
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,480
It overlaps with Roman history.

358
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm really curious about what "All roads lead to Rome" means.

359
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,800
What does it mean?

360
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
Last night I asked the local guide.

361
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,800
It's from all directions.

362
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,920
Their soldiers can all reach Rome.

363
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,240
They gather in Rome to celebrate.

364
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,720
To celebrate the victory.

365
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,600
There's also this little bamboo weaving.

366
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,560
It's woven from bamboo.

367
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,760
This is an intangible cultural heritage.

368
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,640
Okay.

369
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,000
There are also some hair clips, pendants, and such.

370
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,040
There are some.

371
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,440
When the time comes, I will...

372
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,120
They're woven, right?

373
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,760
Yes, they're little bamboo weavings.

374
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,160
Thank you.

375
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Come on, here's the important part, bro.

376
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
I think for this trip,

377
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,640
safety is especially important.

378
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,160
So I searched online for something.

379
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,440
That's great.

380
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,920
This is practical.

381
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,960
Everything is.

382
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
This bag has some useful stuff.

383
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Door stopper.

384
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
A door stopper is for when you arrive at a hotel.

385
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,520
After you check in,

386
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,880
you install the door stopper, and if someone tries to push the door,

387
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,760
even if they pick the lock,

388
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,680
they still can't open the door.

389
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Girls really need this.

390
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
This door stopper.

391
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,960
Girls.

392
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
Didi.

393
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,120
Okay.

394
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Everyone gets a door stopper.

395
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,840
Okay.

396
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,320
I think Naiwen doesn't need one.

397
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,680
No one would try to break into his room.

398
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,320
He doesn't even need to close his room door.

399
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
This is a whistle.

400
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is the most effective.

401
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
I think when we go out,

402
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
when we go sightseeing,

403
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,880
blow it if there's danger.

404
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
Blow it and you'll come right away, right bro?

405
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,880
Bro, we really need you.

406
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,920
I think this one

407
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,800
also isn't very suitable for Li Naiwen.

408
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,840
Why isn't it suitable for me?

409
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
And this is for disguises when we go out.

410
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Is this a belly pouch?

411
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
Like sometimes we carry some change.

412
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,120
How much change would that be?

413
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,480
Bro, this bag matches you so well, the color.

414
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,280
You can't let people see you're a tourist.

415
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,560
You have to look like a local, just sling it on.

416
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,480
It's for disguises.

417
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,400
And if it's sunny, it can block the sun.

418
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
You need this.

419
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
No matter what I carry, I don't look like a local, that's the problem.

420
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,640
Bro, what about this?

421
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,560
This is a child safety harness.

422
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,000
I think it's suitable for Ziwen and Didi.

423
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
Yuwen.

424
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Can't get through.

425
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm jet-lagged.

426
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm done recording.

427
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm not recording anymore.

428
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,200
How about next episode,

429
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,960
let's invite Wang Ziwen as a guest.

430
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,800
I think this suits you.

431
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,520
You take Wang Yuwen.

432
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,080
Okay.

433
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Then I'll take Didi, each of us with one.

434
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay.

435
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,640
Two girls.

436
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,360
Who ties up whom?

437
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
She ties you up.

438
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
But I want to ask, what is this for, bro?

439
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
Why did you bring a plastic bag?

440
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
If you really want to disguise yourself as a local,

441
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,480
just buy two green onions and stick them inside.

442
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,080
Then put your passport, cash, and stuff inside.

443
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,760
Everyone will think you just came back from grocery shopping.

444
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,920
This one, Gong Jun, suits you.

445
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,040
High-end

446
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,560
Alright

447
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,040
Anyway, everyone picked from this

448
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,720
Okay

449
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,760
If you like something, come get it from me

450
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,640
That's thoughtful

451
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,960
Take a door stopper

452
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,280
I need a door stopper too

453
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,640
We're all living together

454
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Who are you blocking?

455
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,680
Thank you

456
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
From inside out

457
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,280
From top to bottom

458
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,240
Truly from inside out

459
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,920
Come on, everyone

460
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,520
Everyone's travel essentials

461
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,600
have pretty much all been shared

462
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,240
We're about to start our trip soon

463
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,680
Okay

464
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
Before we start our trip

465
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
Let's invite our Tsinghua University

466
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,880
Associate Professor and PhD advisor from the Department of Sociology

467
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
Professor Yan Fei

468
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
to give everyone a brief introduction

469
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,960
about our matters in Rome

470
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,280
Alright

471
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,120
Hello, Professor

472
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,560
Hello, welcome

473
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Hello, teacher.

474
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,040
All roads lead to Rome.

475
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
The reason for this saying

476
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
is that Rome is the origin of all of Europe

477
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,080
or even a birthplace of world civilization.

478
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,880
A point of origin.

479
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,480
In 753 BC,

480
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,520
Rome was established as a city.

481
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
After its founding,

482
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,040
it went through a series of developments.

483
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,880
From the Roman Kingdom period

484
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,560
to the Roman Republic and then the Roman Empire,

485
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
the Roman Empire, in the entire

486
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,800
map of the world,

487
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,360
held such a

488
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,600
political, economic,

489
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,320
and socio-cultural central position.

490
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,440
Then, in the 14th century,

491
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Europe, with Italy as its representative,

492
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,080
saw a wave of the Renaissance.

493
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,560
So, Europe led by Italy

494
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,800
in all aspects,

495
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,880
including science and technology, humanities, history, and geography,

496
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
was constantly awakening.

497
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,320
This brought many

498
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
groundbreaking things to world civilization.

499
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,080
So this actually represents

500
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,440
the connection between Rome and the world.

501
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,600
Teacher, I have a question.

502
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,560
Is it true

503
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,800
that the centers of world civilizations

504
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,280
are all somewhat related to the 40th parallel north?

505
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,960
Most of them are.

506
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Is there a pattern here?

507
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,440
I think the main point

508
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,480
is that the area around the 40th parallel north

509
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,960
has certain geographical features.

510
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,720
For example, we can see

511
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,800
the terrain of Italy.

512
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,160
Right below it is the Mediterranean Sea.

513
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,800
And overall,

514
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
in terms of the development of civilization,

515
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,520
it can rely on rivers

516
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,200
to bring abundant natural resources.

517
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,880
And the climate, too.

518
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,360
Climate is actually very important.

519
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,480
Being livable might be

520
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,720
Okay.

521
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,840
Let's thank our guest from Tsinghua University,

522
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,560
Professor Yan Fei.

523
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
Thank you, Professor.

524
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,320
Thank you.

525
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,360
Let's go.

526
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,120
Let's go.

527
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,040
Change clothes.

528
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
Going to change clothes.

529
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,800
Welcome everyone to the strawberry town by Lake Nemi.

530
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,640
This place is famous for its strawberries and various mushrooms.

531
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,520
So we've prepared a feast for everyone here.

532
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,320
To help everyone better

533
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,040
and more appreciatively enjoy the food in front of you,

534
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,440
we've prepared a game for you.

535
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,760
It's called "Are You Full?"

536
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
Check your phone.

537
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,800
Has it been sent?

538
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,160
Come on.

539
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,840
Hurry up, get on.

540
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
You can get on now.

541
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,520
Eat up.

542
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,760
Hurry up.

543
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,560
I'll do it, I'll do it.

544
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,080
Hey.

545
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,880
Be careful.

546
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,800
Didi is full.

547
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
It's He Ge.

548
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
Honglei is full.

549
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
Don't point at me.

550
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,680
Move that a bit farther away first.

551
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,000
Then it must be He.

552
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
It really wasn't me.

553
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,680
Really?

554
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
It really wasn't me.

555
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,160
What are you looking at?

556
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,360
Why are you staring at me?

557
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,200
You're cutting things and staring at me.

558
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,960
Don't look at me with that wise expression.

559
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,160
Look over there.

560
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,080
It's fine, pointing at me is fine.

561
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,360
Why are you pointing that fork everywhere?

562
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,400
Go away, point at yourself.

563
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,040
So if I do as you say, then I...

564
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,960
That's it, it's over.

565
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,040
Yuning is full.

566
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,080
Okay.

567
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,560
This round is a bit tough.

568
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,280
I think we've run into an expert this round.

569
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,400
Didi is full.

570
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,880
Honglei is full.

571
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,079
Yuning is full.

572
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
Let's give our closing statements.

573
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,280
Let's do the closing statements.

574
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,560
There's one more.

575
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,359
One more person.

576
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,200
Don't make any faces at me.

577
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,960
I think Junjun is definitely the one.

578
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,680
When has Junjun ever stuttered?

579
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
Never.

580
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,320
He even stuttered just now.

581
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,160
When Junjun has something on his mind,

582
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
When playing a spy in the future, don't swallow so easily.

583
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,480
Because your Adam's apple will give you away.

584
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
Who are you talking about?

585
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm talking about He.

586
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I think it's him.

587
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,040
Uncle Nai, you're full.

588
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,280
Look.

589
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,440
My hands have been right here.

590
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,400
My hands have been right here, okay?

591
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,600
He.

592
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,200
I vote for you too.

593
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
He needs to reconsider.

594
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,360
It's you.

595
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,760
Why?

596
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,680
Why?

597
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,360
Eating vegetables.

598
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,640
Do you usually eat vegetables?

599
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,560
Every time you pick up a fork, someone "dies."

600
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,800
Every time you pick up a fork, someone "dies."

601
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,360
At the beginning, who did you see standing there?

602
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
When He picked up the fork, who was standing there?

603
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,360
It was Didi.

604
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,160
When Didi fell that time

605
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,960
and right after, Didi was gone.

606
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
It’s you.

607
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,040
No doubt about it.

608
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I vote for you.

609
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
It’s you.

610
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
He, who do you think it is?

611
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Okay.

612
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,440
He wouldn’t step on Yuwen like that.

613
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,760
Wenzi doesn’t seem like that at all.

614
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,840
Yeah, bro.

615
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,160
Isn’t it obvious?

616
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,600
Now I’m starting to change my mind.

617
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,360
You...

618
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,040
So Junjun isn’t as complicated as we thought.

619
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, I think he’s really simple.

620
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,680
He’s actually very straightforward.

621
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,200
Yes.

622
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,360
Then who’s the complicated one?

623
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,200
He.

624
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,960
Then it’s him.

625
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,760
He’s super—

626
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,760
I think it’s Chen He.

627
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,360
I accuse him.

628
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,560
Sorry, Junjun.

629
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,360
Brother.

630
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,920
Very talented.

631
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,560
You guys practice your lines and get ready to go.

632
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
Wait a minute.

633
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,080
Including you.

634
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,680
You gave yourself away.

635
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,320
You just exposed yourself.

636
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,920
You really did.

637
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,560
He excluded all of us.

638
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,720
You guys get ready to speak.

639
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,800
That’s a pretty clever move.

640
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,080
I caught this loophole right away.

641
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,480
Do you have any final words, bro?

642
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,280
Now I have a certain impression of your intelligence.

643
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
I've made some judgments.

644
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
Is that about your own intelligence or

645
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
about ours?

646
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,360
In a moment, you will

647
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
understand yourself a bit better.

648
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,040
Vote.

649
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,240
Vote.

650
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,600
Three, two, one, vote.

651
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,400
Yuning, stand up.

652
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Junjun, stand up.

653
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,760
He, stand up.

654
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
Wen, stand up.

655
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Honglei, stand up.

656
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Didi, stand up.

657
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Wen, seriously...

658
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
It's her.

659
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,600
Yuwen.

660
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,560
What are you doing?

661
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,280
Pointing at people with your hair like that.

662
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Why don't you believe me?

663
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,280
Why are you just standing there?

664
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,120
At the beginning,

665
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,920
Hungry.

666
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,520
You're amazing.

667
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,240
You said he's incredible at eating vegetables.

668
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
She won this really impressively.

669
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,760
I think you played really well.

670
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,680
Played really well.

671
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
You're awesome.

672
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh my god.

673
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,480
Female "killer."

674
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
Female "killer."

675
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,120
Female "killer."

676
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Is it possible that it's not others being amazing,

677
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,840
but that you're just being silly?

678
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,480
Final round.

679
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
There's a problem with the way you speak, too.

680
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,760
You excluded yourself.

681
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,240
Why?

682
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Come on.

683
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,360
Let's do it together, everyone.

684
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,720
Come on.

685
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,560
Shout quickly!

686
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Look at your intelligence, hurry up!

687
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,320
Come on.

688
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,760
Come on.

689
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,120
Attention, everyone.

690
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,200
Hello, everyone.

691
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
You might not know us.

692
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
We are from "Earth Super Fresh".

693
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,200
Sun Honglei.

694
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,120
Gong Jun.

695
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,280
Li Naiwen.

696
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,800
Ouyang Didi.

697
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,760
Who?

698
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,920
Say Chen He.

699
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,000
Say you're Chen He.

700
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,120
I'm Chen He.

701
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm Liu Yuning.

702
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,160
We are the cutest on Earth.

703
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
"Big Dummies".

704
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
Thank you.

705
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,680
You really are...

706
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,480
Just as the Italians often say,

707
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
Piano (take it slow).

708
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,040
The Romans' sense of relaxation

709
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,200
is a philosophy of life ingrained in their bones.

710
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,720
Their leisure life

711
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,240
reflects this sense of relaxation.

712
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Everyone in the Earth Team

713
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
also experienced

714
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,240
this relaxed attitude by the lake.

715
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
Beach dodgeball game rules.

716
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,480
Got it.

717
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,160
Understood.

718
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
Okay.

719
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,960
Alright. Is there a limbo kind of thing?

720
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,520
Think of a difficult one.

721
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,680
Then it must be the splits.

722
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,480
Give it a try.

723
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,680
Like this.

724
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,560
This is the only way.

725
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,400
Like this.

726
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,840
Alright, nice.

727
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,040
I want to know where the defense is.

728
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,800
It's just sticking your face out to get hit.

729
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,680
We definitely can't do that.

730
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
That's a physical issue.

731
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,640
Can we do what we just did?

732
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
We can.

733
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,200
We can't.

734
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,760
You try.

735
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,040
If you go down, you can't get back up.

736
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,280
Didn't we learn that martial art yesterday?

737
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,760
This is a defensive stance.

738
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,040
I'll just do this one.

739
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,760
Let's do this one.

740
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
This one's good.

741
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,680
Then you toss it.

742
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,160
Word.

743
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,560
Won.

744
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
Alright, come on, serve, bro.

745
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,680
Wait a second.

746
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,760
Wait a second.

747
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,960
Give me my money back.

748
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,640
Okay, bro.

749
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Let's do the cool style.

750
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,600
And then catch it.

751
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Cool.

752
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
Why is someone intercepting?

753
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,400
Handsome.

754
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,400
Cooperate.

755
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,880
Let me tell you.

756
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,680
When he throws it over, you can throw it right back.

757
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Yeah, I know.

758
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,560
I mean, for example, if it looks like I'm throwing,

759
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,080
then I quickly pass it to you and you throw.

760
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,440
Got it?

761
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,720
Come on.

762
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Here it comes.

763
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,840
Wait until they get tired.

764
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,520
It's okay.

765
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,360
Come stand here for a day.

766
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,560
If he just stands there, hitting him is useless.

767
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,160
Let's do the same.

768
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Fight fire with fire.

769
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay, it's fine, it's okay.

770
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,880
We lose a point.

771
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,200
Quick, do it (action).

772
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,600
Do it (action), you do it (action).

773
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,200
You're just taking the hit head-on like this.

774
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,520
Taking the hit head-on?

775
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:36,760
No, how do you play this game?

776
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,240
Come on.

777
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,280
You punish them, come on.

778
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,520
Punish them.

779
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,680
Come back.

780
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,560
Right.

781
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,240
Don't cross the line.

782
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
Don't cross the line.

783
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,200
Score.

784
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,000
Bro, awesome.

785
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,680
It's fine.

786
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,240
Agile.

787
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,320
Of course I'm agile.

788
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,560
Didi

789
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,840
Are you passing the ball to us?

790
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,160
Okay, it's fine.

791
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,080
Alright.

792
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,040
Alright, bro.

793
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,400
Come on.

794
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,720
Revenge.

795
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
Pass it back.

796
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,240
Nice!

797
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,080
That was fierce, bro.

798
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
Let's add some pressure.

799
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,520
So much pressure.

800
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,240
It's suffocating.

801
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,080
Did I put pressure on you?

802
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,560
Throw it.

803
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,640
Too far.

804
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
Throw it here.

805
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,680
Okay.

806
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,040
No, I've always done it this way.

807
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
Does that count just now?

808
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,200
We scored.

809
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,480
Because you didn't catch it, bro.

810
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,640
Check the replay.

811
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,720
It moved.

812
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,800
Alright.

813
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,680
You did the same just now.

814
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,440
Here it comes.

815
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,960
It turned into a green shell just now.

816
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,760
Of course I'm flexible.

817
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,400
Nice, cool!

818
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,080
Awesome!

819
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,880
Do you have bow legs?

820
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,320
Why do you turn like that?

821
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Your hand is like this.

822
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,000
Come on!

823
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,400
It's match point.

824
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,640
Double match point.

825
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,280
Hurry!

826
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,880
Quick!

827
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,000
It hit.
