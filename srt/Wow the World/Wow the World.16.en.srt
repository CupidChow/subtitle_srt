1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,170
Take another look.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:03,620
Do you want to?

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,820
Put your gloves on.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,445
Can you put the socks down?

5
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:18,220
This is yours.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,420
This is yours.

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,750
Are you still disgusted by your own socks?

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,325
123 go, 124567812.

9
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,650
The contrast is really obvious.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,250
To be honest,

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,550
Follow my lead.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,700
First, it's one, two, three, four.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,385
Right?

14
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:48,510
Here, it's two counts, five, six, seven, eight, after two sets of eight beats, start shaking, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,910
Keep it simple, don't be so stiff.

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,810
Don't be so stiff.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,035
Oh no.

18
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:52,460
That's enough.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,660
That's too demanding.

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,460
Smile.

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,610
123 go.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,260
Hands.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,160
Is that okay?

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,760
That's too synchronized.

25
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:17,870
Bro.

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,020
You also need to wink.

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,770
This is an idol's basic skill.

28
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,020
What does "wink" mean?

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,845
Just blink one eye.

30
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:24,220
Like this.

31
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,920
Don't blink both eyes.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,220
So silly.

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,770
Here we go.

34
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:38,970
Come on.

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,720
Look quickly.

36
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,090
Hey.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,290
Alright, alright.

38
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,390
This...

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,590
So simple, so simple.

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,820
Everyone takes a weapon.

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
So who fights whom?

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,520
You choose yourselves.

43
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,445
Let's do it.

44
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:07,895
The two of us will demonstrate first.

45
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,020
Is that okay?

46
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,820
Just clamp this straw.

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,470
Knock off the other person's straw.

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,770
Start the attack.

49
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,570
Is this game even playable?

50
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,320
It's pretty annoying.

51
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,720
You two, stand up.

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,970
Why is it the two of us here?

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,820
A civil war among Central Academy of Drama students.

54
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,570
I'll pick first, you choose one.

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,225
Are you here to see me?

56
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:43,500
Bro.

57
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,275
Excuse me.

58
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:48,850
Sorry.

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,300
Little brother.

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,650
Isn't this kind of, kind of, kind of bullying?

61
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,920
It's fine.

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,820
You made me wash your socks on my first day anyway.

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Little brother.

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,820
Pick a guy first.

65
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,070
Come on, come on.

66
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,570
Drink.

67
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,870
I don't want to compete with this contestant.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:17,925
Hey.

69
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,500
Why does everyone dislike you, bro?

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,850
You can't refuse.

71
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,600
You pick.

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,325
You can't refuse.

73
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:23,050
You can't refuse.

74
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,250
Hurry up.

75
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,900
You can't escape this.

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,950
You definitely have to do the PK.

77
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,750
Turn your head and show yourself.

78
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,050
Turn your head to look at the camera.

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,450
I won.

80
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,060
You two, come here.

81
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,660
Don't.

82
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,920
Stop fighting, you guys.

83
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,370
Let's play another round at the company.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,175
Oh no.

85
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,100
What kind of pose is that?

86
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:24,925
Grandma said,

87
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,550
you need to pout your upper lip a bit.

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,900
Mouth goes dudu dudu dudu dudu.

89
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,550
He's about to laugh.

90
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,500
Once you laugh, it's easy.

91
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,350
You can't hold it in anymore.

92
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,140
So sour!

93
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,840
I can't hit it.

94
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,290
It's been so long.

95
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,990
Are your straws too short?

96
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Come and try it.

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,520
Oh dear.

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,570
This is the birthplace of Western civilization.

99
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,070
Ancient Rome.

100
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,595
Actually, I think it's a good idea.

101
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,670
When the kids are on vacation,

102
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,170
or when we have a holiday,

103
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,970
we could do a church tour.

104
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,670
Experience why it's so quiet here.

105
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,780
I think it's a cultural thing.

106
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,030
This is pure European architecture.

107
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,830
Right?

108
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,130
All of this has been renovated.

109
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,980
This is an Apple Store.

110
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,155
You see, back home we often have European-style buildings.

111
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:54,430
European architecture is basically like this.

112
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,930
They're waiting for the night bus.

113
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,180
Them.

114
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,470
What day is it today?

115
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,720
Not sure, but it should be a weekday.

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,295
It's not the weekend.

117
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,770
On weekends, everyone is out.

118
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,170
At this time,

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,470
there are so many people.

120
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,770
Naiwen, are you eating?

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,570
It's too fattening.

122
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,480
Someone who claims to be on a diet

123
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,630
ate cake again today

124
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,430
and then went to buy ice cream on purpose.

125
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,930
No self-control at all.

126
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,200
Is it tasty?

127
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,500
Is it good?

128
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,950
Does it taste good?

129
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
It's really delicious.

130
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,075
What's wrong with you?

131
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:56,675
If you want to eat, just eat.

132
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:57,600
Why bother?

133
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,450
Buy four.

134
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
Which one tastes better?

135
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,060
So sweet.

136
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,410
Hey.

137
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,210
I don't want to eat.

138
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:08,710
Gaining weight.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,985
Oh no.

140
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:11,560
Well, since I'm already here.

141
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,310
No self-control at all.

142
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,240
Mm.

143
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,390
Three, two, one, throw!

144
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,390
Who told you to say "three, two, one"?

145
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,690
Let's make a wish first.

146
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,603
Three, two, one, make a wish.

147
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:50,340
After everyone finishes making a wish, then we all say "three, two, one".

148
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Let's throw together.

149
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,040
OK.

150
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,690
And then?

151
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,790
Come on.

152
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,690
Let me say it.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,750
Three, two, one, okay?

154
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,450
OK.

155
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,325
Three, two, one.

156
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:03,800
Wait a second.

157
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,225
Hold on.

158
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,200
Wait, wait, wait.

159
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,000
I already threw mine.

160
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,850
Sorry, sorry.

161
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,575
Wait for me.

162
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:09,425
I'm not done yet.

163
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,650
Give me one more, I'll give it to you.

164
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,450
We got it, we got it, we got it.

165
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,970
Let me know when you're ready.

166
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,895
Are you ready?

167
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:24,470
Ready.

168
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,870
Count down: three, two—

169
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,820
One—it's done!
