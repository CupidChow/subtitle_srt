1
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,440
Next, we'll do an activity.

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,160
We've prepared some classic movie scenes.

3
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,040
Everyone will take the lines from them

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,160
and turn them into Shaanxi dialect.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Okay.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,280
Let's watch the clip first.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,520
This is Titanic.

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,720
The one with the raised glass.

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,840
Rose

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,160
So cool.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
That legendary glance back then.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,320
Mouth opens, dodges.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,640
Liu Yuning, you play Rose.

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
You, just like that.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,000
There aren't any lines.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How do you act this out?

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,640
There's no Xi'an dialect here.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,400
Where's the Xi'an dialect?

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,240
Do we even need lines for this?

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,640
We gave you one line.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,160
Rose, give me your hand.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,560
Rose, give me your hand.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,520
No, that's not right.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,240
Rose

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,360
Give me your mouth.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,440
Give me your mouth.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,960
This one needs Naiwen to act.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Naiwen has to do this.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
This has to be Naiwen's.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
Quick, add that special effect for me.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
The effect where the mouth disappears.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,240
I don't want this mouth.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,360
I don't want it.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,600
So who plays Jack?

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,720
How do we act that?

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,120
Wait, Ning will do one.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,960
Ning, do that one.

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
Give us your magnetic voice.

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Go ahead.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,880
I want to hear it.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,560
I want to hear the Suzhou version.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,520
Rose

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,160
Give me your hand.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,520
Bro, just give it to her.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,000
Or not.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,600
It's like I want to give it

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,960
but also feel gross about it.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,920
This is just too...

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
I feel uncomfortable after hearing that.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,040
Lin Yi

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,120
Lin Yi, you do one.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Make it deeper.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
Do a Northeast China version.

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,760
Just to compare with the bossy type.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Sure.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Rose

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,680
Give me your hand.

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,320
That was too timid.

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Rose

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,640
Roast, give me your hand.

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Give me your hand.

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Roast

63
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
Roast

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,560
Just kidding.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,800
It's just Rose.

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,680
Fuzhou dialect

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,240
Fuzhou dialect

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,360
Rose

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,280
Give me your hand.

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Are you sure that's Chinese?

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,240
Which word means "hand"?

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
It means "hand."

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Tianjin dialect

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,200
Do a Tianjin version.

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,560
Rose

76
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Give me your hand.

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,960
Right?

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
What are you doing?

79
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,480
Give me your hand.

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,880
It should be "sister."

81
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,040
Sister, right.

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Sister

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,640
Sister, where's your hand?

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Give me your hand.

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,440
Darn it, Xingxu can't show off now.

86
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
I'm the same as him.

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,960
They're both from Shenyang.

88
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,480
They're the same.

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,840
Rose, give me your hand.

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,480
What about Wuhan?

91
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,800
Suan Niao, Suan Niao

92
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,120
Suan Niao, just don't give it.

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
Suan Niao

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,880
Rose, give me your hand.

95
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
They're all a bit different.

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,880
Let's do Harbin Avenue's version.

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,560
That's the same.

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
Harbin Mandarin

99
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,320
This really is Mandarin.

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
We're so standard in Harbin.

101
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,400
Standard Mandarin.

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
We can't join in on this one.

103
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,120
Harbin dialect

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,200
Do a bossy Mandarin version.

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
Just the normal kind, bro.

106
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
Rose

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,040
Please give me your hand.

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,680
Announcer's tone

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,840
Harbin isn't like that.

110
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:54,800
Rose, I want to see Honglei and...

111
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
Ordering food, you're here.

112
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,560
How do you act this out?

113
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,760
Cheating the angle.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,680
You want to...

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,880
Then I...

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,480
You be Rose.

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,640
Okay, I'll be Rose.

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
You be Rose.

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
You two go ahead, or do one.

120
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm getting a little feeling.

121
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,120
Rose

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,200
Give me your hand.

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
A hug will do.

124
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
Come on, give me a hug.

125
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Hug me, quick.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hug.

127
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
Didi.

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,560
I just like it.

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Didi, what's up with you?

130
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,040
What's up with me?

131
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
What's up, really?

132
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm losing it.

133
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,360
How do you say "Whatcha up to?"

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
Say it in Xi'an dialect.

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,880
Whatcha up to?

136
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,200
Whatcha up to?

137
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,200
Who's with me?

138
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
You pick yourself.

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,360
He-ge.

140
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
Come on, He-ge.

141
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,440
Then He-ge it is.

142
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
Let's go.

143
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,800
HER LADYSHIP HAS ARRIVED!

144
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Everybody, clear the way!

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Clear the way!

146
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
You're Jack, bro.

147
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,960
I don't know.

148
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
I don't know which one I am.

149
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,440
You turn around.

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,160
I turn around.

151
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,000
Then you're Jack.

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,760
Mighty fine!

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
Give me your hand.

154
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Silly.

155
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,800
You do one.

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,360
Your turn.

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,120
You just have to play abstract.

158
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
You play abstract with him.

159
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
You startled me.

160
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,560
You gotta see how fine he is.

161
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,240
Give me your hand.

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,880
This round is all about abstract.

163
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,880
Give me your hand.

164
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go, have a drink.

165
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,760
Your cheeks are still a bit warm.

166
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
Love to watch, act more.

167
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,120
Your turn, hurry up.

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,800
Come on.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
You love watching, right?

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,880
Love watching you act.

171
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,560
Do something awesome, go on.

172
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Come on, Junjun.

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,240
You two switch back and forth, later.

174
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Give your hand to each other.

175
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,680
What's that about?

176
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,720
Come.

177
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,680
Junjun.

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,320
Get yourself mentally ready.

179
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
As an actor, you need ethics.

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,360
What did you see when you turned?

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,240
Everything.

182
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,640
You gotta act out that feeling.

183
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,880
Block it out.

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,040
Yeah, block it.

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,880
Block.

186
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
Block me.

187
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,200
Let's go.

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,760
Rose.

189
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,560
Give me your hand.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,560
I'll help you.

191
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
Want to add a scene.

192
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
Why is it so tight?

193
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
I'll help you.

194
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,600
Let's pull together.

195
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:05,879
Quick.

196
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
Can't get it off.

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,080
Give me your hand.

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,239
This is a robbery!

199
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,760
How about you do it, give it to me.

200
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,040
Okay.

201
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,760
That Rose just now was really...

202
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
Give me your hand.

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
Got anxious, you know?

204
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,840
Come on.

205
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,880
You little Rose.

206
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,120
Give me your hand.

207
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,120
Close your eyes.

208
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,360
Close your eyes.

209
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,120
Bro.

210
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Give me my ring back.

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
What are you doing?

212
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,120
Give me my ring back.

213
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,840
Whatcha up to?

214
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
You little Rose.

215
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
Close your eyes, you didn't get it, huh?

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,520
I heard "BA" instead.

217
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,880
Security.

218
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,680
Honglei-ge and Wen, do one.

219
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,760
I'll do one with Wen.

220
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,120
Wen, do one.

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,480
Honglei-ge.

222
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's do a proper one.

223
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,400
There should be a camera here.

224
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Follow from behind.

225
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,240
Then spin around.

226
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,240
Honglei-ge, give me your phone.

227
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,880
I'll film a clip for you.

228
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,360
I'll take it.

229
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,480
Take Didi's.

230
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll film a clip for you.

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
You start subjective.

232
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,760
Of course.

233
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,760
Subjective turns to two people.

234
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,440
Right.

235
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,880
Then you have to pass theirs.

236
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,360
Us.

237
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,240
Right.

238
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,560
You're the last one, right?

239
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,520
A big show.

240
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,600
Block him first.

241
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,520
Director Liu.

242
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,080
Director Liu.

243
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,240
Director Liu.

244
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,080
Continued from Spain.

245
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
Everyone, get into character.

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,880
Get into character.

247
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,760
Cue the music.

248
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,480
Three, two, one, go.

249
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,400
Honglei-ge, you're up.

250
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,960
Go in.

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,480
Rose.

252
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,760
Give me your hand.

253
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,840
Give it to him.

254
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,720
Give it to him.

255
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,600
Give it to him.

256
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Give it to him.

257
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,360
Give it to him.

258
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,120
Give it to him.

259
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,000
Give it to him.

260
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,760
Give it to him.

261
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,600
Give it to him.

262
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,120
Thank you, everyone.

263
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,760
Perfect.

264
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
This year we'll use this scene

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
to submit for awards.

266
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,520
Enter the competition.

267
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
Compete.

268
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,880
The title is "Give Me Your Hand".

269
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,920
"Give Me Your Hand"

270
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,640
"Give Him Your Hand"

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Next, we'll fully showcase

272
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,760
everyone's learning results.

273
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,800
So, the task is

274
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,280
we'll provide some film scenes.

275
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
The first member

276
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,280
will learn the Shaanxi dialect lines.

277
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Others must wear noise-canceling headphones.

278
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,640
The last member

279
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
just needs to repeat

280
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,000
over half the dialect lines.

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
That's a win.

282
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,960
Come on, bro.

283
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
You go first.

284
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
You start the relay.

285
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,120
Come on.

286
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Ning bro.

287
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,280
You're second.

288
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm second.

289
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,280
You're second.

290
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm second, but I'm not reliable.

291
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,160
I'm not reliable either.

292
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,400
The one with good memory is third.

293
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
My memory's not bad.

294
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,120
Then you go up front.

295
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,720
I'll go up front.

296
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,880
Okay, you come here.

297
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,640
I'll sit in the middle, right here.

298
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,000
So, is the last one reliable?

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,760
He's fine.

300
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,960
He can make up for it.

301
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
Who's last?

302
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,640
The last one needs to summarize.

303
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll sit here.

304
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,360
Let Didi be last.

305
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,280
Didi, you're last.

306
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
You'll be fine as the last.

307
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,000
Alright, good.

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
Darn it, we're unstoppable.

309
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,360
Victory is ours.

310
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Everyone, focus.

311
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,960
Right.

312
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,720
To win a girl's heart,

313
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,640
you must rely on your gaze.

314
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,480
Look at me.

315
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,080
Sexy or not?

316
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
Hahaha.

317
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,120
Not sexy, just funny.

318
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,000
How is that possible?

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
Look more closely.

320
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
Hahahahaha.

321
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,880
Not helping you anymore.

322
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,240
Come on, bro.

323
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,640
Let's teach you the Xi'an dialect version.

324
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,880
To win a girl's heart,

325
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,360
you must rely on your gaze.

326
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
Look at me, sexy or not?

327
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,120
Hahaha.

328
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,520
Not sexy, just funny.

329
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,120
How could that be?

330
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,160
Look a bit closer.

331
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,320
Hahahahaha.

332
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,120
Not helping you.

333
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,000
That's really how it is.

334
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,080
To win a girl's heart,

335
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
you must rely on your gaze.

336
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,280
Look at me.

337
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,680
Sexy or not?

338
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,520
Hahaha.

339
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Not sexy, just funny.

340
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,000
Right?

341
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,240
Yeah.

342
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,960
Then, next.

343
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,880
How could that be?

344
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Look a bit closer.

345
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Look a bit closer.

346
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,520
Hahahahaha.

347
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,280
Not helping you.

348
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
That's what we said.

349
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,160
Not helping you.

350
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,640
Yeah.

351
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Okay, time's up.

352
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,960
Bro, only one minute.

353
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,120
Once you're ready,

354
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
just tap Yun Ning.

355
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,000
Then we'll start timing.

356
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
No glasses for this.

357
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,840
That's tough.

358
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,760
I think it's risky.

359
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,520
A bit risky.

360
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,080
It's fine.

361
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,000
We need to deliver on time.

362
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,880
Accurate, let's go.

363
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
Three, two, one, go.

364
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,240
To win a girl's heart,

365
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,880
you've got to use your eyes.

366
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,520
Look at me.

367
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Sexy or not?

368
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,040
Got it. Come on.

369
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,280
Then you say,

370
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,160
Heh heh heh.

371
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,760
Not sexy, just funny.

372
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,400
It's funny.

373
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,280
How's that possible?

374
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,880
Look closer.

375
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,280
Heh heh heh heh heh.

376
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,880
Not helping you.

377
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,120
Not helping anymore.

378
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Okay, time's up.

379
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
Okay, I know.

380
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,960
That's from "East Meets West," right?

381
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,320
The one with Tony Leung and Jacky Cheung.

382
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,480
This one's awesome.

383
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,880
Come on.

384
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Let's start. Come on.

385
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay, let's begin.

386
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
To win a girl's heart,

387
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,640
you need your eyes.

388
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,240
Sexy or not?

389
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,760
Then the other person...

390
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,760
Ha ha ha.

391
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Not sexy, just funny.

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,360
To win a girl's heart,

393
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,480
you need your eyes.

394
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,640
Sexy or not?

395
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,400
East Meets West.

396
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
How could that be?

397
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,000
Look carefully.

398
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,120
Sexy or not?

399
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
Looks like two fat sausages

400
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,960
hanging on your face.

401
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,240
Not teaching you anymore.

402
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,640
That's it.

403
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,720
East Meets West.

404
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,480
Come on.

405
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
Under Xi'an's city wall,

406
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,040
is Xi'an's train.

407
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,120
Look at me.

408
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,000
He might not have seen it.

409
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,040
Start.

410
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,480
If you want to win a girl's

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,800
heart,

412
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,360
you need a sexy look.

413
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,880
Look at me.

414
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,400
Second person.

415
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,000
There are two people.

416
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,000
Ha ha ha.

417
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,440
Is this the start?

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,640
It's started.

419
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,880
First person.

420
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Thirty seconds left.

421
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,480
First person.

422
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,240
First person.

423
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,520
If you want to win a girl's heart,

424
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,720
you need a sexy look.

425
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,280
To tempt you.

426
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,120
Look at me.

427
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Look at me.

428
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,360
Second person.

429
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,680
Ha ha ha.

430
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,880
Why are you laughing?

431
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,760
Sexy or not?

432
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,360
Second person.

433
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,560
Not sexy.

434
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,640
It's funny.

435
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,840
Really not sexy.

436
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,000
Really not sexy.

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,640
Nine.

438
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,880
Eight.

439
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,680
Ha ha ha ha ha.

440
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,480
Seven.

441
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,760
Remember.

442
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,720
Not teaching you.

443
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,240
Wait, I haven't memorized it.

444
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,880
Again.

445
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,760
If you want to win a girl's heart,

446
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,720
you need to be sexy.

447
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,280
Okay, time's up.

448
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,600
Last one.

449
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
Not teaching anymore, that's it.

450
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,680
It's over, that's it.

451
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
It's actually pretty short.

452
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,360
Let me think.

453
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,920
Not teaching.

454
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,880
See if anyone in the back can recover it.

455
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,600
He needs to know this.

456
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,680
If he knows, it's easy.

457
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
I think...

458
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,640
I think He can do it.

459
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,560
Pretty much.

460
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,400
He can make up for it.

461
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,720
He must've seen it.

462
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Definitely seen it.

463
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,640
Like this.

464
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,400
If you want to win a girl's heart,

465
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,920
If you want to win a girl's heart,

466
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,280
you need to look at me with tempting eyes.

467
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,360
Second person.

468
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,880
This is the first person.

469
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,400
Second person.

470
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,200
What did the second person say?

471
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,960
Ha ha, don't forget.

472
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,880
Just keep laughing.

473
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,360
Laugh more.

474
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,080
Why are you laughing?

475
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
Sexy or not?

476
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,840
Tempting or not?

477
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,080
Not sexy.

478
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,960
Not tempting.

479
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,080
Was there something else?

480
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm not teaching you anymore.

481
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,160
Ten seconds left.

482
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
If you want to win a girl's heart,

483
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,840
you need to give me a sexy look.

484
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,440
Hahaha.

485
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,640
Why are you laughing?

486
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,920
Sexy or not?

487
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,560
Not sexy, not tempting.

488
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm done teaching you.

489
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,680
Okay, time's up.

490
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,240
Come on.

491
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,360
That's enough.

492
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,280
Actually, that's enough.

493
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,520
You want to win a girl's heart,

494
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
then you have to give me a sexy look.

495
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,640
"East Meets West"

496
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
Hahaha.

497
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,280
Sexy or not?

498
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,400
So, is it sexy or not?

499
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,680
Not sexy.

500
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,280
Looks like two sausages hanging from your mouth.

501
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,080
Well, I have no idea then.

502
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,840
Because they didn't pass it to me.

503
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,080
Go on.

504
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,960
Uh, what was it...

505
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,200
It's about the heart.

506
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,080
You need to give me a sexy look.

507
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,560
Sexy or not?

508
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,640
Not sexy.

509
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,040
Tempting or not?

510
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,560
Tempting or not?

511
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Tempting or not? Maybe a little.

512
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,600
Right, keep going.

513
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,640
So, not tempting, right?

514
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm not teaching you anymore.

515
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,000
That's it.

516
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,360
I've seen this part.

517
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,400
The part with Tony Leung and Jacky Cheung.

518
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,320
Won.

519
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,600
Won.

520
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,440
Won.

521
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,840
Okay.

522
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,160
Two people.

523
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,520
Okay.

524
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,480
I'll teach you.

525
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,280
That's it.

526
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,840
Is this the phrase?

527
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,160
Yeah.

528
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,800
How do you win a girl's heart?

529
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
How do you win a girl's heart?

530
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
A girl's heart.

531
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
Look into my eyes.

532
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,680
Then turn around.

533
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,560
Turn your head.

534
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,840
How do you win a girl's heart?

535
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,960
Look into my eyes. Sexy or not?

536
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,280
Turn around, turn your head, turn.

537
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,600
Sexy or not?

538
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
I turn, you laugh.

539
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,160
Wait a sec.

540
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,040
Act it out one by one.

541
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,400
Twenty-five seconds left.

542
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,680
Okay, just remember the lines.

543
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,120
How do you win a girl's heart?

544
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,360
How do you win a girl's heart?

545
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Look into my eyes.

546
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,280
Sexy or not?

547
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,520
Tempting or not?

548
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,720
Over there.

549
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,520
How many laughs?

550
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,240
Keep laughing.

551
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,040
Keep laughing.

552
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,160
Laugh a hundred times.

553
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,600
Right.

554
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
Forget it, I'm not teaching you.

555
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,800
Forget it, I'm not teaching you.

556
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,560
Okay.

557
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,120
How do you win a girl's heart?

558
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,840
Look into my eyes.

559
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,000
Sexy or not?

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,440
Tempting or not?

561
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Laugh a hundred times.

562
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,840
Then the other person laughs.

563
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,440
That's not respecting him.

564
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
Then he won't teach you.

565
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,200
Won't teach you.

566
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,120
That's it.

567
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,560
Yeah.

568
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,280
Alright, come on.

569
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,000
Come on.

570
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
Hurry.

571
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,560
Bro, hurry.

572
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:12,880
How?

573
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,440
Calm down.

574
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,920
The phrase.

575
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
How do you win a girl's heart?

576
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
Look into my eyes.

577
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Sexy—

578
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,440
Sexy or not?

579
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,320
Tempting or not?

580
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,400
Laugh a hundred times, later.

581
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,880
Let the last person laugh a hundred times.

582
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,080
A hundred times.

583
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
We don't need to laugh.

584
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,560
Laugh a hundred times.

585
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,040
Then...

586
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,160
What was the phrase?

587
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,880
Yeah.

588
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,120
Yeah.

589
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
It's just...

590
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
His last part...

591
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
How do you win a girl's heart?

592
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,360
Look into my eyes.

593
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,320
Sexy or not? Tempting or not?

594
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,080
Laugh a hundred times.

595
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,960
Let the girl laugh a hundred times.

596
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,640
And then, just...

597
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,560
I forgot the last four words.

598
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,640
Why don't you improvise?

599
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,920
That's too abstract.

600
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,640
Too abstract.

601
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
It's fine, the last four words don't matter.

602
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,560
You've seen this.

603
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,600
The last four words don't matter.

604
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,280
They said it is...

605
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,840
Seen it.

606
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,080
Think about it.

607
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Definitely seen it.

608
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,920
Am I handsome?

609
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,520
Forget it, you say it.

610
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,560
Am I handsome?

611
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,120
That line is just for him.

612
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,880
Forget it.

613
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,320
Not giving it.

614
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,920
He Ge knows.

615
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,160
I know which one.

616
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,640
But I don't remember the phrase.

617
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,360
I can think of it.

618
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,920
But I don't really remember the phrase.

619
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,880
Say the meaning.

620
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,600
Like, the specific action.

621
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,640
I'll teach you how to win

622
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,120
a girl's heart.

623
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,160
I'll teach you.

624
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,840
How to win a girl's heart.

625
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,200
Look at my lips.

626
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,320
Look at my lips.

627
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,080
Irresistible or not?

628
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,840
Handsome or not?

629
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,600
Laugh a hundred times later.

630
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,160
Laugh a hundred times.

631
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
About thirty times should be enough.

632
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,120
No problem.

633
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
No problem.

634
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,160
No problem.

635
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
No problem.

636
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Look at me.

637
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
Ain't I mighty handsome?

638
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,320
Mighty handsome.

639
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
Mighty fine!

640
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,320
Can you do it again?

641
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
Look at my lips. Sexy or not?

642
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,320
Look at my lips. Sexy or not?

643
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,960
Handsome or not?

644
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,560
Handsome or not?

645
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,080
Pretty or not?

646
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,640
Pretty or not?

647
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,320
Irresistible or not?

648
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Irresistible or not?

649
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,640
Ha ha ha.

650
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,360
Yeah, just like that.

651
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,280
Yeah, that's it.

652
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,400
Alright, laugh a hundred times.

653
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,880
Anything else?

654
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,600
No problem.

655
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,600
No problem.

656
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,400
No.

657
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:18,960
No.

658
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,640
That's enough, we can win this round.

659
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,120
That's enough.

660
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,560
Enough, definitely enough.

661
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,560
Ain't I really handsome?

662
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,280
Stuff like that.

663
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,680
I'll teach you.

664
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,640
How to win a girl's heart.

665
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,840
Check out my lips.

666
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,440
Sexy or not?

667
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,320
Handsome or not?

668
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,280
Irresistible or not?

669
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,600
Ha ha ha.

670
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,960
This is like when I pad my essays.

671
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,840
Hahaha.

672
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
Nice.

673
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,400
That's enough.

674
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,920
That's enough.

675
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,000
A hundred is plenty.

676
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,320
This is just essay padding.

677
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,440
It's "East Meets West," right?

678
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,120
Yeah.

679
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
"East Meets West."

680
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,640
Good thing you all watched it.

681
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,880
Because it came from Brother Honglei.

682
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,920
It wasn't "hahaha."

683
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,160
Brother Honglei passed on "hehehe."

684
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,600
Hehehe.

685
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,920
Almost.

686
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,080
Yeah.

687
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,880
Out of forty-eight words total,

688
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
you got

689
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,080
twenty-five right.

690
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,680
Good.

691
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,320
Nice.

692
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,440
Alright, congrats everyone!
