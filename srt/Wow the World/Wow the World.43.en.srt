1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,650
Yeah, just loosen up a bit.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,563
Because the movements are pretty big.

3
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:08,800
You need to stretch for a while.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,750
Three, two, one.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,685
Making a heart gesture is easy.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,360
Actually, this is really simple.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,510
This is a pen.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,810
This is a heart.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,335
You're a romantic guy.

10
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:26,635
Hey.

11
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:27,210
Impressive.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,735
If you really thought of this in 3 seconds,

13
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:30,335
you're amazing.

14
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:31,560
That makes you pretty awesome.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,810
You're actually pretty simple.

16
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,110
Isn't it already on your shirt?

17
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,435
I didn't notice, you just did it like this.

18
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,360
That's good enough, right?

19
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,185
Yeah.

20
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:38,810
Very nice.

21
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,960
Swipe your phone.

22
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,310
Three, two, one.

23
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,160
I'm using a brush to clean my phone.

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,235
That's not much.

25
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,410
Obviously, just give it a brush.

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,235
It's too dirty.

27
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,060
There's oil on my face, so I wipe my phone.

28
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,910
Act cute.

29
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,460
Three, two, one.

30
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,835
Isn't this angry?

31
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:02,985
Isn't this angry?

32
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:04,110
It's so obvious.

33
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,460
And this is a pretty neat one.

34
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,410
This is the most standard answer.

35
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,735
Are you trying to beat the other person?

36
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:19,110
You're playfully punching their chest.

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,390
That's how you act cute with someone.

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,890
What does this mean?

39
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,690
That's acting cute.

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,440
Isn't this a gorilla?

41
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,340
Mermaid.

42
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,815
Mine is super standard.

43
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:38,440
My fish head is pointy at the top.

44
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,940
Did you see it?

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,065
Isn't this the fish head?

46
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:40,740
Is it pointy?

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,640
The tail is at the bottom.

48
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,550
Hidden weapon.

49
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,300
What's the hidden weapon I mentioned to you?

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,750
Date pit is good.

51
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,400
Mine is obviously sticking out.

52
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,700
Yours looks like it's being bitten.

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,750
I'm a mushroom.

54
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,125
What's this?

55
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,075
This is a fresh mushroom.

56
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,000
Haven't you tried it?

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,390
They're usually like an open umbrella on top, right?

58
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,840
Kind of like a ginkgo leaf, just like a ginkgo leaf.

59
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,715
Even your shirt looks like a heart.

60
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:06,140
Oh wow, yeah.

61
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,890
Bro is working hard to break through the soil.

62
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,665
This is a normal mushroom.

63
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:11,340
A scattered mushroom.

64
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,640
What kind of mushroom is Yuwen?

65
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,990
This is my aunt.

66
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,590
She's a really quirky aunt.

67
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,270
This aunt is great.

68
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,470
Aunt, aunt, aunt.

69
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,170
Huang Lei.

70
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,420
Isn't it obvious?

71
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,220
Alright.

72
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,570
A lot of mushrooms look like this.

73
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,720
No, he was acting as that one.

74
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,070
The mushroom from Super Mario that's on the ground.

75
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,670
Taking a shower.

76
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,590
He's a singer.

77
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,890
Whenever you shower, you smooth your hair down.

78
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,790
Hey.

79
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,390
Bro really knows how to look cool.

80
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,390
That hand is scrubbing the back.

81
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,915
Yeah, scratching the back.

82
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:51,490
It's a bit itchy.

83
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,540
You should grab a mic and look cool.

84
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,090
Three, two, one.

85
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,825
Everyone passed this round.

86
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:04,400
Look at that.

87
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,225
Today's background music.

88
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:09,550
Let's play Ning's favorite song.

89
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,100
Is it "Auld Lang Syne"?

90
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:57,800
Bring me my stuff.

91
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,290
You're my brother.

92
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,540
How could I not buy it?

93
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,815
Not only will I buy it,

94
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:08,790
I'll make sure to get you the most expensive one.

95
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,640
Because you deserve it.

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,690
Let me open it for you.

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,415
Alright?

98
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,215
Guess what it is.

99
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,190
Yesterday, you, Naiwen, and I

100
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,765
were discussing the case,

101
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:18,790
and we passed by a shop.

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,130
You told me this thing was great.

103
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,130
You said it was really nice.

104
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,218
I was even teasing you about it.

105
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:26,330
I said, "What kind of junk is that?"

106
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,380
Why would anyone put that at home?

107
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,955
You said, "No way."

108
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,030
You said it looks great at home.

109
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
I remembered that.

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,555
So you didn't buy it.

111
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:32,930
But I bought it for you.

112
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,380
What is this?

113
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,980
This is a

114
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,430
It's a local

115
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,455
very, very famous ornament.

116
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,230
It's called the pineal gland.

117
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,030
It symbolizes wisdom in the brain.

118
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,730
So this represents wisdom.

119
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,480
Put it at home,

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,230
and you'll get smarter and smarter.

121
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,780
Alright?

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,730
Now you have something from me at your place, okay?

123
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,230
Not necessarily.

124
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,130
I'll display all today's gifts nicely at home.

125
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,505
There we go.

126
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:55,905
There we go.

127
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:56,280
Come on.

128
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,740
I'll go slowly.

129
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,340
First one.

130
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,515
The first is your heart gesture.

131
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:06,603
Like this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

132
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:11,540
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

133
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,790
Let's do it together.

134
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,530
Next.

135
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,730
Next.

136
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,440
One more time.

137
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
One more time.

138
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,040
Every performance, we bet our alma mater's honor.

139
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,900
This one's from Central Academy of Drama.

140
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,600
Central Academy of Drama, and I'm from the Sports University.

141
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,550
Again, again.

142
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:01,925
One more time.

143
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:02,450
One more time.

144
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,750
This is crazy.

145
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,600
Come on.

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,100
Let's all go in together.

147
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,615
Made up again.

148
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:43,315
Made up again.

149
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:44,115
Made up again.

150
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:44,490
Hey.

151
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,840
All good now.

152
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,640
Why did you switch dance partners?

153
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,040
Switching partners.

154
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,150
Okay.

155
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,550
Sure.

156
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,260
Not me.

157
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,260
I can't.

158
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,810
These two legs and those two legs...

159
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,435
Let's line up.

160
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:25,735
Line up.

161
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,660
Let's start right away, cue the music.

162
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,460
Like this, right?

163
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,810
Like this, like this.

164
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,440
Alright, alright.

165
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

166
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,940
Aren't you going to try the lamb intestines?

167
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,140
I...

168
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,895
That 5/10 look on your face.

169
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:59,470
Now there’s a 4/10, 3/10, and 8/10.

170
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,420
He's not a mountain anymore.

171
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,870
Have you ever tried pig brain?

172
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,670
I've had pig brain, it's about the same.

173
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,070
Pretty much.

174
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,145
This is all just dough.

175
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:10,820
No brain in it.

176
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,120
I'd give it a 4/10.

177
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,295
It feels like you're eating brain,

178
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:27,220
but it actually tastes just like tofu.

179
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,870
Which one is the thymus?

180
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,990
I'd say 5/10.

181
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,240
The logic behind 5/10 is,

182
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,540
it feels like chicken,

183
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,090
but the more you chew, the less flavor it has.

184
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,865
Like chicken cartilage.

185
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,040
The more you chew, the more you want to taste it.

186
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,940
But you can't really taste anything.

187
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,040
But it's a bit like chicken breast.

188
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,700
Not bad.
