1
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,760
Let's play a little game here.

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,640
It's called "Show Your Signature Move."

3
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,520
Everyone uses two words

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,480
and a matching move to represent themselves.

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,840
When your name is called,

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,120
you must immediately call out the next person's name

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
and do their signature move.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,200
If you get it wrong or react too slowly, it's a fail.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,240
The moves you come up with

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,440
are meant to challenge others.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,320
Right.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,160
Let's go.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,120
The moves you come up with

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,320
are meant to make it tough for others.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm Bend Finger.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,519
Bend Finger.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,680
You have to bend your finger at this angle.

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
Can't do it.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Let him win.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,640
That's a real skill.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,080
I've filmed so many episodes,

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,640
and this is my only advantage.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
You can use your other hand too.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
That works too.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,040
There's no set angle for Bend Finger.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,680
This is fine, right?

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,760
Yeah, that's good.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,120
Only "Finger Break" can beat Bend Finger.

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,360
Who's next?

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,040
I'll go.

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Silk Spit.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,640
You have to squat.

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,560
You need to squat.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
Alright, I've got mine.

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
I'll be "Where Hurts."

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Where Hurts.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,200
Where Hurts.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Two words.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
Two words: Where Hurts.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
All hurts.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
Hurts from top to bottom.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,920
Okay.

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,560
Alright.

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,640
Go ahead, your turn.

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
Alright, I'll do this one.

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,400
I'll do this.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
Spider-Man, this one.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
Yours is called Landing.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,440
Landing.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
Let me think.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,600
Trying to make it hard for us.

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
Just to make things difficult for others.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,480
You can think about it for so long.

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Yes.

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,640
Whoever thinks of it first gets to go.

56
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,280
Aren’t we supposed to challenge our opponents?

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
That’s right.

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,080
Charming.

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,120
Charming.

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,160
Okay.

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,520
Then I’ll do this one.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,680
Showdown.

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,200
Showdown.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
Alright, sounds good.

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Squat.

66
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,640
It’s easy to sit down like this.

67
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Da Peng.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,680
Da Peng.

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,080
Da Peng.

70
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,280
Spread your wings.

71
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,320
Just like that.

72
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,400
Wings.

73
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,720
Let’s all do this one.

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,280
Let me tell you.

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,200
Everyone repeat it once.

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,520
Let’s repeat it.

77
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
Repeat it once.

78
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,680
I’m Bend Finger.

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,240
Bend Finger.

80
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Squat.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,440
Squat.

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,080
Squat.

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,760
Showdown.

84
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,600
Showdown.

85
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,400
Charming.

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,320
Da Peng.

87
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:26,920
Da Peng.

88
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,360
Da Peng.

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Everyone hurts.

90
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,120
Everyone hurts.

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,640
Everyone hurts.

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,280
Everyone hurts.

93
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,640
Alright.

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,120
Landing.

95
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,960
Landing.

96
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,240
Landing.

97
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,720
Landing.

98
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,760
Silk Spit.

99
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,840
Silk Spit.

100
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,400
Okay.

101
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,120
Everyone aches.

102
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,600
Everyone hurts.

103
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,960
That landing.

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
Silk Spit.

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,440
Silk Spit.

106
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
Lower, bro.

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,920
Silk Spit.

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Silk Spit.

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,480
Showdown.

110
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,720
That landing.

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,920
Charming.

112
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,200
Come on.

113
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Let’s go.

114
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,800
Come on.

115
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,160
I’ll go first.

116
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,520
Alright.

117
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,440
Come on.

118
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,120
Get ready.

119
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,680
Ready, go!

120
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,760
Everyone hurts.

121
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Bend Finger.

122
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
Squat.

123
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
He did the squat wrong.

124
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,480
Others squat like this.

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,520
Squat.

126
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Didn’t bloom.

127
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,920
Didn’t bloom.

128
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,400
Alright, it’s my turn.

129
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,440
What are you doing?

130
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,120
What are you doing?

131
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,519
Skating.

132
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,640
What happened? Became...

133
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,120
Suddenly turned into an old man.

134
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,400
What’s wrong, Xing Xu? Did you hurt your back?

135
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Your pants fell down.

136
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
Your pants fell down.

137
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,840
It’s fine, let’s try again.

138
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,800
Silk Spit.

139
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,240
Charming.

140
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
What does Silk Spit have to do with you?

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're so alike.

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,520
Silk Spit.

143
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,960
Landing.

144
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,920
Silk Spit.

145
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,320
Landing.

146
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Silk Spit.

147
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,840
Landing.

148
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,400
Silk Spit.

149
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,920
Landing.

150
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Charming.

151
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,720
Everyone hurts.

152
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Wait a second.

153
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,320
What?

154
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,720
All in pain.

155
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,320
Everyone hurts.

156
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,880
All in pain.

157
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,800
All in pain.

158
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
Are "teng" and "tong" the same?

159
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
No.

160
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,320
"Teng" and "tong" are two different words, bro.

161
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
Two words.

162
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,520
They're written differently.

163
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
So "everyone hurts" doesn't count, right?

164
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

165
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Bro, come on.

166
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Alright, let's start.

167
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,360
Three, two, one.

168
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Go.

169
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,280
Silk Spit.

170
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,800
All in pain.

171
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
All in pain.

172
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Showdown.

173
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,400
Hold on.

174
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
All in pain, sorry.

175
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Landing

176
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,360
Silk Spit

177
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,600
Landing

178
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,840
Everyone hurts

179
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Bend Finger

180
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,800
Squat

181
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,840
Showdown

182
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Silk Spit

183
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Charming

184
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,080
Silk Spit

185
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,640
Charming is wrong

186
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,480
Charming turned out like this

187
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,440
It’s supposed to be like this

188
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Not like that

189
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,080
Charming

190
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
I lost

191
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
Wait, let me learn it again

192
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,360
Charming

193
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,160
Like this, right?

194
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,960
As long as the hands match

195
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,640
How about this?

196
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,120
Are you doing Charming? Right?

197
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,480
Is this correct?

198
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
That works

199
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,840
Yes, that’s right

200
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,600
Now it’s correct

201
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,800
You couldn’t do it like that just now

202
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
You’re all gymnastics coaches

203
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,760
If the move isn’t precise, it doesn’t count

204
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,920
Okay

205
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,240
Let’s go

206
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
Three, two, one

207
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,880
Landing

208
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,080
Da Peng

209
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,080

210
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,200

212
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Everyone hurts

213
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,360

214
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,280
Everyone hurts

216
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,440
Everyone hurts

217
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,080
Charming

218
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,760
Bend Finger

219
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,840
That startled me

220
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,000
Showdown

221
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
Everyone hurts

222
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Charming

223
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
Everyone hurts

224
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
Charming

225
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
Silk Spit

226
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Everyone hurts

227
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,760
Charming

228
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,480

Everyone hurts

Charming

231
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,920
Silk Spit

232
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,840
Everyone hurts

233
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Charming

234
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,320
Silk Spit

235
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
Everyone hurts

236
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,920
Charming

237
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Landing

238
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
Showdown

239
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
You’re amazed, huh?

240
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,640
You thought of three people, right?

241
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,240
Three people, showdown

242
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,560
A combination of three people

243
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,320
Alright

244
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
My turn, let’s go

245
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,080
Silk Spit

246
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,280
Squat

247
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,880
Silk Spit

248
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Silk Spit

249
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,840
What are you doing?

250
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,720
That’s not Silk Spit

251
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,680
What’s wrong?

252
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,160
Went down and couldn’t get back up

253
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,160
I feel like I fell into a pit

254
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,080
I heard a bang next to me

255
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,200
Spit on the ground

256
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
These two are easy to mix up

257
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,840
Yeah

258
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,200
Everyone hurts

259
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,080
Squat

260
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,680
Everyone hurts

261
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,360
Bend Finger

262
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,880

263
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,760

265
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,680
Showdown

266
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,120
Silk Spit

267
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Silk Spit, what are you doing?

268
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,040
I give up.

269
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm still watching the show.

270
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm still here.

271
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
Silk Spit is totally absorbed.

272
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,640
Pretty good, right?

273
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,640
Squat

274
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
Showdown

275
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,880
Silk Spit

276
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,920
Squat

277
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Showdown

278
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,280

279
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,240

280
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,960

286
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,600

287
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Showdown

288
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,880
Silk Spit

289
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,560
Da Peng

290
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Bend Finger

291
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
You two aren't joining in, huh?

292
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it hard for you to hear?

293
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
Maybe switch spots again.

294
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Move closer to where the mic picks up.

295
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,120
Scoot in one spot.

296
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Your mic doesn't seem to pick up well there.

297
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,440
Did you two buy tickets?

298
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
You're just watching the whole time.

299
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
Wait, I get them now.

300
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
I know why.

301
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,680
This perspective—

302
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
We're the audience.

303
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,760
Feels just like being in the audience.

304
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
This is the audience perspective.

305
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah.

306
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
I'm watching you perform.

307
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,400
But standing here,

308
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
we actually can't see you.

309
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,840
It's fine.

310
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,160
Then give those two a turn.

311
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
We’ve got this.

312
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,640
We can do it.

313
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,520
My turn, right?

314
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,320
Showdown

315
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,039
Silk Spit

316
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,799
Everyone hurts

317
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,840
Charming

318
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,760
Showdown

319
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,320
Silk Spit

320
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,080
Everyone hurts

321
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,679

323
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,600

324
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,400

326
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,440

327
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,000

328
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840

Squat

330
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,680
Friends in the audience

331
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,640
We’ve got this.

332
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
One more for the audience

333
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,520
Friends in the audience

334
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,080
What are you doing?

335
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,000
Anyone else want to try this spot?

336
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Let me try it.

337
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,600
Watching the show from a first-person view

338
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,280
This is so clear.

339
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,320
It's almost too clear.

340
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,920
Ready!

341
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,000
Ready!

342
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,120
Everyone hurts.

343
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Da Peng.

344
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,080
Charming.

345
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Showdown.

346
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,120
Silk Spit.

347
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Showdown.

348
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,680
Silk Spit.

349
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,240
Showdown.

350
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,720
Silk Spit.

351
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Showdown.

352
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,680
Silk Spit.

353
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,360
Showdown.

354
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,800
Silk Spit.

355
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,480
Showdown.

356
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,800

357
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,200
Showdown.

358
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,520
Silk Spit.

359
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,000
Showdown.

360
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Da Peng.

361
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,520
Everyone hurts.

362
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,840
Are you getting into it?

363
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,520
You shouldn't stay in this spot for more than three rounds.

364
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
Go.

365
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Let me try.

366
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,280
After three or four rounds, it gets weird.

367
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
You just freeze up.

368
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,320
Still don't believe it, huh?

369
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,000
Go.

370
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
My brain stopped working.

371
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,160
Yeah.

372
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,680
That's why I never get it right.

373
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,320
It's not about you.

374
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,840
Everyone hurts, quick!

375
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,320
Showdown.

376
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,080

377
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,840

378
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,440

379
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,080
Showdown.

380
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,680
Silk Spit.

381
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,280
Showdown.

382
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,880
Landing.

383
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,440
Charming.

384
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Silk Spit.

385
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Landing.

386
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
Charming.

387
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,760
Bend Finger.

388
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,480
Da Peng.

389
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,400
Everyone hurts.

390
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,040
It's fine, the second round is the same here.

391
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Even if you come from there, it's the same.

392
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,920
I won't stand next to you.

393
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
Let me tell you, that's how it is.

394
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,040
If you stare too long,

395
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
It doesn't work.

396
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Why don't you try standing here?

397
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
I'll give it a try.

398
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,520
My turn, right?

399
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,320
Landing.

400
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,400
Charming.

401
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200
Bend Finger.

402
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Showdown.

403
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
I told you.

404
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,000
This spot is weird.

405
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,600
It makes you keep staring at me.

406
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
No, I was just wandering over there.

407
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
He was there, just staring at me.

408
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,080
Like this.

409
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,600
I don't believe it, bro. I'm coming over here.

410
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,200
Silk Spit.

411
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,120
Squat.

412
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
Silk Spit.

413
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,080
Squat.

414
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,800
Silk Spit.

415
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Squat.

416
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Landing.

417
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,080
Da Peng.

418
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,000
Da Peng.

419
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,520
I don't believe it, bro. I'll stand here. Go.

420
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
This is a check-in spot.

421
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,880
Still don't believe it, huh?

422
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,560
Go.

423
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,360
Audience members.

424
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,040
Da Peng.

425
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,840
I told you, this spot is weird.

426
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,800
We can all switch.

427
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
Charming.

428
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,920
Silk Spit.

429
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,400
Silk Spit.

430
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,840
Silk Spit.

431
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
You spit at yourself.

432
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,840
Spit at yourself.

433
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,480
Silk Spit.

434
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Silk Spit.

435
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Silk Spit.

436
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,080
Me.

437
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,960
Silk Spit.

438
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
Let’s switch places.

439
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,200
Everyone hurts.

440
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,720
That startled me.

441
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,160
You look at me, and I hurt all over.

442
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Fake out.

443
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,440
Focus, focus!

444
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,680
Okay.

445
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,320
I’m about to call.

446
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,680
Go ahead.

447
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
Charming.

448
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
Landing.

449
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,320
Silk Spit.

450
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Charming.

451
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,560
Everyone hurts.

452
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,920
Everyone hurts.

453
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,600
Just now, he...

454
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,040
Charming

455
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,320
Charming

456
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,480
Does this move have to be so dramatic?

457
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
That’s a pretty cool move.

458
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,120
Let me try.

459
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
That’s a pretty cool move.

460
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,400
Listen up.

461
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Listen up.

462
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,920
Nervous

463
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,600
I’m not nervous.

464
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Don’t be so stiff.

465
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,840
I’m just...

466
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Don’t be so stiff.

467
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,720
Everyone hurts.

468
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,880
Charming

469
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,800
Fake out

470
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
He’s too scared to speak now.

471
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
I’m not nervous.

472
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,000
I’m just super focused. Go ahead.

473
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,120
Come on.

474
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,240
He’s really focused.

475
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,080
Charming

476
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,120
Everyone hurts.

477
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,200
Charming

478
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,800

479
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,600

480
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,520

483
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,680

516
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,360
Let’s see who gets tired.

517
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,600
Silk Spit

518
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,400
Bend Finger

519
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
I forgot about this.

520
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,080
No need to move. You can just stay still.

521
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Just don’t move, that’s it.

522
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,600
You just do Silk Spit.

523
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
I just want to see who gets tired.

524
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,520
Your brain’s not working, huh?

525
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,280
You just have to argue with me.

526
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
You just have to go against me.

527
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,360
Can’t you pick someone else?

528
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,200
He doesn’t have time to switch.

529
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,800
My brain...

530
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,560
He really doesn’t have time to switch.

531
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,120
Just focused on this.

532
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,680
I didn’t have time to jump out.

533
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,200
I’m overheating, bro.

534
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,040
Silk Spit

535
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,800
Everyone, put on your headphones.

536
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,200
The first person sings the melody they hear.

537
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,080
Sing the lyrics you see for the second person.

538
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
The last person has to guess

539
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,000
what song the first person was listening to.

540
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,280
Alright.

541
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,560
Let me try again.

542
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Changed the lyrics.

543
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
You changed the lyrics again?

544
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,920
Darn it.

545
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,000
He’s not listening to that song in his headphones, right?

546
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Of course.

547
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,800
That’s so hard.

548
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
You have to guess his tune, right?

549
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,520
Not guess the lyrics.

550
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,040
You ask me if I love you.

551
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
Love you, yes.

552
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,640
Okay.

553
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,880
That’s what it means.

554
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Yeah, that’s the idea.

555
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,600
Alright.

556
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,840
You have to trust.

557
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,960
Trust, got it.

558
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,680
Okay.

559
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Wait for me.

560
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
Let me sort it out.

561
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,280
Alright.

562
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,760
Let’s go.

563
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,720
Watch out for the thorny roses ahead.

564
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
Do we need to listen to both versions?

565
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,280
Dear.

566
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,000
I’m almost there.

567
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
Wait a moment.

568
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Me.

569
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,000
Sung by you.

570
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,480
Do it again.

571
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,280
I think the original singer sings it like this.

572
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,280
Darling.

573
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,680
You got it.

574
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,480
You recognized it.

575
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,000
I think this is how the song goes now.

576
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,160
Alright.

577
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,680
Forget about your past and his past.

578
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,760
Darn it.

579
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,480
Are you done singing?

580
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,359
Finished singing.

581
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,200
I think you sang it really accurately.

582
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,680
Not bad.

583
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,040
Darn it.

584
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,280
Darn it.

585
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
He Ge is about to remix it.

586
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,160
I didn’t.

587
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,960
I’ll be serious.

588
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,760
Definitely serious.

589
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,640
I’ll be very serious.

590
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,360
Go ahead.

591
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,840
He Ge.

592
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,280
Acting crazy, huh?

593
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,240
What are you doing?

594
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Just take it off.

595
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,160
Guess his tune.

596
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,360
Don’t guess his lyrics, bro.

597
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,680
Right.

598
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,560
I shouldn’t look at his lyrics.

599
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,560
It’s not about the lyrics.

600
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,400
I think it’s distracting.

601
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,520
Not this one, not this.

602
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
Darn it.

603
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,600
Look how hyped he is.

604
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,120
I knew it’d go wrong, seriously.

605
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,840
I’m doomed.

606
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,360
This is the most hyped moment today.

607
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
This doesn’t help.

608
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,080
We’re really done for.

609
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,480
Guessed him.

610
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,360
Nice.

611
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,960
That’s right.

612
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,200
Not bad.

613
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,360
Not bad.

614
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
I don’t even know what I was singing.

615
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,800
You sang with real flair.

616
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,880
Go ahead.

617
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Awesome.

618
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,840
Awesome, bro.

619
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
So accurate.

620
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,360
You’re amazing.

621
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,200
Super awesome.

622
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Come on, take it off.

623
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,000
Aren’t the lyrics a bit too short?

624
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,600
It’s fine.

625
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,120
You can pause.

626
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,480
Where am I?

627
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,040
Sounds good.

628
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,000
Sounds great.

629
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,760
Fairytale.

630
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,600
You have to become

631
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,360
It's simple.

632
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,640
You have to become the one in the fairytale

633
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,240
the angel you love.

634
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,680
Open your arms.

635
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,160
Yes, that's right.

636
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
The melody is correct.

637
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
But you need to sing with the lyrics.

638
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,160
Protect you.

639
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
The lyrics aren't important.

640
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,000
Okay.

641
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:27,880
Take it down.

642
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,960
Alright.

643
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,400
Sing loudly.

644
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Not concerned.

645
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
That angel.

646
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Guard you.

647
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,640
You have to believe.

648
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Believe in us.

649
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,840
It will be like in the fairytale.

650
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,840
At this moment, my heart

651
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,880
falls like petals drifting down.

652
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
Alright, that's enough.

653
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,560
Suddenly my vision lost its color.

654
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,680
What song is this?

655
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,560
Fairytale.

656
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,800
We're so fast.
