1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,680
Barcelona

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,960
is a city nestled between mountains and the sea.

3
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
Tibidabo Mountain, at an altitude of 512 meters,

4
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
is the city's natural viewing platform.

5
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,360
Barcelona has

6
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,680
a 4.5-kilometer-long coastline.

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,960
It's a key spot for locals to relax and have fun.

8
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,520
Today, our group will walk along

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,800
Barcelona's stunning blue coastline,

10
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
and climb to the city's highest point,

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,920
Tibidabo Mountain.

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,720
We'll cross mountains and sea with laughter and joy,

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,680
feeling the romance and heartbeat of this vibrant city.

14
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,800
When will Sister Wen be back?

15
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
Sister Wen will be back soon.

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,760
Morning.

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,520
Good morning, everyone.

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Brother Honglei's room

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,560
is a tanning room.

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,920
He sleeps next to the octagonal window.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,640
That's right.

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
His bed is right in the center of the octagon.

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,760
And the blinds can't be closed.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,520
All of them,

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,440
can't close in 360 degrees.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,600
Here, the sun rises around six in the morning.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,040
He starts tanning from six o'clock.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
It's super bright.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,440
It shines right on my handsome face.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,080
I'll put on sunscreen before bed tonight.

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,480
Morning.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,280
Sit with me.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
You don't like my type.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,720
I only like your type.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,600
Lin Yi

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,280
Yesterday, I just

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,760
What's that thing he does called?

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,040
Zizhe (Sister)

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,600
Zizhe (Sister)

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,040
I went back and threw up all night.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
The most lethal part is

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
whispering in your ear,

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
Do you want to try it?

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,960
Come on.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,280
Yesterday's segment was too scary.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,120
Take off your glasses.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,600
Okay.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Left ear or right ear?

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Which side do you prefer?

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
I can give you a 3D surround experience.

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
Alright, 3D surround.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
Ready, "Sister"?

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,800
"Sis."

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,640
Got it.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,920
Crazy.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
3D surround sound.

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,160
Forget it.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
That's enough.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,800
Just thinking about it gives me chills.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,480
Then I'll call Lin Yi the big brother.

61
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Big Brother Yi.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,280
Lin Yi, you'll be called Big Brother Yi from now on.

63
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,400
This nickname is too intimidating.

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Everyone, today we officially start

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,760
our exciting journey in Barcelona.

66
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,160
Before we begin,

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,800
let's do a quick warm-up activity.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Whisper relay.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,240
Okay.

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,400
The first person

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,960
will receive a film clip.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,280
Everyone else puts on noise-canceling headphones.

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,680
The first person acts it out,

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
and passes the lines to the second person.

75
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,600
And so on.

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,160
The last member needs to

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,640
repeat the lines.

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,640
Who goes first?

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Yu Ning.

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,040
Brother Ning.

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,880
Yu Ning, go ahead.

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Yu Ning's lines are always good.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,680
Yu Ning.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,440
Alright, I'll do it.

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,400
Let me do it.

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,280
Yu Ning's lines are more proper.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
Strong and powerful.

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,160
Let's go.

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
Everyone else, please put on your headphones.

90
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,520
Not bad.

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,840
I have both beauty and brains.

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
The embodiment of heroism and chivalry.

93
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,520
Tang Bohu.

94
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,400
Madam.

95
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,160
You're meddling.

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Madam, you—

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,680
Not bad.

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
I'm turning hostile now.

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,240
For someone like you,

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I wish you would drop dead right now.

101
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,240
Madam, let's talk this out.

102
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
No need to use knives or guns.

103
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,640
Are you begging me?

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,640
Tang Tianhao, you heartless man!

105
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,800
I couldn't kill you back then.

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,800
Today I'll kill your son.

107
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,160
To vent the hatred in my heart.

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,520
Alright.

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,920
This is actually Cantonese, right?

110
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes.

111
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,840
Okay.

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
Cantonese is the dialect I speak best.

113
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,200
This—

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,960
This is a bit too easy.

115
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,760
I really do know Cantonese.

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay.

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Is anyone here from Guangdong?

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,560
Probably not.

119
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,760
He Ge, come on. He Ge can do it.

120
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Come on, He Ge.

121
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Come on, bro.

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
He Ge is here, He Ge can do it.

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,440
How's your Cantonese?

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,640
Good.

125
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,480
Not bad.

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,720
I have both beauty and brains.

127
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,320
The embodiment of heroism and chivalry.

128
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,400
Tang Bohu.

129
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Dian Qiuxiang.

130
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,960
That's right, second line.

131
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,560
Madam.

132
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Wife, right?

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,880
Third line.

134
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,440
Nosy.

135
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,320
Thank you.

136
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,520
No.

137
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
Nosy.

138
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,080
Nosy.

139
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,040
One more pair of shoes.

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,600
What is this?

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,840
Like this.

142
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
Madam, nosy.

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,480
Two people talking.

144
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,760
Right.

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,960
Shut up.

146
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,360
Fourth line.

147
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,640
Madam, you...

148
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,720
Madam, you...

149
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,240
That's right, I turned against you.

150
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,480
Turned against.

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,440
Turn against.

152
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,840
Turn against.

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,720
That's basically Mandarin, right?

154
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,320
Turn against.

155
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
Turn against.

156
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
I turn against you.

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,240
Separation.

158
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Not separation.

159
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,440
I like you.

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
No, turn.

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,160
Turn against.

162
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,760
You just asked me.

163
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
If I speak Cantonese.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
Now let me ask you.

165
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you speak Cantonese?

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,040
Exactly.

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,040
Turn against.

168
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,400
Turn against.

169
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,480
Turn against.

170
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
Right.

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
I turn against you.

172
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,200
For someone like you,

173
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,320
I wish you would die right now.

174
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,800
Right? That's pretty standard.

175
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,840
The next part.

176
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,080
Madam, let's talk it out.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
No need for knives and guns.

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
Knives and guns.

179
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,600
Right.

180
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,920
Are you begging me?

181
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,360
Beg.

182
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,560
Beg.

183
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
Please, I'm begging you.

184
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,600
Beg.

185
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Okay, let's do it quickly.

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,600
There's more.

187
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,320
There's more.

188
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,840
There's more.

189
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,840
Tang Tianhao.

190
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,480
Tang Tianhao.

191
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
The third person.

192
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
That's Tang Bohu's...

193
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,160
Father.

194
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Tang Tianhao.

195
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Tang Tianhao.

196
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,480
Tang Tianhao.

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,120
You heartless person.

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,000
I couldn't kill you back then.

199
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,040
Today I killed your...

200
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,240
son.

201
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,800
I killed your son.

202
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Your son, right?

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Son.

204
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,560
Killed your headphones.

205
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,400
To vent my anger.

206
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,120
Basically ninety-nine percent Cantonese.

207
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,680
Standard.

208
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,560
No.

209
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,960
Who is this?

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,320
You go.

211
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,320
What's up?

212
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,640
How's your Cantonese?

213
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
Just a little.

214
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,880
Okay.

215
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,160
Then it's fine.

216
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,640
No problem.

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,559
It's starting.

218
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,640
What?

219
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,520
It's starting, it's starting.

220
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,919
Sorry.

221
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,480
Come on, let's start.

222
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,480
That's right.

223
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,640
That's me.

224
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,000
Beauty and brains.

225
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,880
What did you say?

226
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Beauty and brains.

227
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,560
Not a bricklayer.

228
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,280
We don't lay bricks.

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Listen up.

230
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,400
That's right.

231
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,280
That's right.

232
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,920
Did you get that?

233
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,680
That's right.

234
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,880
I'm the one with beauty and brains.

235
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Beauty and brains.

236
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,560
Unmatched in the world.

237
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,720
Harmony between heaven and man.

238
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,800
One in a million.

239
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,720
Tang Bohu.

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,840
Tang Bohu.

241
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
Heaven, heavenly court.

242
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm the one with beauty and brains.

243
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Tang Bohu.

244
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Tang Bohu.

245
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Tang Bohu.

246
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,480
Tang Bohu.

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,440
And next,

248
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,800
Madam.

249
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,680
Madam.

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,040
Nosy.

251
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,560
Nosy.

252
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
That's accurate.

253
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,440
Madam.

254
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,080
Thank you.

255
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
Thanks.

256
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Look.

257
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,400
Madam.

258
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Don't you...

259
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
Get angry.

260
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm not angry.

261
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm turning hostile now.

262
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,560
Yeah.

263
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,120
I miss you so much.

264
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
Now.

265
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,800
Who's making trouble?

266
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,400
Tang Bohu can even speak foreign languages.

267
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,080
Four great scholars.

268
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,960
Knowing some English is fine too.

269
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,520
Tang Tianhao.

270
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,880
Let me tell you.

271
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,880
Beg me.

272
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,080
Beg.

273
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,440
You.

274
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,360
That's it.

275
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,760
Beg me.

276
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Beg me.

277
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,240
Beg me.

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
Beg me.

279
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,160
Beg.

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,160
Beg me.

281
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,440
You beg me, I won't listen.

282
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,840
Tang Tianhao.

283
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
You heartless man.

284
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,080
Heartless man.

285
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,160
You heartless man.

286
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,440
I didn't kill you back then.

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,040
I just didn't get the chance.

288
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,840
Today I'm going to kill you.

289
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,720
I killed your kid, I'm so happy.

290
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,320
So long.

291
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,280
Long.

292
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
He's already copied ninety-eight percent.

293
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,240
Already.

294
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,280
Keep going.

295
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,680
Sister Jing

296
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,720
How's your Cantonese?

297
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,520
I can speak it.

298
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Her nickname is

299
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,320
Little Guangdong

300
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,840
Little Guangdong

301
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,840
Little Guangdong

302
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Hello

303
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,600
Hello

304
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,040
Why are you saying hello?

305
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,880
I am

306
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Tang Bohu

307
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,640
Jane Zhang and Tang Someone

308
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,480
Right

309
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,000
Wait a second

310
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,440
Madam, you're too talkative.

311
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Madam, too talkative.

312
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,440
Tang Tianhao, you heartless man!

313
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,160
All the heartless men in the world

314
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,400
Heartless man

315
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,840
Just kill this heartless man

316
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,880
What are you saying?

317
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,080
Heartless man

318
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,920
Heartless man

319
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,760
Darn it

320
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,800
Heartless men deserve it

321
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
I killed a heartless man

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,080
Heartless man

323
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,120
Heartless man, darn it

324
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,920
Darn it

325
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,000
The whole world

326
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,800
All the heartless men in the world

327
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,000
Should die

328
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Should die

329
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,960
Right now

330
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
That line was just said

331
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,760
Yeah

332
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,640
Right now

333
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,160
Right now

334
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,640
Die!

335
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,160
Beg me

336
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,400
Beg me

337
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Are you begging me?

338
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,560
Beg me

339
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,120
That's the key point

340
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,880
Got it

341
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
Jing, do you still think

342
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
you can speak Cantonese?

343
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,680
Leilei

344
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,280
Leizi

345
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,080
I hope I can do this

346
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,720
I hope I can do this

347
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,160
Okay

348
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Hello

349
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,920
Come and beg me

350
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,960
Hello

351
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
Come and beg me

352
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,120
I am both beautiful and smart

353
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
Beautiful and smart

354
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,400
Tan Baobao

355
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,560
I want to have children with you

356
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
All the children in the world

357
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,360
Not all the world

358
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,480
Not born by me

359
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
All the children in the world

360
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,720
are my treasures

361
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
are my treasures

362
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Madam

363
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Thank you

364
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,760
Thank you, madam

365
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,400
Thank you

366
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800
Heartless men deserve it

367
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,880
Right? Pretty much, right?

368
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,440
If you hadn't said that, I could've translated it

369
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,560
The problem is, I can't understand it when it's translated

370
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
There's a villain here

371
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
There's a villain

372
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,280
This is the hardest script I've ever encountered

373
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,040
Over seventy-five percent is correct

374
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,280
Here we go

375
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,240
Next up, Naiwen

376
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,080
Naiwen

377
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,080
Let's start

378
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,640
Hello

379
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,520
Hello

380
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,440
I am

381
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,640
I am

382
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,480
Tan Baobao

383
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,920
Who?

384
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,520
I'm Hamburger

385
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,480
Yes

386
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,320
Madam, you

387
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Welcome

388
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,600
Let all the hamburgers in the world

389
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,480
die together.

390
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,120
All the hamburgers in the world

391
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
die together.

392
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
What the heck?

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Die together.

394
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,640
Please.

395
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Who are you?

396
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,880
Please.

397
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,920
Test me.

398
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,960
I'm done talking.

399
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,320
Did you get it?

400
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,520
No.

401
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,080
Xingxu.

402
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,320
Hello.

403
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,560
Hello.

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,440
I am

405
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,520
I am

406
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,560
a hamburger.

407
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,200
Stop trembling your lips.

408
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,160
Please.

409
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,920
Help me.

410
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
All the hamburgers in the world

411
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,360
Okay.

412
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,280
Didi.

413
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,640
Come on.

414
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,240
What does that mean?

415
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
Is this a cartoon?

416
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,120
I am

417
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,280
a hamburger.

418
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,760
Hamburger.

419
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,200
All over the world

420
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,360
All the hamburgers in the world

421
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,840
beat them all to death.

422
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,119
Hamburgers have life too.

423
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,920
Is this SpongeBob?

424
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,920
Yes, the story of Bikini Bottom.

425
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,839
Hello, I'm a hamburger.

426
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,760
I beat everyone in the world.

427
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,960
Isn't that right?

428
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,800
I think like this.

429
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Come on, Lin Yi.

430
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
Use your Cantonese.

431
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,280
You guys listen.

432
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,760
Yi Ge has mastered it.

433
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,240
Which turn is Lin Yi?

434
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,680
He's the most important one.

435
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,840
He's the first one.

436
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,840
Honglei didn't.

437
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,240
He missed two lines.

438
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
He didn't miss two lines.

439
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
Doesn't matter, let's go.

440
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,720
Come on.

441
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Hello.

442
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,520
Hello.

443
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,120
No problem.

444
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
That's not Cantonese.

445
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
What does it mean?

446
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,440
I didn't say a word.

447
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,880
Madam, you're too talkative.

448
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,240
All the heartless people in the world

449
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,400
must die.

450
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,880
What is it?

451
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,640
What is

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,560
What language is this?

453
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,440
Sun Honglei.

454
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,480
I blamed you wrongly.

455
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,040
Let me tell you.

456
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,520
You know what they're saying, right?

457
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
He definitely doesn't know.

458
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,960
Say it in Mandarin.

459
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,640
Tell them.

460
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Hello.

461
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,920
I am Tang Bohu, both beautiful and smart.

462
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,320
Wait a second.

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,600
You, what you just said

464
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Say it again.

465
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,400
I am Tang Bohu, both beautiful and smart.

466
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,160
Tang Bohu.

467
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,520
Tang Bohu.

468
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,400
Tang Bohu.

469
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
All the heartless men in the world

470
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,120
must die.

471
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Your kid is also heartless.

472
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,600
Must die.

473
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,720
Your kid is heartless, must die.

474
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,160
Heartless man—the English even came out.

475
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,000
He has English.

476
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,360
There's English.

477
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,120
And now,

478
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,480
Let me tell you.

479
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,000
You begged me, that's it.

480
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,120
This is "one word at a time."

481
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,320
How about I do it?

482
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
Sure, let He Ge do it.

483
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,760
Let He Ge do it.

484
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,480
I used to be the line monitor in my class.

485
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm playing seriously with you now.

486
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Alright, here I go.

487
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,040
I kissed you.

488
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
But it was a compliment to you.

489
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
I want you to pay for that slap.

490
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,240
Pay the price.

491
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,960
I want to finish my compliment to you.

492
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,400
I've already finished complimenting you.

493
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,440
I'll politely say good night to you.

494
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,200
You.

495
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,480
Little brother.

496
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,040
Everything that happens next

497
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,720
will be very disgusting.

498
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
Is it that disgusting?

499
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Yes.

500
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,640
Yes.

501
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,720
Listen to me carefully.

502
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,960
You're a girl now.

503
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
I kissed you downstairs.

504
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,960
But it was a compliment to you.

505
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,800
For that slap you just gave me,

506
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,400
I'll make you pay the price.

507
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,960
I want to finish my compliment to you.

508
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,840
Anything else?

509
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
I've finished complimenting you.

510
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,160
Just politely telling you,

511
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,640
good night.

512
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,520
That's all.

513
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,400
That's it.

514
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,040
This...

515
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,320
This scene partner is really...

516
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,720
Horror movie.

517
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Horror movie.

518
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,720
Definitely a horror movie. Let me calm down.

519
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,040
Uncle Nai.

520
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
You'll definitely like this part.

521
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,440
Really?

522
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,040
Yes.

523
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,800
You even held my hand.

524
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,960
So gross. Really.

525
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,880
It's fine.

526
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,200
You have no lines.

527
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,080
You kissed me downstairs just now.

528
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,640
But that's my compliment to you.

529
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,080
You have to pay for slapping me earlier.

530
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,560
Pay the price.

531
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,960
This is your price.

532
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,560
This is my last compliment to you.

533
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,480
One last thing: good night.

534
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,280
What kind of drama is this?

535
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,040
Honglei.

536
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,520
Is it my turn?

537
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
This scene suits us.

538
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,080
You know, right?

539
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
This character relationship...

540
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,480
Kind of fits.

541
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,160
What are you doing?

542
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,160
Come, stand here.

543
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,360
Doesn't matter if I'm a man or a woman.

544
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,680
You're definitely my opposite sex. Come on.

545
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,080
Even though you kissed me,

546
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,200
I think it's

547
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,840
for you,

548
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,360
a compliment.

549
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,320
A kind of compliment for you.

550
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,800
Compliment.

551
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,320
Praise.

552
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,280
Even though you

553
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
slapped me,

554
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,280
I don't care at all.

555
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,920
Because you

556
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,680
kissed me,

557
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
so now I

558
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,720
I'll praise you again.

559
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,480
I...

560
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,360
Didn't move.

561
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,880
Hurry up.

562
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,160
Why did this turn into an action movie?

563
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
What are you doing?

564
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,440
Just lines.

565
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,560
I need to finish.

566
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,800
No actions.

567
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,120
Hurry up.

568
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,400
No actions.

569
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,200
There's action.

570
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,880
What are you doing?

571
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Fake.

572
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,200
Fake.

573
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,600
My praise for you.

574
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,600
That's it.

575
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,880
Good night.

576
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,600
Good night.

577
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,320
Is that what it means?

578
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,360
Why is there a prize?

579
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
What did you say just now?

580
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,080
I said compliment, right?

581
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,760
Compliment.

582
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,360
Xingxu.

583
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,440
It's your turn.

584
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,200
Come on, Xingxu.

585
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,840
Just come up and say,

586
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,120
You kissed me.

587
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,720
I think I'm praising you.

588
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,960
You slapped me.

589
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,520
I don't care at all.

590
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,680
Now I want to try.

591
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,480
Try it.

592
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,600
Try it.

593
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Is this the right word, bro?

594
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,080
Main scene.

595
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,600
Let's try it.

596
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,640
Li Naiwen just acted like this.

597
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,360
That's it, can't do more.

598
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:45,960
Darn it.

599
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
Come on, I'll forget soon.

600
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,080
You kissed me.

601
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,440
That's my praise for you.

602
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,000
You slapped me.

603
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,920
I really don't care.

604
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,040
Now I want to try.

605
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,360
How does it feel?

606
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,440
The client still needs to give feedback.

607
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
So this is for evaluation, right?

608
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,880
How was it? A perfect recreation.

609
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Great performance.

610
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Especially that part.

611
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,880
Now I want to try.

612
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,720
I want to give it a try.

613
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,120
Exactly the same.

614
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,440
Come on, Jin.

615
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,760
Start.

616
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,480
I kissed you.

617
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,480
That was my praise for you.

618
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,640
Even though you slapped me.

619
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,320
But it doesn't matter.

620
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,280
Now I want to try again.

621
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,160
The actions need to be recreated too.

622
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,400
Okay, I got it.

623
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,680
Okay.

624
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,080
Last round.

625
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,480
Come on.

626
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
Yes, I kissed you.

627
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,080
I kissed you.

628
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,040
That was my praise for you.

629
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Even though you hit me.

630
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,760
Even though you hit me.

631
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,240
But that's not important, it doesn't matter.

632
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
It's not important, it doesn't matter.

633
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,440
Because now,

634
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,120
Because now,

635
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
I want to try again.

636
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,400
Repeat it again.

637
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,400
I kissed you.

638
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,880
This is my praise for you.

639
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,120
Even though you slapped me.

640
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,560
But that's not important.

641
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,800
Now I want to try again.

642
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,440
Only seven words were correct.

643
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
The third round started from this.

644
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
Compliment turned into praise.

645
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,720
Praise.

646
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,200
No, why call it a compliment?

647
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,280
I just...

648
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,560
I don't get that meaning.

649
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:49,880
Yeah.

650
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,760
Actually, that sentence feels a bit awkward.

651
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,560
Got it.

652
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,480
Your "give it a try."

653
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,800
Now I want to give it a try.

654
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,320
Turn Xingxu completely into...

655
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,560
Now I want to give it a try.

656
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,920
Really want to try, Xingxu.

657
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,280
No, the vibe Brother Honglei gave me...

658
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,400
The vibe I gave you.

659
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
It's the vibe Brother Naiwen gave me.

660
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,760
But it's probably not the vibe I gave Brother Naiwen.

661
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
Our next destination,

662
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,760
is Barcelona Olympic Port.

663
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,280
Let's continue with the next challenge.

664
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,560
Let's go, let's head out.

665
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,680
From now on, we have to speak Cantonese with Yi Ge.

666
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,240
Then we won't be able to communicate.

667
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
Thinking about Lin Yi just now,

668
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,680
he couldn't learn it at all.

669
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,440
He just can't pick it up.

670
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Tang Bohu.

671
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,040
Tang Bohu.

672
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Do you guys dare to ride roller coasters?

673
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I really love riding roller coasters.

674
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,720
Seriously.

675
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,280
But I'm scared of those

676
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,080
ones like the pirate ship.

677
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,000
I just can't do the drop tower.

678
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
I can't handle that either.

679
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,200
We're here.

680
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
Can you leave me here tonight?

681
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Look at that beach.

682
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,320
Look at that beach.

683
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
See, the sea is blue.

684
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,480
Then it turns green.

685
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,920
Yeah.

686
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,520
It's so beautiful.

687
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
Barcelona Olympic Port.

688
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,720
It was built for the 1992

689
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,160
Olympics as a modern pier.

690
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,400
It was the main venue for the sailing events.

691
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,160
The archery torch lighting ceremony

692
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,640
was also held here.

693
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,560
Now this place has become

694
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,160
one of the most popular tourist ports in the Mediterranean.

695
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:00,960
So beautiful.

696
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Soul.

697
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,960
It's stunning.

698
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,200
This is the soul.

699
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,360
We can take off our shoes and go down.

700
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
It's the first day since Sister Wen left.

701
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,480
I already miss her a lot.

702
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,360
I miss our Sister Wen.

703
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,400
Seeing the sea makes me happy.

704
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,800
Really.

705
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,520
I feel happy whenever I see the sea.

706
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,000
Let's take a selfie here.

707
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Okay.

708
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,160
So beautiful.

709
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
Let’s admire it a bit more.

710
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,720
Let me take a photo for you.

711
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
One, two.

712
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,000
Done.

713
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,160
Okay.

714
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,800
Alright.

715
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,880
Let’s head straight to the restaurant.

716
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,000
This is the pier.

717
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
Pier.

718
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,000
Have you ever been on a sailboat?

719
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,800
No, I haven’t.

720
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,600
There are sailboats everywhere over there.

721
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,640
I haven’t even gone fishing before.

722
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,680
Sailing is really fun.

723
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,160
You should take me fishing sometime.

724
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,760
Sure.

725
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,400
In a place like this, you have to cast a line.

726
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,360
Thank you.

727
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,120
Hello.

728
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,760
Hi.

729
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,360
Hello.

730
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,120
Hi.

731
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,640
Welcome, everyone, to

732
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
the beautiful coast of Spain.

733
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,960
Since we’re at the seaside,

734
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,240
we can’t miss out on the seafood.

735
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Going home.

736
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,840
Say hello to the mussel brothers.

737
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,680
We’ll eat soon, let’s warm up first.

738
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,000
The task is called the Two-Person Initials Performance.

739
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,480
Form pairs.

740
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,880
Use the given initials to make a word.

741
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Then act out the word together.

742
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,960
Within five minutes.

743
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
The two with the lowest scores

744
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,440
won’t get to enjoy the seafood feast.

745
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,440
They’ll only get Spanish olives and small fish.

746
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,320
Those fish are super salty, little salty fish.

747
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,000
Perfect.

748
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,360
Lin Yi is really good at this.

749
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,520
I’ve never played before.

750
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,560
He’s just better at Cantonese.

751
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,080
Cantonese works too.

752
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,480
Let’s do palm or back of the hand.

753
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,160
Rock, paper, scissors to split up.

754
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,600
Okay, let’s go.

755
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,680
Alright, let’s do it.

756
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,680
Palm or back.

757
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,720
We’ll be a team first.

758
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,640
We’re a team.

759
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,560
Sounds good.

760
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,320
Palm or back.

761
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,160
We’re a team.

762
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,200
Okay, we’re a team.

763
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,240
Palm or back.

764
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,240
You two are a team.

765
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,240
It really is the back.

766
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,040
That’s fate.

767
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,520
Sometimes you just can’t fight fate.

768
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,760
Destiny.

769
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,280
Picked an abstract big bro.

770
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,880
Come here.

771
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,400
Give me a hug.

772
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,720
We’re not arguing anymore.

773
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,440
No more fighting.

774
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,640
Can we try it first?

775
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
Let’s try it out first.

776
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,600
Our first word.

777
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Let’s go.

778
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:54,920
Come quickly.

779
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
Remember your role.

780
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,720
You’re just a

781
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,240
maid.

782
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,600
Why do you love me?

783
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,960
Because it’s instinct.

784
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,719
Hug you.

785
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,800
Okay.

786
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,719
Silly bird.

787
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,280
Silly bird.

788
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,639
This one’s good.

789
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,520
You.

790
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,159
Silly cow.

791
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,159
You two go again.

792
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,880
Another silly cow, go.

793
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,400
Come on, bro.

794
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,159
I’ll set up the scene for you, go.

795
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,760
Come, eat.

796
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,120
Come, eat.

797
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,920
Come, eat.

798
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,520
Brain food.

799
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,800
Highly insulting

800
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,480
Dumb cow brain supplement, that's good

801
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,760
Alright, let's officially start

802
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,240
Five-minute countdown

803
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,920
Okay, let's go

804
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,920
That one from Lin Yi

805
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
Yeah, me too

806
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,360
Like this

807
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,440
Zizhe (Sister)

808
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,800
Zizhe (Sister)

809
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Zizhe (Sister)

810
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,200
Juicing

811
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,320
Okay

812
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,240
Like this

813
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,440
What's this?

814
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,920
Kid

815
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,280
Is there more?

816
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:40,960
Wait a second

817
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,360
Okay

818
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,160
I love you

819
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,160
Sincere

820
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,040
Alright

821
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,840
You guys go first

822
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,520
Needle prick

823
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,160
Alright, that's fine

824
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,080
Madam Rong

825
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,800
Yes

826
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,200
Are you sure?

827
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,720
I'm sure

828
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,080
Come on

829
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
Come on, hurry

830
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,640
No, this isn't a performance

831
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,760
Now the performance begins

832
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,280
Spider

833
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,000
Spider

834
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,000
They acted it out for me

835
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,560
Spider

836
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,040
Yeah

837
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,600
How do you act like a spider?

838
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,920
Spider

839
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,640
They acted it out for me

840
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,040
That's too much

841
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,080
Thanks, young man

842
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,680
You're welcome, old man

843
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,240
Elder

844
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,520
Okay

845
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,080
You guys come

846
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,320
You guys come

847
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,440
You guys come

848
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Found it

849
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
So hyped

850
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
So hyped, way too hyped

851
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,240
Hey, don't run

852
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,320
Catch the thief

853
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,000
Let me go

854
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,840
I want to

855
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,680
Struggle

856
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,840
Quick

857
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,160
Come back

858
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,120
Catch the pig

859
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,320
Come on, you

860
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,840
What?

861
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,520
You

862
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,360
You hum

863
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,480
Slaughter the pig

864
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,600
Piggy

865
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,560
One, two, three

866
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,160
Pig snout

867
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,680
Piglet

868
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,080
Going crazy just for a bit of food

869
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
There's one more

870
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
You stand

871
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,640
Like this

872
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,880
Nephew

873
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,080
Cow

874
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:09,920
There's one more

875
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,880
Just stand, that's fine

876
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,360
Pillar

877
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,360
There's one more

878
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,640
There's one more

879
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,200
You squat down

880
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,120
Can I squat down?

881
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,760
Squat down

882
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,480
Live in

883
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,880
Awesome

884
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,880
Live in

885
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,200
That's the same

886
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,120
Come on, the one you just did

887
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,400
Let's redo that move

888
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,920
You squat down

889
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,080
Residence

890
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,360
One more

891
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
You squat down

892
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,960
Stationed

893
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,840
Come on, line up

894
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,440
Are you sure?

895
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,680
Xingxu

896
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,280
Xingxu

897
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,760
So heavy.

898
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,360
That scared me.

899
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,720
Awesome, really awesome.

900
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,520
Your workouts paid off.

901
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,480
You can even lift me up.

902
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,440
Makeup and styling.

903
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,320
Did he say it?

904
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,800
Makeup and styling.

905
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,400
Makeup and styling, he said it.

906
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,800
He said it.

907
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,920
Master.

908
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,800
Slap the mouth.

909
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,880
You should take two steps forward.

910
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,240
Let me explain.

911
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,880
Okay.

912
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,000
You guys go first.

913
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,440
Ruler.

914
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,960
Come here, come.

915
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
I’ll walk over, look.

916
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,080
You now...

917
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,560
Boss Zhu.

918
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,840
Boss Zhu.

919
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,840
You didn’t tell me either.

920
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,440
Like Boss Zhao, Boss Zhang, Boss Zhai.

921
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,480
Right.

922
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:57,800
Yeah.

923
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,160
Honglei.

924
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,520
How’s your script coming along?

925
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,880
Let me...

926
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,440
Think it over a bit more.

927
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,560
Consider.

928
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,600
Come up quickly.

929
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,680
This is a huge area.

930
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,400
Swamp.

931
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Where are you?

932
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,680
I’m here.

933
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,840
Here.

934
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,200
What?

935
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,880
Young man.

936
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,760
This is mine.

937
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,400
Address.

938
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,080
Impressive.

939
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,480
Pretty great.

940
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,680
Really, none of us showed any nerves.

941
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,800
I think it’s a tie.

942
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,280
We’re really hungry.

943
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
Just for some seafood, I’m telling you.

944
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,160
We really went all out.

945
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,120
Gave it our all.

946
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,160
So brain-teasing.

947
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,920
Honglei and Naiwen’s team got seven words.

948
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,800
They’re amazing.

949
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,880
Really impressive, this is awesome.

950
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,240
So good.

951
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,520
Really strong.

952
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,560
You’re all great.

953
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,360
Jingjing and Didi’s team got eight words.

954
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,000
Yuning and Lin Yi’s team got six words.

955
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,800
He Ge and Xingxu’s team got nine words.

956
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,360
Also impressive.

957
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,320
But in terms of performance,

958
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,760
Theirs was more varied.

959
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,880
I think so too.

960
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
I really learned a lot.

961
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,320
A few moments made me tear up.

962
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,840
My tears were right in my eyes.

963
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,680
With us saying this,

964
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
You still won’t let us eat together?

965
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,440
You guys are too much.

966
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,280
Sit down first.

967
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,560
Let’s go.

968
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,520
Sit down first.

969
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,440
Come on, to the table.

970
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,000
Let’s eat.

971
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
Guys, I can’t hold out much longer.

972
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,840
I’ll finish a plate soon.

973
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,000
So clean.

974
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,080
We need to look pitiful.

975
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,160
We have to act all miserable.

976
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,840
Don’t be too superficial.

977
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,280
Like playing a villain.

978
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,880
Try it, come on.

979
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,720
Try one.

980
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,120
Come on.

981
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,920
Olive.

982
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,320
Is it good?

983
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,040
This really shows the team spirit.

984
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,680
We must.

985
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,920
I want to trade oysters for some olives.

986
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,520
Is that okay?

987
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,280
Sure.

988
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,800
Thanks, bro.

989
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,320
I’ll just trade one, take one.

990
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,600
No need for more.

991
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,720
You’re giving me all of them, right?

992
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,320
Is that how it is?

993
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,040
What’s this, chili?

994
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:48,960
No idea.

995
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,200
This is an olive.

996
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,200
This is a chili.

997
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,080
Really?

998
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,800
There's chili in the middle.

999
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,480
So spicy.

1000
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,040
I don't care.

1001
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,400
We don't have enough space for all these dishes.

1002
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,720
We need to combine that table with ours.

1003
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,840
Let's do it together, okay?

1004
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
It's rare for everyone to be this united.

1005
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,840
It's not easy for us to come together.

1006
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,720
Finally.

1007
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,160
Come on.

1008
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,640
These oysters are delicious.

1009
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,080
Oysters are always tasty.

1010
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,080
How is this so good?

1011
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,880
This shellfish is so tender and fresh.

1012
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,800
How many oysters have we eaten?

1013
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,320
All of us here.

1014
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,760
I must've had ten oysters.

1015
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,320
The staff are all stunned.

1016
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,880
How do these people eat so many oysters?

1017
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,480
We need to explain to them.

1018
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,240
We're a food show specializing in oysters.

1019
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,760
Our show's name is

1020
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,000
"Oysters Super Fresh."

1021
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,880
"Oysters Super Fresh."

1022
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,440
This restaurant is so good.

1023
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,560
Shouldn't we take a photo?

1024
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,520
Send it to Yu Wen.

1025
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,000
You finished all the oysters.

1026
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,160
And you said to take a picture.

1027
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,840
No, it hasn't been served yet.

1028
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,880
But to be honest,

1029
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,120
Eating this many at once is a bit much.

1030
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,960
Oyster King.

1031
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,080
Yu Wen.

1032
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,360
Yu Wen.

1033
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
What's this?

1034
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
It's on fire.

1035
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,720
There's fire here.

1036
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,640
It's burning.

1037
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,520
Caramel.

1038
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,720
Cream caramel.

1039
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,800
This smells amazing.

1040
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,560
Give it to me.

1041
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,640
Let me cut it for everyone.

1042
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,680
It's easy to cut, really easy.

1043
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,440
It's delicious.

1044
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,280
After we finish eating,

1045
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,120
Next, we're heading to

1046
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,280
Tibidabo Mountain in Barcelona.

1047
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,080
Tibidabo.

1048
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,280
Check out my cool sunglasses.

1049
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,000
So cool.

1050
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,600
You can switch to lots of different colors.

1051
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,040
Right?

1052
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,480
Yeah.

1053
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,760
Where did you put that lens?

1054
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,080
In my jacket pocket.

1055
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,400
That's pretty convenient.

1056
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,720
Hurry, move aside.

1057
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,320
We're at the celebration dinner.

1058
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,760
Who told you to be so clueless?

1059
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,320
The difference between you and me.

1060
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,160
Superman.

1061
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,960
I'm feeling a bit dizzy from eating.

1062
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
This meal is really delicious.

1063
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,760
Fujian doesn't produce oysters.

1064
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,320
Fujian.

1065
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:06,680
Oysters.

1066
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,440
Oysters.

1067
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,640
I have such a great impression of Fujian.

1068
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,120
The first time I went there to eat

1069
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,520
What's the wonton called there?

1070
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,040
Rouyan.

1071
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,680
Bianrou.

1072
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,520
And the mixed kind.

1073
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Mixed with pork lard.

1074
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,360
Super tasty.

1075
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,760
I was blown away by the food.

1076
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,440
You know what, He'er,

1077
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,480
Fujian cuisine is really delicious.

1078
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,160
Mixed noodles with bianrou.

1079
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,560
Soy milk and fried dough sticks.

1080
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Guobianhu.

1081
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,320
Mianxianhu.

1082
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,360
Mianxianhu, right.

1083
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,440
Boiled rice noodles.

1084
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,840
Tusun jelly.

1085
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,880
Stir-fried Xinghua noodles and more.

1086
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,960
It's just too good.

1087
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
It's insanely good.

1088
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,880
If I go there, I could never lose weight.

1089
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,960
It's so beautiful here.

1090
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,560
There's a Ferris wheel here.

1091
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,040
Did you see that?

1092
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,200
This one is pretty scary.

1093
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,640
This is fun.

1094
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,760
Tibidabo Mountain in Barcelona.

1095
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,320
It's on the Catalonia coast.

1096
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,200
In the mountain range.

1097
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
The highest peak of the Collserola mountain range.

1098
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,280
512 meters above sea level.

1099
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,720
You can overlook all of Barcelona.

1100
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,080
Enjoy the stunning sunset.

1101
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,880
There's an amusement park on the summit.

1102
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,320
It's also a filming location for famous movies.

1103
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,800
This is so much fun.

1104
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,480
Let's go.

1105
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:24,840
No way.

1106
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,520
Go for it.

1107
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,120
Absolutely not.

1108
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,560
Go on.

1109
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,600
We can check this out, right?

1110
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,880
If you don't see this,

1111
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,080
you've come here for nothing.

1112
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,880
Beautiful.

1113
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,040
So beautiful.

1114
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,760
Amazing.

1115
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,960
Come on, let's take a look.

1116
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,200
Hello, everyone.

1117
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,000
We meet again.

1118
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,800
Hello.

1119
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,240
Here we go again.

1120
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,240
Directors.

1121
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,760
We've now arrived at

1122
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,280
This is Tibidabo Mountain, right?

1123
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,280
This amusement park

1124
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,320
was built starting in 1901.

1125
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
We'll show you around.

1126
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,360
Sure.

1127
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,120
From here, we can see

1128
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,000
the whole city panorama.

1129
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,680
Looks great.

1130
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,800
This view is incredible.

1131
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,560
This is all of Barcelona.

1132
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Let's take a photo in front of Tibidabo.

1133
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,640
Okay.

1134
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,480
Come on.

1135
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,360
Come here.

1136
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,440
This is a typical industrial city.

1137
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,120
Before 1854,

1138
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,160
there was a tall city wall around here.

1139
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,440
A wall over 30 meters high.

1140
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,280
It blocked the sea breeze from coming in.

1141
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,840
And the mountain wind couldn't get in either.

1142
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,920
So every winter,

1143
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,120
many people would pass away.

1144
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,720
All because of poor air quality.

1145
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,040
Back then, the average life expectancy

1146
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,600
was about 35 years old.

1147
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,600
35 years old.

1148
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,440
If I lived 100 years ago,

1149
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,200
I'd only have two years left, bro.

1150
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,040
I'm already "dead."

1151
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,000
You're talking to a ghost now.

1152
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,120
The whole city planning

1153
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,320
is all in blocks.

1154
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,960
See?

1155
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,600
This design

1156
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,080
comes from the Cerdà Plan.

1157
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,200
When Barcelona wanted to expand,

1158
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,680
many urban planners came.

1159
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,440
But they chose the Cerdà Plan in the end.

1160
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,000
Beautiful.

1161
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,520
Why?

1162
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,600
First, everyone lives together.

1163
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,120
Right?

1164
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,240
It's designed like little cubes.

1165
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,840
Block by block.

1166
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,760
Each street

1167
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,000
is 113 meters wide.

1168
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,600
Whether you live inside or outside,

1169
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:35,920
right?

1170
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
there's enough sunlight.

1171
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,120
And enough air.

1172
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,040
Whenever you reach the center of a block,

1173
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,680
you'll notice

1174
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,920
there's an opening in the middle.

1175
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,440
Many people say Barcelona is shaped like a "square."

1176
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,920
Strictly speaking, it's more like a "hui" character.

1177
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,520
The character for "return."

1178
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,040
There's a hole in the middle.

1179
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,520
This way,

1180
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,000
no matter what,

1181
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,600
if you live inside

1182
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,800
or outside, there's enough wind.

1183
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,840
And we also have to thank one more year,

1184
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,240
the 1992 Olympic Games.

1185
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,560
I believe many people

1186
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,840
first heard of Barcelona

1187
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,600
because of the 1992 Olympics.

1188
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,920
So, this is Barcelona today.

1189
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,720
Right?

1190
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,280
Look at it now, such a beautiful tourist city.

1191
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:02,960
Amazing.

1192
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,560
Thank you.

1193
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,760
Thank you, teacher.

1194
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,400
Thanks to the teacher.

1195
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,040
Director Ye also mentioned

1196
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,360
we often see Barcelona

1197
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,280
in its most famous photo,

1198
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,400
with its grid layout.

1199
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,880
Of course, there's an even better spot

1200
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,040
to see the whole city.

1201
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,840
It's that little metal basket behind us.

1202
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,800
Little metal basket.

1203
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,760
A basket for several people.

1204
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,760
One basket.

1205
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,120
How many eggs in a basket?

1206
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,280
Why did I just feel

1207
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,040
like I saw a familiar figure?

1208
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,480
Xingxu, what are you doing?

1209
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,280
Before coming to Spain, I was really looking forward to it.

1210
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,040
But after arriving,

1211
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,280
I'm tired and thirsty every day.

1212
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,080
What should I do?

1213
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,960
Bro, let me help you.

1214
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,240
Get your energy back.

1215
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,480
Feeling better now?

1216
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,920
I'm back to normal.

1217
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,960
When traveling,

1218
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,840
if you're thirsty or tired, you need some Maitong.

1219
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,960
It quickly restores your energy.

1220
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,760
Bro, look at all the vitamins in the ingredients.

1221
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,120
Nice, Maitong is a lifesaver.

1222
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:56,680
I'm good again.

1223
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,440
Bro, let's go.

1224
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,880
Let's head out.

1225
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,640
Go.

1226
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,480
Let's go then.

1227
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,200
The brave enjoy the world first.

1228
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,920
It feels a bit strange not bringing my daughter here.

1229
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,200
A grown man,

1230
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,440
sitting alone on a carousel,

1231
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,600
spinning nonstop.

1232
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,680
Look at the highest point.

1233
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,280
Isn't it a bit high?

1234
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,200
Actually, it's okay.

1235
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,920
This is...

1236
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,800
How many meters is it?

1237
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,040
This is about 60 meters.

1238
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,480
I don't dare go up alone.

1239
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,800
I need someone with me.

1240
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,840
Please.

1241
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,920
Come on, I'll go with you.

1242
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,800
Mom, let's go.

1243
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,040
Let's just do it.

1244
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,640
Yeah.

1245
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,240
It shakes.

1246
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,440
Yes.

1247
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,840
It wobbles back and forth a bit.

1248
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:57,880
Bro,

1249
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,680
Bro, don't be scared.

1250
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,040
I know.

1251
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,600
It's fine.

1252
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,440
Uncle Nai can't handle it.

1253
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,000
Uncle Nai is like this...

1254
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,160
His philtrum is already stretched.

1255
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,360
You can't look down now.

1256
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,280
You have to shoot the church like this.

1257
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,280
Bro, don't drop your phone.

1258
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,680
I know.

1259
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,800
Still a bit scary.

1260
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,840
Yeah.

1261
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,920
Who did this?

1262
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,240
I didn't touch it.

1263
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm pretty afraid of heights.

1264
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,440
Get me an ice cream.

1265
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,880
Let me calm down.

1266
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
It's not at the top yet.

1267
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,680
I know, so...

1268
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,280
This is only halfway.

1269
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,520
Only halfway?

1270
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,800
Awesome.

1271
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,320
It's beautiful.

1272
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:56,960
Really beautiful.

1273
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,760
It's so pretty.

1274
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:04,920
How is it?

1275
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,040
Who said stop?

1276
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,440
Who called for a stop?

1277
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,200
No one said stop.

1278
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,440
Nobody called stop.

1279
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
Still thinking about stopping.

1280
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,800
Don't look back.

1281
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,800
Don't turn around.

1282
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,280
Look behind.

1283
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,920
Why is it shaking?

1284
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,680
Because we're at the very top.

1285
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,280
And now they're going up.

1286
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,720
Do you usually go on rides at amusement parks?

1287
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,240
Yeah.

1288
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,600
This kind is fine.

1289
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,320
It's okay.

1290
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,400
Hurry up and get on!

1291
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,040
I'm turning into Brother Naiwen here.

1292
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,520
I'm Brother Honglei.

1293
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,160
Hurry up!

1294
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,840
What's that noise?

1295
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,160
This really is...

1296
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,280
This is actually a bit scary.

1297
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,840
That last part was really scary.

1298
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,080
What's wrong, "wife"?

1299
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,000
Why did I hear my "wife" shouting?

1300
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,760
Look, it's moving.

1301
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,400
Naiwen,

1302
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,040
Are you okay?

1303
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,040
I'm fine, no problem.

1304
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,480
If you can't handle it, just jump down.

1305
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,360
Come on, let's go.

1306
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,240
I'm okay.

1307
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,720
Still okay.

1308
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,000
Actually, the railing is pretty high for us too.

1309
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,560
It's fine.

1310
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,080
Actually, it's fine.

1311
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,760
What happened?

1312
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,920
Is this thing always this lively?

1313
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,840
Just waiting for Brother Ning's feedback.

1314
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,800
Because he's also scared of this stuff.

1315
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,000
You got this, Brother Ning.

1316
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,800
It's nothing.

1317
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,240
No big deal.

1318
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,840
Piece of cake.

1319
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,240
You can see the grid from here.

1320
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,120
It really is quite high.

1321
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,560
Let us out, help!

1322
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,400
Is it scary, Liu Yuning?

1323
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,800
Just holding on.

1324
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,360
Barely hanging in there.

1325
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,880
See, my hands haven't let go at all.

1326
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,320
This is a bit...

1327
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,120
No one's talking now.

1328
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,720
Ning, why aren't you saying anything?

1329
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,760
Ning, are you okay?

1330
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,320
Tell them to get me a pair of pants.

1331
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,880
You're actually enjoying this?

1332
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,600
You can start swinging now.

1333
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,160
Naiwen.

1334
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,160
Bro.

1335
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Feels great.

1336
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,640
He crouched down at the very top.

1337
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,560
He got scared.

1338
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,120
No, I didn't.

1339
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,480
I thought it was a pirate ship ride.

1340
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,600
No, it's just really slow.

1341
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,560
It's just like this.

1342
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,120
That's nothing then.

1343
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,280
I feel embarrassed riding this.

1344
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,920
Thanks.

1345
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,200
Is it scary?

1346
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,400
Not really.

1347
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,560
But when it gets to the top,

1348
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,280
it shakes a little.

1349
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,800
My bro is staggering now.

1350
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,760
He's forcing himself.

1351
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,920
Bro, why do your lips look pale?

1352
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:44,760
Really?

1353
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,480
I'm really fine.

1354
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,720
Let me show you.

1355
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,320
How amazing is it, right?

1356
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,000
I even took photos up there.

1357
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,760
This looks so good.

1358
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,600
Bro, there are still people up there.

1359
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,200
I don't care.

1360
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,800
Wow.

1361
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,640
You did that on purpose, right?

1362
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,720
No way.

1363
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,840
Let us down.

1364
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,560
Down!

1365
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,440
Let us down!

1366
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,000
Help!

1367
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,200
Hurry, we're coming!

1368
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:12,760
We're going up!

1369
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,840
The lights over there are on.

1370
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,560
This is incredible.

1371
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,240
We feel like a drone up here.

1372
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,720
It's so amazing.

1373
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,400
It's hard to describe this feeling, right?

1374
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,840
Seriously.

1375
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,480
It's awesome.

1376
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,800
It's really awesome.

1377
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,040
There are more and more lights.

1378
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,480
Yeah.

1379
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,440
Let's go one more round.

1380
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,880
Sure, let's do it.

1381
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,800
Let's ride until midnight.

1382
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,680
Are we sleeping up here tonight?

1383
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,640
The church lights are on.

1384
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,400
Really?

1385
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,840
It's stunning.

1386
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,440
It's so beautiful.

1387
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,840
It's really beautiful.

1388
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,960
Not bad.

1389
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,520
Not bad, right?

1390
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Then let's go again.

1391
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,160
No.

1392
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,440
I meant the pants are still okay.

1393
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,240
They're about to get wet though.

1394
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,360
Let's go.

1395
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,320
What's there to be scared of?

1396
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,120
A little.

1397
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,640
A bit nervous.

1398
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,160
Kind of nervous.

1399
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,040
Bro, don't move.

1400
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,720
Bro, stop.

1401
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,040
They should give those two a mic.

1402
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,560
Send a mic up there.

1403
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,000
Put a speaker below so we can hear them.

1404
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,080
Children of the mountains.

1405
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,760
How are you all doing?

1406
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,600
The earth feels so fresh.

1407
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,280
Don't.

1408
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,320
Bro, I'm begging you.

1409
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,040
Quick, can we go back?

1410
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,760
Can you take me back?

1411
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,960
Don't move.

1412
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,960
Move however you want, it's fine.

1413
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,280
Don't.

1414
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,520
Li Naiwen, when I get down, I'm "coming for you."

1415
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,960
When I get down, I'm "coming for you."

1416
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,680
I'm making this my wallpaper.

1417
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,000
This is awesome.

1418
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,840
This one's a wallpaper too.

1419
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,480
That expression.

1420
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,560
That close-up.

1421
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,320
This is so thrilling.

1422
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,520
This view is amazing.

1423
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,760
What do you think?

1424
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,640
It's okay.

1425
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,280
No, it's too beautiful.

1426
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,280
It's just stunning.

1427
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,080
I have to take some photos.

1428
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,120
I don't care anymore.

1429
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm going all out with you today.

1430
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,160
I'm going all out.

1431
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,680
I'm going all out with you.

1432
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,080
Don't move.

1433
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,720
Come here.

1434
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,600
Little hand.

1435
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,640
Little hand, reach in.

1436
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,600
Reach in.

1437
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,280
Take a photo, bro.

1438
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,600
Bro, can you stop messing with me?

1439
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,800
Let me take a picture.

1440
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,040
Bro, I’m begging you.

1441
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,480
Please, bro.

1442
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,440
An’an.

1443
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,360
Sis, did you see that?

1444
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,080
Don’t be afraid of anything you face.

1445
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:19,720
It’s really nothing.

1446
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,320
Look.

1447
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,720
Even though Dad is standing so high now,

1448
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,480
Look down.

1449
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,520
See how brave we are.

1450
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,520
Isn’t it high?

1451
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,160
But we’re all a little scared.

1452
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,880
But we’re not afraid.

1453
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,600
Edit out my earlier slip of the tongue.

1454
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,960
No, look.

1455
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,240
What Uncle did is dangerous.

1456
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,080
Don’t copy that.

1457
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,600
We won’t, we won’t.

1458
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,360
Let’s do one at the church.

1459
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,080
At the church, I might not be able to turn.

1460
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,320
Just turn around.

1461
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,560
Just a quick turn.

1462
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,240
Turn slowly, you’re really sweating.

1463
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,040
I feel sluggish now.

1464
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,040
I need to adjust my steps.

1465
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,880
Hold on.

1466
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:00,920
This is so beautiful.

1467
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,680
Our faces look so squished, bro.

1468
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,000
Let me down, quick.

1469
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,680
Hurry, I can’t take it.

1470
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,960
Comrade Sun Honglei is terrifying.

1471
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,520
Like a bully.

1472
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,680
Spinning nonstop up there.

1473
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,360
I can’t stand it.

1474
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,840
No, let me go now.

1475
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,760
I can’t be in the same basket with him.

1476
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,320
Then you should attack his lower body.

1477
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,120
No, I can’t move.

1478
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,880
My legs are numb.

1479
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,600
He did this to me.

1480
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,920
Who else wants to ride? I’ll go with him.

1481
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,760
Let’s go, bro. Let’s take the plane.

1482
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,560
We’re getting on that plane.

1483
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,640
Is the plane as fun as this?

1484
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,880
It’s way more thrilling than this.

1485
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,840
That one is super fast.

1486
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:36,440
Let’s go.

1487
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,120
This plane flies straight.

1488
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,160
That one goes to Madrid.

1489
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,960
That one is super fast.

1490
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,040
It’s like a centrifuge.

1491
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:42,440
It spins you around.

1492
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:43,800
Go.

1493
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,400
Go.

1494
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:47,920
Were you scared just now?

1495
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,760
I’m really not afraid of heights.

1496
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,200
Do you know the suspension bridge effect?

1497
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,800
The suspension bridge effect means

1498
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,240
when you’re in a slightly dangerous situation,

1499
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,600
you’ll think

1500
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,640
you’ve fallen for the person next to you.

1501
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,080
That’s why couples on dates

1502
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,200
always go to watch horror movies.

1503
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,640
It’s the suspension bridge effect.

1504
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,160
It’s true.

1505
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,760
When you’re scared,

1506
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,160
So just now,

1507
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,920
He Ge must have fallen for Honglei Ge.

1508
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,200
Get on the plane, everyone.

1509
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,080
Is it fast or slow?

1510
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,720
You got on without even knowing.

1511
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,720
Is this a wild ride?

1512
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,200
I want to ask.

1513
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,000
Does it go like this?

1514
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,440
Is it as fast as a centrifuge?

1515
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,080
When it reaches a certain speed,

1516
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,920
it unhooks here and goes straight—

1517
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,560
Yeah, we’ll fly straight to the moon.

1518
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,440
Fly to Madrid.

1519
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,640
Calling the control tower.

1520
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,360
Requesting takeoff.

1521
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:39,880
By the way,

1522
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,240
You played a pilot before.

1523
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,920
Are you ready, everyone?

1524
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,680
There are sound effects too.

1525
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,680
And wind.

1526
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,360
This wind is negative pressure.

1527
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,720
It still feels a bit like a simulation.

1528
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:02,880
Kind of immersive.

1529
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,520
Kind of immersive.

1530
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,280
That moon is so beautiful.

1531
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,560
So pretty.

1532
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,200
I want to fly higher

1533
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,240
Hello everyone, I'm Tang Bohu

1534
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,080
This is so beautiful

1535
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,000
Let's go

1536
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,960
We're getting off the plane

1537
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,520
Gemini, the moon, the Five Fingers Church

1538
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,960
I've combined these three sights of Barcelona

1539
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,320
So beautiful

1540
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,880
It's beautiful

1541
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,360
This light looks amazing when it's on

1542
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,240
Ferris wheel

1543
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,720
Can you get a picture of that?

1544
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,320
The moonlight

1545
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,120
That spot where it shines on the sea

1546
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,280
Really

1547
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,520
You should take a picture of that

1548
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,560
That's truly beautiful

1549
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,800
It looks like that painting

1550
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,760
Amazing

1551
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,560
The bright moon rises over the sea

1552
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,000
Let me say a few words to my daughter

1553
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,080
That's great

1554
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,040
I'll take a picture for you first

1555
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,920
3, 2, 1, go

1556
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,400
Daughter

1557
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:28,880
Hello

1558
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,080
Today I'm in Barcelona, Spain

1559
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,240
On a Ferris wheel

1560
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,240
Saying a few words to you

1561
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,640
You're seven and a half now

1562
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,760
Dad watches you grow day by day

1563
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,200
And day by day

1564
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,040
You become more humorous, witty, cute, and kind

1565
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,800
You're starting to have your own unique personality

1566
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,960
Dad doesn't know what to say to you

1567
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,840
Maybe every day

1568
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,720
All I can tell myself is

1569
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,800
You are your own independent person

1570
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,040
Grow up freely

1571
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,920
Dad is behind you

1572
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,080
Being a wall

1573
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,480
Being a big tree

1574
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,360
Being an umbrella

1575
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,480
Sheltering you from wind and rain

1576
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,000
Grow wild, my daughter

1577
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
You have your own life

1578
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,720
I hope you live more freely than Dad

1579
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,240
Happier than Dad

1580
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,920
More blessed than Dad

1581
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,760
Love you, daughter

1582
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,440
Keep going

1583
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,400
Behind every lit window

1584
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,640
There's a story of its own

1585
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,840
You can only use words during the process.

1586
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,680
No actions allowed.

1587
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,000
But my brother has a concert to do when we get back.

1588
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,720
Yeah.

1589
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Just shouting.

1590
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
Wind.

1591
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,120
There's wind.

1592
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:13,640
Leg.

1593
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:13,960
Mouth.

1594
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,480
Right leg.

1595
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:14,960
Mouth.

1596
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,040
Go lower, down.

1597
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,720
Right leg.

1598
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,000
Three characters.

1599
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,600
Three characters.

1600
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:19,880
Right.

1601
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,400
Three.

1602
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,240
Squat and walk.

1603
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:21,960
What is it?

1604
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,480
Dog?

1605
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,400
Go down.

1606
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,200
Look forward.

1607
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:26,760
Stab.

1608
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,360
Point.

1609
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,840
Poke.

1610
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,320
Hole.

1611
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,360
Who is he?

1612
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:31,920
Is it a man?

1613
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,440
Is he a friend of one of us?

1614
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,920
Is it a three-character artist?

1615
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,360
Is he He Ge's friend?

1616
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:37,920
Just say it.

1617
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,360
Come on, let's ask together.

1618
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,920
Is it Deng Chao?

1619
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,200
This makes us look silly.

1620
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,080
This is so hard.

1621
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,800
Take out the lamb fat.

1622
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,200
After you force it out,

1623
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,120
the soup will be whiter later.

1624
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,920
Liu Yuning.

1625
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,000
How do you sometimes look like a god,

1626
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
and sometimes so down-to-earth?

1627
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,520
How do you make it smell so good?

1628
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,760
It's a total success.

1629
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,600
Smells amazing.

1630
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,240
So fragrant.

1631
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,400
I messed up the last round.

1632
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:07,880
It's fine.

1633
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,720
Because Xingxu is from the musical theater class.

1634
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,080
Are you sure, bro?

1635
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,240
You've definitely heard this song.

1636
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,520
Wait, wait.

1637
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,720
It's not that part yet.

1638
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,080
Cross the bridge.

1639
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,120
Such a long bridge.

1640
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,480
Here it comes.

1641
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,920
Why say goodbye?

1642
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,520
I got it.

1643
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,400
Wait a second.

1644
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,360
Lend me, lend me.

1645
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,720
Lend me a pair of wise eyes.

1646
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,920
He seems to be humming it already.

1647
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,680
What song is this? Let me think.

1648
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,400
You're awesome.

1649
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,280
A long, long time ago.

1650
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,760
Wipe your tears, don't be afraid.

1651
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,800
At least, at least we still have dreams.
