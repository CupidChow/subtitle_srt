1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,759
Okay, let's begin.

2
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,120
Let me explain the rules.

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,640
Among the nine of you,

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,920
two are randomly chosen as impostors,

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,000
and seven are Good Guys.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,720
Good Guys must complete the assigned task

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
to win each round.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,400
The impostors' mission

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,240
is to stop the Good Guys from finishing.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,240
Impostors attack using a specific action.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,000
The person attacked

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,480
is eliminated and must mute immediately.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,360
When the number of Good Guys

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,680
equals the number of impostors present,

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,640
the impostors win.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,840
Each round allows three chances to ring the bell.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,280
After ringing the bell,

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,680
impostors cannot attack.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,320
After each successful attack,

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,520
wait three minutes

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,840
before attacking again.

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,440
Everyone, draw your roles.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,200
Go ahead.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,440
Everyone has drawn their roles.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,200
This round, Good Guys must

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240
eat lychees.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
There are ten task spots in the area

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,400
with lychees placed.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Good Guys must eat at least one lychee

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
and put the lychee seed

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,160
in the empty plate nearby.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,240
When eight plates on the field

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
all have lychee seeds at once,

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,360
the Good Guys complete the task.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,400
But during the process,

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,880
impostors may throw away

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,960
the lychee seeds from plates

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,120
to sabotage the Good Guys' mission.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Alright.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,040
Let's go.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,880
Everyone, head to your starting point.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,960
Let's walk together later.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,680
Let's go.

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,400
Same old rules.

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,120
No matter what,

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,760
let's finish the first task first.

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,040
Yuning,

48
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
your "elimination" move

49
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,520
is to tap both shoulders

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,960
and say "Bye-bye!"

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
See you soon.

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,840
See you soon.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,759
I've decided this time

54
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,759
to team up with someone.

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
How do Good Guys play this?

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,960
This round, I trust no one.

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,320
It's starting.

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll do this task first.

59
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Forget everything else for now.

60
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,520
Just do a task first.

61
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,760
Then go find someone.

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm a Good Guy.

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
Are there lychees here?

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,320
The camera is placed here.

65
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,080
Let's go.

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,120
Want to walk together?

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,800
You go first.

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,720
Let me move this.

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
If the camera points there, something's up.

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,640
What are you two doing?

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,560
That's odd.

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
He moved the action camera.

73
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
Three people together is definitely safe.

74
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Okay.

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,240
Is there one here?

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,360
I didn't look.

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,680
Let's go.

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,120
There wasn't one just now.

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
No physical contact.

80
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,520
Okay.

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
Three people is fine.

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,120
Three people have it.

83
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Can four people do it?

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,800
Yes.

85
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Alright, come on.

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,960
Four people.

87
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,840
Four is best.

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Can't just sit, gotta move.

89
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,880
Why not get someone here?

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,760
I just realized we're connected.

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,000
There's one here.

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
Do you want tea?

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,400
Tea?

94
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,360
No, I'll finish my task first.

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Really?

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,080
He.

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,200
He.

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm watching, it's fine.

99
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Watching, all good.

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,400
Don't worry.

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
If someone's here, it's safe.

102
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
I've figured it out.

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
As long as there are three people,

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
if three are present together,

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,520
it's safe.

106
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,120
Right, it's safe.

107
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Do you two want to come in?

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Let me chat with you for a bit.

109
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Talk about what's on your mind lately.

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Worries and such.

111
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,840
But there's no task spot here.

112
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
No, time will run out soon.

113
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,680
You can't guard it anymore.

114
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,120
Alright.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
You're not coming with me?

116
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm in trouble.

117
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Whoever comes in, something happens.

118
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,680
He won't leave.

119
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,680
Then you go ahead.

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
No way it's still just us.

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,120
Yeah.

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,520
Right?

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,280
Scared me to "death."

124
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,720
I'm telling you, Lin Yi is too sneaky.

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
I found one.

126
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:38,960
Wenzi.

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
Is it in this corner?

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,920
Yes.

129
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Don't "eliminate" me yet.

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,280
Wait, I haven't finished eating.

131
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,960
Bro, I don't have a role.

132
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,120
You go first.

133
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,880
I can go, I'll go.

134
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
Which spot is this?

135
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,640
Spot ten.

136
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,760
Where else is there a task?

137
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,320
There’s so much food here.

138
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,360
Are these all shops?

139
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Afraid with three people?

140
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,120
More than three, no problem.

141
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
More than three is fine.

142
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,760
Then you’re the one with a problem.

143
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,080
Yeah.

144
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,400
Why are you alone?

145
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,120
I’m the problem.

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,080
Why are you alone again?

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,720
Yi Ge.

148
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,200
You again.

149
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
It’s him again.

150
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,840
Careful.

151
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Yuning.

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
Yuning and I are both here.

153
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,640
Help!

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
What? Who?

155
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,880
Just kidding.

156
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
Why joke for no reason?

157
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
I need to find Naiwen.

158
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,400
What are you doing?

159
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,840
I’m just looking for the task spot.

160
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,320
Lin Yi.

161
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
What’s Lin Yi doing?

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
He’s definitely suspicious.

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Me? What?

164
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,440
Who’s the problem?

165
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,880
You two again.

166
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,760
Naiwen can vouch I’m fine.

167
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Lin Yi’s not suspicious.

168
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,000
How long has he been alone?

169
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
Lin Yi’s fine.

170
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,840
Are we missing anyone now?

171
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,520
No.

172
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,000
No, right?

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Where’s Yuwen?

174
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
Is Wen hiding somewhere?

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,760
She’s over there.

176
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,880
Wait, no.

177
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,640
There she is, Yuwen.

178
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,080
Yuwen, why are you alone again?

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
Weren’t we going together?

180
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
No, I need to finish my task.

181
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,400
I have to eat lychee.

182
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
Where did you go to do the task?

183
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,760
Inside there.

184
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
There’s already a lychee seed.

185
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,960
We’re way too competitive this round.

186
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,640
Keep going.

187
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on.

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We’ll stick with her.

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,480
Okay.

190
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,520
Honglei, let’s go.

191
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Don’t go, stick with us.

192
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Don’t go, don’t move.

193
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,200
I’ll stick with you.

194
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,960
What if you “eliminate” me?

195
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,080
If you’re the impostor,

196
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,640
you’ll act alone.

197
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
If not, you’ll stick with us.

198
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,760
I’ll stick with you.

199
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,120
But I’m not.

200
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,840
But I do need to find lychee.

201
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
Let’s look for lychee together.

202
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
She’s got a point.

203
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,200
Or we split into two groups.

204
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
We’ll be a group of three.

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,080
I’ll go with them.

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,640
Don’t go alone.

207
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright.

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Don’t go alone.

209
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Hurry.

210
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Find lychee.

211
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,640
We’re out of time.

212
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,880
My shoelace came undone.

213
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,560
Who?

214
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
If we don’t have enough lychee,

215
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,040
and no one “eliminates” anyone,

216
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,960
then the impostors win.

217
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
If the task isn’t done, impostors win.

218
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Lin Yi.

219
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Someone might throw it away.

220
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,560
What’s Lin Yi doing?

221
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,520
Bro.

222
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,080
What are you doing, Lin Yi?

223
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,560
I just put it in.

224
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,520
Did you just dump it?

225
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
Then I came over.

226
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
You quickly tossed it in the plate.

227
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,840
Don’t rush.

228
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,960
Anyway, we have it now, right?

229
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,400
Yeah.

230
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Good.

231
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,240
Why do you keep wandering off?

232
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
My strategy this round

233
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,000
is to secretly watch people.

234
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,440
Ring the bell.

235
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,200
Ring the bell, let’s go.

236
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,640
Since we have it, let’s go.

237
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
So did we discover

238
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Did we find a “body”?

239
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
Meeting time.

240
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,080
You’re done for.

241
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,320
You’re finished.

242
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,440
In broad daylight.

243
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,280
It’s not me.

244
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,320
Really, it’s not me.

245
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
Sis.

246
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,880
Him.

247
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,640
Him.

248
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
He can’t explain.

249
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,280
If we don’t have enough lychee,

250
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,960
and no one “eliminates” anyone,

251
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,840
then the impostors win.

252
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,440
As long as the task isn’t done,

253
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,760
the impostors win.

254
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Bye-bye!

255
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,400
He acted sneaky.

256
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,080
What’s wrong with you, bro?

257
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,000
You’re scary, Liu Yuning.

258
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
Let my sister go first.

259
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,840
I went into the shop first.

260
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,760
Jun followed right behind me.

261
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,880
Then we went to look for lychees.

262
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
But we couldn't find them at that time.

263
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
Then I heard our big brother.

264
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
After he whistled,

265
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,120
Ning came in.

266
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
I saw it all very clearly.

267
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Honglei.

268
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,120
Think back carefully yourself.

269
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,600
I came in a long time ago.

270
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,640
The whistle was blown later.

271
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,520
Don't try to get votes.

272
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,360
My sister is tied with me.

273
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,400
Because I can't beat you now.

274
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
You're reckless.

275
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
You played this round recklessly.

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm just telling you.

277
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm being wronged!

278
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,160
What I mean is,

279
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
But before that,

280
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
You had a motive to "eliminate."

281
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Because everyone else went that way.

282
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Who went over there?

283
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
Except for the four of us,

284
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,440
the others all went that way.

285
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,640
Me, Xingxu,

286
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
Yuwen, He,

287
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,360
we were always together.

288
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,920
Now we can only say

289
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,640
among you four,

290
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
there's at least one impostor.

291
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
But whether both are there,

292
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,240
it's hard to say.

293
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
No, listen to my analysis.

294
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,000
What's really suspicious is

295
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
he reacted super fast.

296
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,600
He said he was about to ring the bell.

297
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,400
But Honglei was still whistling.

298
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
He'd only whistled a few times.

299
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
And he already wanted to ring the bell.

300
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,280
Let's go.

301
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,880
Ring the bell.

302
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,640
But honestly,

303
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
when someone seems off,

304
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,240
the first thing is to ring the bell.

305
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
Don't explain for him.

306
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,280
I suspect you too.

307
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
Because you walked alone.

308
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
Why me? It's not me.

309
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
So just now,

310
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,000
when big brother got eliminated,

311
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,240
who was alone?

312
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,160
Me.

313
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
Naiwen.

314
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,680
Me.

315
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
A few of us were together.

316
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,480
No chance.

317
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
And those guys were together.

318
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,280
But Junjun and Didi

319
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,240
were always together too.

320
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,760
The only ones missing in between

321
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,320
were Ning and Naiwen.

322
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,800
Cut it out.

323
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,720
You're blaming me to protect Yuning.

324
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm not protecting him.

325
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm just being objective.

326
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
She didn't protect me.

327
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,080
She didn't.

328
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,240
Now all the suspicion

329
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
is on Yuning.

330
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,640
You suddenly bring up someone else.

331
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,760
That makes you very suspicious.

332
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
There are three people total.

333
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,960
These two make sense.

334
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,880
It's simple.

335
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,640
Voted wrong.

336
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,120
One of the two has a problem.

337
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,760
Right.

338
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,680
We can narrow it down.

339
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,120
Okay, vote.

340
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,920
It's fine, vote for me.

341
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,120
Alright, vote for me this round.

342
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,280
Three, two, one.

343
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Please vote.

344
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay, Yuning is eliminated.

345
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
Yuning's role is Impostor.

346
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,560
Why are you covering for him?

347
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Finally made a smart move.

348
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Now I can speak.

349
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,120
I've already cleared your name.

350
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm cutting ties with you.

351
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,880
No.

352
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,360
Goodbye.

353
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,280
I did this at the time.

354
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
Like this.

355
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:02,960
Bye-bye!

356
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,760
I was there.

357
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,520
But actually, he's hard to "eliminate."

358
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,280
Hard to pick the right time.

359
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,360
Everyone, game time is running out.

360
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,280
Time's up.

361
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
Good Guy mission failed.

362
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Good Guys still lose.

363
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
Let's hurry and ring the bell.

364
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
Let's vote Yuwen out.

365
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Bro, how could it be me?

366
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,120
Alright.

367
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Come on.

368
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,960
I also doubt this.

369
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
Ring the bell again, vote Yuwen.

370
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,480
How could it be me?

371
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,120
Go ahead, ring it.

372
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,040
Really?

373
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Ring the bell!

374
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Come back.

375
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,040
Vote.

376
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,080
Vote again.

377
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,280
You can't play like this.

378
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't worry, Ning.

379
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't worry.

380
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
You'll reunite soon.

381
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,120
This isn't fair.

382
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
I've always helped the Good Guys.

383
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,880
I don't care.

384
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,360
Just vote.

385
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,360
Either it's the most amazing round,

386
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,400
and we win super fast,

387
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
or it's a dumb round.

388
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,120
A Good Guy wouldn't say it's unfair.

389
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
A Good Guy would only say

390
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,120
it's okay.

391
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,440
You can vote, I'm fine with it.

392
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
You can't say it's unfair.

393
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,720
Come on.

394
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,280
Vote.

395
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
Vote, come on.

396
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,760
Three, two, one.

397
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,720
Yuwen is eliminated.

398
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,600
It really wasn't me.

399
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,200
Yuwen's role is

400
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,400
Good Guy.

401
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,000
She's a Good Guy.

402
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Yeah.

403
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
That was reckless, huh?

404
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's fine, we have another round.

405
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,760
Wait a second.

406
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120
I know who it is.

407
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,400
Chen He.

408
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Ring the bell.

409
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Don't ring it.

410
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,840
Don't ring it.

411
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,640
Let me explain why I voted Chen He.

412
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,320
First,

413
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,040
I was in Chen He's yard

414
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
and ate a lychee.

415
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
I tossed a lychee seed.

416
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,800
I put it in the plate.

417
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,720
Then I left.

418
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Lin Yi, you know, right?

419
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,800
We left together.

420
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,240
We just split up.

421
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,400
I turned and saw Chen He come out.

422
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,520
I wondered why he came out.

423
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Then I looked back into the yard.

424
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
The seed was gone.

425
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,760
Why didn't you mention this last round?

426
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,880
That's one thing.

427
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,480
Makes sense.

428
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,240
Let me add something.

429
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm a bit confused this round.

430
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,360
And you—

431
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,160
Why did you suddenly break the rhythm

432
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,280
when we just voted someone out?

433
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,160
Take a quick look.

434
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Good Guys have a big chance to win.

435
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
Don't give the impostor any chance.

436
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,400
Hold on.

437
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,040
Let's stay calm.

438
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,160
Finish the task.

439
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Calm down.

440
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,120
You two, stop blaming each other.

441
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,160
He's voting for me.

442
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,600
Wait.

443
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,160
This is so random.

444
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,280
Let's go, let's keep searching.

445
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,840
Let's go.

446
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,040
Didi, you're with them.

447
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,640
Okay.

448
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,560
I'll team up with these two.

449
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,240
Okay.

450
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,280
Go.

451
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,000
The three of us stick together.

452
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,480
Go.

453
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Time's running out.

454
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,880
Not much time, hurry up.

455
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,760
How many have we eaten? How many left?

456
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,760
Just one left.

457
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,360
Only one more to go.

458
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,640
Five minutes left.

459
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,600
One left.

460
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
Go this way, this way.

461
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,520
If any one of us

462
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,240
gets "eliminated,"

463
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
the other must ring the bell right away.

464
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
Nothing here, we've checked everywhere.

465
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,280
Nope, already checked.

466
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,120
We three can't split up.

467
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,520
Okay.

468
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
You really are—

469
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,120
The way you play—

470
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,640
That vibe—

471
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,160
Is it that vibe?

472
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,840
Kind of, kind of.

473
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Right? That's the vibe.

474
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,120
No, I've checked this room.

475
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,280
Check again.

476
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,000
No, it's not that hidden.

477
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,120
Why is there a lychee here?

478
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,400
Wait, there's one here.

479
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,880
There's a bucket.

480
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
The plate is hidden.

481
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah.

482
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,120
This one's been eaten.

483
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:29,880
No.

484
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,040
There's no plate.

485
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,520
The plate is hidden.

486
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
No, this doesn't count.

487
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,720
No plate.

488
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
No, let's go.

489
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,000
No plate, doesn't count.

490
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Check this.

491
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,480
He, don't leave.

492
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Don't give me that look.

493
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,520
What look am I giving?

494
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,640
You really found it.

495
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,640
Bye-bye!

496
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
Bye-bye!

497
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,920
Ring the bell!

498
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,800
The bell's been rung.

499
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Run!

500
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
Hurry, run faster!

501
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
The bell's been rung.

502
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,400
Come quickly.

503
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,480
Come quickly.

504
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
The bell's been rung.

505
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,280
Why are we ringing the bell?

506
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
Darn it, something's up for sure.

507
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
Did anyone throw a seed?

508
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,240
Scared me to "death."

509
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,640
Scared me to "death."

510
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,400
It's like a horror movie.

511
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,280
Old impostor.

512
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,160
Found it.

513
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Found it.

514
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,040
It's Uncle Nai again.

515
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,520
I told you to vote for him.

516
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
You can't talk now.

517
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm not "dead."

518
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,280
So who "died?"

519
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,800
Who "died?"

520
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,520
Jun Jun.

521
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,160
Gong Jun.

522
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
Gong Jun is gone.

523
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
You two are scary.

524
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,760
The last ten minutes,

525
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,000
I was with you two the whole time.

526
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,920
So it's one of you two.

527
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,400
Isn't that obvious?

528
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,920
Three went out, two came back.

529
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,800
Go ahead and make excuses.

530
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,440
Jun Jun, you don't have to talk.

531
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,880
But...

532
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,800
It's fine.

533
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,600
You can give a look.

534
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,240
But I want to hear their defense.

535
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,000
Wait, let me say one thing.

536
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm not emotional.

537
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,760
I'll sit at the door, no reaction.

538
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I'll listen to you.

539
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm just listening to you.

540
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,560
No, which of you split up?

541
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,000
Who was with Jun Jun?

542
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
No one split up.

543
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,920
The three of us watched each other.

544
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
He "eliminated" Jun Jun.

545
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,520
When Jun Jun ate the last one,

546
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,280
He couldn't hold back.

547
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,800
Because the director hinted

548
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Only ten seconds left.

549
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,280
He did this—bye-bye!

550
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,640
See?

551
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,360
Then he looked at me.

552
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,400
That's what he just did.

553
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
That's exactly what he did.

554
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,520
Perfect reenactment.

555
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,880
So scary.

556
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,880
So scary.

557
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,760
The three of us.

558
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,520
Look at us, three little rabbits.

559
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,640
True and fake Monkey King.

560
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
We're three little rabbits.

561
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,520
What about us?

562
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,200
How can we know?

563
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,120
Think again, Lin Yi.

564
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,240
How often are we alone together?

565
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,160
Can't hold back from talking.

566
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,280
I can't hold it in.

567
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,640
Just sit here.

568
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,040
You can enjoy the AC.

569
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,000
Come closer.

570
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,359
It's fine.

571
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,760
It's okay here.

572
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,760
Like I said earlier.

573
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,119
When we split up,

574
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,640
I suddenly realized

575
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
When Chen He appeared before me,

576
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,680
I thought, darn it.

577
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,400
I told the director,

578
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,960
I said,

579
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,160
Maybe the seed is gone.

580
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,480
So I ran over there.

581
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,640
When I got to the yard,

582
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Sure enough, the seed was gone.

583
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
Then I ate one more to make up for it.

584
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
You didn't come with me?

585
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,080
Something happened to me.

586
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Whoever came in, something happened.

587
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,680
He won't leave.

588
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,640
Then you go first.

589
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,640
Throw this away first.

590
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,600
See?

591
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm so "mad" I could die.

592
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,120
I'll eat one more.

593
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,160
Right, I forgot.

594
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,800
In the end, I was full of lychees.

595
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,400
What you just said was great.

596
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,200
But...

597
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,720
You could also drop the seed.

598
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,680
Then say I dropped it.

599
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
And after I went in,

600
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,680
After I came out,

601
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,480
Lots of people went in.

602
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,760
There were many people.

603
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
Then each of us

604
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,920
had time alone.

605
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,480
Including Yu Wen.

606
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
If I were the impostor,

607
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,280
I could have eliminated her.

608
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,880
Right?

609
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,680
Then we were all together.

610
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,640
But only one person

611
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,080
was always on his own.

612
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,680
He Ge did a pretty good job "eliminating".

613
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
He had to "eliminate" me.

614
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,960
Yeah.

615
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,960
Otherwise,

616
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
this round wouldn't mean anything.

617
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,040
It's good, a fight to the finish.

618
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,200
What do you two think?

619
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,880
No opinion.

620
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,720
Really don't know.

621
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,320
Because

622
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,640
we didn't interact.

623
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,880
Not sure if their statements

624
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
Because

625
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,720
are actually

626
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
since I am totally

627
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,880
How did these three survive?

628
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,680
Just guess.

629
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
Go ahead, just guess.

630
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,720
Can you two reenact

631
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,440
how you did it?

632
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,480
Right.

633
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,120
Come on, all three of you together.

634
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
One at a time.

635
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,560
Together.

636
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,480
Otherwise, just watch each other.

637
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,160
Come in.

638
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,160
Jun Jun.

639
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,040
What's up?

640
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,440
What's going on?

641
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,120
Both of you, reenact it.

642
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,080
I said Chen He was here.

643
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,720
I said there's nothing here.

644
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
Just a trash can.

645
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Then Jun Jun said,

646
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,880
What if...

647
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,720
Because there's a big pot lid.

648
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,880
He lifted the lid.

649
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,640
It was really inside.

650
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,400
It was really in there.

651
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
So I came over.

652
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,680
Jun Jun was here at the time.

653
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,960
I looked, and sure enough, it was there.

654
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,920
Jun Jun started peeling.

655
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,240
Then at that moment,

656
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
the impostor was Chen He.

657
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,040
He came over and

658
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,840
Li Naiwen.

659
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,600
Bye-bye!

660
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,720
I turned and ran.

661
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,360
I rang the bell.

662
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,880
Then

663
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,680
He Ge was there.

664
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,640
I rang the bell.

665
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,880
Don't give me that.

666
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,440
You're blaming me for this?

667
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,560
I rang the bell, bro.

668
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,080
Then He Ge was right next to me.

669
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,920
I was holding the mallet, okay?

670
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,840
Alright, He Ge, tell it again.

671
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,160
The three of us entered a room together.

672
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,640
There were some low chairs.

673
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,080
Everyone said they'd searched here.

674
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,600
I said I'd checked this too.

675
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,400
I checked the kitchen.

676
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Took a look.

677
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,960
After looking,

678
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,880
there was a bucket over there.

679
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,600
The one Yu Wen spat into.

680
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,680
The wrong black bucket.

681
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,120
I asked why there's a black bucket.

682
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,640
He pretended and said,

683
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,680
There's a black bucket.

684
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
Maybe there's nothing here.

685
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
There are black buckets everywhere.

686
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,480
He started walking out.

687
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,840
He wanted to lead me away.

688
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,200
Wanted to get me

689
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,840
That place definitely had something.

690
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,400
Right?

691
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
Because there was a black bucket and a plate.

692
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,440
Who knows what's there?

693
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,840
You're so sneaky.

694
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,440
Stop interrupting.

695
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
There's a plate.

696
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,120
Then Jun Jun said to check the pot.

697
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
A big pot lid, for cooking.

698
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,840
Lift it up, and there it is.

699
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,160
His face twitched.

700
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
Then I looked at what you were doing.

701
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,400
Jun Jun was peeling over there.

702
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
Halfway through, he ran over.

703
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,800
Bye-bye!

704
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
Then ran back.

705
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
But I ran a bit faster.

706
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,960
I rang the bell first.

707
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,640
Did He Ge imitate Naiwen Ge,

708
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,920
or did Naiwen Ge imitate He Ge?

709
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,680
So I said you should do it together.

710
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,080
No.

711
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,560
Just watch their expressions.

712
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,440
Who looks more like that?

713
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,360
How would they react?

714
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
Uncle Nai is hard to read.

715
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Uncle Nai has done this too many times.

716
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,680
He fooled us with this trick every time.

717
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,200
He does this every single time.

718
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,440
He's an actor.

719
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,720
Wait a second.

720
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,120
Isn't he?

721
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,560
He is too.

722
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,440
But every time with He Ge,

723
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
I always suspect he's the impostor.

724
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
I always guess wrong.

725
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,200
I've messed up several times.

726
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,120
This season is ending.

727
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,160
You still think he's not the impostor?

728
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,400
I think you're the "Variety God".

729
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,640
So you might get impostor two rounds in a row.

730
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Both times as the old impostor.

731
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,360
Really not.

732
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,600
Alright, you three.

733
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,280
I'll count down, three, two, one.

734
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,640
First instinct.

735
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
Don't think, just go with your instinct.

736
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,880
My instinct.

737
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,440
Go ahead, instinct.

738
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,680
Whatever.

739
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,160
Doesn't matter anymore.

740
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,640
Anyway,

741
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,200
this round is pure guesswork.

742
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,120
Lin Yi.

743
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,160
It's all up to you.

744
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
I'll start voting then.

745
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,160
Go.

746
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Three, two, one.

747
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,320
Please vote.

748
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,000
I vote for He Ge.

749
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,520
Okay.

750
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:00,920
Go.

751
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,720
Uncle Nai is eliminated.

752
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,080
Uncle Nai's role is

753
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,040
Good Guy.

754
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,400
Good Guy.

755
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,120
Congratulations to He Ge for winning.

756
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,880
Lost.

757
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,440
What happened?

758
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,320
Alright.

759
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,760
No chance.

760
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
Bro, please don't be the impostor
next season, okay?

761
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,760
Lucky.

762
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,920
Missed the chance,
second round.

763
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,400
This round for me—

764
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I'm just wondering
where I lost.

765
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Lost because of "luck," right?

766
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,880
Lost because of past things.

767
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,600
The past.

768
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,640
Lost in previous rounds.
