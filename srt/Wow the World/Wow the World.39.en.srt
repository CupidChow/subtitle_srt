1
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,280
In Italy

2
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,760
The Earth Team crossed Sorrento

3
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,600
Swaying lemon trees and the blue coastline

4
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,440
Passing through Catania

5
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,640
Ancient volcanoes and bustling markets

6
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,200
Finally stopping in Syracuse

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Amidst the shadows of a thousand years

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,880
Today

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,120
The Earth Team welcomes

10
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,960
their last day in Italy

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,120
Kiss the Shark

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,640
No

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,720
Kiss the Shark

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,760
Kiss the Shark

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,040
Kiss the Shark

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,160
Kiss the Shark

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
Kiss the Shark

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Kiss the Shark

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
We went back to our rooms

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,040
We even sent Kiss the Shark on WeChat

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
Kiss the Shark

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,360
This morning, when we greeted each other

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,000
it was Kiss the Shark

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,040
Kiss the Shark

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,520
Thank you

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,120
Thanks

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,240
Today, we need to

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
complete two teamwork challenges here

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
to win free time for sightseeing

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,720
Tonight, we'll have hot pot together

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,800
to say goodbye to our Italy trip

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Hot pot

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,040
Is Junjun cooking?

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
He'll cook and send you away again

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,600
If you want to cook

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,120
Go half an hour early

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,760
I'll close all the doors

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,880
You stay inside by yourself

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,640
You can Kiss the Shark inside

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,680
We have two rounds of tasks today

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Let's talk about the first task

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,840
Everyone must be different

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,200
You need to act according to the verb

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
and immediately do the corresponding action

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,520
If anyone does the same action

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,440
those who match lose a point

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
If your action

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,640
doesn't match the word we say

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,880
and can't be explained

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
reasonably

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,040
you also lose a point

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
Based on your scores

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,400
we'll decide the order for drawing travel funds

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,520
So as long as we argue successfully, it's fine

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
This is Wen Ge's segment

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
This rule was made for me

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,480
Wen Ge

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,280
If we can't explain, you go, bro

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
"Li Laiwen"

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,600
Really

62
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,360
"Li Laiwen"

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,000
"Li Laiwen"

64
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,640
Darn it

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,920
"Laiwen Ge"

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,800
"Li Laiwen"

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,200
This sounds a bit like our Hubei dialect

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Li Naiwen

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,200
In Sichuan and Chongqing, it's Li Naiwen

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,240
Li Naiwen

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
There's still a connection with this name

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,240
See, the explanation worked, right?

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
See, that's impressive

74
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,640
Impressive

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Alright

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,640
We won't lose this round

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,560
I have to try harder, come on

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,720
Let's go

79
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,920
A smile over the shoulder

80
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,000
Three

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,080
Two

82
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,800
One

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
You're just like Xingxu

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,320
No, I'm like this

85
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,560
My hand is different

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Different

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,360
Wait a second

88
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,440
These two are special

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,720
They're acting like a drama

90
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Feels super sneaky

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah, I'm doing something sneaky

92
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,079
Suddenly, a charming male guest

93
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,440
called out to me from behind

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
Wow.

95
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,960
You just made eye contact with the male guest.

96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,560
Isn't that...

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
Yeah, I noticed the male guest doing that.

98
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,640
What's this?

99
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you turning back like that in this situation?

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,680
Exactly.

101
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
There's someone behind me, very...

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,080
Someone very short is calling me.

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,600
I can't see like this.

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
So I have to look like this.

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm 1.9 meters tall.

106
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,400
Alright.

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,000
You...

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,440
No, you...

109
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,280
Him and Didi.

110
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Wasn't Didi lying here?

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,120
Lying over here.

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
Just right.

113
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,280
Matched the signal.

114
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,040
I think you all can out-argue me.

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,880
Wen, are you crying, bro?

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Wait for him to make excuses.

117
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,000
Wait for his excuse.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,680
Okay.

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm the senior version.

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
No teeth left.

121
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
Honey.

122
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
Honey.

123
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,480
Where's the turn-back?

124
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
Move slowly.

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,280
Move slowly.

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,880
Honey, wait for me.

127
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,840
Turning back.

128
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,720
Turning back, bro.

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
I'm back.

130
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,440
That's a bit too much arguing.

131
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
We can't really watch this anymore.

132
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,440
Turn back.

133
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,680
Old people's necks aren't flexible.

134
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,360
He has to turn his whole body.

135
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
Honey.

136
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,800
Then turn, go ahead.

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,880
Can't make excuses for that.

138
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,520
Yeah.

139
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,120
Because you...

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,880
You really didn't turn.

141
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
But you turned in your heart, you know?

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,240
Doesn't fit the topic.

143
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,000
Points deducted.

144
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,240
I think this round, it's Naiwen.

145
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,880
It's Naiwen.

146
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,320
Lost.

147
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
Wait, let me check everyone's.

148
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
You are...

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,040
I really turned back.

150
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,360
That's how you turn back.

151
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
You're just lowering your head.

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
In what situation would you smile at someone like that?

153
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,040
Wait a second.

154
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,880
I know both of you are acting a bit off today.

155
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Look at what you're wearing.

156
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
Matching father-son outfits.

157
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,280
My dad.

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,160
This is the student surpassing the master.

159
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,560
I'll definitely help you turn things around.

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,200
You have to help me.

161
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,720
Return.

162
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Because if you put the head at the bottom,

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,120
it looks like the character "hui" (return).

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
That's a bit of a stretch.

165
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,760
Deduct points.

166
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,240
This deserves a deduction.

167
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,640
Alright.

168
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
Heart gesture.

169
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Three, two, one.

170
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,040
Go.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,040
You compete with me.

172
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,640
What am I competing with you for?

173
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,400
Switch hands.

174
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Switch hands.

175
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,480
Aren't we supposed to be different?

176
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,800
Compete with me.

177
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll compete with you.

178
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,480
Then wouldn't it be the same?

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,680
Xingxu.

180
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,120
You're saying one thing and doing another.

181
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,840
Wholeheartedly.

182
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,320
Heart tip.

183
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,520
You don't get it.

184
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320
None of you understand me.

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
This is a pen.

186
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,720
This is a heart.

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
Pen tip.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
What? What does that mean?

189
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,120
This is a pen.

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,160
This is a heart.

191
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Pen tip.

192
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,920
Impressive.

193
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,960
If you really

194
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
came up with that in three seconds,

195
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,000
you're amazing.

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,640
Xingxu, no problem.

197
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,920
What is Junjun doing?

198
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
Is half a heart not okay?

199
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
It's like this.

200
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,920
That's my thought process.

201
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,440
I'll help you.

202
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,880
Let me quickly think it through for you.

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,040
This gesture of yours

204
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
is just you greeting someone.

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,880
Gong Jun's daily routine.

206
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,720
With some really close friends,

207
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
Junjun likes to greet people

208
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,360
in a unique way.

209
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
His greetings are always

210
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,080
You could explain it like this.

211
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,640
Actually, look,

212
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,280
from now on, Junjun will greet people

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,440
Naiwen ge.

214
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,520
No.

215
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Naiwen ge.

216
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,039
Naiwen ge.

217
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,919
Super fresh.

218
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
Shark.

219
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
No way.

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Everyone will think I'm an idiot.

221
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,960
If you don't want to lose points on this,

222
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
you have to actually agree.

223
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,240
So from now on,

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,720
for example, when you see fans,

225
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,360
Hello.

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,920
When you enter a shop and someone says hello,

227
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,440
you do it too.

228
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,200
Sir.

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
Your steak is here.

230
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
You guys are really too much.

231
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,240
That's good.

232
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,040
How much is this?

233
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Fifty euros, make it cheaper.

234
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Deduct points.

235
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
That's a deduction.

236
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,160
I look like an idiot.

237
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,880
If it doesn't work, we'll go with you later.

238
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,840
As long as there's a camera,

239
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,880
we'll each walk over one by one.

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
Everyone does it once.

241
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
If we're playing like this,

242
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,880
then those two shouldn't lose points either.

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,280
You guys.

244
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,960
If we're playing like this,

245
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,360
You have to do it for me later too.

246
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,040
I can do that.

247
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,920
No.

248
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,840
No, I should still get a deduction.

249
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,240
I think Honglei

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
Honglei should lose a point

251
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,880
Minus one point

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
Why?

253
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
How about this

254
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,680
Bro, you don't have to lose a point

255
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,720
How about this

256
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,360
Bro, you don't have to lose a point

257
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
We can walk together later

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,480
Just look for the camera leaks

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,280
You do this

260
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,920
I'll do this

261
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,480
Is that okay?

262
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,720
Okay

263
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
You can too

264
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,080
So Honglei and Junjun

265
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
No points deducted this round

266
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,240
But if someone calls your name on the street

267
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,920
You have to do the move

268
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Alright

269
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,080
I think that's fine

270
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,720
Is that okay?

271
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
No points deducted

272
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,480
Scroll your phone

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,920
Three, two, one

274
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
We're doing the same thing

275
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,880
Why did you kick me?

276
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,960
You hit my nerve

277
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,640
We're the same, why kick me?

278
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,920
It's fine, stop scrolling your phone

279
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,600
Darn it, Junjun and I

280
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Either we don't lose points

281
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,040
Or we do this move

282
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,520
Today, you have to play with your phone like this

283
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,360
No

284
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,120
If you add up the moves

285
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,360
Then you have to do two

286
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,120
For example, Junjun

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,480
You have to do both moves

288
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm telling you, Junjun, if you keep losing

289
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,440
You'll end up doing a whole routine after this round

290
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,360
I'll just lose one point

291
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,320
I'm not doing this one

292
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,120
You do this

293
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Yuning, where's your phone?

294
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm using a brush to clean my phone

295
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Isn't it obvious?

296
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Just brush it

297
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,600
It's too dirty, there's oil on my face

298
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Check out this phone

299
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Act cute

300
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,560
Three

301
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,840
Two

302
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,480
One

303
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
You two

304
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,960
You both are hitting others at the same time

305
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,520
That's so synchronized

306
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,200
How about this

307
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
Everyone, act cute and show us

308
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
That's not it

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,200
It's so obvious

310
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,080
And also

311
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,120
That's not cute enough

312
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,840
He's really cute

313
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
His butt is sticking out

314
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,680
That's still not cute?

315
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Mine is the most standard answer

316
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,560
He's already like that, and it's still not cute?

317
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,920
He's both cute and sassy

318
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,960
Give Yuning the point

319
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
Here comes the boxer

320
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,640
Are you trying to knock them out?

321
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,880
Little fists pounding your chest

322
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
You're so annoying

323
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,840
Xingxu

324
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,480
What are you doing?

325
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,160
Xingxu is riding the subway

326
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,800
Line 3 is so crowded

327
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,640
That's how it is

328
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,560
Isn't that a gorilla?

329
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,640
Exactly.

330
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Right?

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,280
Your move is really good.

332
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,360
Xingxu.

333
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
That's great.

334
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,400
Do it again.

335
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,640
Join us.

336
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,000
I think he belongs on our team.

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,200
They're pulling in whoever they can now.

338
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,920
This way, as a group, it feels

339
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
like it's not so awkward anymore.

340
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,440
Save the points.

341
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
Yeah, save the points.

342
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Risking my life for you guys.

343
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,840
Alright.

344
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,920
Risking my life for you guys.

345
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,640
Just the four of us.

346
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,560
When we go out later,

347
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,160
How do all four of us do it together?

348
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,720
Come on.

349
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,360
Three, two, one.

350
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,640
So cool.

351
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,120
So cool.

352
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,520
So cool.

353
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,280
When a group does it,

354
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
it feels a bit more harmonious.

355
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,880
Much more harmonious, not so weird anymore.

356
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
Throwing hidden weapons.

357
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,280
Three.

358
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,520
Two.

359
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,560
One.

360
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
He Ge hit my hidden weapon right on target.

361
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,680
He got me.

362
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,560
Let's check Yuning first.

363
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
You two are exactly the same.

364
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm a human weapon.

365
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
The most powerful hidden weapon.

366
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Like a cannon-type weapon.

367
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,360
Human cannon.

368
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,680
Mine obviously looks like spitting.

369
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,920
Yours looks like you're holding it in your mouth.

370
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,440
Mine...

371
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,160
The two of them just do this move.

372
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
Just do this move today.

373
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,800
Liu Yuning.

374
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,000
Liu Yuning.

375
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Alright, I'll do this one.

376
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Are you sure?

377
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm sure.

378
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,920
How about this instead?

379
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,800
If you guys want to do this,

380
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,000
You two need to coordinate.

381
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay, let's go.

382
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,320
Handsome guy.

383
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,680
Liu Yuning.

384
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
Two alpacas.

385
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Mushroom.

386
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,040
Three.

387
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,280
Two.

388
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,480
One.

389
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,680
What is that?

390
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Enoki mushroom, what?

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,680
That's my aunt.

392
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,000
Say it again.

393
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,440
Aunt.

394
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,480
Aunt.

395
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,160
Yeah, I'm his aunt.

396
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,800
Then why is it a mushroom?

397
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,560
She's a very magical aunt.

398
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,520
Aunt.

399
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,760
This aunt is great.

400
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
Has anyone not lost points yet?

401
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,640
Me.

402
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,640
That's too much.

403
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,840
We have to drag him in.

404
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,040
Shower.

405
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,800
Three.

406
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,920
Two.

407
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,000
One.

408
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
How is that possible?

409
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
You two have no shame.

410
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,400
No shame.

411
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Come on, you three shower heads.

412
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
You guys explain yourselves.

413
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
I showered happily.

414
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,280
I feel good.

415
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,360
Our interpretation is the same as He Ge's.

416
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,840
Yeah, exactly the same.

417
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,760
Right, exactly the same.

418
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,560
Nothing we can do.

419
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,000
We have no idea what's going on.

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Just surprisingly in sync.

421
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
He Ge has to do it.

422
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,240
I'll do it.

423
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,760
I'll do it.

424
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,000
Chen He.

425
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,160
Walk from the start to the end of the alley.

426
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Xingxu.

427
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,160
It's always like this in that little alley.

428
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,119
Next up,

429
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,240
we have a challenge that requires everyone to agree.

430
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,960
If we pass, we can set off.

431
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,720
Okay.

432
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Let's do it.

433
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,119
In the Earth Family,

434
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,800
who has the best singing voice?

435
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,319
Socks.

436
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,359
That's a lie.

437
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,280
So expressive.

438
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,240
It's pouring rain.

439
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,920
I think...

440
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
A heavenly voice.

441
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,079
So sentimental.

442
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,560
Three, two, one.

443
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,440
Liu Yuning.

444
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,160
Gong Jun.

445
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Gong Jun.

446
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,440
I picked Gong Jun.

447
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,480
I picked Gong Jun.

448
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,840
You two are thinking too abstractly, right?

449
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I want to Kiss the Shark now.

450
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
Isn't that good enough?

451
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,560
Yeah.

452
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,760
We've been talking about Kiss the Shark.

453
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,040
He's the only one who released a song on this show.

454
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
Kiss the Shark.

455
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,440
Gong Jun, the nightingale.

456
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,840
Let's go.

457
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
In the Earth Family,

458
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,120
who understands the rules the least?

459
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,320
Definitely didn't get it.

460
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,600
Can you explain it to us?

461
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Why?

462
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,240
What is it?

463
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
What are you talking about?

464
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,920
Three, two, one.

465
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Bro.

466
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,440
You...

467
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,160
Three votes for Li Naiwen.

468
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Four votes for Honglei.

469
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,080
Why do I have one less vote than him?

470
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,480
You two are competing for who understands the rules less.

471
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,640
He lost.

472
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm a bit unconvinced.

473
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,000
Bro, this is about who doesn't get the rules.

474
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Not about who's handsome.

475
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,600
So he didn't get it.

476
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,320
Still doesn't get it.

477
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Auntie's right.

478
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,880
What's Chen He's signature move on the show?

479
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,320
Burping.

480
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,200
Burping.

481
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,320
Is that really a signature move?

482
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
I didn't even know that was a signature move.

483
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,520
Who have I ever defeated with my signature move?

484
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,480
You've defeated lots of mussels.

485
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,440
You've defeated lots of mussels.

486
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Around Naples,

487
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
there are no mussels left in Sicily.

488
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,400
Next question.

489
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,840
Next question.

490
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Who's the sexiest man in the Earth Family?

491
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
Uh...

492
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,200
Wait a second.

493
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,480
Let's hold off on this one.

494
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,160
I really don't want to lose this one.

495
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,880
Honestly,

496
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,080
Yeah.

497
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,640
Come on.

498
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,760
Want to campaign for votes?

499
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Are you trying to get votes? Is that it?

500
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
We guys won't answer this question.

501
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,640
Let the two girls answer.

502
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,440
Is that okay?

503
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,760
Just go for it.

504
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Go ahead.

505
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,640
Talking about this, I really don't want to lose.

506
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,240
To be honest,

507
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,520
Let's see if we can get along in the future.

508
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
You're putting pressure on me, bro.

509
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,280
Eleven years.

510
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Over ten years.

511
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,400
But Naiwen,

512
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,000
Can you sit down, please?

513
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,520
No.

514
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
I think Naiwen is really charming.

515
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,000
I also think Naiwen is sexy.

516
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,160
He's "Uncle Material" now.

517
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
He, your sexy points are...

518
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,520
There are too many.

519
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,120
I think the sexiest person here

520
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,640
is He.

521
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,440
If you talk about personality,

522
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,480
Or by touch,

523
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
Touch.

524
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,440
I think it's Xingxu.

525
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,840
Covering that hole.

526
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,480
The hole in the clothes.

527
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
I've always been...

528
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,360
Hot hands.

529
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,480
This is so hard.

530
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,760
Three.

531
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,840
Two.

532
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,080
One.

533
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,680
Chen He.

534
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,080
He.

535
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
Give me a high five!

536
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Awesome!

537
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,760
Seriously.

538
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,520
His dance moves.

539
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,160
His dance moves are really sexy.

540
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,960
Really sexy.

541
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I really think

542
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,320
He is just inexplicably sexy.

543
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,760
Yeah.

544
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,520
The sexiest man on Earth.

545
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
In Italy, if you all leave,

546
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
I'll film for three more days.

547
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,080
Just leave one director and one cameraman.

548
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,680
That's enough.

549
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,400
Next, we can go shopping.

550
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,640
Everyone can come

551
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
and draw shopping money.

552
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,680
How much is it?

553
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,640
It's all up to luck.

554
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,720
Come on, let's do it.

555
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Ten.

556
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,280
One hundred.

557
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
That's pretty good, auntie.

558
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,480
Thirty.

559
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
I can already tell it's ten.

560
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,920
I got ten.

561
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,960
You got fifty, bro.

562
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,160
Pick one for me.

563
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,040
Pick one for me, little bro.

564
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,680
Just give me any.

565
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Okay.

566
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,800
Xingxu is such a good guy, he figured it out.

567
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,360
He gave this one to you.

568
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,200
You're so nice, little bro.

569
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,080
He figured it out.

570
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,120
I'm the richest now.

571
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,760
Auntie.

572
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Xingxu is just acting like he's coaxing a kid.

573
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,440
After he picked it,

574
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,080
he gave the one with the most money to Junjun.

575
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,320
Here, little brother, I'll give you ten.

576
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,200
Thank you.

577
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
Are you giving it to me, Didi?

578
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Just kidding.

579
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,360
Thanks over here too.

580
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,240
It's not for me.

581
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,880
Who will do a move for me?

582
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,960
I'll give a hundred.

583
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,080
What do you take us for?

584
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,920
Yeah.

585
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,920
Come here, no.

586
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,520
Listen to me.

587
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,440
I'll do one.

588
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,600
I'll do it, I'll do it.

589
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,480
I'll do it.

590
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,280
Let me.

591
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,200
Let me do it.

592
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,240
I want to do one.

593
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,080
Let me do one.

594
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,880
You do one first.

595
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,240
Gong Jun, I think this—

596
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,280
It's kind of insulting to our Earth Team members.

597
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Just give it to me.

598
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,240
Giving it to any of the brothers is an insult.

599
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,800
You're insulting me.

600
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
Let's get closer.

601
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
We're from the same property company.

602
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,600
Did you forget?

603
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,120
Gong Jun.

604
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
We're both "lemon essence."

605
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,160
How about I help you do one, really.

606
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm so happy right now.

607
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,600
I think he—

608
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,080
It's an insult to give it to any brother.

609
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,160
You can't insult the brothers.

610
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,760
Wait a second.

611
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,440
You need to be sensible.

612
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,000
Gong Jun, I only want fifty.

613
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,520
Okay, Gu.

614
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,080
I just want half.

615
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,480
Gu is generous.

616
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,240
No, my move.

617
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,600
My move is worth a hundred.

618
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,200
How come you—

619
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,080
You're worth a hundred?

620
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,760
Of course I'm worth a hundred.

621
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,360
You're too expensive.

622
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,800
Sit down.

623
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,720
Okay.

624
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,680
You have to know your own worth.

625
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,080
Your value outside depends on yourself.

626
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,960
Thirty, will you do it?

627
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
If not, forget it.

628
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,680
I'll do it.

629
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
I'll do it too, then.

630
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
I'll do it for twenty.

631
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,720
Fifteen, I'll do it for fifteen.

632
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,480
Alright.

633
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,560
Stop fighting, ten.

634
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
I'll take it now.

635
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,240
I never expected this.

636
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,880
I thought we'd all get along.

637
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,440
Who hasn't done a move yet?

638
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,960
I haven't.

639
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Only you haven't.

640
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,800
Me neither.

641
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,920
You two haven't.

642
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,000
Gong Jun, I haven't either.

643
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Me neither.

644
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,000
So this—

645
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,320
This money is hard to split.

646
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,200
So cute.

647
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Then—

648
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
Then it's not enough.

649
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,680
You three split a hundred.

650
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,080
Yes.

651
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,760
Later, come with me.

652
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,880
We'll split it evenly.

653
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,160
What are you looking for?

654
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,400
Yeah, that's right.

655
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
You two can split it perfectly.

656
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,320
Little brother, later—

657
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,400
Come with me.

658
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,000
We'll split it evenly.

659
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,480
I'll go with you.

660
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,800
Don't I have to do it too?

661
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,760
Put the money here, I'll keep it for you.

662
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,680
No way.

663
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,880
No money left.

664
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,360
This kid is so funny.

665
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
Let's go.

666
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,480
We're off!

667
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm coming.

668
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,840
Alright.

669
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,640
Help me take a photo.

670
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,240
Tilt it a bit, just a bit.

671
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,280
Get that view in.

672
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,000
Lift it up a little.

673
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,520
Hold it vertically like this.

674
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,120
Like this.

675
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
So, how did I do taking your photo?

676
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,280
It's mostly because I look good.

677
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,840
Excuse me,

678
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,440
Let me take your photo.

679
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,440
This looks so cool.

680
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,040
Nice, very nice.

681
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,040
This has a "boss on the street" vibe.

682
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,040
Looks good.

683
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,160
Of course.

684
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,120
We're here.

685
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,800
Let's go.

686
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,080
I have ten yuan.

687
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,000
It's with you.

688
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
Why should I keep it?

689
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
Aren't you buying anything?

690
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
What can I buy with ten yuan?

691
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll give it to you.

692
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,880
I have some.

693
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,440
Together, we have enough.

694
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,040
No problem.

695
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Liu Yuning.

696
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,160
Liu Yuning.

697
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,120
His name is Liu Yuning.

698
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,720
Go ahead.

699
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
No one's calling our names.

700
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,760
Yeah, that's great.

701
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,400
It's safe.

702
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,120
Stay away from them.

703
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,800
You escaped, right?

704
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Haven't we been here before?

705
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,760
Yes.

706
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,080
Yesterday.

707
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,520
It was yesterday, right?

708
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,560
Wang Yuwen.

709
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Ouyang Didi.

710
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,640
Ouyang Didi.

711
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:37,840
Wang Yuwen.

712
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,400
Ouyang Didi.

713
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,120
Wang Yuwen.

714
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,520
Auntie.

715
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,280
Auntie.

716
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,360
Bro, they didn't call you, right?

717
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,440
Naiwen bro.

718
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,320
Naiwen bro is so handsome.

719
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,680
Naiwen bro is so handsome.

720
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,760
Naiwen bro is really handsome.

721
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,000
Naiwen bro.

722
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,080
Naiwen bro.

723
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,360
This group is so wild.

724
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,320
It's something we all do together.

725
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,040
Then it's not so awkward.

726
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,160
Right.

727
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,000
What's this?

728
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,240
That's the pistachio one.

729
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,040
Want to try it?

730
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,680
Want to try it, bro?

731
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,520
I'll treat you.

732
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,960
Do you girls want to try it?

733
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,560
You wanted this yesterday.

734
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,320
I think...

735
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Let's just get a small piece.

736
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,880
We each try a bit, that's enough.

737
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,520
Sorry, sir.

738
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,960
One piece of this.

739
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,800
Yes, this one.

740
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,840
I'll pay.

741
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,360
I'll pay first.

742
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,800
I'll pay first.

743
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,960
Naiwen bro has no money, I'll pay.

744
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,880
I have money.

745
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,600
Why not?

746
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,880
Naiwen bro has no money.

747
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,400
Ten yuan.

748
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,160
Naiwen bro.

749
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,720
I think this might taste good.

750
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,920
Want a bag, bro?

751
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,560
Let's get a bag of this.

752
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,000
Get a bag.

753
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,240
Yes.

754
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,800
One portion.

755
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,520
I'll do it.

756
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,320
You go in.

757
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,440
Gong Jun is so handsome.

758
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,760
Achieve great things.

759
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,960
Achieve great things.

760
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
Bro is really hyped.

761
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,080
Bro.

762
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,360
This is what we saw at the airport.

763
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,080
Their famous sauce here.

764
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,040
Do you want to buy it?

765
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,160
What's it called again?

766
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,480
This is pistachio sauce.

767
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,160
Let's get two boxes.

768
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,880
What's this?

769
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,280
This is so cute.

770
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,960
Show it to Didi.

771
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,920
Didi.

772
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,000
So cute.

773
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,040
Don't you want to try it?

774
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,320
Come on.

775
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,080
Take a bite.

776
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Is it tasty?

777
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
It's really delicious.

778
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,360
Bro, I'll give you a box.

779
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,800
No need.

780
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,320
You take it.

781
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,720
It's fine.

782
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,200
Take it.

783
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,680
Really, it's okay.

784
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,120
Here you go.

785
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,800
Give it to your wife.

786
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,240
Alright.

787
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,760
Thanks.

788
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,240
So many fish.

789
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,200
I think this one is...

790
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,840
This one is just right.

791
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,440
Flip it over and check the price.

792
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,040
It's written on it.

793
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
Thirty-three, thirty-five.

794
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
They're all expensive.

795
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,760
I always think these are especially beautiful.

796
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,480
So pretty.

797
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,160
Can I take a quick photo?

798
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,800
I want to take one too.

799
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,280
Ning-ge.

800
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,440
Stand inside.

801
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,320
Go, I'll take a photo for you.

802
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
Take a picture.

803
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,760
Hold on.

804
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,600
I'll record a video for you.

805
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,240
Okay, sure.

806
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:49,800
Come down.

807
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,840
I think your legs should show.

808
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,960
Alright, got it.

809
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,080
If you don't show your legs, it's cut off halfway.

810
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,920
Three, two, one, you can move now.

811
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,440
Take three steps back.

812
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,520
Turn around.

813
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,640
Come, walk over here.

814
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240
One more step.

815
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,200
Alright, strike a pose.

816
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,000
Great, very nice.

817
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,120
Zoom out for a wider shot.

818
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,160
What's this?

819
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,840
That's awesome.

820
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
Low or high angle works.

821
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,720
Come back, yeah.

822
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,160
What a legendary guy.

823
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
You actually said the same thing.

824
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,280
Sorry.

825
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,720
I don't know anything else.

826
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
His emotional value...

827
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,600
That's all I can offer.

828
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,440
Let's go.

829
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,640
Move a bit closer to the left wall.

830
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,600
Come, move this way a bit.

831
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,400
That's good.

832
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,760
That's enough.

833
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,320
Over four hundred shots already.

834
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,080
Got it.

835
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,240
Let's head out.

836
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,680
Honglei-ge is so handsome, Honglei-ge!

837
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,880
Honglei-ge is really handsome.

838
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,400
Honglei-ge.

839
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,320
He's so cooperative today.

840
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
A bet's a bet.

841
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,040
Jun-ge was by that...

842
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,720
Wang Yuwen.

843
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,760
Wang Yuwen.

844
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,520
Wang Yuwen.

845
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,360
Honglei-ge.

846
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,840
Naiwen-ge.

847
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,840
Naiwen-ge.

848
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,480
Didi.

849
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,440
Look.

850
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,400
Sis, what's up?

851
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,600
So pretty, Didi.

852
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Wen-jie, look, this one's beautiful too.

853
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,240
Wen-jie.

854
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
Let's shoot by the seaside.

855
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,760
Kiss the Shark music video.

856
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,480
Kiss the Shark.

857
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,240
You threw me off, that's not how it goes.

858
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,280
It's Kiss the Shark.

859
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,440
Kiss the Shark.

860
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,680
So beautiful.

861
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,080
I like this one.

862
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,200
This looks like...

863
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,840
the Sanxingdui masks.

864
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
Let's look inside.

865
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,600
This ornament is so pretty.

866
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,720
This bowl actually looks pretty nice.

867
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,160
This one looks good too.

868
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
I actually want to buy this cup.

869
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,080
This is quite pretty.

870
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,240
This cup is so cute.

871
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,000
This plate looks nice too.

872
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,040
I really like this.

873
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,280
What is this?

874
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,400
This is good too.

875
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,880
It still can't withstand the test of time.

876
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,440
Pick one that can last over time.

877
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,720
I think the fridge magnet is too light.

878
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,240
This bag isn't big enough.

879
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,360
It has to be practical and look good.

880
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,520
This teapot is so unique.

881
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,880
I think this is something special.

882
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,800
It can be kept for a long time.

883
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,040
Tea or coffee?

884
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,600
Water.

885
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Let me show you.

886
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,400
Great!

887
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,760
Okay.

888
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,840
Do you need me to wrap it for you?

889
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,120
Yes, please wrap it.

890
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,880
Fried seafood.

891
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,520
Do you want to eat?

892
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,480
Do you guys want to eat?

893
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,200
Let's not eat.

894
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,440
I'll take some photos first.

895
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,960
Let's buy it. We'll buy it.

896
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,320
Let me speak.

897
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,800
We want to buy.

898
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,560
Hello.

899
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,720
This is a postcard.

900
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,800
Let's take a walk by the seaside.

901
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,320
You go ahead.

902
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,520
I'll check next door and take a look here.

903
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,200
Okay, go have a look around.

904
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,880
I'll wait.

905
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,640
Hello.

906
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,360
Hello.

907
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,120
Where are you from?

908
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,840
China.

909
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,200
We're from Palermo.

910
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,720
Palermo.

911
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,240
It's in Italy, right?

912
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,080
Do you like it?

913
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,760
Yes, we really like it here.

914
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,080
Sicily.

915
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,960
We love this place.

916
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,120
Love it a lot.

917
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,040
Yes, thank you.

918
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
Is this your first time here?

919
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,639
No.

920
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,880
It's the second time.

921
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,600
Would you take off your sunglasses so we can see your face?

922
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,719
Sure.

923
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,320
Applause.

924
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,360
Thank you.

925
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,400
His name is Gong Jun.

926
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,040
Gong Jun.

927
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,480
You can call him that.

928
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,159
He'll do it like this.

929
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,600
Repeat after me: Gong Jun.

930
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,760
Gong Jun.

931
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,639
Wang Yuwen.

932
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,000
Gong Jun.

933
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,920
Thank you.

934
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,080
You used to play this?

935
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,080
One more time, Gong Jun.

936
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,920
Gong Jun.

937
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,239
Thank you.

938
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,120
You're beautiful.

939
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,840
Thank you.

940
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,440
You're pretty too.

941
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,120
Thank you.

942
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,159
Say it in Sicilian.

943
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,320
Handsome.

944
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,880
Handsome.

945
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,240
What does it mean?

946
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
I don't know, maybe it means handsome.

947
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,040
It means handsome, right?

948
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,000
In Sicilian.

949
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,840
They say it's handsome.

950
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,280
Beautiful.

951
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,200
Handsome and beautiful.

952
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,360
Okay.

953
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,520
Okay.

954
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,680
Thank you, sir.

955
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,360
Thank you.

956
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,120
Thank you so much.

957
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,840
It looks delicious.

958
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,680
Thanks.

959
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,400
Bye.

960
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:43,880
Bye.

961
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,280
Bye.

962
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Thank you.

963
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,720
We can sit over there.

964
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,840
I think that spot is beautiful.

965
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,240
These calamari rings are great.

966
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,560
So beautiful.

967
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,120
So pretty.

968
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,360
This feels so nice.

969
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,800
The water is so clear.

970
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,360
Stand there.

971
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,960
Let me take a photo of you.

972
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,000
Take a look at this vibe.

973
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,560
Bro, look at this.

974
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,480
It's amazing.

975
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,320
You—

976
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,280
It's just—

977
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,520
Let me—

978
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,240
This is so photogenic.

979
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,280
Bro, come on, it's your turn.

980
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,240
Me?

981
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,920
This is the "God of Uncles."

982
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,240
"Charming Uncle."

983
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,800
"Charming Uncle" Li Naiwen.

984
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,800
It's just so hot!

985
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,080
So beautiful.

986
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,160
Alright, let's go.

987
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,760
Let's take one.

988
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,880
Let's take a photo.

989
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Let's take a group photo.

990
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,240
Come on.

991
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,080
Here, you go first.

992
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Show its head.

993
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,280
Come closer, bro.

994
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,240
Kiss the Shark.

995
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,480
Shark.

996
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,240
I have to do this.

997
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,160
I need to take a photo.

998
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,720
Are you filming me?

999
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,080
Yeah.

1000
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,680
Okay.

1001
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,800
It's so beautiful.

1002
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,920
You really have to see this

1003
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,800
color with your own eyes.

1004
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,120
Beautiful.

1005
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,960
Of course.

1006
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,160
Let's sit for a bit.

1007
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm going to buy something, bro.

1008
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
It's really gorgeous.

1009
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,560
So pretty.

1010
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,680
Look at that person in a wedding dress.

1011
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
I see them.

1012
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,160
So beautiful.

1013
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,360
So beautiful.

1014
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,160
Sitting here makes you feel

1015
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,400
I don't want this show to end.

1016
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I'm so happy.

1017
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,680
I can't really describe how I feel, bro.

1018
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,040
Why?

1019
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,560
It's so relaxing.

1020
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,000
I don't know.

1021
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,240
I mean,

1022
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,000
I was really nervous about joining the show.

1023
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,240
Whether it's traveling or anything else,

1024
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,880
I rarely joined before.

1025
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,400
I didn't know how to get along with everyone.

1026
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,480
I was afraid people wouldn't like me.

1027
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,800
And then,

1028
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,320
At first, I also said

1029
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,880
I'd try my best to fit in.

1030
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
But there was this feeling—

1031
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,160
Sometimes maybe

1032
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,680
I tried too hard to fit in.

1033
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,600
Because I didn't want

1034
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,960
people to think I was boring

1035
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,800
or something like that.

1036
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,320
But actually,

1037
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,920
even though it's only been a few days,

1038
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,200
gradually,

1039
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,080
I feel like

1040
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,520
it's like we're all family.

1041
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:48,680
Yeah.

1042
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,160
Traveling together as family.

1043
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,600
I understand.

1044
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,560
And we've come to such a wonderful place.

1045
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,400
Yesterday I told Honglei,

1046
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,280
I said,

1047
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,160
if I come here again next time,

1048
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,000
I might already have kids.

1049
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,560
Really.

1050
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,200
It's hard to say if you'll ever come again.

1051
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,280
To a place like this.

1052
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,360
Honestly, this place—

1053
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,240
if it weren't for filming the show,

1054
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,480
we probably

1055
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,720
wouldn't travel this far.

1056
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,280
And now we're sitting here,

1057
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,160
Yeah.

1058
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,120
It's really nice, isn't it?

1059
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,560
You said you worry

1060
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
about getting along with others.

1061
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,160
I used to be the same.

1062
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,440
When I first filmed "iPartment,"

1063
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,160
I've never been an outgoing person.

1064
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,680
I didn't know how to be on a show.

1065
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,840
I didn't know how to talk to people.

1066
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,840
I remember my very first time,

1067
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,920
the first time I went on He Lao Shi's show,

1068
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,760
which was "Happy Camp."

1069
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,160
All I could think was,

1070
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,720
please,

1071
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,720
please,

1072
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,480
don't mention me,

1073
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,400
don't talk to me.

1074
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,560
I was exactly the same.

1075
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,080
I felt the only thing I could do was

1076
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,480
"Please introduce yourself."

1077
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,120
I said, "Hello everyone,"

1078
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,720
"I'm Chen He."

1079
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
Exactly the same.

1080
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,640
That's it.

1081
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,280
Then I didn't know what else to say.

1082
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,520
Then He Lao Shi said, "That's all?"

1083
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,640
I said, "That's all."

1084
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,880
I said, "Really, that's all."

1085
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,280
That's how we all started.

1086
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,240
Maybe Lao Deng is a bit more outgoing.

1087
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,240
But the rest of us aren't really like that.

1088
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,160
We all support each other.

1089
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,760
We give each other energy.

1090
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,680
I think

1091
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
maybe now, as you said,

1092
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,720
about bringing energy to everyone,

1093
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,000
I might not be able to do that yet.

1094
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,280
But—

1095
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,000
No, you've already done it.

1096
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,600
You did great.

1097
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,560
Because you're genuine.

1098
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,960
You say you have no energy,

1099
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,440
I really—

1100
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,080
I have to disagree with that.

1101
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,760
You know,

1102
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,520
maybe some viewers

1103
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,600
really love our show.

1104
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
And you can see it online, in the comments,

1105
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,680
they'll tell you

1106
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,960
this show brings them happiness.

1107
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,480
That's your energy.

1108
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,880
Maybe you'll slowly open up.

1109
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,880
Don't worry.

1110
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,200
When I'm with others,

1111
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,320
I worry I'll be a burden to them

1112
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,560
because I'm not good at communicating,

1113
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,480
or

1114
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,680
maybe I can't make others happy.

1115
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,120
No,

1116
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,360
that's not the case.

1117
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,160
Being yourself is even more valuable.

1118
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,480
Relax.

1119
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
Let's enjoy

1120
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
these last few hours together.

1121
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,280
Let's toast with our coffee.

1122
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,200
I've never seen this before.

1123
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,480
Where's Ning?

1124
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
He went to buy something.

1125
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,840
Ning, Ning!

1126
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,160
Ning, come help me pay!

1127
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,920
I'll pay for you.

1128
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,520
I only have seven left, bro.

1129
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,000
What do you want to drink?

1130
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,480
I'll order for you.

1131
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,600
I'll have this iced coffee.

1132
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,000
Sorry, one more please.

1133
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,200
One more, thank you.

1134
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,240
Thanks, Ning.

1135
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,480
Did you order coffee?

1136
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,960
Yes.

1137
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,760
He ordered it for me.

1138
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,840
We've got the big bro and auntie.

1139
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,680
Let's say this table can order whatever.

1140
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,720
Bro, ice cream.

1141
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,760
Want some?

1142
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,480
Let me handle this.

1143
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,280
Is thirty enough?

1144
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,560
Just a small bowl is fine.

1145
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:52,960
A small bowl.

1146
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,040
As long as it's not caramel.

1147
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,800
Anything else is fine.

1148
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,640
Chocolate or something is okay?

1149
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,160
Chocolate's good.

1150
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,600
Okay.

1151
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,000
How about you?

1152
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,520
Alright, let's go.

1153
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,440
Good evening.

1154
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,840
Here I am.

1155
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,560
Good evening.

1156
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,720
Are we gathering now?

1157
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Yes, time to gather.

1158
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,320
Okay.

1159
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,560
Chen He.

1160
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,960
Chen He.

1161
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,320
He bro.

1162
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,160
He bro, you do it.

1163
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,440
Come on, let's call Gong Jun together.

1164
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:20,840
Alright?

1165
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,360
Let's go.

1166
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,400
Gong Jun, one, two, three!

1167
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,760
Gong Jun!

1168
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,880
Chen He.

1169
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,040
Call louder.

1170
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,880
Sis, call louder.

1171
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,920
Chen He.

1172
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,560
Chen He.

1173
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,280
Chen He.

1174
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,600
Chen He.

1175
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,360
Chen He.

1176
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,400
Ning, so handsome!

1177
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,760
So handsome!

1178
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,160
So handsome!

1179
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,960
Do a set of drunken boxing.

1180
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,880
Chen Xingxu.

1181
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,160
So handsome!

1182
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,040
Chen Xingxu.

1183
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,000
Chen Xingxu, we've called you three times!

1184
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,840
Chen Xingxu.

1185
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,480
Help me hold this.

1186
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:58,720
I'll hold it for you.

1187
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,680
No, swing it while holding.

1188
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,200
Hurry!

1189
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,920
Please!

1190
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Chen Xingxu.

1191
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
Should we wait for Honglei?

1192
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,920
This guy doesn't fit in.

1193
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,000
This song is nice.

1194
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,800
Since I was little,

1195
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,040
this has been my favorite song.

1196
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,040
Let's go.

1197
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,440
Let's go.

1198
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,280
Let's head out.

1199
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,160
Let's head out.

1200
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm leaving, bro.

1201
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm leaving.

1202
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,680
Honglei is so cool.

1203
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,920
Honglei.

1204
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,600
Honglei is so cool.

1205
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,680
Come on.

1206
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,640
Let's go, heading back.

1207
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,440
What did you buy?

1208
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,120
I bought some fun stuff.

1209
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,000
It's really fun.

1210
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,920
Listen to that.

1211
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,640
That street singer is amazing.

1212
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,160
Right?

1213
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,520
He sings songs from The Godfather.

1214
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,920
All those old songs.

1215
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,880
He sings with real feeling.

1216
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,760
Right?

1217
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,440
That's nice.

1218
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,880
Feels good.

1219
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,280
Friends, let's go!

1220
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,640
Let's go!

1221
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,680
Mizone, save me!

1222
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,520
Director team, you guys are so tight-lipped.

1223
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
It's so hot and you didn't warn me at all.

1224
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,560
I'm sweating like crazy today.

1225
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm totally out of energy.

1226
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,480
Wang Jie, we're exhausted.

1227
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,720
Looking for a Mizone lifesaver.

1228
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,840
I'm revived.

1229
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,920
This has vitamin B and C.

1230
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,280
One sip and I'm back.

1231
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,240
Wang Jie, give it a try.

1232
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,480
Is Mizone back?

1233
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,120
I heard the Stay Energized Challenge is upgraded.

1234
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,920
Mizone is back for the challenge.

1235
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
Everyone stands with a stick.

1236
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,440
Quickly swap sticks clockwise.

1237
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,800
Win to get a Mizone supply pack.

1238
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:45,840
Win to get a Mizone supply pack.

1239
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,360
Let's try again.

1240
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,120
This time I'm definitely back.

1241
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,800
Mizone, I'm back to full energy.

1242
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,120
Please give Wang Yuwen the energy lifesaver.

1243
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,840
Mizone supply pack.

1244
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,280
Full of energy with Mizone lifesaver.

1245
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,200
Ready for more challenges on the journey.

1246
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,320
It matches my outfit.

1247
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Where did this come from?

1248
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,680
Saw it on the wall.

1249
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,640
Kiss the Shark.

1250
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,600
Kiss? What are you singing?

1251
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,040
I'm dying of laughter.

1252
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,720
Seriously.

1253
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,040
It's really nice here.

1254
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,640
Very comfortable.

1255
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,840
Just sit here.

1256
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,760
Grab some bread and chew.

1257
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,240
Listen to the music.

1258
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,400
Watch the people go by.

1259
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
This is the best life.

1260
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,600
So beautiful.

1261
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,600
I'll miss this place.

1262
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,600
Next time we meet,

1263
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,400
maybe it'll be at Ning's concert.

1264
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,000
Could be.

1265
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,760
I think so.

1266
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,320
Right?

1267
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
Gong Jun will be there too.

1268
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,160
Ning, I heard

1269
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,080
I heard you never take a break.

1270
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,440
All 365 days a year.

1271
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,160
Pretty much.

1272
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,320
Almost never miss a day.

1273
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,840
Don't you want to take a vacation?

1274
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,600
Have you thought about it?

1275
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,200
Depends if he joins a group.

1276
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,160
Depends if I join a group.

1277
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,480
I do want to join a group.

1278
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,440
This is beautiful

1279
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,880
Sicily

1280
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,200
So cool

1281
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,520
This is an old Sicilian

1282
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,360
Old Sicily

1283
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,280
We

1284
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,280
are having hot pot here

1285
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,000
Seriously

1286
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,560
This is so romantic

1287
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,080
It's so different

1288
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,080
When have you ever had hot pot by the sea?

1289
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,040
Look at that cloud

1290
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,400
A phoenix

1291
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
So beautiful

1292
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,200
So lovely

1293
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,600
Let's take a selfie

1294
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,160
Last one

1295
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,040
No need for a last one

1296
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,840
No, the last one in Italy

1297
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,680
Come quickly

1298
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,680
In my whole life

1299
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,080
I've never taken so many selfies

1300
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,000
Find your own spot, everyone

1301
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,640
Three, two, one

1302
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,160
Nice

1303
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,480
Nice

1304
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,800
Nice

1305
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,200
Mix your sauces, everyone

1306
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,440
There's fried garlic too

1307
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,640
So professional

1308
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,880
This is the "Five Lakes and Four Seas" sauce plate

1309
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,560
"Five Lakes and Four Seas" plate

1310
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,360
Every flavor is different

1311
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,120
Everyone is different

1312
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,240
I'll add some garlic

1313
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,200
You guys don't mind, right?

1314
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,160
No, I like garlic too

1315
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,920
I mind

1316
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,280
It doesn't matter if you mind

1317
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,480
That's not important

1318
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,240
You're definitely the closest

1319
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,760
That's how close friends are

1320
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,520
They say the harshest things

1321
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,640
That's why you need garlic

1322
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,600
I'll have some too

1323
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:50,880
Go ahead

1324
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,240
Authentic old Sicilians eat garlic

1325
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,360
Ouyang Didi's song, right?

1326
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,200
It's started

1327
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,760
This red shrimp

1328
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,400
This is for sashimi

1329
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,080
Red shrimp is eaten as sashimi

1330
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,840
It's for sashimi

1331
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,760
He Ge

1332
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Can you eat this raw?

1333
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,920
Lobster can only be eaten raw

1334
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,640
I've never had this before

1335
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,720
Is this shrimp tasty?

1336
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,280
It's so delicious

1337
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,400
Seriously, I'm telling you

1338
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,360
Bro, I had one, it's amazing

1339
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,640
I tried it, it's so good

1340
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,120
I just think

1341
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,800
It's so tasty

1342
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,040
Can mussels be eaten raw?

1343
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,480
No, mussels can't

1344
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,960
I'll have another

1345
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,680
The rest are yours

1346
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,040
No

1347
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,080
Let's go to their table

1348
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,880
They probably won't eat much

1349
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,920
They probably won't eat much

1350
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
Go to their table

1351
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:48,800
Trust me

1352
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,760
How can you say that?

1353
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,240
I can't eat it raw, I'm scared

1354
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,480
You might be the only one eating this pot at our table

1355
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:53,920
Really?

1356
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,920
I don't eat raw food

1357
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,040
Then have it cooked

1358
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,400
Boil it

1359
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,240
I'll cook lobster for you

1360
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,360
It's dead

1361
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,040
Bro

1362
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,600
Cut it in half

1363
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,680
What just vibrated?

1364
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,600
Put the meat in.

1365
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,520
Chicken, beef.

1366
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,880
This is authentic Gong Jun hot pot base.

1367
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,120
His base is really authentic.

1368
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,000
Gong Jun hot pot base.

1369
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,360
Old Gong's base.

1370
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,080
Old Gong's base.

1371
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,080
Old Gong.

1372
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,440
Old Gong, the base you brought today—

1373
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,160
Nice job, Old Gong.

1374
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,040
Jun Jun.

1375
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:23,920
Bro.

1376
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,680
Shouldn't you be here—

1377
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,440
Go over there.

1378
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:27,840
I'm good with anything.

1379
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,000
You like spicy, right?

1380
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,520
You organized today's hot pot.

1381
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,480
Go on, hurry up.

1382
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,600
Okay.

1383
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,440
I'll sit in the middle.

1384
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,360
Let's add more spicy for us two.

1385
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,720
Right?

1386
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,920
Just put in more spicy.

1387
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,360
It's really rich and fresh.

1388
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,000
Let me try a bite.

1389
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,600
You can have one.

1390
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,160
Thanks.

1391
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,280
I can't eat that much, babe.

1392
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,200
Come on, guys.

1393
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,600
I'll make a round.

1394
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,280
Let's do a round.

1395
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,440
I'll start with a toast to Old Liu.

1396
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,360
Alright, Old Liu, have a drink.

1397
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,080
Old Liu, thanks for your hard work.

1398
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,720
A toast to Old Chen.

1399
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,040
Old Liu, you're number six.

1400
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,360
He's number four.

1401
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,560
Old Liu, as in Liu Yuning.

1402
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,280
Yeah, I know.

1403
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,320
We've been waiting for your name.

1404
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,560
What does that mean for me?

1405
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,480
Waiting for your name.

1406
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,720
Right, so say it.

1407
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,880
Old Gong.

1408
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,360
Old Gong.

1409
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,480
Old Gong, after filming today—

1410
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,440
He left us early.

1411
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,080
Right?

1412
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,320
Old Gong ran off.

1413
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,720
Old Gong ran off.

1414
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,440
Old Gong ran off.

1415
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,920
Where did Old Gong go, Old Gong?

1416
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,120
Old Gong, you—

1417
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,440
Which show are you filming?

1418
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
It's not another show, right?

1419
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,080
It's not a show, is it?

1420
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,840
It's not another travel show, is it?

1421
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,800
No way.

1422
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,880
I'll finish this tea.

1423
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,600
"Kiss the Shark" drinks first.

1424
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,040
Drink up first.

1425
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,360
"Kiss the Shark" drinks first.

1426
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,840
"Kiss the Shark" finishes first.

1427
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,720
Let's kiss the Shark.

1428
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,800
Give it a kiss.

1429
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,400
A toast to the most handsome in our group.

1430
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
The best singer.

1431
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,200
The best at games.

1432
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,880
You drink.

1433
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,840
We'll really miss him.

1434
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,600
You drink.

1435
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,200
Naiwen, don't cry.

1436
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,880
Naiwen, don't cry.

1437
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,400
Naiwen.

1438
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,160
I'm holding it in.

1439
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,280
It's okay, come on.

1440
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,240
I'm about to cry.

1441
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,960
It's okay.

1442
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,560
Didi, it's okay.

1443
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,920
Sis.

1444
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,760
More emotional.

1445
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,280
Girls are more emotional.

1446
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:39,760
Let's go.

1447
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,720
Let's just go.

1448
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,160
Let's go.

1449
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,040
Wow, you changed faces so fast.

1450
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,640
Come on.

1451
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,840
Come on, bro.

1452
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,480
Don't.

1453
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,160
Don't jump, bro.

1454
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,960
Don't jump.

1455
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,480
Bro.

1456
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,320
Sicily.

1457
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,840
Will Gong Jun come back?

1458
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,840
Come on.

1459
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,080
Come on.

1460
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,280
Kiss the Shark.

1461
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,560
Jun Jun, come on, do the Xi'an round.

1462
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,680
If you can't make it to this one,

1463
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,000
then I have to go.

1464
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,880
He's hesitating.

1465
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,040
I'm heading to the beach.

1466
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,840
Don't stop me.

1467
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,720
Wait a second.

1468
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,400
I'm messaging my team on WeChat right now.

1469
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,120
I'll ask if I can...

1470
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,120
Not bad.

1471
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,600
So, here's the thing, Gong Jun.

1472
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,480
Li Naiwen and I

1473
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,640
we have another event.

1474
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,160
We can't make it.

1475
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,520
Just letting you know in advance.

1476
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,080
Sorry about that.

1477
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,200
Seriously?

1478
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,520
Then I'll take it back.

1479
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,520
No.

1480
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,120
If you two can't come,

1481
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:48,680
we'll send a message too.

1482
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,040
We'll send one too.

1483
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,440
Cancel.

1484
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,080
There, problem solved.

1485
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,320
Cancel that day for me.

1486
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,080
I want to...

1487
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,040
Gong Jun is coming to film the show.

1488
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,760
I want to join him for an episode.

1489
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Help me turn down that later gig.

1490
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,480
I want to film a day with Jun Jun.

1491
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Um...

1492
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,720
Um, this is...

1493
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,360
He took my phone.

1494
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,760
I canceled it for you.

1495
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,480
Canceled all your events.

1496
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,280
Because Jun Jun is coming.

1497
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,480
You...

1498
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:11,960
Liar.

1499
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,040
You didn't even open WeChat.

1500
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,680
You tricked me.

1501
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,080
I almost uninstalled WeChat.

1502
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,280
You liar.

1503
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:24,720
Honestly,

1504
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,280
I'm really happy to be on this show.

1505
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,920
Truly happy.

1506
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,160
Especially spending time with everyone.

1507
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,080
We really vibe well together.

1508
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,160
Because everyone has their own personality.

1509
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,760
I really hate to leave.

1510
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,920
But there's no choice.

1511
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,520
I...

1512
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,600
Yeah, bro.

1513
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,400
You understand me.

1514
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Yeah, you all have to understand me.

1515
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,880
Got it.

1516
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,080
Got it.

1517
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,400
We're all just joking with you.

1518
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:43,640
Guys,

1519
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,480
I'll have a drink.

1520
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:45,880
I'll drink.

1521
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,440
Thank you, everyone.

1522
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,160
Cheers.

1523
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,240
It's fate that brought us together.

1524
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,680
Even though it's just been over ten days,

1525
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,920
really,

1526
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,800
we've all had a great time together.

1527
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,120
Really.

1528
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,040
Feels like we've been together

1529
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,680
for half a year.

1530
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,080
I just looked at Gong Jun's eyes.

1531
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,560
They're already teary.

1532
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,320
They're not.

1533
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,280
Yes, they are.

1534
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,840
No, they're not.

1535
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,680
He's holding it in.

1536
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,440
No.

1537
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,600
No.

1538
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,480
How about this,

1539
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,440
I'll go first.

1540
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,560
Okay, sure, bro.

1541
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,760
I'm the closest.

1542
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,320
Alright.

1543
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,720
It's actually really simple.

1544
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,960
A really simple thing.

1545
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,560
Come on.

1546
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,040
What's this?

1547
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,560
I bought you some fruit.

1548
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,080
What are you doing?

1549
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,200
Come, sit down.

1550
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,120
You should remember this.

1551
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,080
Need to get a little something for Junjun.

1552
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,040
Buy a small gift for Jun.

1553
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,920
Because he won't be here next episode.

1554
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,640
I'll get him a power bank.

1555
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,720
Charge it up for a while.

1556
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,840
Then tell him it's Sicily's electricity.

1557
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,040
Right.

1558
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,480
Sicily's electricity.

1559
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,600
I'm the big brother here.

1560
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,040
What should I give Junjun?

1561
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,560
So he’ll always think of me when he sees it.

1562
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,640
Actually, I want to buy this cup.

1563
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,480
It's pretty nice.

1564
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,440
Let me take some photos first.

1565
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,080
He said he liked that cup.

1566
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,280
He was in that shop today.

1567
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,880
He likes this cup.

1568
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,000
There's another one later.

1569
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,840
One male, one female.

1570
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,840
I can't take it.

1571
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,320
Didi.

1572
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,040
Didi is crying.

1573
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,000
It's not for you.

1574
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,920
Junjun kept hanging around that shop.

1575
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,960
He didn't want to leave.

1576
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,480
And then?

1577
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,080
We left in a hurry.

1578
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,040
I pretended to take some photos.

1579
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,040
This is just the first round.

1580
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,880
No crying.

1581
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,760
This is only the first one.

1582
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,920
It's just the first one, Junjun.

1583
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,720
A cup also means a lifetime.

1584
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,240
Right?

1585
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,760
Good brother.

1586
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,000
Isn't this the one you like?

1587
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,600
So annoying.

1588
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,520
It's for you.

1589
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,600
You said you bought it yourself.

1590
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,200
Going all out right from the start?

1591
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,080
Alright.

1592
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,160
As long as you like it.

1593
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,560
Take it home.

1594
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,680
Next time we're in Hengdian,

1595
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,480
on set,

1596
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,560
let's use this cup to drink.

1597
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,440
Okay?

1598
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,440
And also,

1599
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,440
I haven't done this on a reality show.

1600
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,000
So annoying.

1601
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,440
Give it to me.

1602
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:56,960
Seriously.

1603
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,040
Junjun.

1604
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,240
You saw a little blue cup back then.

1605
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,840
You said it looked nice.

1606
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
But that one

1607
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,480
wasn't easy to carry.

1608
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,440
Li Naiwen and I split up.

1609
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,680
We secretly went back.

1610
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,880
You thought she went to touch up her makeup.

1611
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,280
She was actually buying that for you.

1612
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:16,680
Yeah.

1613
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,320
I bought this for him.

1614
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,360
Like this.

1615
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,280
This one.

1616
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,200
Okay.

1617
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,480
One of these.

1618
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,800
A little plate that represents love.

1619
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,960
And a small cup.

1620
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,720
This looks nice.

1621
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,520
You said it looked great, right?

1622
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:33,960
What are you doing?

1623
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,320
What kind of show is this?

1624
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,800
You just have to make me cry.

1625
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,720
Get me some tissues, please.

1626
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,320
Here.

1627
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,400
What are you doing?

1628
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,360
This is a gift from Liu Yuning.

1629
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,120
That's true.

1630
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,120
Alright.

1631
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,840
Stop it.

1632
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,480
Come on, Didi.

1633
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,240
My turn.

1634
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,320
There's more.

1635
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,760
I got this bag.

1636
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,480
Your English name is on it.

1637
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,840
And all our last names.

1638
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,280
We hope that you

1639
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,440
I chose this shop.

1640
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,520
They do custom orders here.

1641
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,160
What do you want to customize for him?

1642
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,040
Is there something guys would like?

1643
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,320
Young guys, not older ones.

1644
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,600
Twenty-five.

1645
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,840
Twenty-five months?

1646
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,120
No, an adult.

1647
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,440
This is actually pretty nice.

1648
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,720
You can even put his name on it.

1649
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,960
I want a big one called Simon.

1650
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,960
I'll just add one letter around it.

1651
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,280
Hope when you use it every day,

1652
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,240
you'll think of us.

1653
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,320
Remember us.

1654
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,200
Brother Simon.

1655
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,440
Don't make me cry.

1656
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,960
Our Xingxu.

1657
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,840
He put a lot of thought into today.

1658
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,520
Xingxu never goes shopping with me.

1659
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,200
Never.

1660
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,520
It felt kind of empty.

1661
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,680
Walking in Sicily,

1662
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,760
on those beautiful streets,

1663
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,000
he said, "I need to find..."

1664
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,480
"I need to look for something."

1665
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,600
In the end, what I bought

1666
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,800
was actually inspired by Xingxu.

1667
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,760
Gong Jun, here's the thing.

1668
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,240
I never thought I'd meet

1669
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,720
I just didn't expect to meet

1670
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,440
someone I get along with so well.

1671
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,760
I've met you once before.

1672
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,720
But honestly, I

1673
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,240
am a little

1674
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,120
not very confident.

1675
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,240
I'm afraid to interact with people.

1676
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,880
Social anxiety.

1677
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,600
Yeah.

1678
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,880
But then I

1679
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,200
didn't expect you to be

1680
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,120
someone who can

1681
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,280
bring so much energy to us.

1682
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,040
So I hope you

1683
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,760
don't forget us.

1684
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,160
Don't forget us.

1685
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
Don't forget any of us.

1686
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,120
So many fish.

1687
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,040
Buy a shark, right?

1688
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,360
Yeah.

1689
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,560
A shark works.

1690
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,400
Kiss the Shark and let him go back.

1691
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,200
There really is one.

1692
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,480
I'm so touched.

1693
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,600
Shark.

1694
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,080
What are you doing?

1695
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,240
Hey, what are you doing?

1696
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:33,680
That's it.

1697
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,240
What about mine?

1698
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,120
Well,

1699
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,080
It was on "Hahahahaha",

1700
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,560
when he came to film our show.

1701
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,240
I've never seen

1702
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,320
someone poach guests from another show.

1703
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,360
And he did it in front of all the creators

1704
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,120
and all the directors and producers.

1705
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,880
"You have to come to my show!"

1706
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:50,960
So I said, "No problem."

1707
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,120
I said, "Darn it, I'll go, I'll go!"

1708
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,480
I said, "I can fly in for one episode, no problem."

1709
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,440
Permanent guest?

1710
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,280
I said, "How about

1711
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,480
we find a room and talk privately?"

1712
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,520
I said, "This kid is really straightforward."

1713
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,320
This morning I sent him a message saying,

1714
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,720
I said,

1715
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,960
"Gong Jun, you are

1716
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,320
a very, very kind

1717
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,560
and pure person."

1718
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,360
And

1719
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,080
I hope you can

1720
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,640
always keep your kindness and purity.

1721
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,040
That's so precious.

1722
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,480
It's your kindness and purity

1723
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,960
that create a unique energy.

1724
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,480
You bring us happiness.

1725
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,320
Yeah.

1726
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,440
I've seen rain pour in the desert.

1727
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,920
Friends walk together for life.

1728
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,360
Your pants are falling down a bit too often.

1729
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,040
I'm the "lemon spirit" here.

1730
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,680
What's wrong?

1731
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,840
Everyone here

1732
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,480
would probably lose to him.

1733
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,920
I'm so happy right now.

1734
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,640
Every kind of happiness is different.

1735
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,800
There are thousands of ways to make people laugh.

1736
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,080
But this way is really, really rare.

1737
01:01:59,080 --> 01:01:59,800
Yes.

1738
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,160
And I also hope

1739
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,360
I can make you laugh too.

1740
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,040
Although, besides Kiss the Shark,

1741
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,880
besides the shark,

1742
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,480
sometimes we can switch to other fish.

1743
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,200
How about it?

1744
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,920
Hope that's the second song.

1745
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,000
Sardines, right?

1746
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,240
Sardines.

1747
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,600
Kiss the sardine.

1748
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,040
Kiss the sardine, alright.

1749
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,600
Then give it a kiss.

1750
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,040
Kiss it.

1751
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,840
Two fish.

1752
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,120
Come on, wrap it up.

1753
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,280
Give it to me, I'll wrap it for you.

1754
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,400
Isn't there a game in this segment?

1755
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,880
No, it's just...

1756
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,840
Let's play a game.

1757
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:42,960
Let's play a game.

1758
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,160
I'm begging you guys.

1759
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,200
No more games.

1760
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,720
You still have more.

1761
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,960
You're way more fun than the games.

1762
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,680
Let's wrap it up.

1763
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,360
Let's finish quickly.

1764
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,040
I'm taking off my mic.

1765
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,240
Anything else?

1766
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,920
Come on, Junjun.

1767
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,400
What about me?

1768
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,360
I want to find something you'll remember.

1769
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,400
Like this.

1770
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,240
Look.

1771
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,400
What?

1772
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,960
Bro, the cup isn't washed.

1773
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,240
It's fine.

1774
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:12,640
I rinsed it.

1775
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,560
This one's rinsed.

1776
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,680
See?

1777
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:18,800
Thanks.

1778
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,520
One of a kind in the world.

1779
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,160
There's only this one.

1780
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,600
I hope you never lose it.

1781
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,560
Not even when you move.

1782
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,160
Okay?

1783
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:34,800
Alright.

1784
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:35,680
Okay.

1785
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:36,720
Okay.

1786
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,840
You just had to do this.

1787
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,080
When did you guys plan this?

1788
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,000
This fish is for you.

1789
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,600
Don't lose the fish, these two fish.

1790
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,920
They even match your clothes.

1791
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,760
Now we know which cup you'll use for water.

1792
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,600
Everyone knows now.

1793
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,120
That's right.

1794
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,240
These will last you a lifetime.

1795
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:54,960
These cups.

1796
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,480
Gong Jun.

1797
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,320
I didn't know about this part.

1798
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,960
So I'll make it up to you with a gift later.

1799
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,000
You don't need to.

1800
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,080
I'll go to your concert.

1801
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:03,960
Okay.

1802
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:04,720
Come on.

1803
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,920
Bring my stuff over.

1804
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,520
You're my brother.

1805
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,080
How could I not buy it?

1806
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,760
Not only will I buy it,

1807
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,600
I'll get you the most expensive one.

1808
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,320
Because you deserve it.

1809
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:29,840
Bro.

1810
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,600
About this thing,

1811
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,560
Let me open it for you.

1812
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,400
Alright?

1813
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,160
Guess what it is.

1814
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:45,920
It was also yesterday

1815
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,240
when you, me, and Naiwen

1816
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,760
were discussing the case.

1817
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,800
We passed by a shop.

1818
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,160
You told me this thing was great.

1819
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,360
You said it was really nice.

1820
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,320
I was teasing you about it.

1821
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,360
I said, "What a weird thing."

1822
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,520
It'd look creepy at home.

1823
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,080
You said, "No way."

1824
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,360
It'd look great at home.

1825
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,000
I remembered.

1826
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,880
So you didn't buy it.

1827
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,080
But I bought it for you.

1828
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,200
It's beautiful.

1829
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,840
So pretty.

1830
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,560
I want to buy it and take it home.

1831
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,640
Yesterday there was a street.

1832
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,200
That shop sold those

1833
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,920
statues with really big heads.

1834
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,840
It's the street we took to the restaurant.

1835
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,960
Yeah, the street to the restaurant.

1836
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,880
Just go straight ahead.

1837
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,480
Alright.

1838
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,640
Because I don't know where it is.

1839
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,520
Let me look for a bit.

1840
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,240
I'm worried I'll hold things up.

1841
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,760
It's this street.

1842
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,640
Seventy percent sure.

1843
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,040
We didn't take this street yesterday, right?

1844
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:49,800
No.

1845
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,600
We didn't walk this street yesterday.

1846
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,800
I want to take yesterday's route.

1847
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,560
Let's start from the square again.

1848
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,480
Alright, got it.

1849
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:55,840
I understand.

1850
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,320
Can't find it here.

1851
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,400
Thanks for the effort.

1852
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,920
Just turn left at the street ahead.

1853
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,200
Yeah.

1854
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,320
This should be the area.

1855
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,280
It's this one.

1856
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,320
This one.

1857
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,040
That's it.

1858
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,160
Okay.

1859
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,000
This.

1860
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,040
This one.

1861
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:24,560
How much is it?

1862
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,400
Alright.

1863
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,280
Isn't this one a bit too big?

1864
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,440
It's too eye-catching.

1865
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,920
Where's the car? We can put it in the car first.

1866
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,360
Over there.

1867
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:33,920
Will we pass by them?

1868
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:34,760
Yes.

1869
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,600
He'll definitely ask me what this is.

1870
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,680
Let's take a detour.

1871
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,320
Let's go back to the car.

1872
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,040
Let's put this in the car first.

1873
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,920
What is it?

1874
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,680
It's just a...

1875
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,440
It's just a decoration.

1876
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,480
You know.

1877
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:49,600
Okay.

1878
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,680
Should we open it?

1879
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,040
We have to open it.

1880
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,840
We want to see.

1881
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,480
We're all curious.

1882
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
This is from the locals.

1883
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,680
A very famous decoration.

1884
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,000
It's called...

1885
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,400
Bro,

1886
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,760
It's called a pineal gland.

1887
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,240
It symbolizes the wisdom in your mind.

1888
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,000
So this represents wisdom.

1889
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,600
Put it at home,

1890
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,000
and you'll get smarter and smarter, okay?

1891
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,680
It's just this kind of decoration.

1892
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,320
A really big one.

1893
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,200
Just put it in your home.

1894
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,040
Whether it's your new home or old home,

1895
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,160
now you have something from me in your house.

1896
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:17,720
Alright?

1897
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,480
I promise.

1898
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,160
I'll put it somewhere nice at home.

1899
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:26,480
Alright.

1900
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,560
Yesterday, I just passed by quietly.

1901
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,000
I didn't know he remembered.

1902
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:31,880
Of course.

1903
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,120
I have to remember.

1904
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,560
Okay.

1905
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,240
Come on.

1906
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,200
What are you doing?

1907
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:35,840
Come here, give me a hug.

1908
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,440
That's it.

1909
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:36,800
Alright.

1910
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,680
Hope you're happy.

1911
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,200
Okay.

1912
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,240
So annoying.

1913
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,280
Liu Yuning, what are you doing?

1914
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,680
I didn't say anything.

1915
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,240
I didn't say anything.

1916
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,400
You just have to make a fuss.

1917
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,440
Always making a fuss.

1918
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,160
You only dare to scold this one person.

1919
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,640
Only dare to scold me.

1920
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,120
Actually, I joined this show

1921
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,680
because Gong Jun told me about it.

1922
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,200
Before, I also...

1923
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,120
But I don't mean to brag.

1924
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,320
Two shows reached out to me.

1925
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,040
Both said Gong Jun was going.

1926
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:07,840
So I called him.

1927
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,880
I asked which one he was joining.

1928
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,160
He said, "Come to Fresh Earth."

1929
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,280
I said, "Alright, I'll go to this one."

1930
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,840
Honestly, I'm grateful to him.

1931
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,480
Because I came here,

1932
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,120
and it's really different from what I expected.

1933
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,240
I rarely join variety shows.

1934
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,600
I usually do music shows.

1935
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,600
But this time,

1936
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,399
I got to meet so many

1937
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,800
brothers, younger ones, and sisters.

1938
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,800
I'm really happy.

1939
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,920
It just feels right.

1940
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,640
Like the two of us,

1941
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,680
we chat a lot.

1942
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,359
We really click and get along.

1943
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:27,920
Yeah.

1944
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,479
I didn't expect to be this happy every day.

1945
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:30,840
Find some time.

1946
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,040
Make some free time.

1947
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,600
Bring your friends.

1948
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,720
Visit home often.

1949
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,439
Visit home often.

1950
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,960
Go home and visit.

1951
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,479
Even if it's just bringing something for Honglei.

1952
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,120
Wash his socks.

1953
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:49,760
Wash his socks.

1954
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,319
Act as a security guard.

1955
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,279
Yeah.

1956
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,040
Be a security guard.

1957
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,359
Really, everyone gets along so happily.

1958
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,000
And also,

1959
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,120
Honglei, in private,

1960
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,080
After we finish filming,

1961
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:00,920
we gather together.

1962
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:03,000
Honglei watches us play from the side.

1963
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:03,920
He watches us laugh.

1964
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,560
Honglei really always stays with us.

1965
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,720
It feels like family happiness.

1966
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,160
You know?

1967
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,240
Like a grandpa.

1968
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,439
Like a grandpa.

1969
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,040
I just know

1970
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,680
these kids are having so much fun.

1971
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,279
He watches us with such kindness.

1972
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:20,840
Really.

1973
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,800
Watching us play.

1974
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,640
Watching us mess around.

1975
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:22,960
Yeah.

1976
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,080
Watching us grow up.

1977
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,080
And when he can't stay up anymore,

1978
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,080
he says, "I'm going to bed."

1979
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,359
He heads back with his cane.

1980
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,800
Sometimes he says he's going to sleep,

1981
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,640
but usually comes back.

1982
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,120
He grabs his cup before leaving.

1983
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,000
Yeah, every time.

1984
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,800
He actually leaves his cup on purpose.

1985
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,479
Just to watch us for two more minutes.

1986
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,359
Because in my life,

1987
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,240
I'm a bit introverted.

1988
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:47,920
But this time,

1989
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,200
it's really interesting.

1990
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,319
And from these kids,

1991
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:52,479
I learn a lot.

1992
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,760
You see so much

1993
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,800
powerful energy.

1994
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,240
So when I sit there,

1995
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,920
I'm actually absorbing energy.

1996
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,040
I felt like the Black Mountain Demon.

1997
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,600
I was so scared.

1998
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,320
I always say, whenever you're around,

1999
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,080
why am I so tired?

2000
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,840
Why am I always so sleepy?

2001
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,560
Let me tell you,

2002
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,920
all the energy is in the cup.

2003
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,360
When I get back to my room and open the cup,

2004
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,200
I take a big sip.

2005
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,800
Let me add a few words after Gong Jun.

2006
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,680
I want to thank whoever brought these eight people

2007
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,040
together.

2008
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,080
But it's not just one person.

2009
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
It's the whole team.

2010
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,320
Thank you, everyone.

2011
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,840
Thank you.

2012
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,880
Between couples,

2013
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,760
between good friends,

2014
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,880
there's always this saying:

2015
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,400
I'll go with you to the ends of the earth.

2016
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,240
And now, this place

2017
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,920
is called the Cape of Sicily.

2018
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,680
Across the Mediterranean is Africa.

2019
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,680
We hope everyone's friendship

2020
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,960
is like that promise,

2021
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,520
accompanying us to the ends of the earth.

2022
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,960
It doesn't feel so meaningful until you say it.

2023
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,600
After saying it,

2024
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,240
it feels

2025
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,680
a bit special.

2026
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,000
May our friendship last forever.

2027
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,200
Brothers,

2028
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,880
No words needed, that's it.

2029
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,160
Can we get some more soup for our table?

2030
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,280
The pot is almost dry.

2031
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,880
We were just setting the mood.

2032
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,080
Sorry about that.

2033
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:49,800
Now it's almost

2034
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,720
burning through the bottom.

2035
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,760
Please add some soup quickly.

2036
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,560
I rarely cry.

2037
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,720
I really don't cry easily.

2038
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,080
That's because you didn't meet us earlier.

2039
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,880
So never set goals like that.

2040
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,320
Seriously.

2041
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,040
We're a bunch of old "killers".

2042
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,360
I'm telling you, playing this game,

2043
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,680
old "killers",

2044
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,600
we're all emotional "killers".

2045
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,160
Seriously,

2046
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,320
when did you go buy it?

2047
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,040
Weren't we together the whole time?

2048
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,880
Look at you.

2049
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,680
Gong Jun even asked me,

2050
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,000
"Bro, what did you buy?"

2051
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,520
I said I bought some snacks.

2052
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,480
That's what I said.

2053
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,840
What's there to hide?

2054
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,320
He just glanced at me.

2055
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,000
I thought, oh, so that's it.

2056
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,720
Maybe it's something for family.

2057
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,240
It's for family.

2058
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:33,760
Exactly.

2059
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,480
Yes, it's for family.

2060
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:35,840
That's right.

2061
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,480
Didn't you notice today

2062
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,160
everyone was acting so sneaky?

2063
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,280
This afternoon,

2064
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,520
I was sitting with He Ge in Sicily,

2065
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,840
by the seaside,

2066
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,560
I told He Ge,

2067
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,000
I said,

2068
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,680
I have a feeling...

2069
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,200
The feeling of traveling with family

2070
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,840
Because I am

2071
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,200
quite

2072
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:55,640
introverted

2073
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,480
In Northeast China, that's called a trait

2074
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,320
Got it, personality

2075
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,160
Yes

2076
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,920
That's how I see it

2077
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,600
And I think

2078
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,960
work and life are separate

2079
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,520
In my view

2080
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,200
When I'm working

2081
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,520
no matter what I encounter

2082
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,560
or go through

2083
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,680
to me, it's just work

2084
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,120
It doesn't make me feel

2085
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,160
any different emotions or feelings

2086
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,240
But after coming to

2087
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,480
our Earth family

2088
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,360
I realized that

2089
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,640
you should never speak too soon

2090
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,080
Yes

2091
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,720
I've matured

2092
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,520
This is maturity

2093
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,800
What I want most in life

2094
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,840
what I most want to do

2095
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,880
is to take my dad, my mom, my family

2096
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,960
travel to different countries

2097
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,480
and let them see the world

2098
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,560
Maybe that's a bit sentimental

2099
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,160
but I really feel that way

2100
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,840
But I never expected

2101
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,160
besides my parents

2102
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,080
and my family

2103
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,720
I have

2104
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,200
family

2105
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,720
Honored to be your family

2106
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,040
I'm a bit sentimental

2107
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,520
A little sentimental

2108
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,000
Not sentimental

2109
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,960
Not sentimental at all

2110
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,000
It's great, it's genuine

2111
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,600
Very manly

2112
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,320
Really manly

2113
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,840
Not sentimental

2114
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:18,880
Come on, friends

2115
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:19,560
Come

2116
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,240
Love you all

2117
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,200
We are family

2118
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,240
Love you all

2119
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,720
Let's play a song live

2120
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,840
How about listening to "You and Me"?

2121
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,200
Yes

2122
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:31,960
Let's do it

2123
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,480
Sure

2124
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,360
Let me feel that moment again

2125
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,160
You and me

2126
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,280
Heart to heart

2127
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,280
Living together on Earth

2128
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,400
For our dreams

2129
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,200
Traveling thousands of miles

2130
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,640
Meeting in Beijing

2131
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:16,600
Come on, friends

2132
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,400
Reach out your hand

2133
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,000
You and me

2134
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,640
Heart to heart

2135
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:39,880
Forever family

2136
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,600
Sing

2137
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,240
You and I

2138
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,920
Heart to heart

2139
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,960
Living together in the global village

2140
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,400
Okay

2141
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,000
Thousand

2142
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,120
A journey of a thousand miles

2143
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:06,480
Wait a moment

2144
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,920
A journey of a thousand miles

2145
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,720
Meet in Beijing

2146
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:14,960
Come on

2147
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:22,000
Come on, friends

2148
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,800
Reach out your hand

2149
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,160
Bro

2150
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,840
You and I

2151
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,920
Heart to heart

2152
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,120
Always one family

2153
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,760
Here we go

2154
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,680
Let's sing together

2155
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,560
Wait a second

2156
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,080
It's fine

2157
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:47,680
Two

2158
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,560
You and I

2159
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,080
From the same world

2160
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,800
I didn't expect that we

2161
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,200
have such a big age gap

2162
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,040
but we can all have fun together

2163
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,280
It also helped me understand the world better

2164
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,920
It's really big

2165
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:03,920
We should get out and see more

2166
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,200
I really like

2167
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,480
Malèna

2168
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,240
this movie

2169
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,240
Seeing the eight of us

2170
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,360
walking together in that square

2171
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,200
creates a unique

2172
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,080
and unforgettable memory

2173
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,400
This trip was worth it

2174
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,520
And I believe

2175
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:17,800
we will show everyone

2176
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,760
we will show everyone

2177
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,120
many beautiful sceneries

2178
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:20,880
and we will also

2179
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,560
bring all of China to the world

2180
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,000
Do you think the world is big?

2181
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,040
It's huge

2182
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,120
But after meeting these Italians

2183
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,480
and seeing their interest in Chinese culture

2184
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,680
when people from all over the world come together

2185
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,840
you realize the world is actually small

2186
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,400
It's all about love

2187
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,600
With love comes peace

2188
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,800
Everyone in the world is one family

2189
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,600
I think that's the best

2190
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,080
Earth Super Fresh

2191
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,920
The world is right in front of us

2192
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,120
Welcome to the passionate land of Spain

2193
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,480
Let's give a warm welcome to Jin Jing and Lin Yi

2194
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:09,880
Come on

2195
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,200
Please choose your favorite dance partner

2196
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,640
Aren't they going to compete for it?

2197
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,840
Let them fight for it

2198
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,400
Sorry, we're a bit old

2199
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,240
Got stuck in my teeth

2200
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,040
Your whole routine

2201
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,400
From July to August

2202
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,040
is the season for crayfish

2203
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:23,880
Come on

2204
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,600
Alright, let's name it

2205
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,880
Naiwen, give us one

2206
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,440
Next year, fifty dance

2207
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,000
I'm fifty-one

2208
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,440
Dancing under the sun, I'm the lazy dancer

2209
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,920
I'm the lazy dancer

2210
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,520
One two three four dance

2211
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,600
I want to give up

2212
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,160
He can handle it

2213
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,080
Yes

2214
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,400
I'm Li Naiwen

2215
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,680
I'm Li Naiwen

2216
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,920
I'm Li Naiwen

2217
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,280
That's too much, I advise you

2218
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,320
I can do it

2219
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:02,920
Just drink straight from the bowl

2220
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:03,480
Drink from the bowl

2221
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,040
Take a sip

2222
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,640
Are we pooling our money

2223
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,360
or spending separately?

2224
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,320
Let's pool it together

2225
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,920
Give it a try

2226
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,200
Delicious

2227
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,160
Not bad

2228
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,280
Look, Ning is already heading over

2229
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,160
This deserves an eight

2230
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,320
This is really tasty
