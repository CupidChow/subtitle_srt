1
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,960
Let's go in and have a look.

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,480
Let's check it out.

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,800
Hello.

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,560
Hello.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,080
Hello.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Hello.

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,160
It's very old.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,640
Can I touch it?

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,240
Thank you.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,640
Sure.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,880
So what is this?

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
It's a jewelry box.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
Those small ones are pretty cute.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,600
And also,

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,480
There are also these paintings.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
These are nice too.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Grandpa is making one right now.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,560
Polishing.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,360
Polishing.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,040
Waxing and polishing.

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,440
This shop is very famous.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,760
This one looks really nice too.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,960
Then let's look around.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,480
Let's go in.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,400
Chili pepper.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Buy it for the "chili lover."

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,560
Buy it for Xingxu.

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
That actually works.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,480
Let me take a look.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,600
I want to find a chili pepper to buy for Xingxu.

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
This one can be for the "lemon lover."

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
Haven't found anything I like.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,200
Didn't find anything I like.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,680
Forget it.

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,520
If it doesn't look good, I won't force myself to buy it.

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,240
Let's go.

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,480
We bought the team shirts here.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,480
We've revealed it.

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
The team shirts were bought here.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,960
I just want to eat that lemon ice cream.

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
Let's find a lemon ice cream shop.

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,480
They say that place is the best.

43
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,560
Okay, let's go.

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,480
This street is pretty comfortable.

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,240
This street.

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,200
It's awesome.

47
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,080
It's quite comfortable.

48
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,840
What flavor do you want?

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Vanilla.

50
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,400
What?

51
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,960
Vanilla.

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,240
Vanilla.

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,200
Let me try a bite of your vanilla.

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,680
It's definitely delicious.

55
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,320
What did you buy?

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
I bought two paintings.

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,960
Let me see the paintings you bought.

58
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,560
I went into a shop

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
and the owner took some photos

60
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
These photos

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,120
were taken

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,160
so well

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
And I really like this one

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Let me see

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
This one, I really like this one

66
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,520
Let me show everyone

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,080
Why is that?

68
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
This is an old photo.

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,240
It's on film.

70
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,720
On film.

71
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
This is a

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,080
This is a

73
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,440
I really like this one.

74
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
I have cats at home.

75
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,520
And this one is fishing.

76
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
There are lots and lots of cats in the back.

77
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
They're waiting for him to fish.

78
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,120
It's so cute.

79
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
Ice cream.

80
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,360
Do you want some? I'll treat you.

81
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,880
Sure, uncle.

82
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
Come on, pick one.

83
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,400
Really?

84
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Pick a small, medium, or large cup.

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,520
Can I just have a small cup?

86
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,520
It's so delicious.

87
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
I want more, what should I do?

88
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
I'll just stay here then.

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
Isn't mine tasty too?

90
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Right?

91
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,400
Isn't this one tasty too?

92
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
And it's not overly sweet.

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Which one tastes better?

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Caramel ice cream.

95
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,400
Bro, you just love caramel ice cream.

96
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
I just had a coffee one.

97
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not very sweet.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
The yogurt one is really good.

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Thank you.

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll buy one of these.

101
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
Can I have one?

102
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
How much is it?

103
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,520
I'll give you a special price.

104
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,880
Thank you, thank you so much.

105
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,800
Wait a bit before going over.

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,160
Wait until he's done "killing" to be safe.

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
That way, he'll have some company.

108
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,960
You know?

109
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,680
This way, Honglei can help him "kill" me.

110
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
I can't right now.

111
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
If I go, his mission will be ruined.

112
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Isn't that a bit too obvious?

113
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,960
Now you're seeing Xingxu.

114
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,600
He's all alone.

115
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,240
He just arrived in Italy.

116
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,720
And then he became an undercover agent.

117
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
A target appears.

118
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,320
But he doesn't dare to act.

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,880
He's too timid.

120
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,959
He's starting to wait for the right moment.

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,760
He's hiding now.

122
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,320
It's over.

123
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
That's just like Xingxu.

124
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,959
This one is edible.

125
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,960
Try a French fry.

126
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,880
This one's on me.

127
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Ning will cover everyone's expenses.

128
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,720
Thank you, Ning.

129
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,440
Thank you, Ning.

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
Why did you jump up?

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,680
This is it.

132
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
A reward for mealtime.

133
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
That means it's been spent.

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,840
Then we start dancing.

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,120
The audience eats first.

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you.

137
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
Thank you.

138
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,960
Bye-bye.

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Naiwen.

140
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
Yuning, where are you guys?

141
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,120
We're on the main street.

142
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,400
Ask around how to get to the main street.

143
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,400
I'll come find you.

144
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,440
I finally found you guys.

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,320
Naiwen.

146
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,440
That was so fast.

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,320
Sorry.

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,560
Do you want some?

149
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:25,880
I don't want any.

150
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,560
I just ate.

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you want some?

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,360
Three, I guess.

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll have some.

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Lemon.

155
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,720
One lemon flavor.

156
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Yes.

157
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
The original one.

158
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,360
Thank you.

159
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
I want to try a different flavor.

160
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,680
I've already eaten.

161
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
Didi, do you want some? Didi?

162
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I just had one.

163
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,680
Big is fine.

164
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Then take it down.

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,800
That's good.

166
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,680
Here.

167
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,720
Let me do it.

168
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,400
You don't have to.

169
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
It's so big.

170
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,560
Take a picture.

171
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,240
Today's treat is on Young Master Gong.

172
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,400
Junshao.

173
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Are there seats outside?

174
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,080
Let's eat outside.

175
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,240
I really love this sour taste.

176
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,880
See, it's almost gone already. Look.

177
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
You're this one.

178
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,440
You're the ice cream king, you are.

179
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,560
This is pretty cute.

180
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,880
Yeah.

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,800
This one is cute too.

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,560
It's really cute.

183
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,440
How about each of us gets one?

184
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,120
Each person gets one.

185
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,880
I'll take this one.

186
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,480
Shark.

187
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,000
Shark.

188
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
Never mind, I don't want the shark.

189
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,680
I'll get a fruit.

190
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,200
I want a lemon, okay?

191
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Lemon.

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Is lemon okay too?

193
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,080
I want an apple.

194
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
This one is pretty cute.

195
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,880
Chili pepper.

196
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll buy a chili pepper for Xingxu.

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll get one for Xingxu.

198
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,800
Okay, then I want a plane.

199
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
Get a plane.

200
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
I want a lemon.

201
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,960
What do you want?

202
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Didn't you want the shark?

203
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,480
I want to buy another lemon.

204
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Okay, get another lemon.

205
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,320
Apple.

206
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Chili pepper.

207
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,440
Didi, what do you want?

208
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,360
I'll buy it.

209
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,720
It's fine.

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Get a plane.

211
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,800
Because I want to give one to my sister.

212
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,440
I can do it myself.

213
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
He went to get it, let's go.

214
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,240
Let's look inside.

215
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Just buy some of these little things.

216
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
They're pretty fun, that's enough.

217
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,640
This one's mine.

218
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,200
One, two, three, four, five

219
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:27,960
Five

220
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
Will it look good on me if I wear it?

221
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,240
Bro, you look so good

222
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Anything you wear will look good

223
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,600
Which side is the front?

224
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
The bow goes in the back

225
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Is it flashy?

226
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,080
Not really

227
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,560
Just average

228
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,160
I mean

229
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,680
Because I didn't put this one on

230
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Do you want to buy it?

231
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,560
Can you help me pick one?

232
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,040
Is it for yourself or someone else?

233
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,480
For myself

234
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm so hot

235
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
Can I buy this one for you?

236
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,520
Is it big enough?

237
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
If it's big enough, I'll wear it

238
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,360
Is that okay?

239
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,000
It's pretty cute

240
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
Isn't it quite cute?

241
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,600
I'll buy it for him

242
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I think it's pretty cute

243
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,160
Let's go

244
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,920
We’re leaving with lots of stuff

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,480
Why did you buy a mesh bag?

246
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,680
It looks great

247
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,800
It matches my outfit today

248
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
Look, all three of us bought one

249
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,320
We bought them at the same shop

250
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,920
Cool, right?

251
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
It really is.

252
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Looks pretty good.

253
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,320
Isn't it stylish?

254
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,240
How much is this?

255
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,680
Twenty.

256
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,040
Twenty.

257
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,360
How much was your bag again?

258
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
How much is your bag?

259
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,920
Mine was only five.

260
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,760
Yours is more expensive.

261
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
Mine and Wen's are just five.

262
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,120
Only five.

263
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,560
Why is mine twenty?

264
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Yeah, theirs are twenty.

265
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,600
Yours is twenty.

266
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,480
Ours is five.

267
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Did we get ripped off?

268
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
Same store.

269
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Really, the same store.

270
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,360
Ning.

271
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,120
Yours is twenty?

272
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,679
How much is yours?

273
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
Mine is fifteen.

274
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,559
Twenty.

275
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,120
Ten.

276
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
Ten.

277
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,760
Five.

278
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
Why is hers only five?

279
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,480
Ours is five.

280
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440
His is ten.

281
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
Yours is twenty.

282
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,240
Fifteen.

283
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
Why is mine twenty?

284
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Because it's fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.

285
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,880
Got it.

286
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,760
That's how it is.

287
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,160
Seriously.

288
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
You guys are so entertaining.
