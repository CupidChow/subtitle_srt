00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,480
Today is our Super Fresh Earth team

2
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,120
last stop on this journey.

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,560
We've returned to Xi'an.

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,520
Xi'an, as one of the birthplaces

5
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
of the Chinese nation and Huaxia civilization,

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,240
is also the starting point of the ancient Silk Road.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,800
And its end is

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
the first stop of our trip abroad.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
Rome.

10
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,640
They say, "Chang'an in the east, Rome in the west."

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,760
Chang'an and Rome gaze at each other from afar,

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,760
creating countless legends along the Silk Road.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,000
In this thousand-year-old city,

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,600
amid ancient traditions

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,760
and vibrant street life,

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,320
we begin our final journey.

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Bet you didn't expect this.

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm back again.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
Back home.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,040
Back to Earth.

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,080
Today,

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,720
I wanted to prepare a surprise

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
for them.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
I was laughing at the airport yesterday.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,040
Why?

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,800
Because the leaks

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
were just too much.

28
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,800
As soon as I landed in Xi'an,

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,760
they all knew.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,960
Everyone messaged me.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,880
I lied to them.

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,560
I said I was here for business.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
Last night, Liu Yuning said,

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,440
"What a coincidence."

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,920
"You just had to do business in Xi'an at this time?"

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
"The whole country is so big,"

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
"why Xi'an?"

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
Now I'm just stubbornly denying it.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
Originally, we planned

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,720
for me to be like

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,240
in "Romance in the Rain,"

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
and then

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
give them a big surprise.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,000
But in the end,

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
it flopped.

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,240
Let's go.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,000
A flop is a flop.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,640
Hand me the gloves.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm really dying of laughter.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
That thing on the left side,

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
up and down is for the door.

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Lend me a jacket.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,440
Here they come.

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,560
Who's here?

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,680
Who's here?

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,520
Who's here?

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,640
Is it Lin Yi?

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,080
What do I do?

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,120
I'm the first one.

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Hello.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,360
Morning.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,040
Why is it you?

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,160
Sir, can you turn down the AC?

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,240
Sir, can you turn down the AC?

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,640
Block the air from above.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,880
So scary.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
Keeps looking over there.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
What, not letting me on?

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,000
What does that mean?

70
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
Close the door on him.

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,160
Xu ge.

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
I closed it.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
I didn't want you to get in.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,800
You're doing this on purpose.

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
Naiwen.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
So handsome.

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
This is just too cool.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
Why not get in?

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,280
No idea.

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
What does that mean?

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
Naiwen.

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,160
Naiwen Li.

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,519
Naiwen Li.

84
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,279
So trendy.

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,240
Pretty stylish.

86
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,680
These pants are cool too.

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Uncle Nai, how come

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
you went to a fashion class?

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,360
Gone dark, this is...

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
Why does everyone who gets in

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,840
have to close the door?

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
It's Honglei driving.

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,440
This is black too.

94
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,040
So cool.

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,360
How did you get so thin?

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,720
Lost weight.

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,840
Lost weight, bro.

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,880
Is it right for you to be thin, bro?

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,720
Really looking good.

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Tired of being fat.

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,160
Tired of being fat.

102
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,720
Tired of being fat.

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Just slimming for fun.

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,920
Did anyone think Jun would come?

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
He'll definitely come.

106
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,600
He talks too much in the group chat.

107
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,640
I think so too.

108
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,240
The way he talks in the group,

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,920
it's like he wants to just tell me

110
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,440
"I'm coming."

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,280
They say he's a demon one day, a spirit the next.

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Spirit over there, demon over here.

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,520
Over there, he respects elders and loves kids.

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Of course, let the sisters have the room.

115
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
I can stay anywhere.

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,520
I can stay anywhere.

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,000
Here,

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
just messes with them.

119
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Good brother.

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Look at that.

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,760
The driver has a hairstyle.

122
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Really?

123
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,120
What?

124
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Let me see who's driving.

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Wait, hold on.

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
Really, how are you so smart?

127
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,280
Wait a second.

128
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,640
Who closed the car door just now?

129
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,200
Wait, let me take a look.

130
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
It can't really be...

131
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,560
Gong Jun.

132
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,080
Jun ge.

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,040
Gong Jun.

134
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,680
Jun ge.

135
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Really.

136
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,240
Got found out this quickly.

137
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,320
Lin Yi, you're amazing.

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,760
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

139
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,600
I knew it.

140
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,120
The driver cares about his image.

141
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,080
Can't keep up the act anymore.

142
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,160
Gong Jun, you totally failed.

143
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
After all that effort...

144
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,880
We got exposed before even leaving.

145
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,600
Come over here, quick.

146
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm so happy.

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,360
I was wondering who was messing with me.

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Turns out it was you.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,760
Hello, hello.

150
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,520
Hello, hello.

151
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
We're reunited.

152
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,360
The bad things we just said...

153
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,280
He didn't hear them, right?

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,920
I heard them.

155
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
I heard everything.

156
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
Let's pretend we don't know for this part.

157
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,280
You go back.

158
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,120
I'll go back too.

159
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah.

160
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,600
Because the big bro isn't here yet.

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Jun Jun, you go back.

162
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
I'll go back and prank them.

163
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Lin Yi's good.

164
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,920
How did you figure it out?

165
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,280
I saw he did his hair.

166
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
Such a handsome back of the head.

167
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,480
This driver isn't ordinary.

168
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,080
I was dying holding it in.

169
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,960
I haven't spoken in the group for two days.

170
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,640
Always sharing food pics in the group.

171
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,680
I didn't even dare to speak.

172
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
And that's you holding back, right?

173
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
Just now, Naiwen said about him...

174
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,680
He talks a bit too much.

175
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,280
I'm speechless.

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,840
Ning is here.

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
He's here, he's here.

178
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
So handsome.

179
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,720
Let's not open the door for him.

180
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Let's not open the door for him.

181
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,640
So that was all inner monologue just now.

182
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
Hello.

183
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,840
Sir, open the door.

184
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,400
Didn't notice.

185
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,240
Didn't notice.

186
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,960
Mainly because...

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
Bye.

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll take a cab.

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
Young Master Ning.

190
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
How's it going, bro?

191
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,080
Your recent concerts...

192
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,600
Not bad.

193
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,720
Tired?

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm pretty happy.

195
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
But yeah, really tired.

196
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,400
I saw someone say the other day...

197
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,120
Debunking rumors.

198
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,480
Who said Liu Yuning's concert sold out instantly?

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
I was like, what does that mean?

200
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,880
I opened it up...

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
And the caption below said...

202
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,560
It was actually gone in half a second.

203
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,880
So, Yuning...

204
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
What do you think?

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,960
Gong Jun...

206
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,840
Today...

207
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,640
Is he acting strange?

208
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
Didn't you notice he doesn't dare to talk?

209
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,039
I don't even dare to talk.

210
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Wait a minute.

211
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,360
Big bro is here.

212
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,159
Bro is here.

213
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,559
He'll get mad in a second.

214
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,919
Open up, quick.

215
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,600
Open up, quick.

216
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,919
Don't let Honglei break the glass.

217
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,200
Why aren't you opening the door for me?

218
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,680
Hiding the awkwardness with a smile.

219
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,160
So many people.

220
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,240
Gave me a scare.

221
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,320
Ning.

222
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,680
Hello.

223
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,720
Bro.

224
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
Alright, we're all here then.

225
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
All here.

226
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,480
Only Jun Jun isn't here.

227
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,960
Gong Jun's acting so weird in the group.

228
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Is he really not coming today?

229
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,840
Yesterday, I didn't even dare to say anything.

230
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,240
He's filming an ad in Xi'an, not coming.

231
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,000
That's a bit much.

232
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,840
Lend me a camera.

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,400
What do you guys think of him?

234
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
Say anything bad about him now.

235
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,800
What?

236
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,040
You were talking bad about me just now?

237
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,320
No.

238
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,680
We were keeping your secret the whole time.

239
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Kept your secret the whole time.

240
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,320
I can't keep pretending.

241
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,040
Seriously.

242
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm speechless.

243
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Those leaks are everywhere.

244
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,120
Everyone's here.

245
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Everyone's here.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,120
You should've driven here.

247
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Then no one would've known.

248
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm really speechless.

249
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,400
You said you weren't coming.

250
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,520
But your leaks...

251
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,560
And all your schedules are everywhere.

252
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,680
Every time you ask me...

253
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
My conscience gets tested again.

254
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,280
I have to make things up, it's exhausting.

255
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,560
In the end, nothing was kept secret.

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
Kept it secret for nothing.

257
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,160
Except for what Lin Yi just said...

258
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,200
That one was hard to guess.

259
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,440
Just now, Lin Yi said...

260
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,600
Why did the driver style his hair?

261
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,560
No, it's just...

262
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
I noticed the back of his head is so handsome.

263
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,360
This driver...

264
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,720
What's going on?

265
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
He's not opening the door, right?

266
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
He was in control just now.

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
Playing the "bad guy" again, right?

268
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,920
Here comes the disrespect for elders and kids.

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,520
Here comes the disrespect for elders and kids.

270
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,440
Are you Evil Samoyed or Spirit Pearl today?

271
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,080
I think Jun Jun should be ready now.

272
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
He'll be fine here.

273
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Bro, do you have luggage?

274
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,840
Can you take care of us?

275
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,440
Do you need me to carry any luggage?

276
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
Today's meal for us...

277
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
No problem, I'll arrange it.

278
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,720
You make the plan.

279
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,800
Which restaurant do you want to book?

280
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,480
But with us...

281
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,120
Spain was so much fun.

282
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,640
The food was amazing.

283
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,680
So delicious.

284
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
What are you doing here?

285
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,920
Lin Yi

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120
Is the show fun, Lin Yi?

287
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,520
It's fun.

288
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,240
When I go back and

289
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,840
I say I’m having withdrawal.

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Withdrawal.

291
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,200
Really.

292
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,120
It’s my first time filming this long.

293
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,240
All of us going out together.

294
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,880
I felt down for a few days after.

295
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,200
Yeah.

296
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
And after filming, joining a new crew,

297
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
that sense of letdown.

298
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
There’s a letdown.

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Feels a bit surreal.

300
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,840
Yeah.

301
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
When I got in the car just now,

302
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
it was full of good-looking people.

303
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,120
Except you, Naiwen.

304
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,840
You’re lowering our team’s looks.

305
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,960
You look really handsome today.

306
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,760
Very trendy today.

307
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
I’m trying my best.

308
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Put your sunglasses on.

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Okay.

310
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
Your hairstyle is a bit...

311
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,000
Kind of like Jackson Wang.

312
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,840
Right?

313
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Jackson Wang.

314
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,240
Jackson Wang.

315
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,320
Who’s Jackson Wang?

316
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,840
No.

317
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
This is the legendary

318
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,040
Wang Jianai.

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Wang Jianai.

320
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Wang Jianai.

321
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,800
Milk, no sugar.

322
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,080
Wang Jianai.

323
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,800
Wang’s milk.

324
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
I’m Li’s milk.

325
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
With everyone,

326
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,640
let me share a fun fact.

327
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,360
Everyone knows

328
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,160
China’s

329
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,520
English name is "China".

330
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,080
Do you know where "China"

331
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,720
comes from?

332
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,280
Porcelain.

333
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Porcelain, right?

334
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
One theory is

335
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,000
the word "China" comes from the Qin dynasty’s pronunciation.

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,760
Qin.

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,920
Yes, Qin.

338
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,400
The sound of "Qin"

339
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,560
is like the "Chin" in "China".

340
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,880
It’s the same as "Chin".

341
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,280
Qin.

342
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,960
Really?

343
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,400
Yes.

344
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,920
Our theme today is

345
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,080
Spirit Journey to the Ancient Capital.

346
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,200
A thousand years in a glance.

347
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Super Fresh Earth (Xi'an).

348
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,520
Fresh (Xi'an).

349
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,080
Fresh (Xi'an).

350
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,640
Fresh (Xi'an).

351
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Because Xi'an’s

352
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
split up, it’s

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,280
It really is.

354
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,920
Next, we’re heading to

355
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,200
the Grand Qin Theatre.

356
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,040
The Grand Qin Theatre.

357
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,080
It holds the Guinness World Record

358
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,720
for the largest theater stage.

359
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
The total area is

360
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,560
4393.403 square meters.

361
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
Later, we’ll be there

362
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,040
for an immersive journey through time.

363
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,480
To experience the epic of Mighty Qin.

364
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,360
We’re here.

365
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,000
Let’s go.

366
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
Ning Ning.

367
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,800
Bro.

368
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,320
So handsome, Liu Yuning.

369
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,000
Bro.

370
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
We should take a photo here.

371
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,520
Sure.

372
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
Three, two...

373
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,400
Okay.

374
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,640
Let’s take more photos these days.

375
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,880
You really are handsome.

376
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,640
When you’re not here, no one

377
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
organizes group photos.

378
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
So let’s take more these days.

379
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah.

380
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,040
Hand it over, let’s take one here.

381
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,960
Why?

382
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
A group photo? Aren’t you...

383
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,080
But we can’t take one every three steps.

384
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,840
One every three steps.

385
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
Let’s just

386
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,480
catch up on all the missed ones

387
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,240
all at once, right?

388
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,080
Or let’s do something different this time.

389
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,400
Everyone facing away, like this.

390
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,920
Okay.

391
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Who’s got the phone?

392
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,240
You face forward, we all turn our backs.

393
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
Okay.

394
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,960
You’re still the best at organizing. Come on.

395
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,280
All right, let’s go.

396
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,000
Mighty Qin.

397
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,520
Today is Chinese style.

398
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,600
Chief directors: Zhou Liya, Han Zhen.

399
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,320
Directors of "Only This Green".

400
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
We, the youth.

401
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,800
Should be mighty.

402
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,320
Let’s go.

403
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,720
Go.

404
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,400
Archaeology.

405
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
They’ve already started performing.

406
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
This looks amazing.

407
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
Has it started already, or...

408
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,720
They’ve already started.

409
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,480
Didn’t you see?

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
Buckle up.

411
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,160
He’ll yank your neck like this.

412
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,680
Follow me.

413
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
I’m really looking forward to it.

414
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,400
I think it’ll be amazing.

415
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,280
Heifu survived the battlefield.

416
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,040
His tile-making skills got him summoned to the Qin palace.

417
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,680
To build the royal capital.

418
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,880
Heifu is willing to serve the Qin.

419
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,840
Stay.

420
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
We’re moving.

421
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Really.

422
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,600
Feels like he’s pulling us along.

423
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,120
Yeah.

424
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,120
Heifu had no idea

425
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
this royal capital

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,960
would change the fate of millions

427
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,760
including

428
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
himself

429
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
The capital slowly took shape

430
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,600
Majestic as a dragon, grand as a rainbow

431
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,520
with awe-inspiring grandeur

432
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,680
Heifu stood before the palace

433
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,360
unaware that fate

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
had already set for him

435
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
a new choice

436
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,960
Ready

437
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,640
I think you'd be great for the role

438
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,040
So many lines from that scene

439
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,640
Yeah

440
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Do you feel drawn to it

441
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,760
Do you really want to perform

442
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,520
I really, really do

443
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,640
It's so beautiful

444
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,840
Absolutely stunning

445
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Here they come

446
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,200
Assassin

447
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,560
There's an assassin

448
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,240
So cool

449
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,400
This is hard to translate

450
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,800
That's awesome

451
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,520
Jing Ke failed

452
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,880
Heifu protected his lord

453
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,960
and was richly rewarded

454
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,520
He thought his hardships were over

455
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,440
and happiness was near

456
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
But unexpectedly

457
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,840
the musician "He" fell in love with Heifu

458
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,280
But an imperial edict arrived

459
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,760
The nation still needed to be unified

460
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,200
Heifu joined the army without hesitation

461
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,160
She stood in the reeds

462
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,560
bidding him farewell in tears

463
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
Heifu died in battle

464
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,800
and became a kneeling terracotta warrior

465
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,839
In the heavy snow

466
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,000
she finally found him

467
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,960
but could only look up at him forever

468
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,320
Soldiers

469
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,040
Let the wind and snow of the northwest

470
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,760
bring you home

471
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,720
A hundred years from now

472
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,440
you will be with me

473
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,680
and I will be with you

474
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,680
for generations to come

475
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,800
protecting the descendants of Huaxia

476
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
Beneath this land

477
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
many more

478
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,960
untold stories remain buried

479
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,440
Amazing

480
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,200
Fantastic

481
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,120
Fantastic

482
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,480
Fantastic

483
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,640
Fantastic

484
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,680
Great opportunity

485
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
Thank you

486
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,040
Fantastic

487
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,800
Awesome

488
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
You were fantastic

489
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,600
Fantastic

490
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,360
So nice

491
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,960
Very cool

492
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,880
I just read the subtitles.

493
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
This is actually

494
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,320
directed by the team from "The Eternal Wave".

495
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,880
Yes.

496
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,440
And the composer is also Teacher Yang Fan.

497
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Right.

498
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,520
Especially

499
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,280
proud.

500
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,160
Our country's stage plays

501
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
have now reached a new level.

502
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
Especially in dance.

503
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
And in production.

504
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,320
They've become deeper, more advanced.

505
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,280
More impressive and stunning each time.

506
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,840
For our stage plays

507
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,200
to achieve such progress,

508
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm proud.

509
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,720
Because since I was little,

510
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,040
I grew up beside the stage.

511
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,280
At the Fujian People's Art Theatre.

512
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,480
So

513
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,280
I was truly amazed.

514
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,520
I'm completely convinced.

515
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,240
Watching just now made me miss the stage.

516
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,480
You know?

517
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,120
After so many years

518
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,240
without acting,

519
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,040
and now

520
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,880
everyone should really come here.

521
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,320
Yes.

522
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,680
Everyone should see it at least once.

523
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,320
Really.

524
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
I'm truly convinced.

525
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,160
It's amazing.

526
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,880
I agree, first of all, it's beautiful.

527
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,400
It has a unique Chinese style.

528
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,080
The stage's visual design

529
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,920
is breathtakingly beautiful.

530
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Then it absolutely stunned me.

531
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,800
I kept crying on the side.

532
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,120
In the end, I cried my heart out.

533
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,400
Honestly,

534
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,000
I just

535
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,280
was thinking at the time,

536
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,000
Am I getting old, or just soft-hearted?

537
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,080
But it's not that.

538
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,600
It's your stories

539
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,480
that moved me.

540
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,080
I was truly touched.

541
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,640
And honestly,

542
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,480
I kept

543
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,040
tearing up.

544
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,960
I couldn't stop crying.

545
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
I was moved throughout.

546
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
He was crying so dramatically next to me.

547
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,960
It made me

548
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,080
really

549
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,920
lose focus.

550
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,840
Yes, I lost focus.

551
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
He kept wiping his tears.

552
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,000
Like this.

553
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I wanted to cry too.

554
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,920
I was about to cry.

555
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
I was quietly shedding tears.

556
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
His movements were so big, you know?

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,120
Someone on the left was subtle,

558
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,200
but kept sobbing loudly.

559
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Gong Jun and the others—

560
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,160
No, Xingxu.

561
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,880
I sobbed twice and

562
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,720
he kept sobbing.

563
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,920
Xingxu, share your thoughts.

564
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Well,

565
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
I remember back in school,

566
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,480
when we performed big plays,

567
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,640
we only had a few set pieces.

568
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,360
Just some platforms and lifts.

569
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,920
After watching this,

570
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,440
I felt so emotional.

571
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,480
I think, as Brother Honglei said,

572
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,880
Chinese stage plays

573
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,840
can reach everyone.

574
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,640
We can show other countries

575
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,400
with their own stage plays

576
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
that we still

577
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
we still are

578
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,840
the

579
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,920
best right now.

580
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,440
I rarely watched this kind of play before.

581
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,000
But today I feel

582
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,040
extremely proud.

583
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,000
And honored.

584
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Seeing China

585
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,240
with such deep history,

586
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,960
using so much advanced technology,

587
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,520
and so many

588
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,800
traditional Chinese elements

589
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,760
to present it.

590
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,480
Including music and the best actors.

591
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm truly moved.

592
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,680
I'm very happy.

593
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:18,960
As a Chinese, I'm proud.

594
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
As a Chinese, I'm proud.

595
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm just deeply touched.

596
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Every actor

597
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,760
even those in the corners, are so dedicated.

598
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,000
It's truly worth learning from.

599
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,080
I really wanted to rush up

600
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,880
and perform with you all.

601
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,520
I just felt

602
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
like I wanted to join

603
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,800
such an amazing play.

604
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
From the very start,

605
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,040
the audience seating led us

606
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,920
step by step into that era.

607
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,520
Step by step into that era.

608
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,680
Then into the stories of the past.

609
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,280
And finally, it brought us back out.

610
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,360
Before, we only learned history.

611
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,280
We just knew

612
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,800
about the Qin King unifying the six states.

613
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,840
This immersive experience

614
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
made us truly feel

615
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,680
like we stood with them.

616
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,160
I saw all the group dance sections,

617
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
I know they're extremely difficult.

618
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,120
You have to practice thousands of times

619
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,560
for all dancers to move as one.

620
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,000
Whether left to right,

621
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,680
or in the center,

622
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,120
everyone looks perfectly synchronized.

623
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,440
So to me, it's truly remarkable.

624
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,920
What I want to say most right now

625
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,880
is I'll post about this right away.

626
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,640
Everyone coming to Xi'an

627
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,560
must see this stage play, seriously.

628
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,480
That's the most practical advice.

629
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,360
Yes, you must come.

630
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I recommend it to everyone.

631
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,800
Actually, since I was young,

632
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,480
I've had some experience dancing on stage.

633
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,320
Every single one,

634
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,600
even the teachers on the side,

635
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
are deeply dedicated.

636
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
Completely immersed.

637
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,960
Yes, truly.

638
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
I salute you all.

639
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,080
I have one more thing to say.

640
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,160
Your Majesty.

641
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,400
I've played Li Si before.

642
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,800
Then why aren't you kneeling?

643
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,880
If there's a suitable Li Si role,

644
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
you can call me for it.

645
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,520
You don't have the stamina for it.

646
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,520
I just say it, that's enough—plus I dance.

647
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,280
You can cry, bro.

648
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,440
Thank you for your hard work.

649
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,160
Thank you for your hard work.

650
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,680
Group photo?

651
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,000
Come on.

652
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,880
Super Fresh Earth

653
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,720
The world is right before us.

654
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Mighty Qin

655
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,680
Liao Zha Lie (Fantastic!)

656
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,720
Thanks for your effort.

657
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,600
Goodbye.

658
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Next time, I'll bring my family to see you.

659
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,600
Where's my seat?

660
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,280
Please welcome.

661
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,840
Ning-ge.

662
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,600
Please welcome.

663
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,280
Isn't that wrong?

664
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,320
Nothing's wrong.

665
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,440
My bag is here.

666
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,920
Do you want to sit next to Lin Yi?

667
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,840
Yes, I want to sit next to Lin Yi.

668
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,400
I want to sit next to him too.

669
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,000
My left side looks better.

670
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,840
Go over there, bro.

671
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,120
Hurry up.

672
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,400
Hurry.

673
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,560
Try to talk to the person on your right.

674
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,160
That's all you need.

675
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,640
Just show your left side for photos.

676
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,280
Just shoot like this.

677
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,200
Got it, Junjun.

678
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,440
Based on what we know about everyone,

679
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,760
your language talents

680
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
are all outstanding.

681
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
I think Lin Yi is the best at this.

682
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,320
Language master.

683
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,160
This is the only

684
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,840
language master I truly admire.

685
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,640
He’s fluent in southern dialects.

686
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,160
Cantonese.

687
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Is that how you say it in Shaanxi dialect?

688
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,120
Go sit by Lin Yi.

689
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
The show you just watched

690
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,920
actually had a lot of Shaanxi dialect.

691
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,480
Today,

692
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,640
let’s learn a bit of Shaanxi dialect.

693
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,360
Shaanxi dialect was called "Elegant Speech" in ancient times.

694
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,680
"Elegant Speech."

695
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,160
"Elegant Speech" originated in the Western Zhou era.

696
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,360
It was promoted as the official language to Shandong, Henan, and other regions.

697
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,800
It became the common language for many ethnic groups.

698
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
The official language back then

699
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,360
was like today’s Mandarin.

700
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,320
Then, in Jia Pingwa’s book

701
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,920
"Xi'an, This City,"

702
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
he mentions Shaanxi dialect,

703
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,800
saying if you write it phonetically,

704
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,200
it’s still full of elegant classical words.

705
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,760
They don’t say "hold" for carrying a child,

706
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
they say "carry."

707
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,800
Carry.

708
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,040
Right.

709
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,120
The "carry" from "to carry."

710
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,280
Let’s carry together.

711
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
If food is bland, they don’t say "no taste,"

712
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,120
they say "plain."

713
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
So "plain person" means someone bland.

714
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,240
It’s getting a bit bland.

715
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,160
So next, we’ll do

716
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,720
a dialect challenge.

717
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,000
We’ve prepared some classic film clips.

718
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,360
Next, our Shaanxi-born director

719
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
will teach us to turn the lines

720
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,560
into Shaanxi dialect.

721
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,120
Okay.

722
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,880
Everyone needs to perform the line with a glance back.

723
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,040
Act out this dialect line.

724
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,440
The two ladies can see

725
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,200
who moves you the most.

726
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,040
Male rivalry, that’s our thing.

727
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,320
It’s truly

728
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,520
an exhilarating male rivalry.

729
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,680
What does "male rivalry" mean?

730
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,320
Male rivalry.

731
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,360
Male competition.

732
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,880
Males competing with each other.

733
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,720
Trying to make the ladies smile.

734
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,640
Let’s watch the clip first.

735
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,760
"King of Comedy"

736
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,040
Liu Piaopiao.

737
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,760
What’s wrong now?

738
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,400
What’s wrong now?

739
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,800
Can I not go to work?

740
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,880
I’ll take care of you.

741
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,520
I’ll take care of you.

742
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,600
I’ll take care of you.

743
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,280
Me, it should be me.

744
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,920
I’ll take care of you.

745
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Take care of yourself first.

746
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,440
Fool.

747
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,920
Take care of yourself first, fool.

748
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Take care of yourself first, fool.

749
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,280
All the guys are playing

750
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
the role of Liu Piaopiao.

751
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,840
Are you really doing this?

752
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,880
Is it real or fake?

753
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,120
Bro.

754
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,840
You have to act like this later.

755
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,520
You must.

756
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,200
She’s still like this.

757
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,840
She’s like this.

758
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,320
She’s got rhythm.

759
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,800
Fool.

760
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,560
Fool.

761
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,440
Fool.

762
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,280
I want to see you act.

763
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:48,920
Come on.

764
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
Then our Shaanxi-born director

765
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,280
will teach us to turn the lines

766
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,400
into Shaanxi dialect.

767
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,960
Hey.

768
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,800
What’s wrong now?

769
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,240
What’s wrong now?

770
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,600
What’s wrong now?

771
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,800
It’s just "what’s wrong now."

772
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,840
I’ll take care of you.

773
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,600
I’ll take care of you.

774
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,240
I’ll take care of you.

775
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,520
Take care of yourself first, fool.

776
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,280
Take care of yourself first, fool.

777
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,840
Take care of yourself first, fool.

778
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,480
Fool.

779
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,560
There’s rhythm to it.

780
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,800
It’s got rhythm.

781
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,560
Take care of yourself first.

782
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
Okay, I can play it now.

783
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,600
Is this what perfect pitch is?

784
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,400
Who wants to go first?

785
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
First up, Liu Piaopiao.

786
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,480
Fool.

787
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,880
Fool.

788
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,640
Then it's you.

789
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,000
Come on.

790
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,680
Go ahead.

791
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,000
Naiwen, show us and set the tone.

792
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,600
Show us how it's done.

793
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,640
My Xi'an dialect

794
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,760
is really standard.

795
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,280
I've acted in Xi'an

796
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,400
TV dramas set in Xi'an.

797
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Close your eyes.

798
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,480
Then you can't see the stars.

799
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,560
Pick your own Yin Tianqiu.

800
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,880
Didi.

801
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:56,840
Okay.

802
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,040
The daughter takes care of him.

803
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,720
Find her in the future.

804
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,000
Now it all makes sense.

805
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm leaving from here.

806
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,640
Naiwen, where are you?

807
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,560
Did a grenade blow up your pants?

808
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,080
They're all torn up.

809
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,360
Torn like that and still not letting people care for you.

810
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,960
Walk out with style.

811
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,600
Come on.

812
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,640
Start with bro's ripped pants.

813
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,320
Ready.

814
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,880
Ready.

815
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,240
Hey.

816
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
We haven't started yet.

817
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,200
No, I'm just practicing.

818
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,800
You scared me.

819
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,280
This...

820
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,080
Ready.

821
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,640
Three, two, one.

822
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,960
Go.

823
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,160
Start.

824
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,120
Hey.

825
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,600
What's wrong now?

826
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,440
I'll take care of you.

827
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,960
Take care of yourself first.

828
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,960
Fool.

829
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Textbook-level acting.

830
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,080
Pause.

831
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
Pausing is important.

832
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,920
Steady.

833
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,520
Accurate.

834
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,920
Right?

835
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,640
Accurate.

836
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,160
Which one are you?

837
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,480
You're really doing it?

838
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,440
Which part are you playing?

839
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,840
I'm playing this "hey, hey."

840
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,720
You're playing the stomach.

841
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,280
Then I'll be the kidney.

842
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,600
Hey.

843
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,800
I'll take care of you.

844
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,640
I'll take care of you.

845
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,160
Stealing lines.

846
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,520
Let them say their line first.

847
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,280
He still has lines left.

848
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,600
Bro, I just got here.

849
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,840
The key is Lin Yi: "I'll take care of you."

850
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,560
What feeling just came up?

851
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
You "get out."

852
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
He still has a line left.

853
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,680
You say one, I say one.

854
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,160
Okay.

855
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,720
You say one.

856
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,480
Okay, teacher.

857
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,240
Then I say one.

858
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,320
Okay.

859
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,280
Hey.

860
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,640
What's wrong now?

861
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,920
I'll take care of you.

862
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,280
Take care of yourself first, fool.

863
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay.

864
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,240
No.

865
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,280
He's not.

866
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,760
What's up with those two?

867
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,880
Why aren't they being abstract? I'm scared.

868
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm most afraid when he gets serious.

869
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah, he's not abstract.

870
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,680
He's not abstract at all.

871
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,160
He's the normal version.

872
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,840
No.

873
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,960
Take care of yourself first, fool.

874
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,120
They're not doing abstract anymore.

875
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,400
So serious, so weird.

876
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,840
You're playing the boss, right?

877
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,200
Come, I'll take care of you.

878
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,440
Their stripes look oddly cute today.

879
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,560
Take care of yourself first.

880
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,000
Fool.

881
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,400
Take care of yourself first.

882
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,880
Go kiss a shark first.

883
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,640
Hey.

884
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,360
What's wrong now?

885
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,080
I'll take care of you.

886
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,200
Take care of yourself first.

887
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,840
Fool.

888
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
Take care of yourself first, fool.

889
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,520
You and me.

890
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,920
Why are you shaking with me?

891
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,280
I'm sweating.

892
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,520
Come on, bro.

893
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,960
You two go first.

894
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,880
Us two.

895
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,960
We're too mismatched.

896
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,440
You see, I'm not mismatched with Naiwen.

897
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm mismatched with Yuning.

898
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,360
Right.

899
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,960
I think this way...

900
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
Ning and Wen, you go up.

901
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,360
Then Naiwen and Honglei go again.

902
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,960
Why?

903
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,440
I think that's fine.

904
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,680
That's fine.

905
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,960
I'll take care of him.

906
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,680
I'll take care of him.

907
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,280
Yuning, you and Yuwen go first.

908
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Handsome guy, pretty girl—go!

909
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,880
We all perform the same way.

910
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
All with hands in pockets.

911
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,800
Pocket-style acting.

912
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,320
Because there's nowhere to put your hands.

913
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,720
No, we just have no support.

914
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,400
That's it.

915
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,600
Come on.

916
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,160
Hey.

917
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,440
What's wrong now?

918
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,760
I'll take care of you.

919
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Take care of yourself first.

920
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,440
Fool.

921
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,720
Yuwen's heart is broken.

922
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,360
That glance back of his

923
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,400
instantly made me feel

924
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,760
like I was about to get dumped.

925
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,680
His eyes look so cold.

926
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,400
Northeast boss.

927
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Right, you guys do it in reverse.

928
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,040
Okay, reverse it.

929
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,800
Hello.

930
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,440
Hello.

931
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,760
What's wrong?

932
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,320
I'll take care of you.

933
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,760
Take care of yourself first, silly.

934
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,080
Silly.

935
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Why are you laughing at yourself?

936
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,960
Revenge.

937
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,199
You're totally getting back at me.

938
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Bro, pick your favorite guest.

939
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,040
My "old lady."

940
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,400
Come on.

941
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,719
Why do you need props?

942
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,400
Don't you have a bag?

943
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,480
Now there's a pivot.

944
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
No, you look like you just bought groceries, man.

945
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,760
What are you doing?

946
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,639
Went grocery shopping at the community market.

947
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,719
What's wrong now?

948
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,600
Let's go.

949
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

950
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,120
Silly.

951
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,800
Silly.

952
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,520
What's wrong now?

953
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,040
I'll take care of you.

954
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,920
Take care of yourself first.

955
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,040
Silly.

956
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,680
That's the vibe.

957
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,440
I think this relationship is good.

958
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,760
They call each other silly.

959
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,640
These characters feel closer.

960
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,840
I believe everyone here

961
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,080
has learned the Shaanxi dialect, right?

962
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,560
That's right.

963
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,760
Already mastered it.

964
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,960
It's second nature now.

965
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,120
Next, we

966
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,680
are going to fully

967
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,120
show off your learning results.

968
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,920
This task is

969
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,160
Shaanxi dialect telephone game.

970
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
We'll provide some film scenes.

971
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,280
The first member

972
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,080
will learn the Shaanxi lines.

973
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,120
Others must wear noise-canceling headphones.

974
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,320
The last member

975
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,600
just needs to repeat

976
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,760
over half of the dialect lines.

977
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,400
Then it's a success.

978
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,840
Alright.

979
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,400
Okay.

980
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,840
We're about to head to

981
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,040
Xi'an Fanzhuang.

982
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,960
To enjoy Shaanxi cuisine made by heritage chefs.

983
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
Special dishes from Xi'an.

984
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,960
Fail once, lose a dish.

985
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,520
Good luck!

986
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll go first.

987
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:29,880
Okay.

988
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,280
Okay.

989
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,680
Jun Jun goes first.

990
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,600
He can do the dialect.

991
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,440
Actually, the Xi'an dialect

992
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,680
is still understandable to us.

993
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,440
It's not like Cantonese.

994
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
That's totally different, like Minnan.

995
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,880
It's the totally different kind.

996
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,320
Yeah.

997
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,080
Not like Lin Yi's Cantonese.

998
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,800
I just can't understand it at all.

999
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,080
I'm just a bit weak in Cantonese.

1000
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,960
Let's go.

1001
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,880
In front of them,

1002
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
they all put on headphones.

1003
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,320
You're sick.

1004
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,520
Yeah, I'm sick.

1005
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,080
I've never dated over three months.

1006
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
You're already expired.

1007
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,920
You're not fresh, not fun anymore.

1008
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,160
I don't like you anymore, okay?

1009
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,160
You're such a baffling woman.

1010
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,360
I'm a bit dizzy, cut.

1011
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,640
I'll do the Shaanxi version.

1012
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,440
You're sick.

1013
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,480
You're messed up.

1014
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,880
You're messed up.

1015
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,840
I've never dated over three months.

1016
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,200
You're not fresh, not fun anymore.

1017
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,280
I've never dated over three months.

1018
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,200
You're not fresh, not fun anymore.

1019
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah, I'm messed up.

1020
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,680
Yeah.

1021
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,720
I've never dated over three months.

1022
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,040
You're already expired.

1023
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,800
I don't like you anymore, okay?

1024
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,440
I don't like you anymore, okay?

1025
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,600
I don't like you anymore.

1026
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,120
Okay or not?

1027
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,760
Right, it means "okay or not."

1028
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,000
You're really baffling, come on.

1029
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,600
Come on, little bro.

1030
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,800
Let's go.

1031
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,360
Come on.

1032
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
You're messed up.

1033
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,680
Look at me.

1034
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,960
Yeah, I'm messed up.

1035
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,640
I've never dated over three months.

1036
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,360
You're already expired.

1037
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,480
You're not fresh or fun anymore.

1038
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,920
I don't like you anymore, okay?

1039
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Okay or not?

1040
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,600
You're really a baffling woman.

1041
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,240
Okay.

1042
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,640
All done.

1043
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,000
Okay.

1044
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,600
Why the mischievous grin?

1045
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
I acted very seriously.

1046
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,080
My Xi'an dialect is spot on.

1047
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,240
I've acted in Xi'an TV dramas.

1048
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,440
Two people, one guy and one girl.

1049
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,400
You're messed up.

1050
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,960
And this is the girl.

1051
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,280
Yeah, I'm messed up.

1052
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,280
You.

1053
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,400
What was that again?

1054
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,320
I never date for more than three months.

1055
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,520
You're not fresh anymore.

1056
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,640
I give up.

1057
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,000
Wait.

1058
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,080
Are you sure it's...

1059
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,960
You're already expired.

1060
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,720
You're expired.

1061
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,040
I don't like you like this.

1062
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,040
A woman who...

1063
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,720
Four characters.

1064
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,200
A woman who...

1065
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,400
What kind of woman?

1066
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,200
I forgot too.

1067
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,400
Anyway, it's just "something something woman."

1068
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,280
I forgot this part.

1069
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,560
Fill in a word.

1070
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,720
Come on.

1071
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,320
Why are you laughing?

1072
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,680
Two people.

1073
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,320
Two people.

1074
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,520
Are you crazy?

1075
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,520
Are you crazy?

1076
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,520
I'm not crazy.

1077
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,240
You're already expired.

1078
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,680
You're not fresh anymore.

1079
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,840
I don't like it.

1080
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,120
Don't like it.

1081
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,400
I don't like it.

1082
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,320
I don't like this kind.

1083
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't know either.

1084
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,240
Fill in a word.

1085
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,600
I don't like people who aren't fresh.

1086
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,520
I don't like this kind that's not fresh.

1087
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,440
Okay.

1088
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,120
You're pretty quick.

1089
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,440
Good teaching.

1090
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,400
Yes.

1091
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,600
The first line is...

1092
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,360
Are you crazy?

1093
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,040
What is this?

1094
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,760
Are you crazy?

1095
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
Then the other person says, "I'm not crazy."

1096
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,360
Do you have a motor?

1097
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,000
I don't have a motor.

1098
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,920
Right.

1099
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,320
He spent ten minutes on just these two lines.

1100
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,680
Right.

1101
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,480
Do you have a motor?

1102
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,120
He doesn't have a motor.

1103
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
Yes, I passed the exact words.

1104
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,320
I'm really smart, aren't I?

1105
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Me.

1106
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,600
Me.

1107
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,280
Me.

1108
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,920
Me.

1109
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,560
Me.

1110
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,800
Who's teaching who now?

1111
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,720
I've never dated for more than three months.

1112
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,920
I don't like this kind that's not fresh.

1113
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,560
Woman.

1114
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,160
This kid is so forgetful.

1115
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,040
Do you get it?

1116
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,800
Do you understand?

1117
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,240
How could I possibly understand?

1118
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,720
You just...

1119
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,600
Are you kidding me?

1120
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,040
You can understand.

1121
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,680
I trust you.

1122
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,240
Bro, I trust you. You're smart.

1123
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,920
Try to organize it again.

1124
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,800
It's fine, he can understand.

1125
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,160
Should I speak Xi'an dialect?

1126
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,240
Yes.

1127
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,960
She didn't say a single word in Xi'an dialect.

1128
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,720
Not even one word.

1129
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,720
I tried my best, bro.

1130
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,160
Look.

1131
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,800
Did my best.

1132
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,920
You.

1133
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Do you have a motor?

1134
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,760
Then the other person says...

1135
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I don't have a motor.

1136
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,080
You.

1137
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,640
Then...

1138
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Motor.

1139
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,360
I don't know.

1140
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,640
Don't ask me.

1141
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,400
Then ask, "Do you want to date?"

1142
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,640
Do you want to date?

1143
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,840
Do you want to date?

1144
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,480
I've already been with you for three months.

1145
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,520
I like fresh relationships.

1146
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,880
Sure.

1147
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,760
Then ask you...

1148
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,320
Are you hungry today?

1149
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,840
Are you hungry?

1150
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,160
I say I'm very hungry.

1151
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,440
What do you want to eat?

1152
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,560
And that...

1153
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,880
Meat.

1154
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Stop talking.

1155
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,240
Then ask, "Did you drive?"

1156
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,680
He says, "I didn't drive."

1157
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,880
I drove.

1158
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,560
I drove.

1159
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,520
But my car doesn't have a motor.

1160
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,200
No.

1161
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,600
That's epic.

1162
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,560
So accurate.

1163
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,000
So accurate.

1164
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,440
That's awesome.

1165
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,560
It all came full circle.

1166
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,440
See?

1167
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,600
I said my bro's got it.

1168
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,720
My bro's really got it.

1169
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,080
This is a road movie.

1170
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,960
I don't have a motor.

1171
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,240
I want to date.

1172
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,680
But I've been dating you for three months.

1173
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,320
I want a fresh relationship.

1174
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,240
I want to eat roujiamo.

1175
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,480
I'll take you.

1176
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,000
Then you say...

1177
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,960
I don't have a motor.

1178
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,200
Then let's order delivery.

1179
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,320
Perfect.

1180
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,400
Deserve to be "starved."

1181
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,360
Really.

1182
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,960
Game over already.

1183
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,640
Come on.

1184
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,560
Gotta stand up.

1185
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:43,960
Come on.

1186
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,120
Lin Yi is the last one up.

1187
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,320
Do you have a motor?

1188
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,920
Motor.

1189
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,520
Right.

1190
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,720
I don't have a motor.

1191
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,600
I want to date.

1192
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,040
I've dated for three months.

1193
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,640
Are you hungry?

1194
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,840
I'll take you to eat roujiamo.

1195
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,240
But I don't have a motor.

1196
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,960
A motor is a...

1197
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,360
It's a...

1198
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,000
Currency, right?

1199
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,160
We use Mada for transactions.

1200
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,440
I'm really impressed.

1201
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,040
The currency of Madagascar.

1202
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
It's called Mada for short.

1203
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,800
Okay.

1204
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,320
You get it now, right?

1205
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,440
I haven't memorized it yet.

1206
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,840
It doesn't matter if you remember.

1207
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,920
Alright, whatever.

1208
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,040
Lin Yi, just remember this.

1209
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,640
Doesn't matter.

1210
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,440
Doesn't matter.

1211
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,720
Doesn't matter.

1212
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,160
Come on.

1213
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,560
Start your performance.

1214
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,400
Do you have any Mada?

1215
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,240
I don't have Mada.

1216
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,880
I want to fall in love.

1217
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,360
Why are you stuck to me?

1218
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,480
I've been in a relationship for three months.

1219
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,320
I want a fresh romance.

1220
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,240
Are you hungry?

1221
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,440
I'll take you to eat.

1222
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,320
Roujiamo.

1223
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,160
What's that?

1224
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's a bit like Tang Bohu.

1225
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,200
Pretty much.

1226
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,080
You're fine.

1227
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,720
No problem.

1228
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,920
I think this round, we

1229
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,080
are definitely losing.

1230
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,320
No need to even think about it.

1231
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,400
Naiven, who do you blame?

1232
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,960
What do you think?

1233
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,720
No idea.

1234
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,640
Let me tell you.

1235
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,200
Blame who? Blame him.

1236
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,080
Blame him.

1237
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,880
And this culprit, too.

1238
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,320
Adding fuel to the fire.

1239
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,960
How is it my fault?

1240
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,240
I exaggerated things.

1241
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,520
What if I say a few extra words

1242
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,960
and they still match, then what?

1243
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,400
It's got nothing to do with you.

1244
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,720
Doesn't matter.

1245
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,640
Absolutely not.

1246
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,760
Say it again.

1247
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,640
You say it.

1248
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,200
Come on, Junjun, say it.

1249
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,560
I'm really impressed.

1250
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,680
Two people.

1251
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,000
Are you crazy?

1252
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,680
Same.

1253
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:11,640
This is the same.

1254
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,560
Yeah, that's fine.

1255
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,400
It's not about having it or not.

1256
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,120
What exactly is Mada?

1257
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,720
Is Mada an adjective or a verb?

1258
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
Or is it a noun?

1259
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,240
I'll explain later.

1260
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,120
Are you crazy?

1261
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:23,960
Say it.

1262
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah, I'm crazy.

1263
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,280
I've never dated over three months.

1264
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,120
You're expired.

1265
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,040
You're not fresh.

1266
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,160
Not fun anymore.

1267
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,640
I don't like you anymore, okay?

1268
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,760
You're such a baffling woman.

1269
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,240
Is that my fault?

1270
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,000
By the time it got to me, it became

1271
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,880
a whole story, I feel.

1272
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,120
In such a short time, told a

1273
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,600
Roujiamo story.

1274
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,240
But "problem" is the key.

1275
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,840
What is Mada?

1276
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,640
Problem.

1277
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,360
Probably problem.

1278
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah, problem.

1279
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,880
Problem.

1280
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,120
How many words matched?

1281
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,520
Out of fifty-five words,

1282
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,400
fifteen matched.

1283
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,520
How about this then?

1284
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,320
Then let

1285
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Wen, you pass it on.

1286
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,080
You go first, okay?

1287
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,800
Okay.

1288
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,320
Alright.

1289
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,360
Because it's a bit abstract, you know?

1290
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,600
Actually, it's not bad.

1291
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,920
That's pretty accurate.

1292
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,160
It's just the Cantonese part.

1293
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,720
Tang Bohu and "you're crazy" are the same.

1294
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,720
You go first.

1295
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,040
You, let him go first.

1296
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,720
You go first.

1297
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,200
Go ahead.

1298
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,960
I'll go second.

1299
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,520
What about me?

1300
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,360
You sit in the back.

1301
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,480
Why?

1302
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,760
So I can't sit anywhere?

1303
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,000
Xingxu.

1304
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,000
He sits last.

1305
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,720
I believe in you, Xingxu.

1306
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,880
It's not that hard, right?

1307
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,760
I can speak Xi'an dialect.

1308
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,400
Wait, right?

1309
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,960
Hurry up.

1310
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,080
Hurry up.

1311
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,120
So explosive.

1312
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,960
I will defeat the Fairy Queen.

1313
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,120
Become the strongest fairy in the realm.

1314
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,360
Fairy Castle.

1315
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,440
It will be the Dark God's world.

1316
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,440
The whole world belongs to the Dark God.

1317
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,480
No, this, I...

1318
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,720
Our winning standard is

1319
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,600
all words must match, right?

1320
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:20,960
Right.

1321
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,040
Okay.

1322
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,520
Let me count how many there are.

1323
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1324
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,720
I'll do the Shaanxi dialect version.

1325
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,800
I will defeat the Fairy Queen.

1326
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,760
Become the strongest fairy in the realm.

1327
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,960
I will defeat the Fairy Queen.

1328
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,720
Become the strongest fairy in the realm.

1329
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,480
Fairy Castle.

1330
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,360
It will be the Dark God's world.

1331
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:46,920
Fairy Castle.

1332
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,600
It will be the Dark God's world.

1333
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,160
The whole world belongs to the Dark God.

1334
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,080
The whole world.

1335
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,040
Is also the Dark God's world.

1336
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,560
Me.

1337
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,600
No need to watch this, I realize.

1338
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,320
Okay.

1339
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,320
Status.

1340
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,000
I will defeat the Fairy Queen.

1341
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,920
Become the strongest fairy in the realm.

1342
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,920
Dark Magic Fairy

1343
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,400
I am the Magic Fairy Castle

1344
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
The Dark God's world now

1345
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
The whole world is mine too

1346
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,880
The Dark God's world now

1347
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,160
Okay

1348
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,960
I've seen it

1349
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,600
Alright

1350
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,400
Okay, it's my turn

1351
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,720
Looking down from above

1352
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,360
Okay

1353
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,480
Use both hands, both hands

1354
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,640
Stand up there

1355
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,840
Then hands like this

1356
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,280
Look like this, at someone turned dark

1357
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,080
Then look like this

1358
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,760
I will defeat the Magic Fairy Queen

1359
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,360
Become the top of Magic Fairy Castle

1360
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,760
What was it again

1361
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,560
What was it

1362
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,600
Oh my god

1363
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,000
My god

1364
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,400
I will defeat the Queen of Magic Fairy Castle

1365
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,800
Become the god of Magic Fairy Castle

1366
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,120
Yeah, that's about right

1367
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:14,920
And then there's one

1368
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,800
I am the Magic Fairy Castle

1369
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,320
It's the Dark Goddess's world now

1370
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,960
The whole world is ruled by the Dark Goddess

1371
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,280
Okay

1372
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:31,920
Really

1373
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,200
Quick

1374
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,320
Fast

1375
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,840
Looking down from upstairs

1376
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,400
I am the Dark Queen of Magic Fairy Castle

1377
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,520
I will defeat the Magic Fairy Queen

1378
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,240
I will defeat the Dark God

1379
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,640
Become the Queen's god in Magic Fairy Castle

1380
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,200
Feels like the role changed

1381
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,200
Yeah

1382
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,160
How did I become the good guy

1383
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,320
I am the Dark Queen of Magic Fairy Castle

1384
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,480
I will defeat all dark magic in the world

1385
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,760
Become the god of Magic Fairy Castle

1386
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,680
No one below said anything

1387
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,960
No one spoke

1388
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,600
What's Magic Fairy Castle

1389
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,400
Look down

1390
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:23,960
Look below

1391
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,280
Laugh

1392
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,800
I am the goddess of Dark Magic Fairy Castle

1393
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:30,800
I will defeat

1394
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,720
Is this "Balala the Little Magic Fairy"?

1395
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,920
I will defeat all dark magic in the world

1396
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,880
Then become dark

1397
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,120
How did this turn into rap

1398
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,200
This really sounds like "Kylin"

1399
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,880
I want to stand on my

1400
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,360
Strike a pose

1401
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,560
I will defeat all dark magic in the world

1402
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,760
Then become dark

1403
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,080
I will defeat all dark magic in the world

1404
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,040
Become the god of Magic Fairy Castle

1405
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,840
Four "ha"s

1406
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,880
Can you say it slower

1407
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,520
It's just that fast

1408
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,720
I'm the coolest in the universe

1409
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,160
I'm the most powerful magic goddess in the universe

1410
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,880
I will defeat all dark magic

1411
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,280
Then become Magic Fairy Castle

1412
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:10,720
So fast

1413
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,400
He wants to become Magic Fairy Castle

1414
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,520
Why does he want to be a building

1415
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,280
Alright

1416
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,120
He's got issues, right

1417
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,640
He should

1418
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,240
What is Magic Fairy Castle anyway

1419
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,480
Look below

1420
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,080
Look down first

1421
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,320
After looking down

1422
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,960
I want to become this Magic Fairy Castle

1423
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,720
The most powerful goddess

1424
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,440
Defeat the dark magic in this Magic Fairy Castle

1425
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,440
Then add a line about Balala the Little Magic Fairy

1426
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,560
Dark magic transforms the whole body

1427
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,400
Maybe that's right

1428
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,600
Don't add extra stuff

1429
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,520
Darn it

1430
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,800
Something went wrong

1431
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
This really went wrong

1432
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,880
This is definitely going wrong

1433
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,640
What's up

1434
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,280
It's serious

1435
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,320
I want to look down at the little magic fairies below

1436
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,240
I want to be in Magic Fairy Castle

1437
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,320
The baddest woman

1438
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,360
Turned into a villain again

1439
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,920
Balala-la-la-la

1440
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,560
I did my best

1441
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,480
Okay, that's enough

1442
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Aren't you the best at this

1443
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,520
Isn't this your thing, anime

1444
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,000
Right?

1445
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,160
You've definitely seen this one

1446
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,600
He Ge's good, he gets it

1447
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,520
I want to look down in here

1448
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,640
This

1449
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,760
I want to look down at the little magic fairies below

1450
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,480
It's like a god's-eye view

1451
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,400
I want to be the top of this Magic Fairy Castle

1452
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,080
The most powerful little woman

1453
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,840
It has to be you, Liu Ge

1454
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,560
Balala the Little Magic Fairy, transform

1455
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,960
Balala the Little Magic Fairy, transform

1456
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,280
Balala the Little Magic Fairy, transform

1457
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,760
That's the idea

1458
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,040
That's not right

1459
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,400
That's right

1460
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,840
This, I just

1461
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,760
I don't know

1462
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,040
It looks pretty abstract to me

1463
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,240
You can make up more lines

1464
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,040
This one you can make up

1465
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,040
Even making up lines now

1466
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,520
Wait, let me think before starting

1467
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,280
It's over.

1468
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,040
No.

1469
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:40,960
I haven't started yet.

1470
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,760
Not yet.

1471
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,840
It's a bit too abstract.

1472
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
He acted it out for me, anyway.

1473
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,720
I want to overlook this Magic Fairy Castle.

1474
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,280
There are so many fairies in the Magic Fairy Castle.

1475
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,840
Now I want to be in this Magic Fairy Castle

1476
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,640
as the most powerful fairy.

1477
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,360
Fairy.

1478
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,880
Balala Little Magic Fairy.

1479
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,800
Transform!

1480
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,160
Balala.

1481
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,280
Balala balala balala.

1482
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,560
Today, as fairy sisters,

1483
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,080
we've come to Xi'an.

1484
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,040
Let's go eat a Roujiamo together.

1485
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,280
But I don't have a motor.

1486
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,160
No motor.

1487
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,080
I don't have a motor.

1488
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,360
It's fine.

1489
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,720
I'll conjure up a motor.

1490
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,320
Balala balala.

1491
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,200
Right.

1492
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,960
Right.

1493
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,680
I get it.

1494
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,240
So many "ha"s.

1495
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,600
Brother He.

1496
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,040
Brother He, hurry and improvise.

1497
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,400
Quick!

1498
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,640
Found the soul of it.

1499
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,680
Yes.

1500
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,320
Laughing like crazy.

1501
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,480
Just pretend you have a motor.

1502
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,440
Just keep laughing nonstop.

1503
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,720
See?

1504
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,320
I have a Magic Fairy Castle.

1505
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,520
He has a Magic Fairy Castle.

1506
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,880
I want to be the strongest fairy in the Magic Fairy Castle.

1507
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,880
Babala la ba.

1508
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,960
Sure, a bit more is fine.

1509
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,720
Babala la la balala.

1510
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,640
Little Magic Fairy.

1511
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,440
Little Magic Fairy, transform!

1512
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,960
Wakaka, transform!

1513
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,680
Wakaka.

1514
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,440
Yes.

1515
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,160
Yes, keep laughing.

1516
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,880
Anyway, that's right.

1517
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,440
Yes.

1518
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,360
Anyway, it's right.

1519
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,320
Anyway, just laugh.

1520
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,680
Yes, laughing is right.

1521
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,320
Little Magic Fairy is definitely right.

1522
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,280
No Little Magic Fairy.

1523
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,120
No Little Magic Fairy.

1524
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,880
No Little Magic Fairy.

1525
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,560
Who got it wrong?

1526
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,360
When it got to me, I was the villain.

1527
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,040
When it got to Junjun, it became the hero.

1528
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,680
We need to defeat the villain.

1529
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,480
Then it turned into the hero again.

1530
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,760
Then it became the villain again.

1531
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,240
Then it turned into the hero.

1532
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,080
Both good and evil.

1533
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,320
It's about the types of roles we fit.

1534
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,520
Can't tell who's supposed to defeat whom, really.

1535
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,800
Let me check if the first round had any issues.

1536
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,160
It's "overlook."

1537
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,280
But "overlook" is a narration.

1538
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,480
It's not that word.

1539
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,560
No idea who added this under "overlook."

1540
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,280
It got added in.

1541
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,720
I want to overlook the Little Magic Fairies below.

1542
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,800
I want to defeat the Magic Fairy Queen.

1543
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,200
Become the strongest fairy in the magic world.

1544
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,400
I am the Magic Fairy Castle.

1545
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,240
It's the Dark God's world now.

1546
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,520
The whole world.

1547
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,720
It's also the Dark God's world.

1548
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,840
Haha, that's right.

1549
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,920
Then the problem's with you.

1550
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm telling you.

1551
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,360
The second person always has a problem.

1552
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,040
No, it was right when I passed it to him.

1553
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,680
Then it's Jun Gong's problem.

1554
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,800
I just forgot.

1555
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,200
It was right when I passed it to him.

1556
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,400
Then it's Brother Naiwen's problem.

1557
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,080
I passed it correctly.

1558
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,680
How did I not know I should argue about this?

1559
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,720
I was right last round too.

1560
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,160
Sixty-five words in total.

1561
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,040
Twenty "ha"s out of sixty-five words.

1562
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,360
That's great.

1563
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,000
All correct.

1564
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,120
With all twenty "ha"s correct,

1565
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,520
You got thirty-four words right.

1566
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,880
Just passed.

1567
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,600
Team spirit.

1568
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:18,920
Okay.

1569
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,400
Congratulations, everyone, challenge complete!

1570
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,640
Let's go eat at Xi'an Fanzhuang now.

1571
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,560
Let's go.

1572
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,480
Set off!

1573
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,640
So tired, so thirsty.

1574
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,560
Xi'an is way more popular than I imagined.

1575
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,160
Yuwen.

1576
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,600
You don't look quite right.

1577
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,720
Game basics.

1578
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,240
Physical exhaustion isn't basic.

1579
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,360
My energy crashed right at the start today.

1580
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,920
What are we going to do later?

1581
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,720
How about you use that child safety leash?

1582
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,720
You can lead me.

1583
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,120
Maybe that's what you need.

1584
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,920
Is it this one?

1585
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,440
Bro gets me.

1586
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,400
So refreshing.

1587
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,440
This is exactly what I like.

1588
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,920
My energy came right back.

1589
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
Isn't it always gotta be Pulse?

1590
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,840
It's gotta be Pulse.

1591
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,760
Stay energized.

1592
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,240
Only then can we be full of energy. Let's go.

1593
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,840
Let's go.

1594
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,680
I see you.

1595
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:04,880
Where are you?

1596
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,400
Jun.

1597
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,520
Where is Junjun?

1598
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,880
Such deep eyes.

1599
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,600
Watching us.

1600
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,000
Stop, stop it.

1601
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,920
There's more here.

1602
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,040
Why is there more behind?

1603
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,240
This sign.

1604
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,280
This city wall is really...

1605
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:24,240
Right.

1606
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,960
Which character from "Water Margin"
do you like?

1607
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,760
Lin Chong. I want to play Lin Chong.

1608
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,280
Lin Chong, the Panther Head.

1609
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,280
Who does Lin Yi want to play?

1610
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:30,920
In "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"...

1611
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,560
I think he could play Zhao Zilong.

1612
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,040
Zhao Yun.

1613
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,960
Zhao Yun is so cool. Zhao Yun.

1614
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,600
What about He-ge? Who would he play?

1615
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,960
He could play Guan Yu.

1616
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,400
Guan Yu.

1617
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,840
Fell asleep. Everyone's asleep.

1618
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,680
Why are we talking about this now?

1619
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,040
Did I miss something?

1620
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,360
You missed a big part.

1621
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Let bro go.

1622
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,480
Next door, "Dream of the Red Chamber".

1623
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,240
Go play Baochai.

1624
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,200
Baochai.

1625
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,600
I'll play Wu Dalang.

1626
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,800
No way.

1627
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,960
Then I won't play Wu Dalang.

1628
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,480
Not playing Wu Dalang.

1629
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,360
Wu Song fights the tiger.

1630
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,040
Tiger fighting a lion.

1631
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,280
I've seen it.

1632
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,480
Why are we talking about this now?

1633
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,560
Did I miss something?

1634
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,000
The lion has no part at all.

1635
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,040
Naiven-ge, say it together.

1636
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,120
Tiger fights lion.

1637
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,760
I thought it was a cold joke.

1638
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,160
Thought we were guessing something.

1639
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,920
Essential oil spa, right?

1640
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,880
Essence what?

1641
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,840
Wet what?

1642
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,800
Guess the idiom.

1643
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,040
Essential oil spa.

1644
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,920
I think essential oil spa is

1645
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,680
pretty high-end.

1646
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,120
Haven't told a cold joke in ages.

1647
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
So this one...

1648
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,080
You're playing cold, right?

1649
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,120
This part is a highlight.

1650
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,840
What should we do?

1651
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,240
Impressive.

1652
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,960
Too cold.

1653
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,080
I really am cold.

1654
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:02,720
Who's the silliest?

1655
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,440
Which one is the silliest?

1656
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,760
Not B.

1657
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,960
No.

1658
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,760
No, let me think.

1659
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,040
CDEFG.

1660
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,240
It's fine, I'll announce it.

1661
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,600
Yes.

1662
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,080
Right.

1663
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,600
But we're the silliest.

1664
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,160
We're here.

1665
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,800
Let's go.

1666
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,520
Show off eating.

1667
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:34,960
Hungry.

1668
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,360
Come eat now.

1669
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,200
Hurry, I'm starving, guys.

1670
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,680
I'll sit down first.

1671
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,760
Quick.

1672
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,400
Quick, everyone.

1673
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,120
I'm so hungry, I'm ready.

1674
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,240
I'm already ready.

1675
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,960
Ready to eat.

1676
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,640
Smells this good?

1677
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,960
So much delicious food.

1678
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,920
Let's welcome the Chinese culinary master.

1679
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,000
Shaanxi cuisine heritage inheritor.

1680
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,200
Master Xu Haijun.

1681
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,680
He's also our head chef tonight.

1682
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,000
Let me briefly introduce.

1683
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,480
Hello, Master.

1684
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,800
Hello, everyone.

1685
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,520
Welcome to Xi'an Fanzhuang.

1686
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,400
Let me introduce to you

1687
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,440
several Shaanxi dishes today.

1688
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,200
The first is lamb leg.

1689
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,680
It's called Sunset over Mount Li.

1690
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,200
Made with northern Shaanxi lamb leg.

1691
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,480
Crispy outside, tender inside.

1692
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,920
It's a dish from the Chang'an Eight Views Banquet.

1693
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,720
Chang'an Eight Views Banquet.

1694
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,400
It's Xi'an Fanzhuang's

1695
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,800
special banquet.

1696
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,040
This dish is scenery in food.

1697
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,160
Food in scenery.

1698
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,560
Next is Gourd Chicken.

1699
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,600
Gourd Chicken.

1700
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,960
This is one of Shaanxi's top ten dishes.

1701
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,840
It's ranked number one.

1702
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,320
It has a long history.

1703
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,560
Originated in the Tang Dynasty.

1704
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,680
Golden color, crispy outside, tender inside.

1705
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,560
Bones fall off easily.

1706
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,440
Master, what is this?

1707
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,560
You're holding this dish.

1708
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,880
It's one of our snacks.

1709
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,880
Called Bubble Oil Cake.

1710
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,200
Originally named "Jian Feng Xiao".

1711
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,440
Milky white, sweet and soft.

1712
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,880
Bubbles thin as cicada wings.

1713
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,800
So delicate, it bursts with a touch.

1714
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,960
Another dish is this fish.

1715
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,880
This is a palace dish.

1716
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,000
Called Palace Tribute Fish.

1717
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,240
What's in the middle?

1718
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,560
It's fish paste in the middle.

1719
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,560
Two ways to eat one fish.

1720
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,320
Carefully made, beautiful, fresh and tender.

1721
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,120
Quite unique.

1722
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,520
Please enjoy.

1723
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,840
Thank you.

1724
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,080
Thank you, Master.

1725
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,680
Thank you.

1726
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,880
We can eat now, right?

1727
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,440
We can eat.

1728
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,600
Alright, this one.

1729
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,360
This lamb is good.

1730
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,600
This lamb is excellent.

1731
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,400
Delicious.

1732
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:35,920
Let's eat together.

1733
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:37,920
Okay.

1734
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:40,720
Get some of this.

1735
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:41,920
What's this?

1736
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,400
Barbecue.

1737
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,640
Move this over here.

1738
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:47,760
Okay.

1739
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,040
This is really delicious.

1740
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,960
The popcorn, that corner on the mountain.

1741
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,480
I ate all of it.

1742
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,360
It's truly tasty.

1743
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:03,960
Let me try.

1744
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,240
Honglei just said it's good too.

1745
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,080
It really is delicious.

1746
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,120
This is so tasty.

1747
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:12,480
Really?

1748
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,280
Did he really say that?

1749
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,960
It's kind of like candied hawthorn, that good.

1750
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,160
This is amazing, seriously.

1751
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:19,960
You should try this.

1752
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,040
Is that an artificial hill? Is it...

1753
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,680
This is the city wall of Xi'an people.

1754
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,080
Tasty.

1755
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,240
Really delicious.

1756
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,760
It tastes a bit like caramel.

1757
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,400
Yeah, because every piece

1758
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,920
is evenly coated.

1759
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,920
That's why it's so good.

1760
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,080
Look, the chef is watching outside.

1761
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,080
He says, "My display is gone, all eaten."

1762
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,440
Feels so accomplished.

1763
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,560
This is the mini version.

1764
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,680
Is this the baby roujiamo?

1765
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,480
So delicious.

1766
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,440
It's just too good.

1767
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,040
This smells amazing.

1768
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,040
This chili is especially fragrant.

1769
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,600
Is this one of those super long noodles?

1770
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,240
It really is long.

1771
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,400
Just one strand.

1772
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,080
We're all dieting, so just one today.

1773
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,560
Tell people, "I only had one noodle."

1774
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,560
This looks pretty tasty.

1775
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,080
There's fermented rice inside.

1776
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,840
Fermented rice ice cream.

1777
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,960
This fermented rice looks delicious.

1778
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:56,920
Tasty.

1779
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,680
If you opened a shop in Europe, there'd be a long line.

1780
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,040
Fermented rice ice cream.

1781
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,680
Compare this to what He made.

1782
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,880
He’s was unbeatable.

1783
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,960
When He’s braised pork arrived,

1784
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,600
Everyone said no carbs at first.

1785
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,040
But everyone grabbed a big plate of rice.

1786
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,280
Then poured the sauce

1787
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,160
right on top.

1788
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,640
After Lin Yi finished, he was carb-dazed.

1789
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,200
Just sat there.

1790
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,960
Seriously, so good, really delicious.

1791
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,640
What did I miss this time?

1792
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,880
When did you ever make braised pork?

1793
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,640
Yeah.

1794
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,280
You have no idea.

1795
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,480
Forgot.

1796
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,040
You missed the lamb soup too.

1797
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,960
Ning made the lamb soup.

1798
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,440
Yeah.

1799
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,360
Before, we only had hotpot once.

1800
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:34,880
Right?

1801
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:35,720
Right.

1802
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:37,680
Just that one time.

1803
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,440
No one cooked.

1804
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,800
Only Yun Ning cooked a bit.

1805
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,000
He.

1806
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
He didn’t cook that day either.

1807
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,800
He just sat on the stool.

1808
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,520
Didn’t cook.

1809
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,200
Just stir-fried some beef.

1810
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,640
Just stir-fried.

1811
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,600
I drank.

1812
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,840
He sat on the stool.

1813
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,320
Sat on the stool.

1814
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,120
Gong Jun.

1815
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,280
While you were away,

1816
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,880
we ate the best meals.

1817
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,480
Like this.

1818
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,880
Tomorrow, these guys will cook for you.

1819
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,480
For real?

1820
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:10,840
Really.

1821
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,240
He’s braised pork,

1822
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,760
I think we have to recreate it.

1823
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,120
Tomorrow.

1824
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,520
This is a classic.

1825
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,160
I think we can.

1826
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,440
Let Ning handle the soup and all that.

1827
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,360
He’ll make you a big lamb soup.

1828
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,400
No problem.

1829
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,160
The lamb soup here, in every way,

1830
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,760
is incredible.

1831
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,120
Yeah.

1832
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,640
That lamb was amazing.

1833
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,440
Are you cooking tomorrow?

1834
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,440
Mom’s braised eggplant, right?

1835
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,680
If you do, let’s switch it up.

1836
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,560
That dish is pretty tiring.

1837
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,800
You care about me too much.

1838
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,040
No, it’s mainly He who gets tired.

1839
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,760
Shake it up, shake me, shake to me.

1840
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,000
Naiwen’s fine.

1841
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,200
It’s He who gets tired.

1842
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,920
How many meals did you guys have?

1843
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,560
Watch the main episode.

1844
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,160
Now I know how too.

1845
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,000
This really kills and crushes the heart.

1846
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,800
You learned it, right?

1847
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,240
Alright, I give in, seriously.

1848
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,280
Welcome home

1849
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,680
Come on, come

1850
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,880
Welcome home

1851
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,160
Come

1852
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,280
Come

1853
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,640
Home

1854
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:15,680
Alright

1855
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:16,800
Everyone's here

1856
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,920
Nine Calabash Brothers

1857
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,880
Everyone knows

1858
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,479
Xi'an has another label

1859
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,760
It's music

1860
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,319
The deep culture of the thirteen dynasties

1861
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,600
also makes musicians here

1862
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,720
good at expressing

1863
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,439
their thoughts in their works

1864
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,600
During its most prosperous times

1865
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,080
music and poetry

1866
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,319
were part of daily life

1867
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,200
Singing became for Xi'an people

1868
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
a natural habit

1869
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,720
and a way to express feelings

1870
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,160
For people in Xi'an

1871
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,800
music is the background left by history

1872
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,880
It's a cultural gene in their blood

1873
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,160
So now that we're in Xi'an

1874
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,120
let's do a

1875
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,680
singing-related challenge

1876
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,560
We're singing again

1877
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,920
Two guessers watch the others perform

1878
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,880
and pick out the two real singers

1879
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,760
Each correct guess earns a point

1880
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,760
If they don't guess right

1881
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,000
the others get the point

1882
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,520
Okay

1883
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,640
The lowest scorer

1884
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,080
must try Xi'an's special food

1885
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,080
Grilled sheep's eye

1886
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:12,840
That's scary

1887
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,680
Black eyeball

1888
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,439
Why is this sheep's eye so small

1889
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,040
Sheep pupils are really odd

1890
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,200
They're rectangular

1891
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:21,439
Try one

1892
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,000
Eat sheep's eye, you'll look better

1893
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,040
Come on

1894
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,800
This round, we'll have

1895
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,319
a surprise strategy

1896
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:33,880
Alright

1897
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,960
How about you sing for real

1898
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,680
Okay

1899
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,000
How to make it look real

1900
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:41,760
Force the breath

1901
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,840
You have to hold it in

1902
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,720
Tense your neck

1903
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,120
I want to try a new approach

1904
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:49,920
Go for a quiet style

1905
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:52,240
Don't do that

1906
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,320
My passion

1907
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,800
is like a fire

1908
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,280
burning through the desert

1909
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,920
When the sun sees me

1910
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,080
it hides from me

1911
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,040
It fears me too

1912
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,440
This fire of love

1913
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,160
Make them all eat sheep's eye

1914
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,680
Come on

1915
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,400
Peeking

1916
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,480
Like a fire

1917
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,240
burning through the desert

1918
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,920
When the sun sees me, it will

1919
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,440
Rock

1920
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,400
hide from me

1921
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,360
It fears this fire of love

1922
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:38,960
Okay

1923
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,080
Sit

1924
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,720
Flower of youth

1925
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,920
I sing out loud

1926
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,160
You harmonize softly

1927
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,080
I think

1928
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,680
He's a bit delayed

1929
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:02,320
Xiao Ai lost in the desert's love

1930
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,440
Sit

1931
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,440
Don't get so close

1932
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,360
Alright, got it

1933
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:28,760
Next

1934
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,440
Sing like this

1935
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,400
Neck, cover your neck

1936
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,840
Sing rock

1937
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,400
You're off-key

1938
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,200
Sit down

1939
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:21,680
Xingxu

1940
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,240
Not just staring because it looks good

1941
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,200
We're guessing, you know

1942
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,000
Don't look

1943
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,960
Don't just keep staring because it's nice

1944
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,280
Okay, I'm exhausted

1945
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,600
Let's do it together

1946
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,680
You two sit

1947
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,440
We're a real dream team

1948
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,920
Feels like no one sang

1949
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,640
Ning, your turn

1950
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,440
Honglei

1951
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,200
Are you watching the show

1952
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,720
No, not yet

1953
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,320
Everyone sing

1954
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,080
My passion

1955
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,040
is like a fire

1956
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,200
burning through the desert

1957
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,440
When the sun sees me

1958
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,120
it hides from me

1959
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,160
It fears this fire of love

1960
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,360
I got it

1961
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,480
Alright, stop

1962
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,240
You got it

1963
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:50,720
Go ahead

1964
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,560
You got it

1965
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,360
I think I know

1966
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,480
Feels like you're just watching

1967
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,640
I feel

1968
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,400
I can only guess

1969
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,560
Ning and

1970
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:04,960
Big bro

1971
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,200
Ning and Big bro

1972
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,160
Eliminated

1973
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,320
Come on

1974
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:16,920
I'll listen to you

1975
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,360
Listen to me

1976
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,280
Really couldn't guess

1977
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,200
Jun and Didi

1978
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,200
Climax, go

1979
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:34,840
Keep going

1980
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,200
Just you two

1981
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,280
Come on

1982
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,760
Listen to me

1983
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,240
Looks like we can't hide it, Ayi

1984
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:41,800
Can't hide it

1985
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,480
Started singing

1986
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,520
One by one, come on

1987
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,080
One by one

1988
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:45,680
One by one

1989
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:51,880
Next

1990
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:55,960
Definitely not him

1991
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,760
I know it's not him

1992
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,680
Keep going

1993
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,280
Naiwen

1994
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,520
High

1995
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,360
Really high

1996
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,880
Ready, go

1997
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,720
Not a single one guessed right.

1998
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,480
We missed them all perfectly.

1999
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,720
All the correct answers.

2000
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,720
Chen Xingxu was so confident.

2001
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,880
I got it.

2002
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,600
I got it.

2003
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,400
I got it.

2004
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,800
I feel like I know it.

2005
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,960
You two, sit down.

2006
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,960
When I play this game,

2007
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,320
I've never lost this badly.

2008
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,520
Never lost this badly before.

2009
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,440
Big bro.

2010
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,240
Second bro.

2011
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,080
I dragged you down.

2012
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,080
Me too.

2013
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,800
Us.

2014
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,600
Eye Candy Team, come up here.

2015
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,360
Come up here.

2016
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,000
We two eat eyes to fix our eyes.

2017
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,680
Give us two skewers.

2018
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,080
Sure, no problem.

2019
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,280
I'm fine with it.

2020
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,240
This is grilled pretty dry.

2021
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,600
Try one.

2022
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,560
Join in for one.

2023
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,360
You join in.

2024
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,080
I'll try it.

2025
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,320
I'll try a skewer, come on.

2026
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,040
This is really good.

2027
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:13,960
So delicious.

2028
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,400
It's just okay.

2029
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:15,720
It's okay.

2030
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,040
No weird taste at all.

2031
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,800
Kind of like tendon.

2032
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,720
Has that tendon texture.

2033
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,640
Not as good as the one you stewed.

2034
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,040
Not as tasty as your stew.

2035
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,920
After everyone finished the tasty lamb eyes,

2036
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,320
we're heading now to

2037
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,360
visit the Xi'an Museum.

2038
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,240
Xi'an Museum

2039
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,000
is a national first-class museum.

2040
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,320
It houses Xi'an's

2041
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,880
artifacts from every historical era.

2042
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,360
By the end of 2022,

2043
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,800
Xi'an Museum had 113,977 items.

2044
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,760
Among them, 11,612 are precious relics.

2045
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,160
To enrich the exhibitions,

2046
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,480
and showcase the ancient capital's history,

2047
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,680
the museum uses modern digital technology

2048
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,400
to let visitors truly

2049
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,960
feel the pulse of Xi'an's culture.

2050
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:52,960
Now we

2051
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:53,840
let's go.

2052
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,600
Go.

2053
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,080
Who ordered takeout?

2054
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,480
I did.

2055
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,960
Why does it smell so good?

2056
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,480
I specially ordered Dicos.

2057
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,160
Their signature Volcano Pineapple Burger.

2058
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,400
Pineapple with chicken.

2059
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:03,880
Perfect match.

2060
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,000
This meat is huge.

2061
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:08,640
Tasty.

2062
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,200
And their top item, the drumstick.

2063
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,040
It's enormous.

2064
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:12,760
Let's eat a drumstick.

2065
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,240
I really loved eating this as a kid.

2066
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,200
I want to eat it all.

2067
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:18,760
So delicious.

2068
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,760
I'll share some with everyone later.

2069
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,000
Let's go.

2070
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,600
Alright, let's go.

2071
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,600
Let's go, He-ge.

2072
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:22,800
Go.

2073
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,880
At Xi'an Museum,

2074
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,400
we'll start a journey through a thousand years.

2075
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,200
Arriving at Yongning Gate Ancient City Wall,

2076
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,920
we'll listen together to Chang'an's glory.

2077
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,080
We're here.

2078
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,720
Hello.

2079
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,800
Welcome, everyone.

2080
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,120
Hello.

2081
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,960
Let me introduce myself first.

2082
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,240
I am from the Xi'an Museum.

2083
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,440
Guide number 007.

2084
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,440
My name is Li Qianxin.

2085
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,680
So you're the "glasses guy"?

2086
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,040
That's me.

2087
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,000
How did you know?

2088
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,200
Well...

2089
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,360
How do you think I knew?

2090
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,680
This place is called the Ancient Capital of Thirteen Dynasties.

2091
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:07,680
That's right.

2092
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,560
The lifeblood of thirteen dynasties' growth

2093
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,480
is actually right before our eyes.

2094
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,840
It's all laid out here.

2095
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,160
On the far left are Fengjing and Haojing.

2096
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,240
Those are city ruins from over three thousand years ago, in the Zhou dynasty.

2097
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,440
The ancient city remains.

2098
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,520
The yellow area marks the Qin dynasty capital.

2099
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,160
That's Xianyang.

2100
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,760
Below it is the famous Afang Palace.

2101
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,360
Afang Palace.

2102
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,960
"Afang Palace Rhapsody."

2103
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,440
It's said that in "Afang Palace Rhapsody,"

2104
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,080
Xiang Yu burned the palace to the ground.

2105
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,360
But...

2106
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,880
Archaeologists can uncover the real truth.

2107
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,120
In 2003,

2108
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,920
experts from the Archaeological Institute

2109
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,840
finished excavating Afang Palace.

2110
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,920
One thing is clear:

2111
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,840
No large-scale burn marks were found.

2112
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,840
They found three walls of Afang Palace.

2113
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,400
But no south wall.

2114
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,960
Most likely, it was never finished.

2115
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,480
It was an abandoned project.

2116
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,840
The blame was shifted to

2117
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,840
Xiang Yu.

2118
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,320
This is different from what we learned in textbooks.

2119
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,360
There's a real contrast.

2120
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,920
So why was Afang Palace left unfinished?

2121
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,360
Experts are still studying this.

2122
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,320
Du Mu was from the Tang dynasty.

2123
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,640
He wrote about it long after.

2124
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,080
His essay came much later.

2125
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:10,800
So in all this,

2126
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,120
there's a lot to think about.

2127
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:12,920
Really a lot to consider.

2128
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,240
That's why

2129
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,400
visiting the museum matters.

2130
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,080
All the relics before us today

2131
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,760
from every era

2132
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,320
are messengers of their time,

2133
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,640
telling the true story.

2134
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,720
So by learning today,

2135
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,760
you can discover

2136
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,360
the real, accurate history of dynasties.

2137
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,400
Next,

2138
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,240
I'll give you a special introduction

2139
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,840
to the magnificent Chang'an in its prime.

2140
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,480
This is the grand Tang Chang'an.

2141
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,360
This model is based on archaeological reports

2142
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,480
and historical records.

2143
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,760
It's scaled down by one thousand five hundred times.

2144
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,840
Over one million people lived here.

2145
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,240
How did they manage such a city?

2146
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,840
The designer, Yu Wenkai,

2147
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,240
was truly ingenious.

2148
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,120
East, west, south, north—

2149
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,960
twenty-five streets in total.

2150
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,960
He divided the city into neat,

2151
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,240
over one hundred districts.

2152
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,560
Europe is also laid out in grids, right?

2153
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,000
Yes.

2154
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,120
See, we did the same.

2155
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,200
This district here—

2156
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
that's Xi'an's famous Yongxing District.

2157
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,360
Small Wild Goose Pagoda is in Anren District.

2158
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,640
Great Wild Goose Pagoda is in Jinchang District.

2159
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,480
With so many districts,

2160
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,480
did any survive to today?

2161
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,920
In 904, a huge fire

2162
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,360
Zhu Wen forced Emperor Zhaozong

2163
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,080
to move the capital to Luoyang.

2164
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,520
He set fire and burned it all down.

2165
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,200
The Small and Great Wild Goose Pagodas that remain today

2166
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,000
are truly lucky survivors.

2167
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,480
So in 2014,

2168
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,520
as Silk Road heritage sites,

2169
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,320
they were listed as World Heritage.

2170
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,320
Besides all this,

2171
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,640
besides the serious history,

2172
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,240
besides the serious history,

2173
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,200
there were many fun things too.

2174
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,960
People in the Tang dynasty, over a thousand years ago,

2175
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,520
could even eat

2176
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,280
ice cream,

2177
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,160
hot pot,

2178
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,920
and enjoy barbecue and sashimi.

2179
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,880
Three thousand years ago,

2180
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,440
we already had a local delicacy

2181
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,840
called mustard fish slices.

2182
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,280
Mustard sauce is wasabi.

2183
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,160
Fish slices are raw, thinly cut fish.

2184
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:02,720
Sashimi.

2185
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,360
It's actually similar to

2186
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,240
what we've learned.

2187
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:06,600
Right.

2188
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,440
This is part of cultural exchange.

2189
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,480
Some things

2190
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,720
we've left behind.

2191
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,800
But some countries

2192
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,480
that admired us

2193
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,480
thought it was great,

2194
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,480
so they kept those traditions.

2195
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,400
The central axis.

2196
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,280
This is connected to us.

2197
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,240
We're standing right on this street.

2198
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:24,680
Where are we?

2199
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,200
Where exactly?

2200
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,560
Small Wild Goose Pagoda is here.

2201
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,760
Our museum is here.

2202
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,720
Right in the center.

2203
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,880
Sometimes history feels

2204
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,560
so distant, so far from us.

2205
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,640
But when you stand here,

2206
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,760
you suddenly realize

2207
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,280
it's happening all around us.

2208
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,400
Maybe every step you take here

2209
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,440
overlaps with Li Bai, Du Fu, He Zhizhang,

2210
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,080
Wang Wei, and Meng Haoran.

2211
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,960
Tang Chang'an is a city

2212
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,360
we can never return to,

2213
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,520
but will never forget.

2214
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,080
This is one of our

2215
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,760
Xi'an Museum's most treasured artifacts.

2216
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,560
Cloud and Thunder Pattern Ding.

2217
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,480
Mr. Chen, please take a look first.

2218
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,480
Where is the cloud and thunder pattern?

2219
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,080
On the top.

2220
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:11,920
On the bottom.

2221
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,600
On the bottom.

2222
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,760
The cloud and thunder pattern is below.

2223
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,760
This lower part is the interlocking cloud and thunder pattern.

2224
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,080
The pattern above is Taotie.

2225
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:18,800
Taotie.

2226
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,720
It's the legendary

2227
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,160
monster known for its enormous appetite.

2228
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:22,880
That's me.

2229
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,640
He is the embodiment of Taotie.

2230
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,200
See how much you resemble the old days.

2231
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,000
But eating with this for a long time

2232
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,800
isn't really healthy.

2233
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,000
This is a vessel for eating.

2234
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,040
A ding is a cooking pot.

2235
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,360
It's used to cook meat.

2236
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,240
But

2237
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,560
it contains heavy metals inside.

2238
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,040
It's an alloy of copper, lead, and tin.

2239
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,000
Copper, lead, and tin.

2240
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,480
Right.

2241
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,120
Back then, nobles' average lifespan

2242
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:43,920
was just over thirty years.

2243
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,000
No one lived especially long.

2244
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,360
It was related to using these vessels.

2245
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,680
They didn't know which metals

2246
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,200
were non-toxic back then.

2247
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:51,800
The one behind is

2248
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,840
our museum's Yong Yu.

2249
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,240
It's a treasure because

2250
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,520
there are inscriptions inside.

2251
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,040
There are 123 characters on the inner base.

2252
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,520
You all are quite tall,

2253
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,800
so you can see it, but I can't.

2254
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:05,760
I can't see it either.

2255
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:06,640
No.

2256
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,280
It's right in the center.

2257
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,280
At the bottom.

2258
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,880
If you're not one eighty tall, you can't see it.

2259
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:18,960
Can't see it.

2260
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,880
This inscription gives a detailed explanation

2261
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,720
from two thousand nine hundred years ago

2262
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,720
to three thousand years ago.

2263
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,120
It’s from the mid to late Western Zhou

2264
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,240
and covers some farming laws and systems.

2265
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,800
So it holds great academic value.

2266
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,360
On the side, this is a long-nosed animal.

2267
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:34,760
Elephant.

2268
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,200
Elephant.

2269
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,400
Back then, raising elephants

2270
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,640
wasn’t just for show.

2271
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,400
They played a key role

2272
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,400
in warfare as

2273
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,400
mounts for cavalry.

2274
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,600
They were Asian elephants.

2275
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,840
Later, as the climate changed,

2276
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,720
elephants gradually migrated south.

2277
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,720
Now, they’re rarely seen inland.

2278
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,760
So by the Song dynasty,

2279
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,840
there were no elephants left here.

2280
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,680
Just imagine them living here long ago.

2281
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,600
There’s a word called

2282
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,480
“imagination.”

2283
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,120
This word is actually linked to elephants.

2284
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,000
Think of elephants.

2285
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,600
Think of elephants.

2286
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,200
Jade Cup with Interlocking Cloud Pattern.

2287
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,520
This is so beautiful.

2288
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,720
A jade cup from the Qin dynasty.

2289
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,600
It’s made of Hetian jade.

2290
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,280
Hetian jade.

2291
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,160
It’s China’s national jade.

2292
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,400
It has a fiery cloud-like look.

2293
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,640
That’s called “Qin se,” the jade’s hue.

2294
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,160
There are musical instruments here.

2295
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:23,840
Bianzhong (chime bells).

2296
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,560
Bianzhong.

2297
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,080
These are all mirrors here.

2298
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,160
This one is stunning.

2299
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,880
Below is a standing female figurine.

2300
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,680
Behind is the “Ladies with Hairpins” painting.

2301
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,240
This is jokingly called

2302
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,240
“Pop Mart from over four hundred years ago.”

2303
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,200
Actually, it was made to accompany

2304
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,120
one’s afterlife.

2305
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:41,880
So, in life,

2306
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,600
whatever army formation you had,

2307
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,160
you’d get a miniature set after death.

2308
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,680
I heard before you arrived

2309
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,280
that Teacher Chen He likes to drink.

2310
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,040
He Ge, you like drinking.

2311
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,800
Even the museum knows about it.

2312
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,080
But don’t tempt me.

2313
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,800
You said you’d let me have a sip.

2314
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,240
Such a huge jug.

2315
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,120
A whole jar.

2316
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,200
Twenty-six kilograms of Han dynasty wine.

2317
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,560
Let me have a taste.

2318
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,760
It’s not easy to get a cup now.

2319
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,120
It’s a liquid national treasure now.

2320
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,200
It’s kept in our storage at a constant temperature.

2321
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,280
We also have two “muscle men” here.

2322
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,600
Isn’t that you two?

2323
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,360
Chen Xingxu.

2324
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,360
This is a Sui dynasty yellow-glazed warrior figurine.

2325
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,520
It used to hold a long pole

2326
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,120
made of wood, either a ritual item or weapon.

2327
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,640
Some have already carbonized.

2328
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,720
So it looks a bit quirky and flamboyant.

2329
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,920
Here’s a little cutie from our museum.

2330
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,600
Netizens call it “Lue Lue Lue.”

2331
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,760
So cute! What is this?

2332
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,080
It really is adorable. What is it?

2333
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,600
It’s “Lue Lue Lue,” sticking its tongue out, right?

2334
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,080
It’s modeled after a wild boar.

2335
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,760
Designed as a tomb guardian beast.

2336
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,880
All of these are tomb guardian beasts.

2337
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,360
Tomb guardian beast.

2338
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,440
But it’s not any real species.

2339
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,400
It’s imagined.

2340
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:51,840
Imagined.

2341
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,120
It combines features of snakes, pigs,

2342
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,120
dogs, lions, and many other animals.

2343
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,080
Mixing animals together to intimidate others.

2344
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,360
The one behind is

2345
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,480
the Xi'an Museum’s prized treasure.

2346
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,840
Sancai Prancing Horse.

2347
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,160
This one is gorgeous.

2348
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,960
Currently in China,

2349
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,840
Sancai horses with all four hooves off the ground

2350
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,160
are extremely rare.

2351
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,440
It’s truly one of a kind.

2352
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,880
A unique collection piece.

2353
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,440
So beautiful.

2354
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,800
Look, its hair is parted in the middle

2355
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,720
and tied at the back.

2356
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,400
Why has this color

2357
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,040
lasted for so long?

2358
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,880
Because Tang sancai is fired twice.

2359
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,840
First, a plain firing.

2360
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,560
Then a glaze is added and it’s fired again.

2361
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,680
This glaze

2362
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,320
contains lead.

2363
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,840
Lead melts easily and flows downward when fired.

2364
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,320
So you see these flowing marks.

2365
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,120
But this flow

2366
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,480
actually looks like the horse’s mane.

2367
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:36,960
Yes.

2368
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,880
Some scholars believe

2369
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,120
it might represent the sweating Ferghana horse.

2370
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,440
The state of sweating.

2371
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:43,480
Right.

2372
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,120
So they purposely added more glaze

2373
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,160
around the horse’s neck.

2374
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,080
That’s true.

2375
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,760
There are no two

2376
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,080
identical Tang sancai pieces in the world.

2377
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,600
This is what we're looking at today.

2378
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,200
The last section: calligraphy and painting.

2379
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,520
Next is "Wangchuan Landscape".

2380
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,040
It depicts Wangchuan in Lantian.

2381
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,280
It's painted in the blue-green landscape style.

2382
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,920
It's called Shaanxi's version of "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains".

2383
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,320
Actually, time...

2384
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,080
Unknowingly, we've reached the Qing Dynasty.

2385
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,040
We started from the Zhou Dynasty.

2386
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,960
Every era has its own story.

2387
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,720
Quietly writing history.

2388
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,960
The artifacts we've discussed today

2389
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,080
are the most iconic of the Thirteen Dynasties.

2390
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,560
Because the Xi'an Museum's exhibition

2391
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,000
is centered on the ancient city of Xi'an,

2392
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,720
showing the history of its thirteen dynasties.

2393
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,560
Although the Xi'an Museum

2394
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,280
isn't a huge venue,

2395
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,880
in this small space,

2396
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,200
it holds three thousand years of civilization.

2397
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,840
The English word "history"

2398
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,160
can be split into two parts:

2399
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,600
"Hi" and "story".

2400
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,960
Alright, that's the end of my story today.

2401
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,600
Thank you, everyone.

2402
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,840
Thank you, teacher.

2403
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,200
Thank you, glasses bro.

2404
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,200
Thanks.

2405
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,440
You're always welcome to visit Chang'an.

2406
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:52,840
Okay.

2407
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,280
Alright.

2408
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,080
Thank you.

2409
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,080
Come to Chang'an often.

2410
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,000
Goodbye, Chang'an.

2411
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,440
Feels like traveling through time.

2412
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,360
So beautiful, really beautiful.

2413
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,520
Let's take a photo here, it's gorgeous.

2414
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,480
Photo time.

2415
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,600
Really.

2416
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,040
Come here.

2417
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:26,480
Come.

2418
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,840
It's great with Junjun here.

2419
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,920
Photos anytime, anywhere.

2420
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,440
We always have photos.

2421
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,200
Three, two, one.

2422
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,200
This city wall is truly...

2423
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,960
...impressive, like a fortress.

2424
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,000
Quick, stand tall.

2425
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:54,760
Sounds great.

2426
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,160
Thank you.

2427
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:56,560
Awesome.

2428
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,920
So wonderful.

2429
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,280
Amazing.

2430
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:58,840
Thanks.

2431
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,040
Our Xi'an Wind and Percussion Music

2432
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,160
is also a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

2433
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,440
It blends percussion and wind instruments

2434
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,560
in a large-scale musical genre.

2435
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,880
It's ancient Chinese music,

2436
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,800
a miracle in world folk music history.

2437
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,760
It's called a living fossil of ancient Chinese music.

2438
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,080
Ancient symphony.

2439
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,360
Xi'an Foreign Affairs Wind and Percussion Orchestra

2440
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,400
has performed in over twenty provinces.

2441
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,280
So we'll join them

2442
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,600
to perform "Song of Xi'an People" together.

2443
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,920
Let's start right away.

2444
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,320
Xi'an trains run beneath Xi'an's city walls.

2445
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,360
No matter where, Xi'an people must eat paomo.

2446
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,880
See, you can tell he's a karaoke king.

2447
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,800
That's how it is.

2448
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,640
At karaoke, it's always these two, I'm telling you.

2449
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,440
Alright, let's arrange ourselves.

2450
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,240
Step forward.

2451
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:43,960
Each person sings a line.

2452
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,080
Then we'll all join in for the chorus.

2453
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,200
Just like our "Super Fresh Earth" theme song.

2454
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:46,680
Just like our "Super Fresh Earth" theme song.

2455
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,280
Sound good?

2456
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:47,760
Sure.

2457
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,080
Let's do it once.

2458
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:50,560
Where do we start?

2459
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,960
Let's start with Yuning.

2460
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,400
Okay.

2461
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,920
Thank you.

2462
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,440
Super Fresh Earth

2463
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:53,320
The world is right before us.

2464
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,760
Today's our last undercover mission.

2465
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,760
I suspect Naiwen.

2466
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,960
He hasn't drawn yet.

2467
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:14,880
What are you doing?

2468
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,920
Why are you following me?

2469
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:16,800
I know you're definitely not it.

2470
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,360
Go away.

2471
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,560
Why did you say I didn't play?

2472
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,360
It's you.

2473
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:20,680
No, it's not.

2474
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,960
We're starting the meeting without even beating the gong.

2475
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,880
Sorry, I made a move.

2476
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,400
What?

2477
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:24,920
No one.

2478
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,320
What are you doing?

2479
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,760
I actually saw it myself.

2480
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,000
What's going on?

2481
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,280
So hard to guess.

2482
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,680
Then how did you know he was "killed"?

2483
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,520
Then I think Junjun is cleared now.

2484
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,320
Whatever, I don't care.

2485
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,280
Whatever, this round.

2486
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,240
Three, two, one.

2487
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:41,920
Let's make stir-fried pork.

2488
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,000
I've been waiting for this.

2489
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yes, it's already stewing.

2490
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,520
Chef Liu, your soup is amazing, really.

2491
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,520
Let's do surgery on the lamb.

2492
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,440
Did you scoop out the lamb's eye?

2493
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,240
It's very hot.

2494
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,480
Let's play "either-or".

2495
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,080
Xingxu and I.

2496
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:54,600
You.

2497
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,800
What's the question?

2498
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,960
Who do I pick, Didi or me?

2499
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,160
He barely hesitated.

2500
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,560
Let's wait for the question before talking.

2501
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,520
No problem.

2502
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,040
Yuning.

2503
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:04,720
Me and Chen Xingxu.

2504
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,000
We won.

2505
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,920
First glass, what do we do?

2506
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,920
First glass, a toast to ourselves.

2507
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,080
Bro.

2508
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:13,720
Why are you crying?

2509
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,360
It's all your fault.

2510
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,000
Super Fresh Earth

2511
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,400
The world is right before us.

2512
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,280
Next, let's do a dialect challenge.

2513
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,240
Luo Si

2514
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,120
Give me your hand.

2515
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,960
Shredded Pork with Green Peppers

2516
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,760
Give me your hand.

2517
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:35,920
Give me your hand.

2518
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,600
Luo Si, you're so cute.

2519
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,160
Are you sure this is Chinese?

2520
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:40,840
Luo Si

2521
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,440
Give me your hand.

2522
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,720
B A

2523
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,240
Give me your hand.

2524
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,120
Give it to him.

2525
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:48,560
Give it to him.

2526
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,440
Scene stealer.

2527
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,080
Submit this clip for an award.

2528
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,760
The title is "Give Me Your Hand."

2529
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:54,720
Got my eye on it.

2530
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,360
Is it sexy?

2531
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,280
Not sexy, it's funny.

2532
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,440
If you want to win a girl's heart,

2533
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,680
you have to give me a tempting look.

2534
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,240
With two sausages hanging from your mouth.

2535
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,080
That, I have no idea about.

2536
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,080
We never matched it, right?
