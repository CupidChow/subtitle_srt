1
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:10,754
Let's start with a few words.

2
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,104
How many?

3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:26,790
Bro

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,090
Right here

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,890
Fan the flames

6
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,040
Fan the flames

7
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,450
A flock of ducks passed by the alley in front.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,800
Peking Duck

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,950
Quack quack

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,200
Four words

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,350
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,350
Am I performing for them?

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,900
Could it be

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,500
Come on

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,950
Play the music, quick

16
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,950
How many words?

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,850
Heart-to-heart

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,950
Darling

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,060
Heartless stir-fried kidney

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,310
Heart is correct

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,760
No switching, your turn again

22
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,185
Heart-rending

23
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,260
Not "homesick couple"

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,960
Just guess directly

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,510
On a whim

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,485
Ruthless

27
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:34,410
Overjoyed

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,410
Hey

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,835
We've used almost all the "heart" words

30
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:38,535
It's "heart," right?

31
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:39,560
It's related to "heart," right?

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,400
Proposed

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,900
Throw it away

34
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,300

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,800
Darling

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,825
Heartless

37
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:47,750
Ruthless

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,350
What does Couple's Lung Slices have to do with "heart"?

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,200
Straw battle, suck suck

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,675
Is it a feng shui problem?

41
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:00,550
I'm in the middle of you two

42
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,555
Four words

43
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,230
How many words?

44
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,230
Lightning fast

45
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,680
Tiny fists pounding your chest

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,755
What's missing a "mouth" radical?

47
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:08,230
What?

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,230
What what?

49
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,830
Watch the main episode

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,855
Watch the main episode

51
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:12,105
Okay

52
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't even know this word

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,880
How many words?

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,130
Rooster crows, dogs bark, chaos everywhere

55
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,080
Steal chickens and dogs

56
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,630
Walk to

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,280
This game isn't in our comfort zone

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,055
It's fine

59
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:28,980
We'll rebound from the brink

60
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,180
Not afraid to rebound from the brink

61
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,530
How many words?

62
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,455

Small-headed Dad

65
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,110
We could pull this era back a bit

66
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,185
Then it'll be easy

67
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:45,810
Four words

68
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:46,960
IPartment

69
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Lover, you leave

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,610
Lover disappears

71
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,510
Four words

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,660
Lure the snake out

73
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,560
Draw the sword to help

74
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,510
Startle the snake by beating the grass

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,185
Stand up

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:05,810
Big Yuan

77
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,660
Why is this guy so lucky?

78
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,210
They're distracting me

79
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,660
You...

80
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,160
How am I supposed to guess this?

81
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,235
I only got two questions right

82
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,310
You guys are like this

83
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,210
How many words?

84
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,610

87
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,860
Pull off the roof without reason

88
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,390
Three, two, one, Lemon Seafood Pizza

89
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,528
Wait

90
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,890
I didn't catch that

91
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Do the whole thing

92
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,940
Hurry, hurry

93
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,495
Go out, go out

94
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:02,220
Come on, come on

95
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,020
Next round

96
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,670
Next round

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,470
Next round

98
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,670
Next round

99
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,370
Go

100
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,020
I haven't joined yet

101
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,770
I've never seen anyone cheat like this

102
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,620
Seafood

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Fresh

104
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,520
I'm out

105
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,920
It's all your fault

106
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,020
How is it my fault?

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,620
Look at the seafood pizza

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,170
Lemon Seafood Pizza

109
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,970

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,250
Three, two, one, Pizza Seafood

114
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,590
We've been swimming for ages

115
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,190
I'm climbing on the rocks

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,390
The rocks over there

117
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,590
Is this spot okay?

118
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,890
Hey

119
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,890
This is too slippery

120
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Too slippery

121
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,540
On the left

122
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,190
How do we get over there?

123
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,615
Start rock climbing

124
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:34,240
Rock climbing

125
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,090
Why is there a rock climbing challenge?

126
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,585
I'll go first

127
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:49,748
Me

128
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:50,635
I'll pull you over

129
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:52,360
I missed the grip with this hand

130
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,100
Okay

131
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,260
I can get over there

132
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,810
Li Nai

133
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,910
Nai

134
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,935
I'm up here

135
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:39,710
I'll jump from here

136
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,420
Okay, okay, okay

137
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,620
Be careful, bro

138
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,220
I'll stand here

139
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,970
I'll stand here

140
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,210
This is pretty high

141
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,460
Aren't you coming up?

142
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,260
Come on

143
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,610
It's still pretty high

144
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,810
Just jump forward

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,910
My heart is racing now

146
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,110
Pretty high

147
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,420
The earth is fresh

148
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,770
Here I come
