1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Let me check if they've sent me the menu.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,550
Alright.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,025
Guys,

4
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:07,750
Got it, got it.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,700
I'm starting the shopping now.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,625
If you didn't mention it, I'll buy a bit too.

7
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,550
There are about seven or eight of us eating.

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,850
Let's get some green onions.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,550
I think this is enough chopped green onions for seven or eight dishes.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
This will be used as a seasoning.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,380
For side vegetables, I think four are enough.

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,505
Green peppers, green peppers.

13
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,055
These can be used to make stir-fried spicy peppers.

14
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:31,205
I think we just need one of these.

15
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:31,530
No.

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,180
I think we can make a stir-fry with this.

17
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,430
Not sure if anyone knows how to make braised eggplant.

18
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,880
Tomatoes.

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,280
They'll definitely use a lot.

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,480
And these taste great just dipped in sugar and eaten plain.

21
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,065
We might need a few more potatoes.

22
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:44,840
Not too big, not too small.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,290
Easy to peel.

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
I think that's enough.

25
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,940
I think we need two onions.

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,965
Just enough for one dish is fine.

27
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:00,840
Don't waste any.

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,370
I think that's fine.

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,945
I think that's fine.

30
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,070
And we don't need the oranges.

31
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,820
And these are all very common.

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,620
I think that's about right.

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,270
How much will be deducted?

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,365
Thank you so much.

35
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:23,740
Sir.

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,190
Okay.

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Thank you so much.

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,740
You gave.

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,515
That's wrong.

40
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:37,840
Boy.

41
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,615
OK.

42
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:42,140
This is really hard.

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,570
Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,220
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

45
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,020
His profession, when I describe it, is also a person's name.

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,170
The problem is, his profession is also "actor."

47
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,070
What?

48
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,820

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,720

00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:50,300
OK

69
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,300
Not a man

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,300
Not a man

71
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:53,850
Not

72
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,050
Not human

73
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,200

Can't put things in front of Chen He anymore

79
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,620
You're sitting here because you're about to bring me cold imported bread

80
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,140
This is a mussel killer

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,590
This

82
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,650
This is my friend

83
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,900
This is my friend

84
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,850
They just became sworn brothers

85
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,000
This one inside is a bit lighter

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,900
This one is a bit salty

87
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,620
Translate this.

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,655
Get ready.

00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:35,680
Film Gong Jun's abs and chest.

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,980
Get the tall one.

111
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:38,760
Hey.

112
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Hold on, come down and walk.

113
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,860
I don't dare.

114
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,910
It's pretty shallow.

115
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,410
Hey.

116
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,235
Come over here.

117
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,410
I need to put the airport here.

118
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,810
It seems like we're making a big deal out of it.

119
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,160
Mine is really tall.

120
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,660
It's fine.

121
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,810
Very tall, very tall, very tall.

122
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,460

Cool, cool, cool.

129
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,360
Give it to me.

130
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,910
Give it to me.

00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,240
Lovers missed each other.

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,690
Lover ran away

141
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,290
Lover flew away

142
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,565
Love

143
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,390
Lover left

144
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,040
Lover departed

145
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,640

146
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,440
Lover disappeared

147
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,915
Sure

148
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,028
Bro’s got it

149
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:04,090
Bro

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,370

Big dive

152
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,070
Big dive, big backward jump

153
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,170
Utmost respect

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,620
Awesome

155
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,220
Awesome

156
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,170
I’ll go for a swim

157
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,970
Left side

158
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,845
I’ll go to a deeper spot

159
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:35,370
I’m not swimming

160
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,575
Get ready

161
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,550
Take a picture of Gong Jun’s abs and chest

162
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,075
It’s all covered by this

163
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:40,400
OK

164
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,300
Seafood pizza

165
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,400
Pizza

167
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,850
Lemon seafood

168
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,600
Pizza

169
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,475
I’m saying

170
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:12,625
Bro

171
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:12,875
Look

172
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,050
If you lose, you come down

173
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,550
No struggle

174
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,250
Let's do it one by one.

175
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,800
Or should we break it down?

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,050
Wait.

177
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,700
There's the character "person" in the middle.

178
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,825
What's up with "person"?

179
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,650
What did I see that made you like this?

180
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,400
I think I know.

181
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,050
Famous person's name.

182
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,200
Start with this one.

183
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,220
Tie up your hair.

184
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,310
A loving mother's thread in her hand.

185
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,510
A wanderer's clothes on his body.

186
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,810
Is there a song like this?

187
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,160
This is really "hitting the ox through the mountain."

188
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,260
I guessed this one.

189
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,760
Four characters.

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,310
Shouting.

191
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,910
Chen He.

192
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,260
I was thinking of calling you "junior."

193
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:49,885
Junior.

194
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:50,660
He really is a junior.

195
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,950
It hasn't started yet.

196
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,910
Cat and dog battle, Tom and Jerry.

197
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,860
