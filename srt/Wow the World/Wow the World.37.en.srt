1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,700
I think someone needs to set the tone.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,850
Liu Yuning, go ahead.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,400
Come on.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,775
It's hard to pick the right key.

5
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:08,750
Don't let me down.

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,950
Hello, mentors.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,250
I'm a boy from Dandong, Liaoning.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,550
I've had a music dream since I was little.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,600
I just want to be a singer.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,175
But in this dream,

11
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,600
two singers have deeply influenced me.

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,350
The first is Jay Chou.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,650
The second is Gong Jun.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,775
So,

15
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:37,400
I'll sing a song that Gong Jun has performed.

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,475
Sure.

17
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:41,125
Because all my singing techniques,

18
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,200
and my stage presence,

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,650
are learned from Gong Jun.

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,050
Here I go.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,450
Start your performance.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,700
If there's not enough sadness,

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
I can't fly or breathe.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,600
Without dreams,

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,050
why go far away?

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,000
I've always been wandering.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,350
But I've never seen the ocean.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,900
I thought I could forget.

29
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,700
Thank you for being my mentor.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,175
That's not necessary.

31
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:16,825
That's not necessary.

32
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:17,900
So you choose the mentor, right?

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,150
If I pass, is that okay?

34
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,425
Yes.

35
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:20,975
I think the two mentors should have a showdown.

36
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:22,100
I'll choose my team.

37
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:22,760
Right.

38
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,710
I want to pick against the mentors.

39
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,085
Aren't you both fighting over me now?

40
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:25,560
Aren't you?

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,710
I'm in high demand now.

42
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,385
Come on.

43
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,260
I think you should.

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,060
Mentors, try to win me over, okay?

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,585
Come on.

46
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,485
Mentors, show us your talents.

47
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,060
Let us learn from you.

48
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,560
They really have no talent.

49
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,048
If we had talent,

50
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,310
would we be sitting here?

51
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,710
No.

52
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,660
I think you can.

53
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,085
How about this:

54
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,410
How about you two sing a song together?

55
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,150
Can you sing "Long Time No See"?

56
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,400
The mentors are nervous.

57
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,400
It's fine, it's fine.

58
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,900
Come on.

59
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,300
First, tell us where you're from.

60
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,225
Share your story.

61
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:49,700
What about you?

62
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,200
You.

63
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,550
Introduce yourself.

64
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,950
Why does the vibe feel off now?

65
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,000
Who seems more like a mentor?

66
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,700
You can tell, right?

67
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,950
The shy rose

68
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,820
blooms quietly

69
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,770
burns slowly

70
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,720
it's not a human feeling

71
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,820
Oh my

72
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,870
How did it turn into rap?

73
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,670
It's just this kind of change

74
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,950
I know what you're saying

75
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,950
I'm confused

76
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,250
Only good music makes it clear to me

77
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,750
Bel canto slowly loses its effect here

78
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,300
Only rhythm can be celebrated together

79
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,175
Classmate

80
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:31,600
Bel canto

81
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,350
What are you saying?

82
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,550
I'm confused

83
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,050
Only good

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,370
music makes it clear to me

85
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,870
Words start to lose their effect here

86
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,520
Only rhythm can connect us

87
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,770
Okay

88
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,220
Here we go

89
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,720
Come on

90
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,570
Next question

91
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,520
We must win this one

92
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,720
Oh

93
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,620
Friend

94
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,920
Walk together for a lifetime

95
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,520
Those days are gone, not a word left

96
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,370
A lifetime

97
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,220
A lifetime of love

98
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,120
A glass of wine

99
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,145
You reckless guy

100
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:17,820
Singing so high

101
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,920
Ten years ago

102
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,220
I didn't know you

103
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,645
You didn't belong to me

104
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:31,670
We were still beside a stranger

105
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,420
Walking through familiar streets

106
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,220
There are so many people in this world

107
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,245
Singing so high

108
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:47,270
Look for yourself in the crowd

109
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,458
There are so many people in this world

110
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:57,820
There's an open door in the crowd

111
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,990
In my hazy eyes

112
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,290
is the memory of first meeting you

113
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,290
Blue stars

114
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,590
People as outstanding as me

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,690
People as outstanding as me

116
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,840
should have had a brilliant life

117
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,015
Let me tell you

118
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:23,515
Why is it wrong?

119
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:24,690
Because you messed up the first melody

120
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,490
Let me help you start

121
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,590
Let me help you start

122
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,240
People as outstanding as me

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,190
should have had a brilliant life

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,390
Let it be

125
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,940
I won't shout

126
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,600
Afraid love is like quicksand

127
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,300
Can't let go of what's in my heart

128
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,100
Oh

129
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,500
Baby

130
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,650
Let me be like this

131
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Can you get it up next time?

132
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,950
You're too intense.

133
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,150
You, go.

134
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,675
I use the female key for this.

135
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,550
Guys can't reach it.

136
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,600
Women can't go that low.

137
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,375
For example,

138
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,750
You're listening to "Long Time No See."

139
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,425
I came to your city.

140
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:12,650
But he gave you the lyrics to "Little Apple."

141
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,525
You're my little...

142
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:15,950
Little Apple.

143
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,200
This is so hard to guess.

144
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,330
Gong Jun goes first.

145
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,505
Xuan Xu is second.

146
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:19,855
Second turn.

147
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:20,230
Xuan Xu.

148
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,130
You're more reliable.

149
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,880
Take the third turn.

150
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,455
Alright, that's fine.

151
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:22,930
Third part.

152
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,380
So,

153
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,730
You're the one correcting him.

154
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,505
I'll correct him.

155
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,330
Then you pass it to him.

156
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,630
He can pass it on properly.

157
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,155
Then after him,

158
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,755
I'll stand next to Hong Lei.

159
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:31,280
Like this.

160
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,330
You're last.

161
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,730
You're last.

162
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,330
Listen to me.

163
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,230
Let's do one last round.

164
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,235
After me, let's follow this lineup, okay?

165
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:38,885
Let's do it.

166
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:39,285
Let's go.

167
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:39,760
Let's go.

168
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,410
Here we go.

169
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,340
Let me sort it out.

170
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,190
No.

171
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,090
Seems a bit too short.

172
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,765
It's fine.

173
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,340
No sky.

174
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,690
No earth.

175
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,580
No him.

176
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,530
No home.

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,180
No home.

178
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,955
No you.

179
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:07,880
No me.

180
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,030
No sky.

181
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,468
No sky.

182
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,355
No home.

183
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:15,380
No me.

184
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,930
No you.

185
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,030
How could I sound good?

186
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,910
I don't care anymore.

187
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,935
I think it's this one.

188
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:24,910
I think it's this one.

189
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,260
Go ahead.

190
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,510
I'll just sing what I heard.

191
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,860
My home is on the Songhua River in Northeast.

192
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,340
There are fields of soybeans and sorghum everywhere.

193
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,590
My home is on the Songhua River in Northeast.

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,690
There are fields of soybeans and sorghum everywhere.

195
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,890
My home is on the Songhua River in Northeast.

196
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,290
That's the one.

197
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,040
My home is on his Songhua River in Northeast.

198
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,540
I'll sing it again.

199
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,140
I'll sing it for you with this.

200
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,490
Blow, blow.

201
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,240
My pride.

202
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,940
Indulgence.

203
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,315
Blow, blow.

204
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:18,790
Blow.

205
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,040
Spring Garden.

206
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,840
Let the wind

207
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,230
fall into chaos.

208
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,305
never fade away.

209
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:27,830
It's my vision at the end.

210
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,105
Are you going to ruin it?

211
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:29,380
Come on.

212
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,455
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

213
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:31,080
Seriously.

214
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,530
You're the best.

215
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
You really are.

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,655
Calibrate, calibrate.

217
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:39,330
Calibrate, calibrate.

218
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,010
Brother Monkey, Brother Monkey.

219
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,585
I've heard "Brother Monkey, Brother Monkey, Brother Monkey."

220
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:43,910
You're truly amazing.

221
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,485
Even the Five Elements Mountain can't hold you, you jumped out as Sun Wukong.

222
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,060
Let me tell you.

223
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,610
Hong Lei actually passed it on very accurately.

224
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
It's not this song.

225
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,360
Not this one.

226
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,095
No.

227
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:59,220
This isn't the song.

228
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,070
Didn't you notice?

229
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,070
What's this?

230
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,720
It's not this one, right?
