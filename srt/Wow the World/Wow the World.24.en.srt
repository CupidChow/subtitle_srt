1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,680
Today,

2
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm going to record

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,160
a video diary about packing.

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,640
Because soon

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,200
I'll be traveling abroad.

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,920
Let's not waste words, let's get started.

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,560
I don't really know if I should record this.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm not sure what I should say in this video diary.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,760
Because

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,160
they say that for this trip,

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,800
the three most important things to bring are

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,000
but in my opinion,

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
I've prepared

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,840
a whole bunch of things.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,280
Adapter plug

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,720
This is something I think I must bring.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,200
The first most important item.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,800
Two adapter plugs.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,280
I bought this kind.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,160
It's compatible with many countries.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,760
The second thing I think is very important.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,440
It's because my beard grows really fast.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,120
So I brought a manual (razor).

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,000
I brought one.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,120
I also brought an electric one.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,280
But I haven't taken out the electric one yet.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
When I'm all done,

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,040
I'll pack it into my suitcase.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,680
For me,

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,360
The third most important thing

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,200
is my glasses.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,440
And my contact lenses.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,360
If I don't bring my contacts and glasses,

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,320
I guess these few days

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
I won't be able to see anyone clearly.

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,000
What's that?

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,880
They're saying

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,280
What a beautiful place.

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,000
This building is so beautiful.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,880
I say, what's that?

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,640
Where is this?

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,320
For foreign friends,

43
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,870
give some intangible cultural heritage gifts.

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,120
The first one is

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,560
shadow puppetry

46
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,920
And the second one is

47
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
a mugwort hammer

48
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,640
I really like its scent

49
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,680
It's a

50
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,760
seal

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
incense burner

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
It's already sealed

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,480
so I can't show it to everyone

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
This is from the Shenyang Palace Museum

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,880
which is near my hometown

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
This silk scarf

57
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,040
This looks really nice, right?

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,240
round fan

59
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
It has embroidery on it

60
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,520
This actually comes with a box

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm just showing it to everyone

62
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,960
I'll have to put it back in the box later

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,840
paper cutting

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
I think this

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
is actually familiar to many foreign friends

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,600
They probably aren't unfamiliar with it

67
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
Go eat something delicious.

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,880
Go experience new things.

69
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,840
A lot of things I haven't seen before.

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
I saw this.

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,880
Go to Sicily.

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
I've watched a movie.

73
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,000
It's called "Malèna."

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm really looking forward to it.

75
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,520
I also brought my camera.

76
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,760
And I'm planning to take some

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,840
photos of scenery and local culture.

78
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
We

79
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,600
See you later.

80
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Bye.

81
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Okay, we're getting in the car now.

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,880
And heading to the airport.

83
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,360
Right now in Hangzhou,

84
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,160
it's raining a little.

85
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,880
It's my first time at Qiandao Lake too.

86
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
Honestly, it's pretty beautiful.

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm planning to take a nap in the car soon.

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,280
Then

89
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
I'll nap again when we get to the airport.

90
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,840
But I'm also a bit excited.

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,160
Okay.

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
Alright, we've arrived at the airport.

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
Seems like I can't see anything.

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,200
It's fine, we'll see soon.

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,840
We're about to take off.

96
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,760
Once we're ready to take off, I'll just sleep.

97
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll fall asleep right away.

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,240
We're now

99
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,040
transferring flights.

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,840
I had a long sleep.

101
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm still a bit groggy.

102
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,560
We've arrived.

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,480
We're here.

104
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
We're about to reach Naples.

105
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm about to meet

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
my friends soon.

107
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
I've brought someone.

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,560
I've brought myself.

109
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,240
I rushed over here without stopping.

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,200
Honestly,

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
I didn't really prepare anything.

112
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,400
I did prepare one thing—

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
a long-hungry appetite.

114
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,000
This time, I also brought

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,120
some intangible cultural heritage gifts and such.

116
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,280
This time,

117
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,080
I won't trust you all again.

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll be careful and cautious.

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm so nervous.

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,440
No, I can't.

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,120
It's my first time here.

122
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,240
I really miss everyone.

123
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,640
Because I saw them in the group chat.

124
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,480
They posted some fun stuff.

125
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
Like,

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,960
where they went,

127
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,840
and what they were doing.

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I was really envious.

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,480
After all, they're all in a foreign country.

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
They've spent so much time together.

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,560
They must be closer now.

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
So I feel a bit out of place.

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
Really?

134
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
I thought

135
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,160
I thought everyone had already forgotten about me.

136
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm here!
