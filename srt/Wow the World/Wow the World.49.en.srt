1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,880
I think everyone should know it by now.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,480
Then let's pick someone at random.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:06,905
Go ahead.

4
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:07,380
Xin Xu.

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,730
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,280
I knew you were here.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,605
I haven't learned a single line yet.

8
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:18,280
Wait, hold on.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,230
Why is Xin Xu the only one who gets away? What about me?

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,305
Is it two people?

11
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,880
Didn't you hear it's two people?

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,280
I'm the first unlucky one.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,680
Jin Xu, you handle the high notes.

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,880
I can't hit those notes at all.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,630
How about we all sing it together once?

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,855
Then let those two sing, right?

17
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:34,005
Let's learn it together once.

18
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:34,780
We didn't learn it just now.

19
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,680
So, Xin Xu...

20
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,250
After you learn it,

21
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:38,825
You do a round.

22
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:39,225
Hey.

23
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:40,000
Darn it.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,700
What, what?

25
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,425
Chorus.

26
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:48,000
Do it again.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,950
Chorus, three, two, one—The world is super fun.

28
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,950
Life's engine hides mysteries.

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,750
Accept it.

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,970
So interesting.

31
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,020
The world hides secrets in its slowness.

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,870
Hey.

33
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,870
Qian Xu.

34
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,020
Sing it a cappella.

35
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,570
Qian Xu.

36
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,120
Are you singing an octave lower?

37
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,970
Give me the tune—The world is fun, life has its folds.

38
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,300
The world is super fun.

39
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,925
Want to go—Wait, what is this?

40
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:26,750
Want to breathe.

41
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,250
The world is so interesting.

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,450
And then, believe in the world under the sea or something.

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,200
But the end is too high.

44
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,225
I'm not doing it.

45
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:36,700
No, no.

46
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,725
Let's do it together, the three of us.

47
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:38,725
Or you can just sing it yourself.

48
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,250
Go ahead and sing it yourself.

49
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,120
So interesting.

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,120
Hiding secrets inside.

51
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,520
The world is super fun.

52
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,470
Let him and I go bungee jumping at the edge of the world.

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,020
Wait a second.

54
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,660
Interesting.

55
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,680
How to block every wind and...

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,380
There could be endless possibilities and freedom.

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,030
One, two, three, sing—Where is it?

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,740
Where is spring?

59
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,140
Spring is in the lush green forests.

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,440
There are flowers here.

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,840
There is grass here.

62
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,340
And little brothers who can sing.

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,590
One, two, three, sing—Duo Lun Steals the Imperial Horse.

64
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,940
Guan Gong Fights.

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:12,060
Changsha's ranks, Cao Cao's face, Zhang Fei shouting.

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,810
One, two, three, sing.

67
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,110
One, two, three.

68
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,910
How many points did Xingxi deduct?

69
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,010
Four points.

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,290
Why did he only deduct four points?

71
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,340
Because I didn't switch sides or block with my foot.

72
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,640
Did he make any sound?

73
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,590
What do you mean, did I make any sound?

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
Singing badly doesn't lose points.

75
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,190
It's your turn.

76
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,215
Pretty standard.

77
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:03,690
What's wrong?

78
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,990
I taught a little.

79
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,670
Yeah.

80
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,170
But your moves need to be more intense.

81
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,545
You need to have that sense of rhythm.

82
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:09,845
Everyone's got rhythm.

83
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm intense too.

84
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,770
You go.

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,420
I gave him a perfect score.

86
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,120
It's about the mouth.

87
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,445
Why can't you relax your mouth a bit?

88
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,320
Because you cramped up.

89
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,420
Because...

90
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,820
Made a mistake.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,670
You went too far.

92
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,820
Let...

93
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,470
Even lonelier.

94
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,370
That's why you get caught in a whirlpool of emotions.

95
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,920
Just need to separate.

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,320
If we separate, then we separate.

97
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,200
Now we need true love to protect the future.

98
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,950
Love isn't something you can buy just because you want to.

99
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,850
Let your heart decide love.

100
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,450
A cotton flower.

101
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,470
Song.

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,170
Your romantic chorus.

103
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,620
Softly echoing, your eyes firm in your choice.

104
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,720
Whatever you sing, it all feels like...

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,770
Turns out your main song means this.

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,830
Take a look.

107
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,530
Just stay like this for a second or two, then go.

108
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:41,980
OK.

109
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,320
Alright.

110
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,820
Flashy young guy.

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,920
Wait a second.

112
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,520
Let me go again.

113
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,345
Can I pick a jacket?

114
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:10,020
I've been too flashy lately.

115
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,470
Let's see what's going on.

116
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:11,870
What's the deal?

117
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,370
What's the deal?

118
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,095
Don't let Xinxu shave his beard.

119
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,670
No one can steal his spotlight.

120
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,720
How long will it grow in three days?

121
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,470
It's not too bad.

122
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,470
After three days, in a week he'll need someone to help him walk.

123
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,895
He'll have to hire someone to carry it for him.

124
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:30,820
About three thousand that long.

125
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
What's the longest you've ever grown it?

126
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,120
Will it be a full beard in the future?

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,770
Not a full beard.

128
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,970
Everything below the nose and mouth is beard.

129
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,245
In winter, you can shave your whole face.

130
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:44,120
You're starting to look like Santa Claus.

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,020
But I originally wanted...

132
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,170
When I'm not filming,

133
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,970
I wanted to grow it out.

134
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,370
Then...

135
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,740
My mom said...

136
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
She hates men with beards the most.

137
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,540
But my dad and I both have beards like this.

138
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,840
That's great.

139
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,240
You...

140
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,890
How long did you trim it?

141
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,715
I trimmed...

142
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:23,640
I mean you...

143
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,240
Just even it out and it's fine.

144
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,390
Garlic bread.

145
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,755
I think you guys are just going with the flow.

146
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,755
Isn't "flow" just what it's called?

147
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,380
It doesn't taste like garlic at all.

148
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,430
You're so excited, really hyped up.

149
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,780
Did you chew it, is the flavor strong?

150
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,330
The thing is, definitely not.

151
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,930
But with that flavor and the tomato, it's not much.

152
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,960
How did it fall off so quickly?

153
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,085
Add some ham to this and it's amazing.

154
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:57,260
You really know how to eat, it's incredible.

155
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,860
Can you eat both sides in time?

156
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,235
That's really delicious.

157
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:00,910
Super tasty.

158
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,310
I've learned something.

159
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,260
I'll make it when I get home.

160
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,160
Show me.

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,165
I've always been making that garlic spread bread.

162
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,040
Then I added some of his stuff.

163
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,365
And added a bit of pumpkin.

164
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,865
But he doesn't eat ham.

165
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,890
But if you add ham, it balances the flavor.
