00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,680
in experiencing traditional European etiquette

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,680
So we should stand up, right?

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,440
He has served

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,600
heads of state from multiple countries and celebrities from various fields

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
including Madonna

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,200
and Michael Jackson, among others

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
world-famous personalities

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
Let's welcome our etiquette coach

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,600
Welcome

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,800
Look how elegant they are.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,920
Please have a seat.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Alright.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,600
Thank you.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,600
Today,

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,400
I will teach you

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,320
how to be graceful and proper when being hosted.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,960
Shall we begin?

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
Yes.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,280
Ladies and gentlemen, in Europe,

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,240
there are very strict rules about seating at the table.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,440
This gentleman's seat is the main seat.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
This is the main seat.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,800
Of course.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,120
The center position at the table

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,280
is for the most important person in the family.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,760
On the right side,

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,840
to his right,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,080
is the most important lady.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
This is the most important lady.

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
To his left,

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
is the seat for another lady.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,640
Didi,

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
madam,

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,240
please.

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,920
My pleasure.

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,480
The second seat to his left

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,600
is the second most important position.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,200
Naiwen,

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,080
I sit here, right?

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
We go by age, right.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,200
By age.

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,919
Excuse me.

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,280
Wait a moment.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Sorry.

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,240
Hold on.

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,639
Pardon me.

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,000
Just a second.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Sorry about that.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,960
Ma'am.

53
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,640
Which one?

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,200
Which one?

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,240
The way you ask...

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,640
Isn't it obvious?

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,440
The three of us work at the same company.

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
You offended me.

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm a girl.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,080
Ma'am is more respectful.

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Little princess.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,320
Please call me princess.

63
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
Sis.

64
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,520
Which one?

65
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Him.

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,600
Bro.

67
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,120
Him.

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,760
Why?

69
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,000
No reason.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,920
There's no reason.

71
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,560
Please sit down.

72
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's continue introducing the seats.

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,480
Sit here.

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,680
Where does the next person sit?

75
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Maybe this one.

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,440
Yes.

77
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,560
The third most important boy sits here.

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,360
Then you sit here.

79
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,920
You sit.

80
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,800
Okay, I'll do it.

81
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,680
Now, who do we start with?

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,160
Okay.

83
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,760
The one sitting over there.

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,160
And the one sitting at the very end.

85
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,920
Sure, of course.

86
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,600
Okay.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,480
The important seats are right, left, right, left.

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,200
Sit from the center outwards.

89
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,840
Alright.

90
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,640
Alright, everyone please stand up.

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,600
Please stand up.

92
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Suppose we are now

93
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,040
having dinner with the king.

94
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,320
This gentleman is the king.

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
You play the role of

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,040
the king.

97
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,440
Congratulations.

98
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,600
Yesterday you were still the head of security.

99
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
Today you've become the "king."

100
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,440
A security "king" is just as good.

101
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,200
Security "king."

102
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
That's a quick promotion.

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Three, two, one

104
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,640
Please sit down

105
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,960
You have to sit first, then we can sit

106
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
The "king" can sit however they want

107
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,320
The "king" is out

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,200
Shouldn't it be this one?

109
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
You need to put on your suit jacket

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,680
You have to wear this

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Okay

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,200
Please sit down

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
Let the "king" go first

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
It should be like this, right?

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
A talented student

116
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,680
A very gentlemanly man

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,200
Teacher, I am really touched

118
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,600
He is very touched

119
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,600
That lady

120
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,880
Didn't see

121
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,839
Alright

122
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,360
Come on, little sister

123
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
Please sit down

124
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,760
Gentlemen

125
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,520
Please

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,560
Gentlemen

127
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,520
Okay

128
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
Very good

129
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,280
Very good

130
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't put your feet under the table

131
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,880
And don't put them under the chair either

132
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
Your jacket

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Unbutton it

134
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,960
When sitting, open your suit jacket

135
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
To prevent it from wrinkling

136
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,120
Another important rule, sir

137
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Never put your hands under the table

138
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,560
Never

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
There's a historical reason for this

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Because in the past, there might have been a gun hidden under the table

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,600
A gun, yes

142
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,200
Understood.

143
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,680
Don't use your elbows.

144
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Don't use your arms.

145
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,520
Sir, relax.

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,960
Relax a bit.

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
Please unfold your napkin.

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,760
You can only do it after the host does.

149
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,520
Do you understand?

150
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,560
Understood.

151
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,760
You can start now.

152
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,560
Yes, just move the napkin.

153
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,640
Yes, unfold it.

154
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,920
That was too direct.

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,440
That's not right.

156
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
You two seem a bit too close.

157
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,560
Too intimate.

158
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,720
Too intimate, that's not allowed.

159
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,440
Not even the daughter?

160
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,040
No.

161
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,720
She can't either.

162
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,880
Just fold the napkin in half, don't shake it.

163
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,600
Okay.

164
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,000
Fold the napkin and place it on your lap.

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Okay.

166
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
Ladies and gentlemen, please begin.

167
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,880
Okay.

168
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
It's our turn.

169
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,080
The plate on the table is for bread.

170
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,360
It's for bread.

171
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,480
You can't eat the bread before all the dishes are served.

172
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,840
But what if you're hungry?

173
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,560
This bread, before the dishes arrive,

174
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,800
you're not supposed to touch it, right?

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
You can only eat it after the dishes are served.

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,480
Okay.

177
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,440
But won't it all get cold?

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
The bread.

179
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
The dry kind.

180
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,000
I've been eating it wrong for so many years.

181
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,960
I thought it was a pre-meal bread roll.

182
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,520
So you can't even have a little to fill your stomach?

183
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,600
You can't eat it first either?

184
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
It's just etiquette.

185
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Right.

186
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,240
The king will fire you.

187
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,960
He'll fire me.

188
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
He'll fire all of us.

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,200
Teacher, please show everyone

190
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,560
how to eat steak properly.

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,280
How to eat steak the right way.

192
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,520
You should wait for that gentleman to start first.

193
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,440
You go first.

194
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,040
The knife is always on the right.

195
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,480
The fork is always on this side.

196
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,560
The fork should never go to the right.

197
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,280
You can't switch them.

198
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,200
You can't use the fork like this.

199
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,200
You can't use the fork this way, that's not right.

200
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,280
You should always use the fork like this.

201
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,760
And use them gracefully.

202
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Gracefully.

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
Watch me.

204
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Keep your mouth closed and don't make any noise.

205
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,520
No smacking your lips.

206
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,000
If you want to talk to others while eating,

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,320
if you need to communicate,

208
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,120
you should cover your mouth with your hand.

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
Can we start now?

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,280
Yes.

211
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,520
Okay, three, two, one.

212
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,360
Let's begin.

213
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,440
The "king" goes first.

214
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
Alright.

215
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
Perfect.

216
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
Very good.

217
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Very good.

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,320
Always remember,

219
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,400
it's rude to use the salt and pepper on the table.

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,960
You must not use them.

221
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,280
Then why are they here?

222
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Because if you use them, it means the food isn't good.

223
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,559
It's disrespectful.

224
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,200
But I love pepper.

225
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,360
So even if it really isn't good, you still can't use them?

226
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,120
That's right.

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Okay, let's continue.

228
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,200
You must eat more slowly than this gentleman.

229
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,880
You can't finish before he does.

230
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,520
But you also can't be slower than him.

231
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
So you have to watch him while you eat.

232
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,880
Then we really can't chat.

233
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
We need to say a couple of things.

234
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
Turn your head and it's already empty.

235
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,360
Finished eating.

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
For example,

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,840
Excuse me, ma'am.

238
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
If the napkin falls,

239
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,320
It fell.

240
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,840
It fell.

241
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,840
That's not allowed.

242
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,040
It's dirty now.

243
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,640
You need to ask someone to bring a new one.

244
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
Naiwen, come here.

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
Coming.

246
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,640
I'm here.

247
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,040
Okay.

248
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,440
You should hand it to her on the right side.

249
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,360
Hold it.

250
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,440
Thank you.

251
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,960
Perfect.

252
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,840
Now, let's start drinking.

253
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,640
Come on.

254
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Cheers, everyone.

255
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
This glass is for water.

256
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,840
This small one is for white wine.

257
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,560
This large one is for red wine.

258
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,520
This one is for champagne.

259
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,040
What about beer?

260
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,600
No beer.

261
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
Royalty doesn't drink beer.

262
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,920
The royal family just doesn't drink beer.

263
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,680
He drinks it in secret.

264
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,000
Now, this gentleman wants a drink.

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,800
Then you need to use this first.

266
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
After that, you can drink.

267
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
Then we also need to wipe.

268
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,880
And I'm in the middle of eating.

269
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
Brothers and sisters,

270
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
I raise a glass.

271
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,280
Okay.

272
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Take a big sip.

273
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,200
Take a big sip, bro.

274
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,920
Should we say something?

275
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,160
No.

276
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
Say it after drinking.

277
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,080
Drink first.

278
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,280
You can't talk while eating, right?

279
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,240
Then we can't say anything.

280
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,360
It's all in the wine.

281
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
Cheers.

282
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,360
No.

283
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,680
Don't clink glasses.

284
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,840
The teacher is about to go crazy.

285
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,080
You’re driving the teacher crazy.

286
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,880
This class is too hard to handle.

287
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,800
Teacher.

288
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,120
Next time, I’ll invite you to Fujian for a street food feast.

289
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,800
Everyone has to drink.

290
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,280
Okay.

291
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,360
Let’s exchange a glance.

292
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,320
Make a connection.

293
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,800
What should you do after finishing your meal?

294
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,560
Wipe your mouth, bro.

295
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,720
Very good.

296
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
Excellent.

297
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
The teacher is very pleased.

298
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,640
What about this?

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,720
Is this napkin clean or dirty?

300
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,440
Dirty.

301
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,960
Correct.

302
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,160
So, you should put the napkin on the chair.

303
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
Just place it behind the chair.

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
Sir.

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
Please stand up first.

306
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,280
Then everyone stands up.

307
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
Everyone, please wait a moment.

308
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
Hold it in front of your chest.

309
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,920
Then give a brief speech.

310
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
To thank the guests for coming.

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
Keep it short—enjoy the food and drinks.

312
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,600
Ladies and gentlemen.

313
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,400
We’ll make up for it next time.

314
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,520
I’ll make pork stew with noodles for everyone.

315
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,240
It smells amazing.

316
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,840
I want to eat it.

317
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,760
Let’s do it.

318
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,280
After wiping your mouth, sit down.

319
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay.

320
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,360
Really.

321
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,680
Dinner is over.

322
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,600
Thank you.

323
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,280
It's finished.

324
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,840
No.

325
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,240
You must not fold your napkin.

326
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,800
Because that means you don't want to be invited again.

327
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,560
Pick it up.

328
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't fold it, just leave it like this.

329
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,840
That gentleman, please stand up.

330
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,160
Sir.

331
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Help the lady.

332
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,520
Help the lady, understood.

333
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,560
Alright.

334
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,760
Please.

335
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,360
Alright, very good.

336
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
Button up your suit.

337
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Thank you.

338
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
Thank you, Master.

339
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,680
That's the end of today's introduction to traditional etiquette.

340
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
There's this kind of energy here.

341
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,240
Yes.

342
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,200
Ma'am.

343
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,000
It's too far.

344
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,600
I just want her to see me.

345
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,320
Okay?

346
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,040
It's too far.

347
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,400
It was too far just now.

348
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,240
Don't get too close.

349
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,240
Nice to meet you.

350
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Ma'am.

351
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,080
Good morning.

352
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,760
My name is

353
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,600
Chen He.

354
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm glad to meet you too.

355
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Nice to meet you.

356
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,520
What are you doing with your hand?

357
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,720
Sorry.

358
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
I have a "condition."

359
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,040
Yes, me too.

360
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,080
No.

361
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,640
No.

362
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,880
Don't move your hand.

363
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,000
Keep your wrist still, don't move it anymore.

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,760
No.

365
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,320
Good afternoon

366
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
What is your name?

367
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Chen He

368
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,440
And you?

369
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,400
My name is

370
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,320
Ouyang Didi

371
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,320
How amazing

372
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,040
Ouyang Didi

373
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,240
Ouyang Didi is so beautiful

374
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,520
How amazing

375
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,960
Good, very good

376
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,960
How are you?

377
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,600
Very well

378
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
What is your name?

379
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,680
Chen He

380
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,400
And you?

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,480
My name is

382
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Ouyang Didi

383
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,120
My pleasure

384
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,440
Very good

385
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Not bad

386
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,520
Madam

387
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,960
Very good

388
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,800
Remember the key etiquette

389
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
It's very important

390
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,000
A hand-kiss should only be performed after 3 p.m.

391
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,440
Why?

392
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,000
This comes from 17th-century dress traditions

393
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,200
At that time, ladies wore gloves in the morning and afternoon

394
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,200
Before attending a dinner after 3 p.m.

395
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,720
They would only remove their gloves when changing clothes

396
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,600
Performing a hand-kiss at this moment

397
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,720
Shows respect for the lady

398
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,600
That is the reason

399
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,880
The second rule

400
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,480
A hand-kiss should only be given to married ladies

401
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,520
Only married ladies may receive a hand-kiss

402
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,120
You can also come up with challenges for each other.

403
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,400
For example, falling down gracefully.

404
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,840
Burping gracefully.

405
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,280
Refusing gracefully.

406
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Showing off gracefully.

407
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,960
Was the graceful burp designed for He Ge?

408
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,840
Yes.

409
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,200
You do it—burp gracefully.

410
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
I want to hear what a graceful burp sounds like.

411
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,560
He hasn't done anything yet.

412
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Take a sip of water.

413
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,720
Then, teachers, let me start things off.

414
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,440
Do one—gracefully.

415
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
You burp gracefully.

416
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
We'll fall down gracefully.

417
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,480
Shake and fall away.

418
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
Are you telling me what to do?

419
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,680
I was wrong again, director.

420
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,040
Do one.

421
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Then I'll start the test.

422
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,840
Hello, teachers.

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
Hello, classmates.

424
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Graceful.

425
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,320
So graceful.

426
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
That's so graceful.

427
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,440
Graceful.

428
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,040
This kind of shyness, this...

429
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,000
That's good.

430
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,480
Okay, come on.

431
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,200
Let's start.

432
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,040
Dance battle.

433
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,400
Just now.

434
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,480
Just started.

435
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,040
Right.

436
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Hulala la.

437
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
Quick, hulala.

438
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,760
Hulala la.

439
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,319
And then like this.

440
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:17,720
Then...

441
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,280
Like this.

442
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,960
One, two, three, four.

443
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,640
Honglei, I think maybe you should...

444
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Maybe do a little face-off with the two of them.

445
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,200
Just join in.

446
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
Just join in, Honglei.

447
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,440
Don't hesitate.

448
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,720
Come on.

449
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,520
Come on, hurry up.

450
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
We need to send out our dance king.

451
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Pause the music for a second.

452
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,840
I don't think this is elegant at all.

453
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Show us something elegant, man.

454
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,600
Come on.

455
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,320
Come on, let's...

456
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Music.

457
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,680
Start.

458
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Don't stop the music.

459
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,600
Here we go.

460
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Do I need to tip?

461
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,760
Thank you.

462
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,560
What is this?

463
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Naiwen is stunned.

464
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,640
Brothers

465
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,320
Big Brother, Second Brother

466
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,200
We met again after fifty years

467
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,640
Naiwen

468
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,480
One more time, Naiwen

469
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
You're using your teeth again

470
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,080
No, I just held the bullet with my teeth

471
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,120
Senior brother, your teeth are still as strong as ever

472
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,160
Let's do this again, come on

473
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,520
One, two, three, four

474
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,040
Go

475
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,560
Five

476
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,120
Six

477
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,640
Seven

478
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,240
Go

479
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,880
Naiwen, does your neck need rehab?

480
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,880
I think you should go to the hospital

481
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,600
Get acupuncture from a Chinese medicine doctor

482
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,680
Bone adjustment

483
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,200
Alright, I think that's enough

484
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,760
Very good
