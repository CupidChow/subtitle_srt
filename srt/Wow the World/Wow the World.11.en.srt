1
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,880
Welcome to my estate.

2
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,600
Yours?

3
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,560
Your estate?

4
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,480
You're the only one not wearing a suit, bro.

5
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,000
Why are you wearing a chauffeur's uniform?

6
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,680
Because I'm the host.

7
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Today we're about to start our time in Rome.

8
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
A new day's itinerary.

9
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
Okay.

10
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,160
It's a new day.

11
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,240
In the classic film "Roman Holiday,"

12
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,840
the main character, Princess Ann,

13
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,480
grew tired of her royal life.

14
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,200
So she ran away in the middle of the night.

15
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,320
And began

16
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
a romantic encounter in Rome.

17
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,120
Everyone has changed into elegant clothes today.

18
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,400
But does everyone have

19
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
an elegant posture?

20
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,440
That's quite a posture.

21
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
So elegant.

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,920
Let me tell you,

23
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
this person is so elegant.

24
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
It's just that

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
you can't capture it on camera.

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,800
You can't get the lower half in the shot.

27
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
He's sitting with his legs crossed.

28
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,160
Like this, too.

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
So relaxed.

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,840
Rome.

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
"Roman Holiday."

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,120
You three are the chef, the actor, and the rascal.

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
No, that's not right.

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Chef, actor, rascal.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
Ning can play all those roles by himself.

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,160
That's true.

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,560
I just remembered something really funny.

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,480
Go on.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,880
That meme of Xiaoming.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,200
Then I think He should imitate Xiaoming.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Try to imitate the meme expression.

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,320
Imitate that one.

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,040
I really don't know about this.

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,440
Imitate his.

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,600
If you can do it, you try.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,960
He really wants to try.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
Imitating Xiaoming is not offensive at all.

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,680
You do it.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,200
It's fine, Xiaoming won't mind.

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,240
First, wipe your lips.

51
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,920
And give a mischievous smile.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,920
I'm set on you.

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm set on you.

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,320
Okay.

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,400
Elegant.

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
I just started sweating.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,480
What's wrong?

58
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm set on you.

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm set on you.

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
I've set my sights on you.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
I've set my sights on you.

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,600
Naiwen.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,480
I think Junjun imitating Xiaoming

64
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,280
might be a bit stressful for him.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
But as Xiaoming's senior,

66
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,600
it's no problem for you.

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,320
That's true.

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,840
It really is.

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
Take off your glasses, bro.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,400
What's wrong?

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,600
They haven't even made a face yet,

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
and you're already scared.

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,760
Take off your glasses.

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,800
That move of yours—

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,840
No, the moment you take off your glasses,

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,560
you're already so charming it makes people scream.

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,160
To your elders,

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,880
show some respect.

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,680
A bee just zoomed past here.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,560
Let me do one.

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,400
The Earth is super fresh.

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,640
The world is right before your eyes.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Screaming again.

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,480
Alright.

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Alright.

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,560
Pretty cool.

88
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,520
Bro, that's pretty cool.

89
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
Come on, do another one.

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,440
Do it elegantly.

91
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Um, I want to see someone dance elegantly.

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,880
I want to see Gong Jun dance.

93
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,320
I want to see you dance.

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
This...

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,840
I think...

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
This is elegant dancing.

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Really.

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,760
Let Honglei do it.

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,720
Let Honglei do it.

100
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,240
Seriously.

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,640
Honglei is really suited for dancing.

102
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Dance elegantly.

103
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,640
I'll move the chair for you.

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,880
Bro wants to go to the front.

105
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
What's this?

106
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
"Great Ambitions"

107
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
This song is really popular right now.

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,600
Bro.

109
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,720
Really?

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,560
Come on.

111
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,960
He'll show you.

112
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,920
So elegant.

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Is this also choreographed?

114
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,280
Elegant.

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,520
Is this elegant?

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,320
You do it.

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,360
You do it.

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,560
Come on, let's do it together.

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
Okay, let's do it together.

120
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,680
Together.

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Then let's go to the front.

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,160
How about we go to the front?

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,880
Guys, come on.

124
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,440
Let's learn from He Ge.

125
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's learn one move together first.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,120
Let's start with something not so elegant.

127
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,880
Let's all do the intro together.

128
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
Let's add some moves, okay?

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,720
Okay.

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,040
What was that move you just did?

131
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,640
Not elegant.

132
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,320
This is so elegant.

133
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
Is this elegant?

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,760
This is so elegant.

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,120
This is so elegant.

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
Not enough.

137
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,160
Bro, it's still too elegant.

138
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,520
Too elegant.

139
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
Let's do something like that.

140
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,480
Yeah, that kind of thing.

141
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,920
Can you do it?

142
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
You do it.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Not doing it.

144
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,520
You're always asking.

145
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,320
You studied dance.

146
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,160
Why don't you do it?

147
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,800
You studied dance.

148
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,840
I really want to do ballet today.

149
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
You do it.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Come on, let her dance to this music.

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
You dance, come on.

152
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,840
Then do the ballet version.

153
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,720
Do one.

154
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,160
Do the ballet version.

155
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,800
Let me teach everyone a Douyin dance, okay?

156
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Okay, Douyin dance is good.

157
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,120
Awesome.

158
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,000
First step, squat down, okay?

159
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,080
Squat down.

160
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,600
Squat down.

161
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
It's the hands.

162
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,120
Along the face like this.

163
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,440
Like this, a wave.

164
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,000
You know what I mean? A wave.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,400
Okay.

166
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,960
To here.

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,040
After it goes down.

168
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
Then like this.

169
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,600
Like this.

170
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,320
This doesn't really match my vibe.

171
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,040
You guys really want me to teach?

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,960
Alright, come on.

173
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,480
Come on.

174
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,440
Are we starting or not?

175
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,960
Singing inside the villa.

176
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,960
Then start swaying.

177
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
They really all...

178
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,400
This is very elegant.

179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,440
Why did you dance for such a short time?

180
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,760
He Ge hasn't even had enough fun yet.

181
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm sweating.

182
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
It's just too hot.

183
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's tell a cold joke.

184
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,040
Go ahead, Nai Ge.

185
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
A cold joke.

186
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
n and m got into a fight.

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720
In the end, m admitted fault.

188
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,960
Do you know why?

189
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,960
m...

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,120
Because n was right?

191
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,880
No.

192
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,240
Because...

193
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
It was too cold.

194
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
Today, we've specially invited

195
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
a top international etiquette coach

196
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
to guide everyone in experiencing traditional European etiquette.

197
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,320
We should stand up, right?

198
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,920
He has served

199
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,440
many heads of state and celebrities from various countries.

200
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
Including Madonna

201
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
and Michael Jackson, among other world-famous figures.

202
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,520
Let's welcome our etiquette coach.

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,240
Welcome!

204
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
See, he's very elegant.

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,560
Please have a seat.

206
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,200
Alright.

207
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
Thank you

208
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Today

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,040
I will teach you

210
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,960
how to be graceful and proper when being received

211
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,600
Shall we begin?

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,880
Yes

213
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,600
Sir

214
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,720
Sir

215
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Sir

216
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,880
I

217
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,320
Yes

218
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,440
Ma'am, please come over

219
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,600
This feels a bit like being called up by the homeroom teacher

220
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,120
You can do it

221
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,920
Now, sir please

222
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,040
introduce yourself to the lady

223
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
From there

224
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,120
And enter the frame

225
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,040
One

226
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,160
Two, three

227
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Begin

228
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,800
Hello

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Go ahead, sir. Thank you

230
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,360
Not graceful

231
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,560
That wasn't graceful

232
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,640
Don't put your hands in your pockets

233
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Try again

234
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
No

235
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,080
Try again

236
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
Your hands aren't cooperating

237
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,800
You don't know where to put your hands

238
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
Be more natural, please

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,200
A bit more natural

240
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
A bit more natural, good

241
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,200
Wait a moment

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
I forgot how to walk

243
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,720
Begin

244
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,440
Madam

245
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,840
Sir

246
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
Hello

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,880
Nice to meet you

248
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,360
Nice to meet you too

249
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
My name is

250
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,440
Sun Baobao

251
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,680
My name is "Yan Wang"

252
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,080
Okay

253
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
Don't get too close

254
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,200
Don't be too far

255
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Fifty centimeters

256
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,680
Is that okay?

257
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,200
Fifty centimeters

258
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,880
I won't reach out first

259
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,120
I'll wait for the lady to reach out first

260
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,200
Of course

261
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
Nice to meet you

262
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,840
You gently shake hands

263
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,760
Gently

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Two centimeters

265
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,040
Two fingers

266
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,080
It's my honor, madam

267
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,280
It's my honor

268
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,120
Don't put your hand near your mouth

269
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,400
That feeling is still a bit internal.

270
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,480
It's so hard.

271
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,760
Everyone, please stand.

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,840
We have a formal dinner with the king.

273
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,280
I will...

274
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,360
This gentleman will play the king.

275
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,400
You play...

276
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
the king.

277
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,640
Congratulations.

278
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
Yesterday you were still the head of security.

279
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,720
Today you’ve become the king.

280
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
A security king is still a king.

281
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,240
Security king.

282
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,160
Sorry, sir.

283
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
But you still need to wear your coat.

284
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,200
You have to put this on.

285
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,160
Okay.

286
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,880
Please sit.

287
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,400
Please sit.

288
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,280
The king goes first.

289
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,120
That's how it should be.

290
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
Very good, sir.

291
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,200
A very gentlemanly man.

292
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,600
Come on, little sister.

293
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,600
Thank you.

294
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,200
Please sit.

295
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,120
Gentlemen.

296
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,920
Please.

297
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,880
Okay.

298
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,040
Very good.

299
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,640
Very nice.

300
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,760
Don't put your feet under the table.

301
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,240
And don't put it under the chair either.

302
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,160
Your coat.

303
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Unbutton it.

304
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
When you sit down, open your suit jacket.

305
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,280
To prevent it from wrinkling.

306
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,480
Another important rule, sir.

307
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,080
Never put your hands under the table.

308
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,920
Never.

309
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,280
There's a historical reason for this.

310
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Because in the past, there might have been a gun hidden under the table.

311
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,960
A gun, yes.

312
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,920
Understood.

313
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,520
Don't use your elbows.

314
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,760
Don't use your arms.

315
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
Sir, relax.

316
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,640
Relax a bit.

317
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,200
You unfold your napkin.

318
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,160
But only after the host does so.

319
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Do you understand?

320
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
Yes, I understand.

321
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,960
Try not to do that.

322
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Okay.

323
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,320
Don't put it here either, put it on your lap.

324
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,280
Okay.

325
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,840
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

326
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Alright, it's our turn.

327
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,640
Very good, excellent.

328
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
Are you all ready now

329
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,280
to accept the real king's invitation?

330
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,680
Okay.

331
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,360
Thank you.

332
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,320
Thank you.

333
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
Thank you (with a respectful gesture).

334
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,920
Master.

335
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,160
After experiencing European traditional etiquette,

336
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,680
everyone,

337
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
let's change into something more comfortable

338
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,360
and continue our journey.

339
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
Let's go, everyone.

340
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,040
Let's go.

341
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,160
Come on, friends, let's set off.

342
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
The weather is amazing today.

343
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,680
So cool.

344
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,240
This is just too cool.

345
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,920
This car is so cute.

346
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,960
This car is so small.

347
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,000
It feels like you're bigger than this car.

348
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,880
I don't think I can fit in.

349
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,200
Their roads are very narrow.

350
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
That's why everyone likes to drive small cars.

351
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,240
Right?

352
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,760
Right.

353
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,120
Who sits in the front?

354
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,080
Whoever arrives last sits in the front.

355
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,480
Okay.

356
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,000
Sir, nice to meet you.

357
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,920
It's too big.

358
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,280
This is too big.

359
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,840
Too big.

360
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,200
Bro, the door's closed.

361
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,800
Watch your arm.

362
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay.

363
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,840
How old is this car?

364
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,720
This car is fifty-six years old.

365
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,280
It's from Italy.

366
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Yes.

367
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Fiat.

368
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,080
Fiat.

369
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,240
Cool.

370
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,800
I think my English works pretty well here.

371
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,280
It's actually quite useful.

372
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,400
I feel pretty fortunate.

373
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,920
I kind of want to try driving it.

374
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,880
Who dares to ride in my car?

375
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,720
Do you have a driver's license?

376
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes.

377
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,720
If you want to drive, I'll go with you.

378
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,400
I want to drive too.

379
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Have you driven a manual before?

380
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,080
Yes, my license is for manual.

381
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
This is reverse.

382
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,960
First gear, second gear.

383
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,920
How about you sit in the passenger seat?

384
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,440
Me?

385
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,920
No, you sit here with me.

386
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,960
Liu Yuning, you sit here.

387
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,360
In the front.

388
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,640
I can't even stretch my legs here.

389
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,280
Ning, as long as you open the door,

390
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
you can just use the foot brake.

391
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Come on.

392
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,560
What?

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,400
Why do you guys get to ride in the sports car?

394
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Security captain.

395
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,120
Patrol.

396
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,400
Let's take a group photo.

397
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,200
Three, two...

398
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,640
Use your phone to take a picture.

399
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,800
I don't know how.

400
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,440
You do it.

401
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,440
I still have to drive.

402
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,120
I still have to drive.

403
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
I still have to take your picture.

404
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,400
Are we in it?

405
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,040
Yes.

406
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,040
Ask the big bro to take one.

407
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
Honglei is at the very front.

408
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,560
Let's go.

409
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,760
Let's go.

410
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,200
This feels so cool.

411
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,560
Clutch.

412
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:13,960
Okay.

413
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,560
Don't panic.

414
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,440
Take it slow.

415
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,480
Why can't we move?

416
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,240
He Ge.

417
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,640
I want to go with you, He Ge.

418
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,440
Don't press it like that.

419
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,680
It shot out!

420
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,280
I want to get out.

421
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
I...

422
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
Wait, I put it in first gear.

423
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:35,920
Look.

424
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,720
I want to get out.

425
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,280
No, I don't want to.

426
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,840
Wait a moment.

427
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
That's right, look.

428
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,520
This is it, look.

429
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,240
Can I try?

430
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Of course you can.

431
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Let him drive, or else...

432
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
Let him drive.

433
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,720
I can't do it, I can't.

434
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,160
I can't.

435
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
Sit down, hurry.

436
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,440
There's someone behind you, what are you afraid of?

437
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,720
Release the clutch.

438
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,520
Okay.

439
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,600
Thank you, thank you.

440
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,680
It's fine.

441
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,520
It's fine.

442
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I can't.

443
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,440
Don't be afraid, it's fine.

444
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
I can't.

445
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,200
It's not a big problem.

446
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,040
It's not a big problem, you'll get used to it.

447
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,720
This feels amazing.

448
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,440
Even in Rome, we can drive.

449
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,320
And it's a convertible.

450
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,480
Look at that.

451
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,680
Little pig.

452
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,240
So cute, take a picture!

453
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,720
Bro.

454
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,080
Slow down.

455
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,440
Step on the brake.

456
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,000
That worked really well.

457
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
Help!

458
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,280
Keep your distance.

459
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,080
Keep your distance.

460
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,240
It's fine, no rush. Right.

461
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,280
This car is going twenty.

462
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
Twenty is good enough.

463
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Turn off the engine, bro.

464
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,640
It's fine, go ahead.

465
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
I have to give it a try.

466
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,040
I originally came to relax.

467
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,200
But in the end,

468
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,040
my toes are digging into the floor.

469
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
He Ge drives pretty well.

470
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
Yeah.

471
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,840
Actually, the driving king of Fuzhou

472
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't need to say much more.

473
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Slow down.

474
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
This turn is really wide.

475
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,080
Brake here.

476
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,640
This turn is really wide.

477
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,040
Brake here.

478
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,880
This turn is really wide.

479
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,560
Okay.

480
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,360
Brake here.

481
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,960
Okay.

482
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,600
Brake here.

483
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600
Brake a bit more, bro.

484
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Bro, bro.

485
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
A bit more.

486
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,640
Not this turn.

487
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,440
Yeah, this turn is really wide.

488
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,360
This is a sharp turn.

489
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,120
Someone told you.

490
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,120
It's so beautiful here.

491
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,640
Stop looking.

492
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,120
No need to look.

493
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,440
Watch the road.

494
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,760
Yes, I will.

495
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,360
I'll send you that postcard later.

496
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,960
Take a good look at it on the postcard.

497
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,120
I'll check out the aerial shots later.

498
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay, check out the aerial shots.

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
Watch our show.

500
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,960
He'll definitely film it.

501
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,440
So beautiful.

502
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,920
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

503
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,160
This is great. Look how beautiful it is.

504
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,400
Happiness.

505
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,800
Honglei is so cute.

506
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,560
Personality.

507
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,360
What kind of personality?

508
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not quite what I imagined.

509
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,880
So what kind of personality do you think he has?

510
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,840
I used to think

511
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,720
he might be pretty serious.

512
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,240
Would a serious person come here?

513
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,480
Honglei, you should be happy.

514
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,880
Take good care of Addy and Jiaojiao.

515
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Today I'm recording our feelings.

516
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,840
A joyful journey.

517
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,640
Leilei, Huang Bo.

518
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,720
Xun, Yixing.

519
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,480
Miss you all.

520
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,360
I miss you but I won't tell you.

521
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,120
That's just how cool I am.

522
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,680
Behind is Yuning.

523
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
Gong Jun.

524
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,080
And also Xiaowen.

525
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Love you all.

526
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,160
The brakes are a bit soft.

527
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,520
My legs are weak.

528
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,680
My legs are even weaker than the brakes.

529
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
I'm so overheated.

530
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,760
Riding in the car makes me overheated.

531
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,680
I instantly got a sore under my mouth.

532
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,640
Let me tell you,

533
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,240
it just popped out.

534
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,200
Instantly overheated.

535
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
See, my voice is even a bit hoarse.

536
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,720
It's because of this heat.

537
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,960
One reason is there's a surge of anger.

538
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,480
The other reason is

539
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
Brake quickly!

540
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,840
Step on the brake!

541
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,800
Hurry, step on it!

542
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm stepping on it.

543
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm watching.

544
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,200
Can you speak Fujianese?

545
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,080
You mean Minnan?

546
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,240
Not very well.

547
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Not well, just like me.

548
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,520
Only those who strive will win.

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
Only those who strive will win.

550
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,360
That's actually a bit gross.

551
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,600
Sometimes, when you lose your ambition, you can't help but complain.

552
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,960
Sometimes, when you're down and out, you can't help but feel afraid.

553
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,800
If you lose hope,

554
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,320
you'll be lost in a daze every day.

555
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,880
Like a scarecrow, soulless but with a body.

556
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,680
Sometimes up, sometimes down.

557
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,640
Good luck, bad luck,

558
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
you still have to keep working hard.

559
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,400
Thirty percent is fate,

560
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,880
seventy percent depends on effort.

561
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,760
Only those who strive will win.

562
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,680
In Italy,

563
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
singing this song is really

564
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
amazing.

565
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,520
We're here.

566
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
I survived.

567
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,680
Finally got everyone here safely.

568
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,720
You drove so well.

569
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,000
My anger has all died down.

570
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,040
Turn off the engine quickly.

571
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,200
Turn off the engine, this anger is rising.

572
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,160
Scared them, really scared them.

573
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,360
My legs are already weak.

574
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,320
My voice is hoarse, seriously.

575
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,440
I only said three words the whole time.

576
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,560
Step on the brakes.

577
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,480
Park the car.

578
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,600
Liu Yuning, quickly put out the fire for me.

579
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,160
Not even a second more.

580
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
As brothers, we risked our lives to accompany you.

581
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
We've reached the beach, everyone.

582
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
We're here, almost.

583
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,040
Here we come.

584
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,640
This lake.

585
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,120
Look how relaxed they are.

586
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
So laid-back.

587
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,160
See if the lake is clear.

588
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,320
It's actually pretty clear.

589
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,000
Really.

590
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,880
Take off your glasses.

591
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,320
Turns out the color is quite nice.

592
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
Look, Honglei.

593
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,520
That's your shadow.

594
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,640
Cool.

595
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,760
Sun Honglei.

596
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,840
This shadow.

597
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,120
It's just so handsome.

598
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,640
Swaying to the seaside

599
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,480
Xiao He and Didi

600
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,360
They look like a father and his daughter

601
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,480
Can you swim?

602
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,360
Yes, I'm really good at it

603
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,160
I'm really good at it

604
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,600
I'm really good at it too

605
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,080
A person among fish

606
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,840
Then I'm a mermaid

607
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,280
Mint candy

608
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,000
Calm down

609
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,440
I can't calm down anymore

610
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,360
I've already broken out

611
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
The three of us

612
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Wait, why?

613
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,800
What?

614
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
No matter where I sit, it's always the three of us

615
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,520
I saved this seat for you

616
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,960
You three are even from the same company

617
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,520
As everyone knows

618
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,920
Macaroni is a staple of Italian cuisine

619
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,040
and one of its important symbols

620
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,320
Inspired by macaroni

621
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,080
we've prepared a task for everyone

622
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,680
called

623
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,600
the "Elite Among People" Challenge

624
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,360
Why is it called "Elite Among People"?

625
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,320
Because everyone knows

626
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,000
there is someone in our team

627
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,960
who is a true king among people

628
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
Today we'll use our philtrums

629
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,760
to determine the winner.

630
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
Uncle Nai will definitely win.

631
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,440
For our game props, we specifically chose

632
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,040
straws shaped like macaroni.

633
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
The rules are very simple.

634
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,680
Hold your straw with your philtrum.

635
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,920
Whoever can use their own straw

636
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,240
to knock off the opponent's straw

637
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,000
will earn

638
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,560
the title of "Philtrum Champion."

639
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,440
Use the straw to hit.

640
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,920
Right.

641
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,400
No hands allowed.

642
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,720
Simple.

643
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,520
You have to use your mouth.

644
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,280
I have a mouth ulcer, it hurts so much.

645
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,280
I just rode in his car and immediately

646
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,080
got a surge of bad energy.

647
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,840
I've already broken out.

648
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,960
I've got a bump in my mouth.

649
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm so mad I could "die."

650
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,040
Are you mad at me or the car?

651
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,400
I don't know who to blame.

652
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Maybe just be mad at the car.

653
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,720
Don't be mad at me.

654
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,280
Blame the car.

655
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,200
Come on.

656
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,480
These are our official competition tools.

657
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
They meet "international standard" sizes, right?

658
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,400
Very precise.

659
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Uncle Nai's philtrum is long.

660
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,240
He'll definitely win.

661
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,240
A long philtrum makes it easy to drop, though.

662
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
It's easy to lose it if you hold it between your nose and lips.

663
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,240
Wait, can we even play this game?

664
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,800
It's really hard.

665
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,440
Very hard.

666
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,480
You two, stand over here.

667
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,640
Why is it the two of us?

668
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,400
A "battle royale" from the Central Academy of Drama.

669
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,640
Come on.

670
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,040
Let's go.

671
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:21,920
So...

672
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,840
Wait, we can't just...

673
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,920
...just naturally be put on the same team.

674
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,720
Why is that?

675
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm fine with it.

676
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,960
I'll pick first.

677
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,680
Go ahead.

678
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,600
Pick me, bro.

679
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,960
I'm scared now.

680
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,720
Excuse me.

681
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,320
Didi.

682
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,080
Pick a guy first.

683
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,840
Yeah.

684
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,280
Is that okay?

685
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,680
Go ahead.

686
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,240
He'er.

687
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,080
He'er.

688
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,960
I don't want to compete against this contestant.

689
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,440
Bro, why is everyone avoiding you?

690
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,280
You can't refuse, hurry up.

691
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,240
Bro, this round today...

692
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,120
...let's turn the tables and sing our victory song.

693
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,360
Yeah.

694
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,480
Let's just take them all out.

695
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,240
Alright.

696
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,680
We'll be the owners from now on.

697
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Brilliant.

698
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,040
This is the polite kind.

699
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Don't dodge.

700
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
Stop fighting.

701
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,160
You guys, stop fighting.

702
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,520
Attack the lower part, the lower part.

703
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,520
You guys, stop fighting.

704
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,040
What kind of pose is this?

705
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,720
We should draw a circle, right?

706
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,880
You can't step out of the circle.

707
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,440
And you can't use your hands.

708
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,080
Right.

709
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,480
Hands have to be behind your back.

710
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,880
Right.

711
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,200
Uncle Nai, you need to pout your upper lip a bit.

712
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,480
What do you mean?

713
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,680
Jun Jun, go!

714
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,960
Come on.

715
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,840
How do you get an advantage?

716
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,480
If you're tall, he can't hit you.

717
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,680
Really.

718
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
He can't reach.

719
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,920
Harry Potter.

720
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,680
You need to do it on this side.

721
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
No using hands.

722
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,360
Like the mating dance birds do.

723
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,440
Sorry if I offended you.

724
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,240
Let's take a break.

725
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,640
It's mainly sore here.

726
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,000
The main thing is you can't keep hitting continuously.

727
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,560
Right.

728
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,400
Who's next?

729
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,560
Come on.

730
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,120
I'll go first.

731
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:19,840
Oh no.

732
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
You're taller than me.

733
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,240
Oh no.

734
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Oh no.

735
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,520
Come.

736
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,640
Come on.

737
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,880
Come on.

738
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Stop fighting, you guys.

739
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,680
Stop fighting, you guys.

740
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:38,920
Come on.

741
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,520
Stop fighting.

742
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,800
Stop fighting, you guys.

743
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,000
Stop fighting, you guys.

744
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,800
Stop fighting.

745
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,720
Okay, I'm coming.

746
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,320
Is it okay to stick it in your nostril?

747
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,440
You do it.

748
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,960
I want to see.

749
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,480
I really can't hold this.

750
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,520
I really can't hold this.

751
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't know why.

752
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,080
If you can stick it in your nostril,

753
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,000
we'll allow two.

754
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,840
Double swords.

755
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,720
Yeah.

756
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,880
Double swords combined.

757
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
Okay, here we go.

758
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,880
Get ready.

759
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,320
I really can't hold it.

760
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,440
Why aren't you moving?

761
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
Really, I just can't hold it.

762
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,160
If I'd known, I would have challenged him.

763
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,000
You have to step in now.

764
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,520
Brother.

765
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,240
I helped wear down his

766
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,640
muscle endurance already.

767
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,440
Bro, beat him!

768
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,680
Big bro.

769
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,680
Sorry, big bro.

770
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,240
No need to apologize.

771
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,320
Can we not offend you, big bro?

772
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,160
Sorry.

773
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,400
Don't offend him, big bro.

774
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,320
Is that okay?

775
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,760
Big bro.

776
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,000
Jun Jun, let's talk this over.

777
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,720
Let's discuss.

778
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,240
If you...

779
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
If you lose this round,

780
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,360
I'll call you big bro, okay?

781
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,840
No, we have sportsmanship.

782
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,360
Sportsmanship.

783
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,120
I'll make you lose badly.

784
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,880
Alright.

785
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,720
Little brother.

786
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,400
I'll fight to the end to win.

787
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,160
This

788
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,600
I want to ask

789
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,440
about this straw

790
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,560
Has it faded?

791
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,520
On Junjun's side here,

792
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,120
there's already a patch of beard

793
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,000
and it's faded

794
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040
Look

795
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,800
That's the one

796
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,760
It's just hormones

797
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,560
The beard is growing out

798
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,360
It's popping out

799
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,360
It's popping out

800
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,600
It's popping out

801
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,000
Wait a minute

802
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,640
Honglei's is practically a drawer

803
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,840
So fast.

804
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,160
This is just like a float.

805
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,960
Naiwen.

806
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,280
Doesn't this look annoying to you?

807
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,600
You can challenge him, Naiwen.

808
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,520
What happens if I beat him?

809
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,120
You have to be like Gong Jun.

810
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,160
Beat everyone one by one.

811
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,520
Become

812
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,360
the Straw King.

813
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,720
Come on.

814
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,200
Come.

815
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,560
Come on.

816
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,800
Come on, "drawer."

817
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,160
What does "drawer" mean?

818
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,360
It means

819
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,000
when you first clamp the straw,

820
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
a lot comes out from here.

821
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,000
It's like a float.

822
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,960
Come on.

823
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,280
Put your hands behind your back.

824
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,160
Come on.

825
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,080
Everyone wants to

826
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,000
You can't go past this area.

827
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,320
Everyone wants to take it easy, right?

828
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,080
Come.

829
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,440
This...

830
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,880
Hands behind your back.

831
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,360
This is intense.

832
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,440
This is the most

833
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,400
intense round ever.

834
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,080
Okay.

835
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,520
He’s clamping it really tight.

836
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,679
So tight.

837
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,960
Very firm.

838
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,120
I just saw it.

839
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,960
It looks like it’s growing on his face.

840
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,560
I put it in the drawer.

841
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,840
How about this instead?

842
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,320
How about all five of us join in?

843
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,840
Come on, play with him.

844
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
All five of us together.

845
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Come on.

846
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
I think we should come up with a plan.

847
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,760
Let's take out the strongest one first.

848
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,640
Okay.

849
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,120
Is that okay?

850
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,600
Okay.

851
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
The four of us will take out the strongest one first.

852
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,800
See, it's four against one.

853
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,480
Everyone's after me.

854
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
I feel like I'm back ten years ago.

855
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,760
You're the chosen one, bro.

856
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,880
One, two, three, go!

857
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,600
Hurry up!

858
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,480
Are you really that strong?

859
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,400
I lost.

860
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,680
What are you two doing here, just hanging around?

861
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,960
Darn it, that competitive spirit.

862
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,760
Those two were holding on really tight too.

863
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,280
Those two.

864
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,600
I was the first to fall.

865
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,880
Congratulations to the winner.

866
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,000
We won.

867
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,440
The girls haven't played yet.

868
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,240
The girls haven't played.

869
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,080
Come on.

870
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,160
Competing for the top girl.

871
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,040
Why does my philtrum feel itchy?

872
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,560
Wait a second.

873
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,280
Your snot is coming out, Didi.

874
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,120
Didi.

875
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,520
Go clean it up first.

876
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,640
Clean it up, quickly.

877
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,600
No.

878
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
Increasing stickiness is fine.

879
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,600
Liu Yuning said,

880
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,360
Increase the stickiness.

881
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,040
That's fine.

882
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,360
That's also okay.

883
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,840
But we can't just rely on this to stick.

884
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,000
Stick it on.

885
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,760
It's stuck.

886
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,920
No.

887
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,400
Old Di, this is about to get stained.

888
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,000
Hurry up.

889
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Who do we think will win?

890
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,080
We can make a guess.

891
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,200
We're definitely supporting Property Management.

892
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,560
I'll put up a straw.

893
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,400
Who are you?

894
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,080
Who do you support?

895
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,400
I support...

896
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,840
Wenzi.

897
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,560
From our company.

898
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,000
Okay.

899
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,040
Then I support Didi.

900
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
Um, I support Didi.

901
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,320
Come on.

902
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,640
Let you guys play.

903
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,920
Can't even hold it with your own chopsticks.

904
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,760
I'm not important.

905
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,360
What are you doing?

906
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,720
Dancing, right?

907
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,680
They're fighting, aren't they?

908
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,760
First time for this straw battle.

909
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,680
So flamboyant.

910
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,040
Okay.

911
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Okay.

912
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,120
As the Italians often say,

913
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,400
take it slow.

914
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,200
The relaxed attitude of Romans

915
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,080
is a way of life ingrained in their bones.

916
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,080
Everyone in the Earth Group

917
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,520
also experienced this

918
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,000
laid-back lifestyle by the lake.

919
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,840
Besides that,

920
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,200
the Earth Group in Rome

921
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,040
also encountered some

922
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,960
unexpected surprises.

923
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,240
So beautiful.

924
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,200
What is this?

925
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,520
Look.

926
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,240
What are they doing?

927
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,600
Chinese kung fu.

928
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,800
That was amazing.

929
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,320
That was amazing.

930
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,080
That was amazing.

931
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm stunned.

932
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,320
There's more performances.

933
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,160
There's more.

934
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,280
There's also a lion dance.

935
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,120
That's a little lion.

936
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,720
It's a child.

937
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,200
This little lion is so cute.

938
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,720
The backlighting here looks so beautiful.

939
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,560
Take a picture.

940
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,440
So cute, the child.

941
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,360
His pants are about to fall.

942
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,680
Did you see his pants almost fall just now?

943
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,840
So adorable.

944
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,520
So cool.

945
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,360
These moves have a special charm.

946
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,240
Ao Bing.

947
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,840
This scene is beautiful.

948
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
Feels like time travel.

949
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,240
Feels like time travel.

950
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,360
A group of our friends from Italy

951
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,240
came to perform our traditional Chinese culture.

952
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,440
Is this a character?

953
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,840
Is this the "zhong" from "China"?

954
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,280
Cool.

955
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,200
Okay.

956
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,360
Thank you.

957
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,600
This is a child.

958
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,560
Child.

959
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,640
Let's take a photo together.

960
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,600
Come on, let's take a photo together.

961
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,160
Friends.

962
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,120
Come, Master.

963
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,800
Master.

964
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,560
Hello.

965
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,360
I'm here.

966
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,200
That's amazing.

967
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,400
Three, two, one.

968
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,920
Hello, everyone.

969
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,640
Hello.

970
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,120
Welcome.

971
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,240
I am Fabio Tozzi.

972
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,440
He is Nicola Pastorino.

973
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,440
We have been practicing kung fu for forty years.

974
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,680
We practice different styles.

975
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,920
Baguazhang.

976
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,800
And Wing Chun.

977
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,120
Another style is Hung Gar.

978
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,200
Our school follows

979
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,360
the principles of the Wong Fei-hung school.

980
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,280
Wong Fei-hung is famous for this.

981
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
Isn't Wong Fei-hung known for the "Shadowless Kick"?

982
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,640
Yes, he is very skilled at kicking.

983
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,400
I see.

984
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,280
Yes, he is very skilled at kicking.

985
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,480
But this is

986
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,000
Wong Fei-hung's most powerful technique.

987
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,720
Number one.

988
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,320
In Italy,

989
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,760
there are many people who love traditional Chinese culture.

990
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,600
International friends.

991
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,920
Aqueduct Park is also a place where they often gather.

992
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,160
The master of these two teachers

993
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,800
has, since the 1970s,

994
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,360
studied under many Chinese martial arts masters.

995
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,200
For many years, they have also

996
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
been promoting Chinese kung fu in Italy and abroad.

997
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,080
been promoting Chinese kung fu.

998
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,880
The two teachers will now

999
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,120
demonstrate a technique for us.

1000
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,240
Now I'll spar with you.

1001
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,600
I can't.

1002
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,120
Yuning, the master likes you.

1003
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,200
Come here for a moment.

1004
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,240
Give it a try.

1005
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,880
Yuning, show a couple of moves.

1006
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,880
Really? Why?

1007
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,760
I started learning martial arts from my grandfather when I was four.

1008
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,800
I didn't.

1009
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,880
I think you should go easy.

1010
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,000
Be sure to go easy.

1011
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,960
It's already come to this.

1012
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm ready.

1013
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,800
Take care.

1014
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,600
No, sorry.

1015
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,400
Um...

1016
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,280
No, I'm ready.

1017
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,760
They're joking.

1018
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,560
He's serious.

1019
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,720
How about this: he has a weapon, and you have a weapon too.

1020
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,480
Nunchaku.

1021
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,760
Chen He is...

1022
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,320
the "successor" of Chen-style Tai Chi.

1023
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,760
Yes.

1024
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,600
He's a Tai Chi "successor."

1025
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,920
Fight.

1026
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,840
He's the best.

1027
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,720
He's the best among us.

1028
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,160
Yes.

1029
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,960
He's a professional.

1030
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
His profession is stunt double.

1031
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,560
Master.

1032
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Beautiful student

1033
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Beautiful student

1034
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,760
Beautiful student

1035
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm from the good looks club

1036
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,680
Beautiful student

1037
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,280
I'm showing off to you, bro

1038
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,880
You should have him call you a beautiful student too

1039
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,120
Let's not embarrass ourselves

1040
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,920
Really

1041
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,560
Teacher

1042
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,840
Then, teacher, teach me a set

1043
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,480
That sparring move, okay?

1044
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,160
No problem

1045
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,360
If you want

1046
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:38,920
If you want

1047
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,760
I can teach you some

1048
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,920
kung fu moves

1049
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,600
Of course

1050
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,040
Okay

1051
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,080
One of the moves

1052
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,600
Is this mantis fist?

1053
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,880
Isn't this tiger?

1054
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,520
Tiger claw

1055
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,560
Tiger claw

1056
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,960
Yes, tiger

1057
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,440
That startled me

1058
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,160
This one

1059
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Bend it a bit

1060
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,800
Where is my

1061
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,320
cane

1062
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:21,840
Bend

1063
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,040
Like this?

1064
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,720
No

1065
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,880
Yes

1066
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,640
Very good

1067
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,640
Show me

1068
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,560
Follow me

1069
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,280
Follow you

1070
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,880
One

1071
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,360
Two

1072
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,800
Perfect.

1073
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,560
Very good.

1074
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,720
The teacher reluctantly applauded.

1075
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,680
Thank you for letting me win, teacher.

1076
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,800
Gift.

1077
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,360
Master.

1078
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,080
I saw that you have that

1079
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,560
Southern lion dance.

1080
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,520
It's really cool.

1081
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,440
And coincidentally,

1082
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,600
the play I performed in before

1083
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,640
also had elements of lion dance.

1084
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,400
So I want to give you

1085
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
this, which is from China.

1086
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,760
It's called a "hulu" (gourd).

1087
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,400
It symbolizes luck and wealth.

1088
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,120
Thank you.

1089
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,280
This is for you.

1090
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,120
It's very

1091
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,760
popular as a trendy toy now.

1092
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,640
Kids will really like it. Thank you.

1093
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,640
Thank you.

1094
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,000
Thank you.

1095
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,160
Thank you.

1096
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,160
Goodbye.

1097
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,680
Goodbye.

1098
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,320
Mizone, save me.

1099
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,000
Xiaowen

1100
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,680
I see you're so tired you're sweating.

1101
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,200
Don't rush.

1102
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,800
I've got something good for you.

1103
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,520
Brother Honglei

1104
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
You really get me.

1105
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,840
I'm really thirsty and tired.

1106
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,040
I need a quick sip.

1107
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,720
I feel alive again.

1108
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,920
It's refreshing and hydrating.

1109
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,720
Now I'm back to full energy.

1110
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,800
Let's have a little competition then.

1111
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,400
Energy's dropping.

1112
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
So thirsty and tired, I'm about to collapse.

1113
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,720
Join the "Stay Energized with Mizone" challenge.

1114
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,640
On the road during your journey,

1115
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,520
stay in top form.

1116
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,760
Succeed and win a Mizone supply pack.

1117
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,800
Please have Sun Honglei present to Wang Yuwen

1118
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,880
the Mizone supply pack.

1119
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,120
Stay energized with Mizone as your lifesaver.

1120
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,840
Get ready for more challenges on your journey.

1121
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,320
Since there are so many

1122
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,560
friends in Italy who love Chinese culture,

1123
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,360
let's also leave behind

1124
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,320
some wonderful memories here.

1125
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,920
Next,

1126
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,480
you will complete

1127
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,440
a one-minute martial arts short film here.

1128
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,760
The key word for the plot is

1129
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,240
Who wants to play the male lead?

1130
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,000
Gong Jun, how about you?

1131
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,800
No.

1132
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,280
Naiwen, how about you play the male lead?

1133
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,360
I can't do it.

1134
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,320
Naiwen can do it.

1135
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,680
Naiwen, I think you should be the male lead.

1136
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,920
I'll do it.

1137
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,560
No.

1138
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,040
I'll play the "Martial Arts Manual."

1139
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,960
I'll play the "Martial Arts Manual."

1140
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,360
Because I'm the "book."

1141
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,880
What?

1142
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,400
Because he's "shu"—it's a pun.

1143
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,360
"Shu" (uncle).

1144
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,520
Then someone will have to practice with you later.

1145
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,840
Someone will practice with you in a bit.

1146
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,040
Practice with me.

1147
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,200
Okay.

1148
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,320
A hero of late-night snacks works too.

1149
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,240
A generation's "snack" hero.

1150
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,480
Is that okay?

1151
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,360
A hero of late-night snacks for a generation.

1152
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,360
Like Chen He.

1153
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,080
Eating at night.

1154
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,040
Getting this fat.

1155
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,920
Is that right?

1156
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,800
Let's brainstorm first.

1157
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,680
Come up with a story.

1158
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,680
Then figure out how to do it.

1159
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,560
He's the uncle, so you be the main character.

1160
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,960
How about the three of us play bandits?

1161
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,960
The three of us are the bad guys.

1162
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,280
Okay.

1163
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,720
No, you play the main character.

1164
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,800
I don't want to play the main character.

1165
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,080
I don't want to be the main character.

1166
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,160
We

1167
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,600
How about

1168
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,400
Two male leads

1169
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,280
Two male leads

1170
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,480
Two male leads

1171
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,680
You're pretty creative.

1172
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,920
No,

1173
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,080
We could play the younger versions.

1174
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,200
And also play

1175
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,240
the older versions.

1176
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,480
Sure, bro.

1177
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,200
Right?

1178
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,680
Okay.

1179
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,600
Then it's you two.

1180
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,760
You two are a couple now.

1181
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,520
That means you're lovers.

1182
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,920
Already disappeared, right?

1183
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,000
How about this:

1184
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,400
You play me twenty years later.

1185
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,680
You play him twenty years later.

1186
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,840
Okay.

1187
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,320
Like this.

1188
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,040
You and Didi

1189
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,320
The three of you were the youth group before.

1190
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,000
Youth group.

1191
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,400
We're the senior group.

1192
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,320
And then He-ge is

1193
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,400
the pest.

1194
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,520
No.

1195
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,080
The younger and older versions of the villain

1196
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,640
are both him.

1197
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,320
They're both him.

1198
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,160
He has lived a long time.

1199
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,000
Alright.

1200
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,560
I have to fight so many people by myself.

1201
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,320
You're "crazy."

1202
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,200
The two of us are

1203
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,560
What is the grown-up version?

1204
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,480
It's ours.

1205
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,760
It's our grown-up version.

1206
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,200
What are you?

1207
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,760
We are the youth version.

1208
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,400
The youth version of who?

1209
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,520
You, the youth version.

1210
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,360
Who are we?

1211
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
You are

1212
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,080
They are you, and you are also him.

1213
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,760
Two senior brothers from the same sect

1214
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,880
and a junior sister

1215
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,400
Okay

1216
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,920
I think it should be like this

1217
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,960
At the beginning

1218
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
the two of us are practicing

1219
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,920
I say, "Senior brother,"

1220
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,400
"Do you still remember that day fifty years ago?"

1221
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,360
Then you two arrive

1222
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,600
So the camera should pan like this

1223
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,280
First, film you two

1224
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,840
Then

1225
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,240
pan over to this side

1226
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,880
Right, senior brother

1227
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,760
"Do you remember fifty years ago?"

1228
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,480
Then it's your turn

1229
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,960
Then the other one of you says

1230
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,520
Then it flashes back again

1231
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,080
Junior brother

1232
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,120
You said, fifty years later

1233
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,800
what would we be like

1234
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,600
Pan over

1235
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,680
That's fine

1236
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,000
That's fine

1237
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,880
Do you still remember back then, that

1238
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,760
Chen Tianba?

1239
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,320
Pan to me

1240
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,280
This works.

1241
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,920
And there's a backstory, too.

1242
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,000
That's "crazy."

1243
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,560
This is a masterpiece.

1244
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,720
Like this.

1245
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,960
We're the younger version.

1246
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,720
Let's have

1247
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,960
the two older brothers come up with a scenario.

1248
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,160
We'll improvise it.

1249
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,960
Then he

1250
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,200
will switch to the older version.

1251
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,440
We can call them in at any time.

1252
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Okay.

1253
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,320
Let's do it.

1254
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,560
There are also weapons.

1255
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,240
And costumes.

1256
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,760
Pick a cooler one.

1257
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,120
You're wearing white, right?

1258
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:58,960
Then I'll wear black.

1259
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,880
Alright.

1260
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,840
You are...

1261
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,120
You're not practicing martial arts anymore.

1262
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,720
You're making money now, bro.

1263
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,720
No, I'm not.

1264
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,600
I've gone into business.

1265
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm doing business now.

1266
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:10,720
That's right.

1267
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,240
Gone into business.

1268
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:12,600
Why?

1269
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,480
Those three look much more upright.

1270
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,600
Why do we look like this?

1271
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,360
Let me tell you,

1272
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,240
it's really not our fault.

1273
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,960
Look.

1274
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,440
What's wrong?

1275
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,520
Sha Shidi,

1276
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,040
I spent ages just getting a skirt.

1277
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,360
Can you tie it for me?

1278
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,000
Tie it for me.

1279
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,320
This is Dae Jang Geum.

1280
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,560
Dae Jang Geum.

1281
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,160
Does this outfit not have a top?

1282
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,040
No top.

1283
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,800
Seriously?

1284
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,280
It's fine.

1285
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,800
Where's my top?

1286
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,680
I'll find you a top.

1287
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,520
Here.

1288
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,360
Let's mix and match this.

1289
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,640
What's this?

1290
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,840
This is going from martial arts to mythology.

1291
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,960
This is a monster.

1292
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,120
I'm a parrot.

1293
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,880
Bro,

1294
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,160
a handy weapon.

1295
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,200
Monster

1296
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,520
No way

1297
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,840
Honestly, this is just too outrageous

1298
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,240
No

1299
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,480
Dae Jang Geum

1300
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,400
It's just too much

1301
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,600
Just like this

1302
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,800
Here, let me take care of the back for you

1303
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,120
Come on

1304
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,200
Yeah

1305
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:23,880
This works

1306
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,560
Gone Girl

1307
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,400
I think He Yan

1308
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,960
Missing Lover is really good

1309
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,640
Yeah

1310
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,960
It's especially charming

1311
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,000
You guys

1312
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,120
You two groups

1313
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,920
If you're using the pole to swing those

1314
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
I'll go shoot some fragmented shots

1315
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,040
You can edit them into your part, okay?

1316
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,760
Alright

1317
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,400
Just have one camera follow me

1318
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,360
No, bro

1319
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,320
Trust me

1320
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
You guys just act your parts

1321
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,160
My shots can definitely

1322
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,000
be added in to make it much richer

1323
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,080
Come on, have two cameras follow me

1324
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,600
Hurry

1325
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,120
Come on

1326
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,640
Let's start with a close-up

1327
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,840
A close-up of my hand, like this

1328
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,320
Okay, follow this close-up of the hand

1329
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,120
Move forward

1330
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,320
Okay, follow for a few seconds

1331
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,840
Follow

1332
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:07,920
Okay.

1333
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,000
Then,

1334
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,480
I swing it in front of me.

1335
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,400
Then you do this.

1336
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,480
And then like this.

1337
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,280
Ready, one, two, three.

1338
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,160
Alright.

1339
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,480
Then just follow behind my back.

1340
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,920
Pull it that way.

1341
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,240
You pull from behind me.

1342
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,080
It's hard for me to face

1343
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,040
the person walking toward me.

1344
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,400
To be honest,

1345
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,240
you can't really tell.

1346
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,320
You can't see the face either.

1347
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,760
So, we'll go down this road.

1348
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,240
Alright.

1349
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,960
Come on, you guys follow.

1350
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,960
Are you following?

1351
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,160
Okay.

1352
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,880
As long as they have an opening, it's fine.

1353
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,000
Then they can cut over.

1354
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,440
Come on.

1355
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,000
Let's go.

1356
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,880
Let's improvise.

1357
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,400
Come on.

1358
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,080
Start, let's go.

1359
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,640
I've called it.

1360
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,440
Get into position.

1361
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,440
Ready.

1362
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,840
Here we go, three, two, one.

1363
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,560
Action.

1364
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,000
Junior Sister

1365
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,440
Senior Brother

1366
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,400
Junior Brother

1367
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,280
Do you all still remember

1368
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,960
that day fifty years ago

1369
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,840
at night?

1370
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,840
I remember that day

1371
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,400
It was a summer day

1372
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,200
on a night in Rome

1373
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,640
Eldest Senior Brother

1374
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,160
went "crazy"

1375
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,600
and started slapping Junior Brother like mad

1376
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Do it again.

1377
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,920
Um,

1378
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,120
After Second Junior finishes speaking,

1379
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,120
pass it over.

1380
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,760
Right.

1381
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,240
Each of us says one line.

1382
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,000
Come on.

1383
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,200
Okay, get ready.

1384
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,280
Ready, go.

1385
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,160
Junior Sister,

1386
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,120
Senior Brother,

1387
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:42,920
Junior Brother,

1388
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,440
Do you still remember that day fifty years ago?

1389
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,480
You don't mean that day, do you?

1390
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,720
You're talking about that day, right?

1391
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,280
This day is actually pretty nice.

1392
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,600
What do you think, Junior Brother?

1393
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,440
Senior Brother,

1394
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,960
The weather is amazing today.

1395
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,080
We could have a

1396
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,920
duel.

1397
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,240
Okay, pass it over.

1398
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,320
It didn't reach.

1399
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,080
Give it to us.

1400
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,040
Alright, here we go.

1401
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,120
I think this duel

1402
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,040
should be set for

1403
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,960
fifty years later.

1404
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,280
Fifty years later.

1405
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,840
We'll finally settle this.

1406
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,520
Shake.

1407
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,680
Today is the day.

1408
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,800
Back then, I liked to sing.

1409
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,600
A Laugh in the Vast Sea

1410
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,720
The surging tides on both shores

1411
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,960
At that time, I never knew

1412
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,680
which senior brother

1413
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,560
was actually

1414
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,560
the more handsome one.

1415
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,800
Junior sister

1416
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,480
I'm so handsome today.

1417
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,440
Dressed up on purpose

1418
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,520
Junior sister

1419
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,280
Second senior brother

1420
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,880
Junior sister

1421
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,800
He's so strange

1422
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Then I remember I just knelt down

1423
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,280
and proposed to junior sister

1424
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,480
This won't do

1425
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,920
Brother

1426
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,640
Senior brother

1427
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,880
Then I also knelt down and proposed

1428
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,160
Junior sister

1429
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,120
Junior sister

1430
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,000
Then I remember

1431
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,120
Junior sister, you sang a song

1432
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,640
"Between a Rock and a Hard Place"

1433
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,560
Wait a second

1434
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,120
Are you guys done yet?

1435
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,840
Not done yet

1436
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,320
Not done yet, huh?

1437
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,240
It's our turn

1438
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,280
Your turn

1439
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,480
That thing of yours

1440
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,120
You didn't act it out

1441
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,440
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, right?

1442
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,880
Help us act it out

1443
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,600
Then I'll do it

1444
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,280
Okay

1445
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,080
My villain's martial arts

1446
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,600
is called

1447
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,840
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter

1448
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,280
Alright

1449
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,960
Okay

1450
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,160
He needs to play Chunxiang and Qiuxiang

1451
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,920
Alright

1452
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,200
This part needs to be edited into "walk two steps"

1453
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,040
Move to the side

1454
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,280
Walk two steps and move here

1455
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,440
"Horror" film

1456
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,840
That's enough.

1457
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,160
First, film the four holes.

1458
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,560
They're empty, right?

1459
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,440
Empty, yes.

1460
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,400
The four lonely holes—capture a sense of loneliness.

1461
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,120
Lonely, very lonely.

1462
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:05,800
Then I will—

1463
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,240
Then I will—

1464
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,440
come out of each hole, one by one.

1465
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,520
Strike a pose.

1466
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,840
I come out of one hole.

1467
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,880
Write "Spring" on this wall.

1468
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,120
Summer.

1469
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,200
Autumn.

1470
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:14,720
Winter.

1471
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,640
That's enough.

1472
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,160
We've already given them too much.

1473
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,440
This should be a thriller, right?

1474
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,760
Legend has it

1475
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,800
that somewhere at 40 degrees north latitude

1476
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,480
there is a rift in time and space.

1477
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,040
And I

1478
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,880
am the guardian of the rift.

1479
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,800
On this day,

1480
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,280
a strange phenomenon appeared in the sky.

1481
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,760
The rift in time and space shattered.

1482
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,880
My treasure

1483
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,880
The time-space manual fell in

1484
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,880
It fell into two parallel universes

1485
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,440
Fifty years later, three great heroes

1486
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,640
suffer from severe manual phobia

1487
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,440
I have manual phobia

1488
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,560
I also have manual phobia

1489
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,800
It's impossible to practice this manual

1490
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,280
It's so painful

1491
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,760
Fifty years ago

1492
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,120
The three had milder symptoms

1493
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,840
Much milder

1494
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,640
Senior brother, look

1495
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,920
I found one

1496
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,280
A martial arts manual

1497
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,520
I have manual phobia

1498
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,200
Junior sister, how about this

1499
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,480
The two senior brothers will accompany you

1500
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,320
to practice this martial art

1501
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,240
and help you become

1502
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,520
a legendary hero

1503
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,160
How about it?

1504
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,640
Okay

1505
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,040
The curious little junior sister

1506
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,280
couldn't wait

1507
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,640
and started practicing right away

1508
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,720
Training through the coldest winters and hottest summers

1509
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,360
But who would have thought

1510
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,560
that after practicing this manual

1511
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,320
it would increase their competitiveness and aggressiveness

1512
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,720
even leading to conflict among fellow disciples

1513
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,000
Both of them are my good senior brothers

1514
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,200
The situation is extremely critical.

1515
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,800
I must master it immediately.

1516
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,400
The power that contains the cycle of the four seasons,

1517
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,280
the Divine Art of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.

1518
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:23,840
Only then can I mend

1519
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,440
the rift in time and space.

1520
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
and save the lives of the two heroes.

1521
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,480
It's done.

1522
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,000
Fifty years ago,

1523
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,960
the strike delivered by Junior Sister,

1524
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,160
in the time fifty years later,

1525
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,200
was forcibly

1526
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,680
stopped.

1527
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,480
Senior Brother,

1528
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,000
your bite is still as strong as ever.

1529
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,600
Good thing you held on.

1530
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,440
You two Senior Brothers really are

1531
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,840
still as sharp as ever.

1532
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
Victory or defeat—

1533
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,800
does it really matter?

1534
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,800
I understand now.

1535
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,720
Compared to becoming a martial arts master,

1536
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,720
this bond that has survived life and death,

1537
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,960
and has never been broken across time and space,

1538
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,400
the camaraderie between fellow disciples

1539
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,640
is the true treasure worth protecting.

1540
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,440
I think we shouldn't spread this around.

1541
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,880
We're about to have our first

1542
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,400
job swap.

1543
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,840
He stood up, bro!

1544
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,080
Heavens, help me.

1545
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,000
Wow.

1546
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,720
It's fate.

1547
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,640
Don't touch me.

1548
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,400
Come on, darling.

1549
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,760
No idea at all.

1550
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,000
I really couldn't tell.

1551
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,200
I don't care, none of you should be happy.

1552
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,360
Hitting means affection, scolding means love.

1553
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,800
You're the weirdest one.

1554
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,280
You stayed at the back on purpose.

1555
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,000
The one acting jealous must be Naiwen.

1556
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,920
Yuning doesn't know.

1557
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,840
It must be you.

1558
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,160
This one.

1559
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,080
He keeps explaining and you all keep listening.

1560
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,000
The last one.

1561
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Snatched the center spot so easily.

1562
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,200
The jealous one has been exposed.

1563
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,600
Two words: very.

1564
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,000
Very Chinese.

1565
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,680
Most.

1566
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,320
Popular.

1567
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:04,920
Movie.

1568
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,480
Nezha.

1569
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,240
Right.

1570
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:06,920
Awesome.

1571
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,000
Apple.

1572
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
No.

1573
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,920
Not a person, right?

1574
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,120
Let's go, to the diving spot.

1575
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,520
Goodbye, Mom.

1576
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,280
Tonight I'm setting sail.

1577
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,280
Really nice.

1578
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,120
You're up next.

1579
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,920
One, two, go.

1580
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,920
One-arm pull-up.

1581
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,960
Here I come.

1582
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,360
Now that we're here, shouldn't we swim in the sea?

1583
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,000
Of course.

1584
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,840
This water feels so nice.

1585
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,280
What are you looking at?

1586
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,960
Why are you staring at me?

1587
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,720
You're cutting things and staring at me.

1588
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,480
Don't use that either.

1589
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,640
Don't look at me with those wise eyes.

1590
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,000
Look over there.

1591
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,920
Eating vegetables—do you usually eat vegetables?

1592
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,840
As soon as you pick up a fork, someone "dies."

1593
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,080
Jun Jun, sorry.

1594
01:02:59,080 --> 01:02:59,880
Brother.

1595
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,600
You guys.

1596
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,280
Practice your lines and get ready to go.

1597
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,640
I think it's him.

1598
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,680
Brother.

1599
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
Younger brother.

1600
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,320
Do you have any last words, bro?

1601
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,240
Make it a tough one.

1602
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,360
Then it has to be the splits.

1603
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,400
Like this.

1604
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,520
You try it.

1605
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,840
Once you go down, you can't get back up.

1606
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,080
I want to know where the defense is.

1607
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,760
It's just sticking your face out to get hit.

1608
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,320
Let me tell you.

1609
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,160
When he throws it over,

1610
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,200
you can just smash it back.

1611
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:21,800
Then you toss it.

1612
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,720
Word, I won.

1613
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,760
Alright, come on, serve, bro.

1614
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,480
Wait until they get tired.

1615
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,840
It's fine, I can stand here all day.

1616
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,920
Hurry, do it (the move).

1617
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,120
Do it (the move), you do it!

1618
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,960
Of course I'm flexible.

1619
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,160
Elegant.

1620
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,120
Naiwen, come here.

1621
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:37,840
I'm here.

1622
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,480
Take this.

1623
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:39,920
Thank you.

1624
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,840
Come on, sis.

1625
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,520
Ma'am.

1626
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,400
Good afternoon.

1627
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,840
My name is Chen He.

1628
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,440
I'm glad to meet you too.

1629
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,800
No.

1630
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,000
Pause the music.

1631
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,560
I don't feel elegant at all.

1632
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,280
I think this person is a "refined scoundrel."

1633
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,840
And he calls me a "refined scoundrel."

1634
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,080
He doesn't even have the "refined" part.

1635
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:02,560
Naiwen.
