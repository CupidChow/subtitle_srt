1
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,441
So I'm here by myself.

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,341
The three of us can't be together.

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:07,691
Being together would freak out the mood.

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,291
Just wow.

5
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,866
This bag is really nice.

6
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:15,041
This bag looks amazing.

7
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:17,991
Does it look good?

8
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,091
I'm such a lemon.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,595
The ultimate lemon bought it.

10
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:24,870
Is the blue one better or...

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,670
Oh wow.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,170
Is the blue or the white one better?

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,070
What about the yellow one?

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,370
I'm the ultimate lemon.

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,670
Hello.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:38,970
Ah.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,070
Which one is good?

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:40,940
For me.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,940
This one.

20
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,540
Lemon for me, okay?

21
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,040
The best.

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,890
Best.

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,540
OK.

24
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,990
Do you have another one?

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,440
This one.

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,365
Maybe this one.

27
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:00,640
Good.

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,640
This color is better.

29
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,290
Looks classy.

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,190
I'll buy two.

31
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,765
One for my wife.

32
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:09,690
One for myself.

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,590
The ultimate lemon is here.

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,790
So pretty.

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,810
These fabric bags.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,860
These little pouches are all quite nice.

37
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,060
I'll get a tote bag.

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,960
Hey.

39
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,560
It's pretty convenient to carry like this.

40
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,860
Alright.

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,960
I'll buy it later.

42
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,335
Letting a guy shop alone...

43
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:46,210
It's honestly so awkward.

44
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,060
I have no idea what to buy.

45
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,860
Let me see if there are any little trinkets.

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,150
Let's go.

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,975
Let's get out of here.

48
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:09,200
That scared me to death.

49
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,200
Where's Xingxu?

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,500
I thought he was the hunter.

51
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,500
We're the prey.

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,300
Darn it.

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,000
What about the prey?

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,350
The prey is going after the hunter.

55
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,390
Now you can't tell who's the hunter.

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,090
I really think they're being too obvious.

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,165
First Chen He talks to him alone.

58
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:30,990
Then,

59
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,640
Sun Honglei talks to him alone.

60
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,815
If it were me,

61
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:38,240
I would've thought something was up long ago.

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,015
Go.

63
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:39,840
I'll go find him.

64
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,450
Here's how he's thinking.

65
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,700
He has Chen He,

66
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Sun Honglei,

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,950
and me, the three least suspicious people, passing it along.

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,165
I bought two super cute dolls.

69
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,140
They're for my two daughters. So adorable.

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,090
Really cute.

71
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,065
Look, isn't this one really nice?

72
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:06,090
And the texture is great.

73
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,040
It's heavy.

74
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,090
Yeah, really heavy.

75
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,140
But I have to buy two.

76
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,540
One for each of my daughters.

77
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,640
Each must have one.

78
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,365
And I also bought two more.

79
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,815
I think they're from an artist, but I'm not sure.

80
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:19,440
They're not his photography.

81
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,840
Look at this photo.

82
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,910
It's really good.

83
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,010
It's someone fishing.

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,810
With lots of cats behind.

85
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,585
There's a signature on the back.

86
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:26,360
What's this about?

87
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,560
It's from this photographer.

88
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,610
Yeah, it's the photographer's.

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,085
Yeah, look at this one, this is mine.

90
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,585
I really like this one.

91
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,910
This is from 2007.

92
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,310
Yeah, he took it in 2007.

93
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,670
There are some smaller ones too.

94
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,220
Sorry.

95
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,470
I spent quite a bit.

96
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,620
These are two little cups I bought.

97
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,770
Lemon-themed cups.

98
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,045
And a plate for fruit, perfect for summer vibes.

99
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:57,395
But these two photos,

100
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:58,270
I really like them.

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,470
This photo just feels so nice.

102
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,570
Someone's fishing in the front.

103
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,535
A bunch of cats lined up behind.

104
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,610
It's like we're doing something,

105
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,860
with others waiting for someone to take the bait.

106
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,385
It's about the fish,

107
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:11,960
and the cats.

108
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,310
One person fishing, so many cats.

109
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,210
It's really interesting, you know?

110
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,110
And also, it's kind of lonely.

111
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,260
Right?

112
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,610
But it's not lonely either.

113
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,030
You're lonely too.

114
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,605
Use the wide-angle to get the whole view.

115
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,905
Got it, taking a panorama.

116
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:33,780
Everyone's in the shot.

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,630
Everyone's in.

118
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Nineteen.

119
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,530
Eighty-seven.

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,480
Six.

121
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,350
Fifty-four.

122
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,150
Three.

123
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,225
Let me tell you.

124
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:50,475
Hide behind Liu Yuning.

125
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,700
You can't lose that way.

126
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on.

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,300
I'll do it.

128
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,650
Let me.

129
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,800
Hey, hey, hey.

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,950
Why do I feel so uncomfortable?

131
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,350
Come on.

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,750
Sixty-five.

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,050
Forty-three.

134
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Twenty-one.

135
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Zero.

136
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,625
Let's do it again.

137
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,075
One more time.

138
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:14,650
Again.

139
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,600
No more.

140
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,100
Can you get a lot of people from this angle?

141
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,050
Feels like a security camera.

142
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,600
Guys.

143
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,800
Just like surveillance.

144
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,400
This height though.

145
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,880
Come on.

146
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,955
Let's stand still.

147
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:27,330
Okay.

148
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,880
Let's try the surveillance angle.

149
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,430
Come on.

150
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,280
Surveillance scans like this.

151
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,430
That's really good.

152
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,980
Totally still.

153
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,405
Let's go.

154
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:35,730
Come on.

155
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,380
Nineteen.

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,580
Eighty-seven.

157
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,930
Six, go.

158
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,560
Five, go, go, go.

159
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,960
Four, three, go, go.

160
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,810
Two, one, go, go.

161
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,635
Nice move.

162
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:56,360
Beautiful.

163
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,710
Oh no.

164
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,460
Let's just do it.

165
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,760
Walk over here.

166
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160
Turn your head this way.

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,925
Let's do it like this.

168
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,775
This music is great.

169
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:24,975
Come on.

170
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:25,900
Wait, like this.

171
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,180
After putting it on your back, do this.

172
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,305
Ah.

173
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:42,030
This one, this one, this one—let's lift your veil.

174
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,030
I don't get it.

175
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,780
You missed out on a fortune.

176
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,880
What about up?

177
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,530
Then let's do up and down.

178
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,580
What about left?

179
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,655
Let's do this one on the left.

180
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:57,030
This one.

181
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,530
This one.

182
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,280
This one.

183
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,730
Isn't this the right side, not left?

184
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,830
This is right, on the right.

185
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,930
I thought I'd already done this one.

186
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,110
Right, left.

187
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,360
What about left?

188
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,460
Left.

189
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,210
Left is good too.

190
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,510
Up, down, left, right, right.

191
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,610
The world feels so fresh.

192
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,710
The world feels so fresh.

193
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,870
I'm losing my mind.

194
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,195
No way.

195
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:35,970
I can't win.

196
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,020
They can suspect me.

197
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,920
But I can't give them fake clues.

198
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,470
I definitely can't be the winner.

199
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,650
You have to think in reverse.

200
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,600
Normally, you'd be afraid if they got the clue.

201
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,450
Right?

202
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,800
I think I'll just give them the clue.

203
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,150
For now,

204
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,500
they trust me.

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,300
The more okay it is,

206
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,925
the less I try to compete.

207
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,650
Or do anything aggressive.

208
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,370
I'll hold back my actions for now.

209
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,820
Stay steady no matter what happens.

210
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,120
Right?

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,145
Well,

212
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,287
He Ge said it himself.

213
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,620
He wrote down ten families.

214
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,795
Everyone wants to write more.

215
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:22,820
So everyone gets more funding.

216
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,420
That's normal.

217
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,770
So I think it's basically around 80.

218
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,960
With help from Honglei Ge and He Ge,

219
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,210
I feel like I can definitely win.

220
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,260
So what should I do?

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,660
He's basically me.

222
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,435
The question is so weird, making someone touch the same muscle three times.

223
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:37,910
Right?

224
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,560
That's so creepy.

225
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
It's really hard.

226
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,110
How did everyone end up together?

227
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,435
Yeah.

228
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,210
Let them go first.

229
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,660
I still need to hide myself.

230
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,695
Honglei Ge helped me because of He Ge.

231
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,420
He Ge was the first one I passed it to.

232
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,683
I forced you, you were forced by me.

233
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,420
I lost because I was forced.

234
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,445
Alright then.

235
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,570
Now you feel at ease.

236
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,470
How can there be a man who's 1.79 meters tall?

237
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,125
Why does everyone usually say they're 1.8 meters?

238
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,700
If a guy is 1.79 meters,

239
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,850
he'll definitely say he's 1.8.

240
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,200
Exactly.

241
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,550
Who would ever say

242
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,250
they're 1.79 meters?

243
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,050
Alright.

244
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,175
The world's first 1.79-meter man has appeared.

245
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,750
You should be more precise.

246
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,300
Is your 1.79 meters with or without shoes?

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,750
With or without shoes?

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,700
What do you mean?

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,610
Soles and hair.

250
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,510
Actual height.

251
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,235
I'm talking about actual height.

252
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:30,860
Actual height.

253
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,060
Actual height is 1.79 meters.

254
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,785
Bare height, bare height.

255
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:36,860
With shoes, it's over 1.8 meters.

256
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,410
OK.

257
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,210
I'm 1.79.

258
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:38,810
Hey.

259
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,560
The second one showed up.

260
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,685
Take off your shoes.

261
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,010
Take everything off, no extras.

262
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,810
Advisor.

263
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,780
Take out the insoles from your socks too.

264
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,330
What about you?

265
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,930
I'm 90 Ge.

266
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,280
How can you even ask that?

267
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,130
Didn't you notice when you pointed at him, how tall are you?

268
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,390
No, I didn't just now.

269
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,465
I don't think I did just now.

270
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:05,915
I should've asked like this.

271
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,465
Like this.

272
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:07,790
Me.

273
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,440
So, Xingxu, you're 185 or 185.5, what about you?

274
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,290
We're using the info we found on Tencent Yuanbao.

275
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,010
180.

276
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,385
Do I really have to say it?

277
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,160
Turns out, there's no man who's 1.79 meters.

278
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,285
Just write down the amount.

279
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,760
It doesn't matter to us.

280
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,310
We don't need to care.

281
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,110
Because our goal is to let

282
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,990
him win this round successfully.

283
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,690
So,

284
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,690
if he comes to ask me later,

285
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,040
I will

286
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,740
be super nice so he thinks I'm a good sister

287
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,190
and tell him everything.

288
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,890
But actually, I'm not that nice.

289
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,340
Let's enjoy shopping.

290
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,550
I'm afraid if I talk,

291
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,425
it might suddenly show up.

292
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:08,000
And then I'll get really scared.

293
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,300
This one is pretty cute.

294
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
This TV is so colorful.

295
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,750
Take a look, take a look.

296
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,400
This really has that

297
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,950
local vibe.

298
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,050
I want to take a look.

299
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Is this a ring or...

300
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,070
There are too many.

301
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,720
I can't decide.

302
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,020
Maybe I just won't pick any.
