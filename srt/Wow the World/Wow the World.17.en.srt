1
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,640
This is number two

2
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,890
This is number two, the tiger in the turn

3
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,440
Your arms, number one

4
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,340
One and two

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,740
This is important because this is a punch

6
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:56,820
Show me

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,570
I think it's useful

8
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,970
You can see

9
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,540
Is it the one being hit?

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,040
Oh

11
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,840
Come on

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,410
Two

13
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,610
Three

14
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,960
Another one

15
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,610
One

16
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,110
Two

17
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,410
Three hundred forty-four

18
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,615
The shape of the thing

19
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,240
Thank you

20
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
Number one

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,440
Okay

22
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,940
Like this

23
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,610
One

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,260
One

25
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,710
Two

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,010
Three hundred forty-four

27
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,360
Oh

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,260
Looking at your phone, right?

29
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:37,710
Yeah

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,210
I don't dare

31
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,960
Getting a bit timid, huh

32
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,760
Still don't dare to make a move.

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,935
I'll challenge this killer.

34
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:50,485
A bit cowardly.

35
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:51,660
You two are a bit cowardly.

36
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,510
Come on.

37
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's each say something.

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,110
The killer is too cowardly.

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,710
So cowardly.

40
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,360
Why so cowardly?

41
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,810
The killer is too cowardly.

42
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,360
And it's double cowardly.

43
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,160
Yuning.

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,660
Let it go.

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,885
You covered Naiwen.

46
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,235
You can't do this, there's something wrong with the younger brother.

47
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:06,760
Doing it like this...

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
There's something off about the younger brother's look.

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,110
I also think there's something wrong with the younger brother.

50
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,710
The younger brother's look just now seemed like he didn't understand.

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,360
Dou.

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,870
You're full, huh?

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,845
Goodness.

54
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:16,420
Very good.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,670
Very good.

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,295
Very good.

57
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,670
And even a "beautiful" one.

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,320
So beautiful.

59
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,345
What's wrong with being pretty?

60
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:25,770
Wait a moment.

61
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,870
You're about to win.

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,670
Let's speak up.

63
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,170
Right.

64
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,820
Speak.

65
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,870
I think it's these two.

66
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,020
What do you mean by "these two"?

67
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,320
Vote those two out.

68
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,240
Then we can win.

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,190
I think it's the two brothers—what about the two brothers?

70
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,140
Sis, can you analyze it for us?

71
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,715
I think they don't know how to play.

72
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:46,465
Or maybe they're just not very good at playing.

73
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,090
Then I'll give it to you.

74
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,965
Let me repeat once more.

75
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,040
I'm an experienced killer.

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,780
Please don't insult my profession.

77
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,880
So many people were suspicious of that guy just now.

78
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,905
And you didn't listen to anyone else's statements at all.

79
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,980
You just looked around and didn't listen at all.

80
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,130
And then if he, if you...

81
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,105
Followed something...

82
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:02,930
And then he was satisfied.

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,230
Yeah.

84
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,830
He was satisfied.

85
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,705
Not much expression.

86
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:06,130
So what, I was using my ears.

87
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,980
So you should listen to others' statements.

88
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,030
You only noticed me listening to him.

89
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,280
No, I was watching you all.

90
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,057
No, you weren't.

91
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,140
You weren't watching us.

92
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,390
Then I killed him with the back of my head.

93
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,390
And I think Honglei, Honglei must be suspicious.

94
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,715
Let me talk about Honglei first.

95
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:24,115
It must be because Honglei found me out.

96
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:25,490
After I realized it was him,

97
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,815
He quickly made me shut up.

98
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:28,315
He hurried and killed me.

99
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,290
I got mistakenly killed by someone who doesn't know how to play.

100
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,590
Don't you hate him?

101
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,640
Thank you.

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,390
And it's about time, right?

103
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,115
It should be the Nai-Lei team, right?

104
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:38,590
And Honglei has been canvassing for votes the whole time.

105
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,590
He kept trying to get votes against He just now.

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,015
No, if it's Honglei,

107
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,290
You guys are really targeting our company.

108
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,140
I think it's definitely Naiwen, one hundred percent.

109
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,790
Why, why, why?

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,240
Me?

111
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,640
Actually, I think acting is a physiological reaction.

112
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,990
I was watching his pulse here just now.

113
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,490
It was beating really fast.

114
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,090
You were watching me last round.

115
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,640
No, bro.

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,190
Then your eyes kept blinking.

117
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,740
We even hugged.

118
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,315
If it's about physiological reactions,

119
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:05,940
Yours are even more obvious.

120
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,040
And you were checking the pulse.

121
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,615
That's a bit too much.

122
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:09,540
It's definitely one of those two.

123
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,865
Right?

124
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,440
I think I'm showing it on my face.

125
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,890
I'm already full, and you actually have a lot too.

126
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,470
You kind of deserve to get it once.

127
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,345
No, even my dog is already full.

128
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:23,045
You're still stepping on me, so it's you.

129
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:26,170
Jun'er, Yuwan, and Honglei.

130
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,120
Yuwan and Honglei.

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,445
The two of us were put in a group.

132
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,495
That's so unlucky.

133
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,970
Our little brother was taken out by Honglei.

134
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,720
I said it.

135
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,720
The little brother is Honglei.

136
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,370
Do you want me to analyze it again?

137
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
Yuwen and Honglei are good.

139
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,820
It's settled then.

140
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,720
It was just a moment ago.

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I immediately went to Jingjie.

142
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Our hug was for nothing.

143
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,470
Yeah, last round's hug was for nothing.

144
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,445
No more hugging.

145
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:47,870
Let's...

146
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,270
Killer, please stand up.

147
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,410
You scared me to death.

148
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,340
Who wouldn't eat that cake?

149
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,765
Fruit is fine.

150
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:13,865
Bro, give me a peach.

151
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:14,540
It's too big.

152
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,035
Go ahead and eat.

153
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,110
Just don't eat dinner then.

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Can we even play like this?

155
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,580
Is this how the game is played?

156
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,980
Bro.

157
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,530
Come on.

158
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,630
But I can't hold you, is that okay?

159
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,180
Why can't you hold on?

160
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,310
It's you.

161
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,810
Of course I'll pick him, let's do this seriously.

162
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,360
How do you get an advantage in this?

163
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,160
You're tall.

164
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
He can't hit you then.

165
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,760
Really.

166
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,060
Mine.

167
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,010
Who's next?

168
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,785
Come on.

169
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:46,310
I'll go first.

170
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,060
Oh no.

171
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,010
You're taller than me.

172
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,060
Stop hitting.

173
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,160
I really can't hold this.

174
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,160
Sorry about that.

175
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,020
Change for me.

176
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,470
Turn into a watermelon.

177
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,820
That hurts.

178
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,020
Big Brother

179
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,830
Sorry, Big Brother.

180
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,855
No need to apologize.

181
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,080
Can I avoid offending Big Brother?

182
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,580
Jun Jun

183
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,055
Let's discuss this, just the two of us.

184
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:31,955
If you lose this round,

185
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,930
If you lose, can I call you Big Brother?

186
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,630
No.

187
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,580
I don't have good sportsmanship.

188
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,530
Bro

189
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,205
I'll make you lose badly.

190
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:39,580
Baby

191
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,730
Little Brother

192
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,205
Goodbye

193
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:44,030
I'm leaving first.

194
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,180
Come on.

195
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,330
So fast?

196
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,455
How about all five of us go together?

197
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,005
Let's do it this way.

198
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,680
Why don't we hold hands?

199
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,530
I'll stay farther away from Jun Jun.

200
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,330
I won't hold his hand.

201
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,040
I won't team up with him.

202
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,165
We can form an alliance first.

203
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:10,615
I think no one can beat Honglei.

204
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,090
Wait a second.

205
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,115
Wait a second.

206
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:12,590
Wait a second.

207
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,290
I think we should come up with a strategy.

208
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,815
Let's take out the strongest brother first.

209
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,640
I feel like I'm back ten years ago.

210
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,190
Then let's just fight however we want.
