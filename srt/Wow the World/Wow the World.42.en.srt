1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:03,915
Hey

2
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:04,440
Wait a second

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,815
Make these two smaller

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:08,415
Pause, these two are special

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:09,940
These two are acting in a romantic drama now

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,990
Who acts like this in a romantic drama?

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,590
These two are performing together

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,265
Both of them are sneaky

9
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,290
They're both acting sneaky

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,815
These two are like Bonnie and Clyde

11
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,665
This pair is really giving off thief vibes

12
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:21,965
Hey

13
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:22,640
Points should be deducted

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,240
You're saying one thing and meaning another

15
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,040
How does this relate to my half a heart?

16
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,450
A big heart

17
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,700
And it's red

18
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,000
Then I'm playing half a broken heart

19
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,450
Heartbroken

20
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,450
Meeting you makes me sad

21
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,125
Come on

22
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,950
Who do you think should lose points this round?

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,400
I think it should be Honglei

24
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,800
Maybe both of them together?

25
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,100
You're still laughing

26
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,850
And you too

27
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,000
Why not?

28
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,650
Like this

29
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,850
Like this, like this

30
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,475
We'll go together

31
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,450
Later we'll look for the camera for a sneak peek

32
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,600
You do this

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,050
Can I do this instead?

34
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,375
Let's play like this

35
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,500
You won't lose points either

36
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,300
Alright

37
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,050
Alright

38
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,350
I'll just pull you along

39
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,375
Yeah

40
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,150
I'll just pull you along

41
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,100
Three, two, one

42
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,075
You just do this

43
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,200
Is it okay if I do this?

44
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,840
Is that okay?

45
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,065
Really

46
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:11,890
Wait a moment

47
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,740
You were happy giving ideas just now

48
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,065
Yeah

49
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:15,790
That's it

50
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,265
I said the fans will be outside taking pictures later

51
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:19,128
I'll say three, two, one

52
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:20,190
Bro, get ready for three, two, one

53
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,565
I'll do this

54
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:21,165
The fans are here

55
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:21,690
You can't do that

56
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
You have to do it like this

57
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,940
You have to do it this way

58
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,140
I'll be right next to you

59
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,340
I'll play like this

60
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,090
So those two won't lose points either

61
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
If you play like this

62
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,095
You have to do it for me later too

63
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:33,545
Okay

64
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:33,970
Okay

65
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,870
You guys join in

66
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,895
If we're playing like this

67
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,170
Let's not deduct any points

68
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,870
You can't do it

69
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,695
Let's do it together, the three of us

70
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:40,970
What are we doing later?

71
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,195
I'm not on your team

72
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:42,645
You're included

73
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:43,820
You've already lost a round

74
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,195
Come on, come on

75
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:44,720
Give it a try

76
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,770
Join us

77
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,270
Come join us, Xuxu

78
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,045
Hey

79
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:48,920
So cool

80
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,010
Really good.

81
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,285
I think he belongs on our team.

82
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,485
Quick, find their weak spots.

83
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,010
There are still four more people later.

84
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,910
Four more people left.

85
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,060
Yeah.

86
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,760
Four more people.

87
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,635
Come on, hurry up!

88
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:04,410
Who didn't deduct?

89
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,135
That's too much.

90
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,410
We have to drag him in.

91
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,335
We have to get He Ge involved.

92
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:09,760
This round.

93
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,650
Can't let him pass.

94
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,150
If we show off, let's do it together.

95
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,150
I think this round, let's follow He He and do whatever he does.

96
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,750
He Ge.

97
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
He Ge has to do it.

98
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,575
He Ge.

99
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:20,425
I haven't finished.

100
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:21,050
You can't take it yet.

101
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh no.

102
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,900
Want him to go out.

103
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,325
We two always have the lowest scores.

104
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,100
No need to think about it.

105
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,700
Don't worry about it.

106
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,325
Don't want him.

107
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,750
A lot of them have one point, it doesn't matter.

108
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,345
Yeah.

109
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:31,370
So we have to pull his score to our side.

110
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,220
Otherwise, he'll be first.

111
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,170
If he's first, so be it. Let's go.

112
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,470
Join us.

113
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,620
You four have minus one point.

114
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,545
I have more negative points.

115
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:38,320
I've figured it out too.

116
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,770
Jun Jun is right.

117
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,070
Bro.

118
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,695
Get more people to go out together.

119
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:45,270
And there's also the luck factor.

120
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,870
Yeah.

121
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,370
Everyone's making moves now, right?

122
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,240
Come on.

123
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,990
Let's try one.

124
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,315
This is a wine glass.

125
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,015
Yeah, bro.

126
00:02:58,015 --> 00:02:59,340
You can use it as a wine glass.

127
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,165
This one.

128
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,965
All of these can be used for drinking water.

129
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:05,790
They can also be used as wine glasses.

130
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,190
Pretty cute.

131
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,550
China.

132
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:21,700
Yeah, we're really enjoying Sicily. We love it here.

133
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,650
Yeah, thank you.

134
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,000
No, no, it's mine.

135
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,880
It's my second time.

136
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,780
I know, it's just a bit hard to see.

137
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,780
It's...

139
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,630
The name is "Drama on Dramas".

140
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,870
I'll show you.

141
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,270
It's called "Wall the World Wall" here.

142
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,770
But in Chinese text.

143
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,670
Chinese platform for translation.

144
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,320
Also in...

145
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,170
I don't know.

146
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,670
English.

147
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,660
I don't know if they have it outside.

148
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,460
It's new.

149
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,510
Maybe.

150
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,860
We're in Italy, in Sicily. We're leaving Sicily tomorrow.

151
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Take off your sunglasses and show your face in the city.

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Okay.

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,750
Wait a moment.

154
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,100
Gong Jun.

155
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,800
Gong Jun.

156
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,940
Gong Jun.

157
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,390
Jun.

158
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,140
Wang Wen.

159
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,090
Gong Jun.

160
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,090
Gong Jun.

161
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,690
Wang Yuwen.

162
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,360
Thanks for joining in.

163
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,610
Hey.

164
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,460
What are you doing?

165
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,460
I bought fruit for you.

166
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,960
You should remember.

167
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,910
Hey.

168
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,660
He was at that shop today.

169
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,340
She likes this cup.

170
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,640
No crying.

171
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,490
It's just the first one.

172
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,990
Isn't this what you like?

173
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,240
So annoying.

174
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,090
It's for you.

175
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,390
You said you bought it yourself.

176
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,765
Alright.

177
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:56,190
Okay.

178
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,465
As long as you like it.

179
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,740
Take it back and next time we're in Hengdian,

180
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,690
with the film crew,

181
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,990
let's use this cup to drink, okay?

182
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,715
Jun Jun saw a little blue cup back then.

183
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:08,140
You said,

184
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,375
it looked pretty nice.

185
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,800
But it wasn't very convenient to carry.

186
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,500
Oh no.

187
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,000
So annoying.

188
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,100
And then there was this little plate.

189
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,250
You said it looked nice.

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,250
Then we said,

191
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,450
Which one of us,

192
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,600
should I go with, in turns?

193
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
The two of us sneaked back.

194
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah.

195
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,790
This little plate representing love and the cup both look nice.

196
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,690
You said it looked great, right?

197
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,790
What are you doing?

198
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,140
What kind of show is this?

199
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,290
Are you trying to break me down?

200
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,540
I'm not here for this.

201
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,995
So annoying.

202
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,220
You even gave me this paper.

203
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,845
And put this on the bag.

204
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,145
This is your English name.

205
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,470
And all our surnames.

206
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,670
Oh my god.

207
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,095
Don't make me cry.

208
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:07,870
I'm so annoyed.

209
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:12,995
Jun Ge.

210
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:13,470
Here's the thing.

211
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:13,770
I...

212
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,070
I...

213
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,770
I don't know.

214
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,120
I never thought I'd meet

215
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,270
someone I could get along with so well.

216
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,220
I hope you won't forget us.

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,660
Don't forget.

218
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,410
All of us.

219
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,260
Thank you.

220
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,910
What are you doing?

221
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,610
I messaged him this morning.

222
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,360
I said, Gong Jun,

223
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,660
you're a very, very kind

224
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,580
and

225
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,780
pure person.

226
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,680
I hope you always stay kind and pure.

227
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,130
It's truly precious.

228
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,830
Besides sharks,

229
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,730
sometimes we can switch to other fish.

230
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,830
Hope this is the second song.

231
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,630
Kiss the Sardine.

232
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,530
Alright.

233
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Then give it a kiss.

234
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,480
Kiss it.

235
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,820
Isn't there supposed to be a game in this segment?

236
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,170
How did this segment turn out like this?

237
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,970
What are we doing?

238
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:23,970
Jun Jun.

239
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,770
What about me?

240
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,570
I just wanted to find something you'd remember.

241
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,195
Wait a second.

242
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:29,470
Bro.

243
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,060
When I got in the car at the end,

244
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,685
I even asked you,

245
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,810
What was that bag you were carrying for?

246
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,910
He tricked me.

247
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,410
I asked, "Where did you go?"

248
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,260
Then I said,

249
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,485
Bro.

250
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,010
What did you buy there?

251
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,060
He just opened it a little for me.

252
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,910
It was wrapped, so I had no idea what it was.

253
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,710
Okay.

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,650
Hey.

255
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,875
Why do you have to do this?

256
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,200
When did you guys plan this?

257
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,950
Give me my stuff.

258
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
You're my brother.

259
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,150
How could I not buy it?

260
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,350
That's right, that's right.

261
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,750
Not only did I buy it,

262
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,700
I had to get you the most expensive one.

263
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,950
Because you deserve it.

264
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,850
Big bro.

265
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,490
It was also yesterday.

266
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,815
Me, you, and Naiwen bro,

267
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:12,390
were discussing the case there.

268
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,390
We passed by a shop.

269
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
You told me this thing was great.

270
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,765
You said it was really nice.

271
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:19,815
I was even teasing you.

272
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,965
I said, "Why would anyone put this junk at home?"

273
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:22,565
You said, "No way."

274
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,640
It looks great at home.

275
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,690
I remembered.

276
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,165
So you didn't buy it.

277
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,290
But I bought it for you, for sure.

278
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,440
I'll display all today's gifts nicely at home.

279
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,540
Yesterday, I just passed by casually.

280
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,865
I mentioned that decoration, and Liu Yuning was still asking me about it.

281
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:37,990
I didn't know he'd remember.

282
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,290
Of course I had to remember.

283
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:40,790
Alright.

284
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,040
What am I doing, let's have a hug.

285
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,690
Hug's over.

286
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,590
What's this?

287
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,390
Hope you stay happy.
