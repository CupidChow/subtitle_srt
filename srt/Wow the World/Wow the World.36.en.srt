1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,100
Handle it.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,625
Get a grip.

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:05,288
Don't touch me.

4
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:06,250
Don't touch me.

5
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,300
This mentor.

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,850
Show some respect, okay?

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,700
What do you mean?

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,200
I want you.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,750
It's you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,350
Is this a test too?

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,300
Teacher.

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,350
Let me sweep the floor.

13
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,650
I'm really nervous right now.

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,685
Let's have the two most nervous producers.

15
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:27,260
Hello.

16
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,510
I'm Salad Salad King Love You from Wuhan, Hubei.

17
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,010
Yuwen.

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,260
Expressionless.

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,060
Can you briefly talk about yourself?

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,185
You spoke from the heart.

21
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:42,860
Actually, I...

22
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,940
I really love dancing and performing.

23
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,840
But I've always been told I sing off-key.

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,040
They say I'm uncoordinated.

25
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,040
Who are you picking?

26
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,315
Let's put it on hold for now.

27
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:53,715
On hold.

28
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:54,440
I'll wait for now.

29
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,428
Why are you openly picking me?

30
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:57,465
Are you the mentor?

31
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:58,340
Who picked you?

32
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,990
Were all your words just targeting me, like I'm asking for trouble?

33
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,570
Getting mad at the mentor is just getting mad at the mentor.

34
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,020
I think...

35
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,970
I think we should put it on hold.

36
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,445
On hold.

37
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:07,895
Mr. Gong.

38
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:08,620
I'm your fan.

39
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,145
Join me.

40
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:12,870
If you pick me, it's just to tease you.

41
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,670
Actually, I like this too.

42
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,570
Why didn't I choose just now?

43
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,480
You.

44
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,830
He winked at me.

45
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,480
He's distracting me.

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,430
Wait, wait, my clothes!

47
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,700
It's fine.

48
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,400
Oh no.

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,850
You've got a slim waist for a tool belt.

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,150
Dance, get moving.

51
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,450
Can the two guys do a solo?

52
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,750
No problem.

53
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,200
We can both do a solo anyway.

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,650
No need to wait.

55
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,460
We can both solo.

56
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,685
No need, aren't we both soloing?

57
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:06,560
Come on.

58
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,660
You two switch hands, it's fine.

59
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,410
That's enough.

60
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,160
Let it go.

61
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,210
Jun Jun, do a solo.

62
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,060
Anyone else?

63
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,310
This is the last request.

64
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,160
Music, start.

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,720
Switch, switch.

66
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,670
You missed your chance.

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,420
No chance to switch hands now.

68
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,620
That's enough.

69
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,220
I can guess it now.

70
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,970
I've already guessed it.

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Here.

72
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,300
Still not working.

73
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,450
Originals aren't allowed?

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
What are you saying?

75
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm confused.

76
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,550
Only good music makes things clear to me.

77
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,050
Words always lose their effect.

78
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,600
Only rhythm lets us celebrate together.

79
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
He doesn't have bel canto.

80
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,060
Come on.

81
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,910
Do bel canto again.

82
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,285
Come on.

83
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,760
Three, two, one.

84
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,460
What are you saying?

85
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,660
I'm confused.

86
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,510
Only good music makes things clear to me.

87
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,710
Suddenly,

88
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,310
The sky turned dark.

89
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,390
Suddenly, I have nothing.

90
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,728
I thought of you.

91
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,890
Then I thought of myself.

92
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:46,040
Why does my happiness sound so sweet when I'm sad and vulnerable?

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,080
Spring goes, spring returns.

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Flowers wilt, but they'll bloom again.

95
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,780
As long as you're willing.

96
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,030
As long as you're willing.

97
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,030
Let dreams sail to your heart.

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,090
Oh

99
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,365
I'm listening

100
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:17,540
I hear the wind coming from the subway and the crowds

101
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,740
What am I clapping for

102
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,690
I'm standing in line

103
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,740
Holding a ticket for love

104
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,640
Okay

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,990
Is this bel canto?

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,390
Number ticket

107
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,290
I leave at this point

108
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,165
Loneliness at night easily gets to people

109
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,590
You're like a music library too

110
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,265
I realized something hit me

111
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:44,890
I know, everything gets thrown

112
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,390
Friends walk together for a lifetime

113
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,670
Those days

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,120
Alright

115
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,920
One sentence

116
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,820
A lifetime

117
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,620
A lifelong love

118
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,570
A glass of wine

119
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,970
I ask why

120
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,870
That girl texted me

121
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,780
But why don't you explain

122
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,130
Lowering your head in silence

123
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,230
Should I believe you really love me

124
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,880
Unwilling to be perfunctory

125
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:28,130
I still understand you don't want to fix anything

126
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,370
Curly eyelashes

127
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,720
Blinking eyes

128
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,070
Words on the tip of my tongue

129
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,520
How did they change

130
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,270
Your smile is like a crescent moon

131
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,320
The atmosphere is so romantic

132
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,120
I need you with me in the spring breeze

133
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,370
Why

134
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,410
Blowing past someone who falls in love at first sight

135
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,610
If we pass this

136
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,585
That's a bit too easy

137
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,035
Let's leave it at that

138
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:02,510
Let's leave it at that

139
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,260
Be a little sensible

140
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,110
I've already mastered it

141
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,480
Definitely will

142
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,830
Tasty

143
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,630
This is delicious

144
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,890
Super delicious

145
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,940
Please help me express this

146
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,290
This is the most delicious meal I've had since coming to Italy

147
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,315
Staying at your home

148
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,340
Feels like

149
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,790
Living inside a painting

150
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,610
And you look like a beauty who stepped out of a painting

151
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,160
This is one of the most popular trendy toys in China right now

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Very cute

153
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,610
Thank you for your hospitality

154
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,990
This Italian tripe

155
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,140
Do they sell it cooked?

156
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,340
We definitely can't make it this authentic

157
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,040
No cooked food?

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,340
There must be

159
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,190
There definitely is

160
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,740
Because I've had tripe sold at the market in Naples before

161
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,540
Very good

162
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,290
What does it taste like?

163
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,190
This is

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,415
This is grafted

165
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,590
It's like the child of a Hami melon and a lemon

166
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,857
I have to buy one of these

167
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:28,090
Okay

168
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,040
He

169
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,440
Ask them if they bought this

170
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,540
We haven't tried this before

171
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,840
This one looks like a snake

172
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,390
Silk

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,585
Which one

174
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:39,910
Good

175
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,310
Yes

176
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,160
This is Italian loofah

177
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,060
Italian loofah

178
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,510
OK

179
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,785
Let's buy some of that

180
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,160
Which one is better?

181
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,310
This one is fine too

182
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,310
This one is good

183
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,410
OK, sis

184
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,940
Oh no

185
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,840
This loofah is amazing

186
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,015
It's a mat

187
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,790
Should we cut it in half and put it in?

188
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,190
Hey

189
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,940
Don't think it looks bad

190
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,690
I think it still looks good

191
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,590
So, if, let's say,

192
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,260
Yuwen leaves,

193
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,510
Didi and I pretend to be a couple,

194
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
then I turn around,

195
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,760
and he slaps me.

196
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,460
You know?

197
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,685
We really got into character.

198
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh my gosh.

199
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,060
We acted it out.

200
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,035
Is that okay?

201
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:31,960
Do it like this.

202
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,260
When Yuwen comes over later,

203
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,660
after I look at him,

204
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,410
you give me a slap.

205
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,220
Bro,

206
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,220
How do I hit? Anyway, after two slaps,

207
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,670
turn my head,

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,820
That Yuwen,

209
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,945
I think after you see it,

210
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,320
then you turn your head,

211
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,195
and fall over.

212
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:54,908
It’s not me.

213
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:55,895
Didi and I,

214
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,320
we pretend to be a couple.

215
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,190
We’re acting like we’re dating.

216
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,865
Then after Yuwen passes by,

217
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:03,090
I’ll do it unconsciously.

218
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,990
Then she turns and leaves.

219
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,140
How about this?

220
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,915
You do it like this.

221
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,990
The three of you are playing Fight the Landlord.

222
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,215
Hey.

223
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,040
You two do this.

224
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,790
You two,

225
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,915
there’s someone watching the chess game next to you.

226
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:19,065
You two are playing Chinese chess.

227
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:19,440
Check.

228
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,740
Checkmate.

229
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,115
Right.

230
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,415
Then you realize the guy isn’t doing his job.

231
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:25,540
And he abandons his girlfriend.

232
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,890
Should we beat him up?

233
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,090
They always think it’s me.

234
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,415
But it’s hard for me.

235
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,640
Because I was the first to come out.

236
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,990
Why did I say those things?

237
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,040
Because I thought if I said I was a good guy right away, it wouldn’t be fun.

238
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,965
I just wanted to play around.

239
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,990
But I didn’t expect it would cause a misunderstanding.

240
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,890
But Yuninge believes I’m a good guy.

241
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,405
Do you suspect anyone?

242
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,680
I think maybe Xuxin Xuge or Naiwen Ge.

243
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,105
Because I know I’m good here.

244
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,855
If those three are also good,

245
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:10,980
then it’s obvious in the second round,

246
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,230
it’s Naiwen Ge and

247
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,030
Xin Xu Ge.

248
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,480
But He Ge is really out of it.

249
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,130
He really looks like an undercover.

250
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,680
I think

251
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,095
No,

252
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,970
oh no, he looks like an opposer.

253
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,620
Really, really, really looks like it.

254
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,070
I’ll go find them.

255
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,020
Ah.

256
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,095
Anyway, I’m definitely easy to recognize.

257
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:36,820
Honestly, I still kind of want to be that... what’s it called...
