1
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
Everyone needs to complete three rounds of tasks

2
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,000
and have Xingxu perform the designated actions

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,800
to pass good luck on to you.

4
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,400
At least four people must receive it from him.

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,320
But we can't let him know

6
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,960
that we know he's the "Chili Spirit."

7
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,800
If it doesn't work, we can just sacrifice ourselves.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
What we just saw was

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,320
this spot

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,000
this spot

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,960
has absolutely no body fat.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,440
Do it like this.

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Hold your fingers like this.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,200
Trust me.

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,360
I've never seen muscles like this before.

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,080
What are you doing?

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,320
Wait a second.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,440
Come on.

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,160
What is this?

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,960
Final round

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,520
He just needs to find one more person.

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,600
One more from among us.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,040
Xiao Xu seems especially shy and reserved.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,320
I feel like he's too embarrassed to bring it up.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Based on your

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,520
understanding of Xingxu,

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
is he nervous?

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
He's already falling apart.

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,720
Isn't that nervous?

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,080
I just saw him, he's already falling apart.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,840
Isn't that nervous?

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,040
But I think he's enjoying it.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,960
He thinks it's nice to have someone include him.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
He's really happy.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,520
What should I do, brother?

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,920
Brother locked me in.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,199
What should I do?

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,000
Acted cute.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,199
What should I do?

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
So annoying, brother locked me in.

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,240
But it's really cute.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,200
At that moment, I was

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,960
At that moment, I was

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
Just right.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,720
Chen Xingxu's group has three people in their car.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,840
I really did feel Xingxu's figure.

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,520
It's so delicate.

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
It's so slender.

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,120
I touched him.

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
He's full and springy.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,320
To be honest,

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,840
because

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,120
since you just arrived and have jet lag and all,

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,240
I really didn't think of you.

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,200
No,

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
I truly didn't know.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,120
I really drew the "lemon essence."

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
You drew it.

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,080
No,

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,560
It wasn't assigned to me.

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,000
I really did.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
You drew it yourself.

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,840
You personally drew the "chili essence."

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
This is what they call the variety show god.

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
showing favor.

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
I said, are you guys messing with me?

67
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,040
Then when I took those out, they were all blanks.

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,600
I said,

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,560
that's it.

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
That was a good game.

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
No, I couldn't help it.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
We have to—

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
You're so sly and cunning.

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,320
If I draw the undercover role next time,

75
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
I'll be the undercover.

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,200
Like this.

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,640
Actually, now you know who to suspect.

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
That's more normal.

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,560
Is that normal?

80
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,320
Yuning.

81
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,840
You guys can target me.

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Yes.

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
I really seem like the bad guy.

84
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,880
Don't just accuse one person.

85
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
The four of us are all suspicious of each other.

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,840
Let's all target each other a bit.

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
Yes, okay.

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,520
Is it really that pretty?

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
So beautiful.

90
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Let's take a selfie together.

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,800
Okay.

92
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,800
Alright.

93
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,640
So beautiful.

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Let's take a selfie.

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,120
Three, two, one.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
Nice.

97
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
Perfect.

98
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,920
How is it, Xu?

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,320
You’ve been running around with us all day since you arrived.

100
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,440
You’re sweating all over.

101
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,079
Are you tired?

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,160
Can you still keep up physically?

103
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,360
I always carry my energy booster with me.

104
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,320
Mizone.

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,160
You should have a bottle too.

106
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
Take a sip when you’re tired.

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,920
It’s refreshing and quenches your thirst.

108
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,840
You’ll feel recharged right away.

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Here.

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
Get your energy back.

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,720
Get your energy back.

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,960
It really is different.

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,480
Let me tell you,

114
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,520
after drinking Mizone,

115
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,720
I can even guess who the undercover is now.

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,440
I’ve figured it out.

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
I’m super sharp now too.

118
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,160
Let’s go.

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,600
Let’s go.

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,200
They look so relaxed.

121
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,880
Hello.

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
What did you buy?

123
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,800
I bought two really cute dolls.

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
For my two daughters.

125
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
So cute.

126
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,920
Really cute.

127
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
This is really cute.

128
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
So cute.

129
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
This one is really cute.

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
It really is. Hold it for a second.

131
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
You'll see.

132
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,520
The texture is really nice.

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,920
This doll.

134
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Thank you, Hehe.

135
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,720
I think this is real.

136
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,120
Taking this back is so meaningful.

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,360
The kids will be so happy.

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Kids will definitely love it.

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,000
Also,

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,160
I bought two of these photography prints.

141
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,520
Let me see.

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,240
This is very memorable.

143
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,720
Yeah.

144
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
This photo is especially nice.

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
Someone is fishing in the front.

146
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,400
There are lots of cats lined up behind.

147
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,600
It feels lonely.

148
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,920
Right?

149
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,160
But he's not really alone.

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
You're lonely.

151
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
I think coming to this place called "Lajiao Jing"

152
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,600
I have to buy a chili pepper.

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,560
This chili pepper has "Good Luck" written on it.

154
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
It means "very spicy." So spicy.

155
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,480
So spicy.

156
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
It's really spicy.

157
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
You understand English.

158
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,160
So spicy.

159
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Honglei gave me a bag.

160
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
This bag right here.

161
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Because I think

162
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,920
when I saw him buy this bag,

163
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
it looked really nice.

164
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,480
Then the two of us

165
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,200
also have a very meaningful

166
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,000
mug.

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
A partner set.

168
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,880
We even bought matching couple mugs.

169
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
Because we both love coffee.

170
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,960
Yeah.

171
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
So we bought ones with the same pattern.

172
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
But the brushwork is different.

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
I also want to buy that mug.

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,040
So whenever I pick it up, I think of

175
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
the Earth group,

176
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,240
think of Xingxu,

177
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,120
and think of Naiwen, whom I don't want to see.

178
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,640
I bought it myself.

179
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,800
I have a bunch of these.

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
Little keychains.

181
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
This one is Junjun's.

182
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,440
Yeah, she gave it to us too.

183
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
This one is my Lemon's.

184
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,080
And I'll give this one to "Spicy Pepper" later.

185
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,800
Let's show off the four of us.

186
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,840
The straw bags we bought.

187
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,640
Straw bags.

188
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,160
Four straw bags.

189
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Let's do a little runway show for them, come on.

190
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,120
Walk a bit, do a turn.

191
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
These models here.

192
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,320
Their looks are great.

193
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
Ready.

194
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,880
Okay, sure.

195
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
Alright, thank you.

196
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,720
This is your only trophy.

197
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,640
What did you buy at first?

198
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,600
I gave it to him.

199
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
This one.

200
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
Very kind.

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,680
He, you’re always relying on everyone.

202
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
We’re all brothers.

203
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,800
When you’re out, you rely on friends, right?

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,400
He.

205
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,880
Wherever you go, you ask if you can buy something for your brother.

206
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
Can you spend some money on me?

207
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,360
I don’t have any money.

208
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,320
I really don’t have money.

209
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Brother should spend money on us.

210
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,880
Sure.

211
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
I’ll buy it for you outside the show.

212
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,280
Alright, that works.

213
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,800
And also that one.

214
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,680
The one we saw at Naiwen’s sock washing place.

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
This really nice-looking soap.

216
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,680
Yeah.

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you giving it to me?

218
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,280
No, bro.

219
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,400
Of course not.

220
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,080
Then why did you mention the sock washing place?

221
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,440
What did you mean by that?

222
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
I just saw it.

223
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,800
I kept looking for that nice-looking thing.

224
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,280
Who’s washing socks now?

225
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,240
It’s still you, sorry.

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
It’s still me.

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,720
That was an unnecessary question.

228
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,000
What’s up, Naiwen?

229
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
I bought one.

230
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,640
What is it?

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
A spinning top.

232
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Wine cork

233
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Also, Naiwen just wouldn't spend a single cent no matter what.

234
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
I really saved a lot.

235
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,480
Then I bought this.

236
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,280
It's also a straw bag.

237
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,080
Bought a bag.

238
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,240
And this straw hat.

239
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,200
Straw bag and straw hat.

240
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
The "straw bag" wears a straw hat.

241
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,840
Okay.

242
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Didn't spend much else.

243
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,880
Just treated them to that.

244
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Those fries.

245
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,360
Chicken nuggets.

246
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,800
Hot dog.

247
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,520
Hot dog.

248
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,240
Everyone,

249
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,200
"Chili Essence" has already passed his good luck

250
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
on to someone else.

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,400
So he already knows, right?

252
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,919
Yes.

253
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,600
That means there’s more than one bad guy among us.

254
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
It's possible.

255
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Come on.

256
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,200
The clue about the real "Chili Essence".

257
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,560
Who will get it?

258
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,400
The total number of people before is

259
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,120
fifty-seven.

260
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,920
Who is it?

261
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,600
I won.

262
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Fifty.

263
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
Ning won.

264
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
If he is the "Chili Essence",

265
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
I think we've already lost.

266
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
And look, why did he

267
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
spend exactly fifty yuan so perfectly?

268
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,000
Now it's very clear.

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Everyone,

270
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
now it's very clear.

271
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,960
Naiwen, how tall are you?

272
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,920
One meter seventy-nine.

273
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,280
How can there be

274
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,640
a man who is one meter seventy-nine?

275
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,200
Really.

276
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,200
Why?

277
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
If a man is one meter seventy-nine,

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,160
he would definitely say he's one meter eighty.

279
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,520
Right.

280
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:36,920
Okay.

281
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,840
The world's first

282
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,480
one meter seventy-nine man has appeared.

283
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,440
That proves I'm telling the truth.

284
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,760
Be more precise.

285
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,600
Is your one meter seventy-nine with or without skin?

286
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
With or without skin?

287
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,760
Foot skin.

288
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,720
After removing the foot skin.

289
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,120
How thick must that foot skin be?

290
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm talking about height without shoes.

291
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,200
Okay.

292
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,880
This keyword actually

293
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
is pretty accurate.

294
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,920
This "spicy guy"

295
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,480
is over 1.80 meters tall.

296
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,280
You just happen to be exactly that height.

297
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
How tall is Honglei?

298
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,480
With shoes, 1.81 meters.

299
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm 1.79 meters.

300
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,320
Here's the second one.

301
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,880
Are you really 1.79 meters?

302
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,560
Really 1.79 meters.

303
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,200
Wait a second.

304
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,800
He's 1.79 meters.

305
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,920
You two stand up and compare your heights.

306
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,960
As long as you're taller than him.

307
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
Take off your shoes.

308
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,880
Come on.

309
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,520
Take off your shoes.

310
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,040
Come on.

311
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,840
Take out the height insoles from your socks too.

312
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,480
Stand up straight.

313
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Stand up straight.

314
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
Your legs.

315
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,520
What are you doing?

316
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,520
Straighten them.

317
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,120
Feels like airport security.

318
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
You three together, bro.

319
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
Excuse me, what's Sun Honglei's height?

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
Bro, is that how you ask?

321
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
I just looked it up.

322
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,840
Top ten most handsome tough guy actors.

323
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm on the list.

324
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
And I'm ranked fourth.

325
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,240
These three 1.79-meter-tall actors

326
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,960
are all here.

327
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
He, you're a bit taller.

328
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,400
He really is a bit taller.

329
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Not taller than Honglei.

330
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Look at the level of the chin.

331
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,360
Look at the forehead.

332
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,880
Look.

333
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
That's just his hairline, it doesn't count.

334
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,720
That thing.

335
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,880
You can't measure by the hairline.

336
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Someone definitely lied about their height.

337
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,600
Stand back to back and compare like this.

338
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
Why do I feel like He...

339
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,200
He might be a bit taller.

340
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,640
He, he's definitely over 1.8 meters.

341
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,600
No need to think, he's 1.82 meters.

342
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm his fan, I've looked him up.

343
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,640
I know his stats.

344
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,920
Then he's more than 1.79 meters.

345
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Then I think he's suspicious.

346
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
He's suspicious.

347
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,200
How tall are you?

348
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I'm 1.85 meters.

349
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
And you?

350
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
I'm 1.90 meters, bro.

351
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
How can you even ask that?

352
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
Didn't you notice when you pointed at him...

353
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,960
How tall are you?

354
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,880
I'm 1.90 meters, bro.

355
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
How tall are you?

356
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,640
No, just now I should've... no.

357
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Xingxu, how tall are you?

358
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,800
1.85 meters.

359
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,520
1.85 meters.

360
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,400
And you?

361
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm 1.90 meters, bro.

362
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
How tall is Didi?

363
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,360
Didi.

364
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,920
We checked on Tencent Yuanbao.

365
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
According to the information we found.

366
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
Naiwen's height

367
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,520
is 1.80 meters.

368
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,840
Do you really have to say it?

369
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
As expected, there are no men who are 1.79 meters tall.

370
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
No, at crucial moments

371
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm 1.79 meters.

372
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,840
Got it.

373
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,960
No need to mention Honglei.

374
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,680
He's 1.80 meters.

375
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,320
Really?

376
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,760
Yes.

377
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,960
He is 1.82 meters.

378
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,560
They're all there.

379
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,600
Really?

380
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,880
All are suspects.

381
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,440
Except me.

382
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
Who do you think?

383
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Me.

384
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
It should be Yuning.

385
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,880
What about me?

386
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
Yuning

387
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,960
It's because he's just too

388
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
amazing.

389
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,360
He performed exceptionally well today.

390
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,320
So I think his suspicion

391
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,040
is also quite high.

392
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
If he gets this,

393
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,880
I would find him especially dangerous.

394
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,000
So Yuning, you're very suspicious.

395
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
You're accusing me, aren't you?

396
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,640
Alright.

397
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,800
You're really flustered, man.

398
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
You're so flustered.

399
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Just confess already.

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Then who do you think it is?

401
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
I think it's you.

402
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
Why didn't you say someone over 1.9 meters?

403
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm just waiting to see who accuses me.

404
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,120
It's him, I'm telling you.

405
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,840
And this 1.8 meter information

406
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,000
might not even be accurate.

407
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Xingxu

408
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,840
Do you think what I said makes sense?

409
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
It actually does make sense.

410
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,120
Yeah.

411
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,840
Although I'm a bit confused right now,

412
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,560
I still think

413
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,920
he's really the only one I can choose.

414
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,200
Why?

415
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,520
Because I

416
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
have interacted with

417
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,320
Brother He

418
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
at the very beginning,

419
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,320
and I ran into Brother Naiwen.

420
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,680
I was paired with Brother Honglei.

421
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,640
No one told me I was passed on.

422
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,960
And just now there was another clue:

423
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,120
over 1.80 meters tall.

424
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,880
Then,

425
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,880
so

426
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,240
do you think the two of us are accomplices, is that what you mean?

427
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,160
He thinks the four of us have already

428
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,880
all been passed on.

429
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,840
I don't know, because I

430
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,320
I really don't know.

431
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,080
Anyway,

432
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,520
I can understand his point.

433
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,560
Because he really hasn't seen us.

434
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Yeah.

435
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
Look, you're blushing.

436
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
Even your ears are red.

437
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
"Chili powder"

438
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Right, Xingxu?

439
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,120
Yeah.

440
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,600
You...

441
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,040
It can't really be you, right?

442
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,840
Shut up.

443
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,480
I said shut up.

444
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,240
I'll explain in a minute.

445
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
You sit down first.

446
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,360
Your heart is beating really fast.

447
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,320
About to self-destruct.

448
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,120
Xingxu is laughing.

449
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,360
Laughing so hard.

450
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Liu Yuning.

451
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,600
There are two possibilities here.

452
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,800
If everyone is stepping on it,

453
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,880
if it's Yuning,

454
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,200
where did the person being passed to go?

455
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,680
Bro, it's you.

456
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,960
You're also a suspect.

457
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
When eating ice cream,

458
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,240
you two sat too close.

459
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,560
First of all, from my perspective,

460
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,640
the two ladies must be good people, right?

461
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,360
Why?

462
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,840
Because over 1.8 meters tall.

463
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,040
One, two, three, four.

464
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,200
Actually, the four of us are relatively tied together.

465
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,760
If the two of them accuse me,

466
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,840
it means I didn't pass it to her.

467
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,400
First, this is definite proof.

468
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
So the four of us must be innocent.

469
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,040
So, do you believe me?

470
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
This "chili essence" is really playing very well.

471
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Then it's him.

472
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,360
Vote for him in a bit.

473
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,880
This round.

474
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,200
Okay, whatever, fine.

475
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,160
I promise, like this.

476
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,400
Vote for Naiwen this round.

477
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
Next round, vote for me, okay?

478
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
No, that's not okay.

479
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,200
Why?

480
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,760
We just can't let you survive.

481
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,280
Vote.

482
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,600
Vote.

483
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,160
Three, two, one.

484
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Vote.

485
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,040
"Chili Extract"

486
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,440
Let's do it together

487
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
"Chili Extract"

488
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,240
Yuning's initial role is

489
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,840
a good person

490
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm really impressed

491
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm really impressed, guys

492
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm really impressed

493
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
That's kind of interesting

494
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,840
This is a bit of a brain teaser

495
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Not interesting

496
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,000
Not interesting at all

497
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,120
That's so interesting

498
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
Not interesting in the slightest

499
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,480
The pacing here

500
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,520
Kind of interesting

501
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,400
We're really bad at this.

502
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,840
How come we still can't figure it out?

503
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,120
This "chili extract" is really spicy.

504
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,360
Next, we'll do the last one for today.

505
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,760
It's a task where we can get clues.

506
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,600
It's called "Earth Super Fresh."

507
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,480
The members design four

508
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,640
each representing

509
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,680
dance moves for up, down, left, and right.

510
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,160
All members stand in a line.

511
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
One member steps forward.

512
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,440
and takes on the "Earth Super Fresh" challenge.

513
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,119
They stand in front of each member in turn and shout

514
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,119
"Earth Super Fresh!"

515
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,359
and make a different move

516
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,760
from the defending member.

517
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,319
Direction.

518
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,640
If the direction is different, the challenge is successful.

519
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,160
If you pass all seven people in one go, the task is complete.

520
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,079
The member who finishes the task fastest wins.

521
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,599
Seaweed, seaweed.

522
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,440
Right?

523
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,920
Look here, look there.

524
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
Yes.

525
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,720
Seaweed, just do the opposite anyway.

526
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,360
Let's decide on a set of moves.

527
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,840
This one needs to be...

528
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,360
What's this?

529
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,280
Head covering.

530
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,480
Red head covering.

531
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,040
This.

532
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,800
Lift up your head covering.

533
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,120
Down is this one.

534
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,040
I don't understand.

535
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,040
You missed out on a fortune.

536
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,880
This is down.

537
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,880
Right.

538
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,600
What about up?

539
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,080
Then let's do up and down.

540
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,440
Down.

541
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,480
What about left?

542
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
Left.

543
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
Right.

544
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,760
This one, I guess.

545
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Left, this one.

546
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,120
Isn't this right?

547
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,440
This is right.

548
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
I thought I even missed this one.

549
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,920
Right.

550
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,840
Right.

551
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,000
What about left?

552
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,240
Left is also this one.

553
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,040
Left, this one.

554
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,080
Right, this one.

555
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,600
Up, down, left, right.

556
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,880
You're mixing up left and right again.

557
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
Left, right.

558
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,000
This whole left-right confusion thing.

559
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,240
It's another show again.

560
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,320
What are all these things?

561
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,280
This is the Tai Chi we learned.

562
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,840
Hung Gar Kung Fu.

563
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
You even learned this?

564
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,240
Taught by an Italian.

565
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,960
Hung Gar Kung Fu taught by an Italian.

566
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,840
Are you kidding me?

567
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,640
An Italian performed a lion dance in front of us.

568
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,960

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,080
Three, two, one.

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
The Earth is super fresh.

572
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,360

Congratulations

588
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,840
One minute and six seconds

589
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,600
So fast

590
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,680
Six

591
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,520

592
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,320
Okay

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,960
Earth is super fresh

599
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,360
Earth is super fresh

600
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,600
The last one

601
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,680
No problem

602
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,200
Quick

603
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,760
The last one

604
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:43,360
Earth is super fresh

605
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,200
The rhythm is messed up, you messed it up

606
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,120
Earth is super fresh

607
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,000

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,840
This day, it's a perfect match

617
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
Earth is super fresh

618
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
Perfect match

619
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,440

Earth is super fresh

621
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,600
Earth is super fresh

622
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,040
Earth is super fresh

623
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Can't get through

624
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,560
Earth is super fresh

625
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,760
Earth is super fresh

626
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,480
Help Didi

627
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,800
I can't help her right now

628
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,640
Try again, come on

629
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:18,320
Earth is super fresh

630
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,080
Come on

631
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
Earth is super fresh

632
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,600
Earth is super fresh

633
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,720
Come on

634
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,760
Come on

635
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,320
Earth is super fresh

636
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,480
Sorry

637
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,520
Earth is super fresh

638
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,040
I'm laughing so hard my head hurts

639
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,040
Earth is super fresh

640
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,400
That scared me to death

641
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,520
Earth

642
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,120
This of mine

643
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,000
Alright, Earth is super fresh

644
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
Are you the gatekeeper?

645
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,840
You go do it with him first.

646
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,760
Yes, you go do it with him first.

647
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,880
Go do it with him first.

648
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,320
Come with me first.

649
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
I was the first, I'm pretty tired too.

650
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,160
Actually,

651
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,040
Come on.

652
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,120
Earth is super fresh.

653
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay.

654
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Earth is super fresh.

655
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,920
Earth is super fresh.

656
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,600
Earth is super fresh.

657
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,560
Earth is super fresh.

658
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,120
Earth is super fresh.

659
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,600
Four minutes and forty-nine seconds.

660
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,720
Wow.

661
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,200
Come on.

662
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,680
You start from there.

663
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,720
Why?

664
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,640
You start from there, I'm the last one.

665
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,320
I don't want to.

666
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,760
No.

667
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,560
Yes.

668
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,520
I'll listen to her.

669
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
I'll start from this side.

670
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,400
Okay.

671
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,840
This kid really holds a grudge against me.

672
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,520
Come on.

673
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,200
This feud is settled now.

674
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,560
You're done for.

675
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,360
Come, from this side.

676
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,920
Earth is super fresh.

677
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,280
Earth is super fresh.

678
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,000
Earth is super fresh.

679
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,200
It's all the same, that's amazing.

680
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,800
You don't even need me.

681
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,080
You don't even need me.

682
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,520
Come.

683
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,720
Come.

684
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,160
Come.

685
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,640
Earth is super fresh.

686
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Earth is super fresh.

687
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Earth is super fresh.

688
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
You're still too slow, you...

689
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,280
No.

690
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,680
Ning.

691
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,640
So you do it like this first.

692
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,360
Then after he does it like this,

693
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,120
You follow like this.

694
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,600
Right.

695
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Fresh.

696
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,760
Wait a second.

697
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,960
Let me do it.

698
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,200
Earth is super fresh.

699
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,800
You didn't do it.

700
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,920
What do you mean?

701
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,440
Okay.

702
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
Earth is super fresh.

703
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,240
Come on!

704
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,520
Alright, let's go.

705
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,000
Earth is super fresh.

706
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,280
Earth is super fresh.

707
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,360
Are you in or not?

708
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,160
Are you in or not?

709
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,200
You guys, stop fighting.

710
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,040
Stop fighting.

711
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,920
You guys, stop fighting.

712
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,400
Stop fighting.

713
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,920
You're having another dance battle, huh?

714
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Let's play something advanced, come on.

715
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,920
How do we play?

716
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,760
Just like this.

717
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm behind you.

718
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,400
Alright.

719
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,240
I definitely won't cheat.

720
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I'll turn my back to you too, okay?

721
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,520
Alright.

722
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,440
The two of us will turn our backs to you, come on.

723
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,600
Three, two, one.

724
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Earth is super new.

725
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,520
Earth is super fresh

726
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Okay

727
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,200
Awesome, come on

728
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,920
Passed, he passed

729
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I passed, come on

730
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,560
Bro, do you know what I'm going to play?

731
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,200
I know

732
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,880
If you know, that might not work

733
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,840
You can't know

734
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,360
I don't know, come on

735
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,600
Earth is super fresh

736
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
Wow

737
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,560
Earth

738
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,200
Wait a second

739
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Okay, I can wait

740
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,960
Make a call, call someone

741
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,800
Hello

742
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm going to play left

743
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,920
Top, bottom, or right?

744
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,960
You know now, right?

745
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,640
Someone told you the secret, didn't they?

746
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,360
Of course

747
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,880
If I lose this time

748
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
I'll jump into the sea from here

749
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Play

750
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,960
That intense?

751
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
That intense?

752
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,800
Don't forget what happened in Room 6

753
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,840
Right

754
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,600
Blood feud

755
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,040
It's become a blood feud

756
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,680
These are two big families

757
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,720
The blood feud between the Elves and Vegeta

758
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,040
Your sister is great

759
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,480
Of course

760
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
Which side are you going to play?

761
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm going to play top

762
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,640
Okay

763
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,400
Super fresh

764
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Wow

765
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,520
Not bad

766
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,640
A few minutes

767
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
Five minutes and one second

768
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,080
The first person to go over five minutes

769
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
Hello

770
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,800
Hello

771
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,880
Three, two, one

772
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,520
Earth is super fresh

773
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,120
Earth is super fresh

774
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,720
Earth is super fresh

775
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,840
Earth is super fresh

776
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,480
Earth is super fresh

777
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,240
I've already learned it.

778
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Earth is super fresh.

779
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,080
Earth is super fresh.

780
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,520
What are you doing? If you didn't do it, it doesn't count.

781
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,400
Earth is super fresh.

782
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,880
Both of us did the downward move.

783
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,520
It's this.

784
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,600
It's really like overcoming many obstacles.

785
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Getting serious.

786
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,040
Getting serious.

787
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
Earth is super fresh.

788
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:36,440
Earth is super fresh.

789
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,280
Earth.

790
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,480
Earth is super fresh.

791
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,000
Two minutes and twenty-one seconds.

792
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,080
Okay.

793
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,360
Come on.

794
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,840
Come on.

795
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,160
Earth is super fresh.

796
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,000
Earth is super fresh.

797
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,120
Earth is super fresh.

798
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,800
Defense is broken.

799
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,280
Defense is broken.

800
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,000
Earth is super fresh.

801
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,120
Earth is super fresh.

802
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,520
Wait a moment.

803
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,640
What are you doing?

804
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,040
I'm going to interrupt your spell.

805
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,840
Okay, go ahead.

806
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,160
Earth is super new.

807
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,840
Earth is super fresh.

808
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
One minute and forty-nine seconds.

809
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,200
Awesome.

810
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,080
Go for it, big sis.

811
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
Earth is super fresh

812
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,720
Okay, I'll play seriously

813
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,200
Okay

814
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,800
Okay

815
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,160
Earth is super fresh

816
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Be a bit more serious

817
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,320
I'll be even more serious

818
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,760
Earth is super fresh

819
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,880
It's really hard

820
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,080
Not necessarily, you might not be able to guess

821
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,440
Come on

822
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,760
Earth is super fresh

823
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,880
Earth is super fresh

824
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,600
What is this thing you're doing?

825
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,760
What are you making?

826
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,080
Go

827
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Earth is super fresh

828
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,520
Earth is super fresh

829
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,560
Earth is super fresh

830
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
I think I still have to go up.

831
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,360
You can't put it at the back.

832
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,960
Earth is super fresh.

833
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,920
Earth is super fresh.

834
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,960
Earth is super fresh.

835
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,840
You're really good at this.

836
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,520
How much?

837
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,040
One minute and nineteen seconds.

838
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,360
That's good.

839
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,800
That's really fast.

840
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
You're still the best.

841
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,920
Naiwen is awesome.

842
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,040
Brother, please.

843
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,800
It's my turn.

844
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,400
Please.

845
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,120
Easy.

846
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,920
Please.

847
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,800
Easy.

848
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,960
Earth is super fresh.

849
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
Earth is super fresh.

850
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,240
Earth is super fresh.

851
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,000
Earth is super fresh.

852
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,680
Earth is super fresh.

853
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,320
Earth is super fresh.

854
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,840
Earth is super new.

855
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,680
Earth is super fresh.

856
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,160
Impressive.

857
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,720
That was easy.

858
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Fifteen seconds.

859
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,560
That was easy.

860
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,400
Impressive.

861
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,360
So impressive.

862
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,920
That was amazing.

863
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,640
Come.

864
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,320
Come on, bro.

865
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,320
I think you should take care of them a bit.

866
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,560
Okay.

867
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Sure.

868
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,840
Give them some hospitality.

869
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,760
Treat them well.

870
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,560
Alright.

871
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
Earth is super fresh.

872
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,800
Earth is super fresh.

873
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,400
Master.

874
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
Master.

875
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,000
The lines are really nice.

876
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,280
Hurry up, bro.

877
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,080
It's really good.

878
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,040
Hurry up.

879
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,160
The rhythm is already broken.

880
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,680
Did you guys touch it today?

881
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,120
No.

882
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,720
No.

883
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,560
Hurry up.

884
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Haven't you felt it before?

885
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,080
Come on, hurry up.

886
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
Let me tell you, this is the master I acknowledge.

887
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,080
It's really different.

888
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
You—hurry, don't—

889
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,760
How many seconds has it been for me?

890
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,400
Hurry up.

891
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,560
Hurry up, bro.

892
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Hurry up.

893
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,360
You work out, come over here.

894
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,720
And there's one more thing.

895
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,760
No.

896
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,440
Show it.

897
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,760
No.

898
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,800
Hurry up, bro.

899
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,320
Hurry up.

900
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm only looking at this one spot.

901
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,160
Look.

902
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,760
Don't move yet.

903
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,080
Look, like this—hold it down.

904
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,240
What are you doing? What are you guys doing?

905
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,400
Hold it down.

906
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,080
Look, press here.

907
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Press this spot.

908
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
And look at this part.

909
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,000
He really practiced well.

910
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,440
Check out this edge.

911
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,120
Hurry up.

912
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,080
He really did a good job.

913
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,920
Because it sinks in.

914
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,360
It's really good, the lines are good.

915
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,000
The lines are pretty nice.

916
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,960
Bro.

917
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,480
Big bro from the family.

918
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,040
Quick.

919
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,640
The Earth is super fresh.

920
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,200
Go back.

921
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
He practiced well, right?

922
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:18,920
Not bad.

923
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,360
Pretty good.

924
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Practiced quite well.

925
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,240
Earth is super fresh

926
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,440
Earth is super fresh

927
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,240
Earth is super fresh

928
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,680
How can someone get their muscles like that

929
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,720
He Ge

930
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,320
And also, Yu Ning

931
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
There's something you don't know

932
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,640
What

933
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,920
He trained to get them like this

934
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,840
And he only has five abs

935
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,400
No, five? I don't believe it

936
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Five

937
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,040
I actually felt them today

938
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,880
Who has five? Isn't it six or eight?

939
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,280
Five, look

940
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,480
One, two, three, four

941
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,080
And he's not even flexing

942
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,640
No, I only felt four

943
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,280
Show him the fifth one

944
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,280
The fifth one

945
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Not allowed to touch

946
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,520
You can't touch the fifth one

947
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,200
We're really curious.

948
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,400
How about this? Or maybe like this?

949
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,679
With muscles like yours,

950
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,040
you must have a strong resistance to hits.

951
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,880
Let each of us punch you three times.

952
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,880
How about it?

953
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,719
We'll let you pass all of them, okay?

954
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,679
Each person gets three punches.

955
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,719
What are you doing? Where should we hit?

956
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,679
Hit the abs.

957
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,040
Hit here.

958
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,960
Feel this part, it's like a tank.

959
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,199
Come on, stand up.

960
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,440
How about each of us gives three punches?

961
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,320
Will that count as passing?

962
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,840
Because it's already been over five minutes.

963
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll go.

964
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,480
You go.

965
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,080
You better not.

966
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,960
Alright, it's done.

967
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Okay.

968
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Can you still keep going?

969
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,040
I can.

970
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,719
He can.

971
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,719
I definitely can.

972
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,480
Earth is super fresh.

973
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,960
Earth is super fresh.

974
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,159
Earth is super fresh.

975
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,840
Are you ready?

976
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
I'm talking, it's fine.

977
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,480
You...

978
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,040
I'm talking.

979
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,360
It's fine, we're normal.

980
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,159
We're normal.

981
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,960
Like this.

982
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Come on.

983
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,000
I'll turn my back to you, come on.

984
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,120
Three, two, one.

985
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,480
Earth is super fresh.

986
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Not easy.

987
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,280
Five minutes and twenty-nine seconds.

988
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,360
Congratulations to the members of the five-minute club.

989
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,520
That's awesome.

990
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
So this is how you welcome me.

991
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,600
We only have the final round of voting left.

992
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,960
Then let's go back to the guesthouse.

993
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,240
We'll do the final round of voting at the guesthouse.

994
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,080
Okay.

995
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,680
Alright.

996
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,320
Let's go.

997
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,880
Let's go.

998
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,120
Mizone, save me.

999
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,160
Naiwen.

1000
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm thirsty and tired.

1001
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,720
Then wait for me a moment.

1002
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,040
Okay.

1003
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,120
Have a Mizone.

1004
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,920
Get your energy back.

1005
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,880
As expected,

1006
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,240
the energy savior.

1007
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,200
The lime-flavored Mizone is really refreshing.

1008
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
My energy came back right away.

1009
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,200
I can keep going.

1010
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,880
Do you believe it?

1011
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,800
Can you really keep going?

1012
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,560
Full of energy.

1013
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,040
Bring it on.

1014
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,360
Let's try something even harder.

1015
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,840
Energy dropping.

1016
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,880
So thirsty and tired, I'm about to collapse.

1017
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,120
Join the "Unstoppable Energy" Mizone comeback challenge.

1018
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,840
Stay energized on your journey.

1019
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,360
Succeed and win a Mizone comeback supply pack.

1020
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,680
Haven't you had enough to drink?

1021
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,520
Have some more.

1022
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,960
Please ask Sun Honglei to give Li Naiwen

1023
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
a Pulse comeback supply pack.

1024
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,360
Stay energized with the Pulse lifesaver.

1025
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,800
Get ready to face more challenges on your journey.

1026
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,840
I'll try again.

1027
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,760
Take your time with the challenge.

1028
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
I'll go back and grab a bite first.

1029
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,960
Looks great.

1030
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,360
The sunset is so beautiful.

1031
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,920
The sunset.

1032
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,520
So beautiful.

1033
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,560
So beautiful.

1034
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,000
This light.

1035
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,560
The afterglow shines on our faces.

1036
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,240
Go over there and take some photos for me.

1037
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,560
Over here.

1038
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,680
Then I'll take some wide shots.

1039
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,320
I'll take another wide shot.

1040
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,120
I don't want wide shots.

1041
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I want beautiful people in the photo.

1042
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,000
We've got beautiful people.

1043
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,120
Okay.

1044
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Come over, let's take a selfie.

1045
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,120
You hold it.

1046
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Like that.

1047
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,400
Which way?

1048
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,840
Like that.

1049
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,800
Horizontal? No.

1050
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,040
Like that.

1051
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,600
Like this.

1052
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,120
Right.

1053
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,080
Come on.

1054
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,840
Let's make it into a nine-grid collage.

1055
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,520
Ready, one, two, three.

1056
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,880
Let's go home and eat.

1057
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,160
Go home, go home.

1058
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,160
Come on, get in the car.

1059
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,720
Congratulations on winning the competition.

1060
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,720
Amazing, really.

1061
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,800
Now it's completely safe.

1062
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Totally safe.

1063
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,320
Won everything.

1064
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,000
If, just now, while playing that game,

1065
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,720
did you already forget

1066
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,480
what you were supposed to do?

1067
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,560
I remember.

1068
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:17,960
But it wasn't good.

1069
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,040
So what should you do?

1070
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,760
It's hard to make a move.

1071
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,760
If I hadn't acted just now,

1072
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,000
you wouldn't have had much of a chance.

1073
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,840
Because I was planning to look for that person—

1074
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,560
Wen'er.

1075
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,200
Because I'm more familiar with Wen'er.

1076
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,480
Just now, he

1077
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,320
while you were standing there chatting,

1078
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,280
he came over and let me touch.

1079
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,440
He said even though he's been on set lately,

1080
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,680
he's still been working out pretty well.

1081
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,840
Still been working out pretty well.

1082
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,840
What's wrong?

1083
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,080
Even though he hasn't really been working out,

1084
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,240
it's still okay.

1085
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,080
It's fine.

1086
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,120
I touched three times.

1087
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,960
That's fine.

1088
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,600
I didn't squeeze.

1089
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,040
It would be weird if I squeezed.

1090
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,160
Squeezing would be too fake.

1091
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,120
Yeah, squeezing three times right away

1092
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,920
would be exactly what he wanted.

1093
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,160
So I just touched once.

1094
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,720
Are you sending it to me now?

1095
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,840
Send it over, I'll pick some.

1096
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,160
Wait a moment.

1097
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,880
Then I'll edit them tomorrow.

1098
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
Who else?

1099
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,160
It's on the phone.

1100
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,720
Liu Yuning has it on his phone, right?

1101
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,600
I don't have it.

1102
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,760
I look really bad in photos.

1103
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,360
Not as bad as Chen Xingxu (his photos are worse).

1104
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
I just asked him to

1105
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,720
take a few photos for me nearby.

1106
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,920
The scenery is so big,

1107
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,560
but I'm just a tiny part of the photo.

1108
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,360
And it started from here.

1109
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,080
Just my head in the bottom corner.

1110
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,680
It made me so mad.

1111
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,720
Let me see.

1112
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,720
I'll show you, I'm so annoyed.

1113
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,520
This is the first one, this composition.

1114
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,400
The next ones are...

1115
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I'll show you, the later compositions are even crazier.

1116
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,320
What is this supposed to be?

1117
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,280
The later compositions are even more exaggerated.

1118
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,680
Look.

1119
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,360
Tourist photo.

1120
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,320
It's all just mountains.

1121
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,480
The main thing is, it's so ugly.

1122
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,440
What is this?

1123
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,000
Look at the ones I took for him.

1124
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,680
Not bad.

1125
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,640
I'm so frustrated.

1126
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,880
Not bad, looks good.

1127
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,520
You didn't even say anything.

1128
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,120
You should've asked your sister to take them for you.

1129
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,200
We're here.

1130
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,840
We're here.

1131
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Come on, Xingxu.

1132
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,840
Come on.

1133
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,360
Come.

1134
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
Honored homeowner, welcome home.

1135
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,480
Welcome home.

1136
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,920
You haven't been here before, right?

1137
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,400
No, I haven't.

1138
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,920
Take a good look.

1139
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Come on, move forward.

1140
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,240
I'm your security guard.

1141
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,720
Really?

1142
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,680
Follow me.

1143
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,880
This is our foot-washing guy.

1144
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,120
Foot washing.

1145
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,680
No.

1146
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,280
Sock washing.

1147
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,320
Foot washing.

1148
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,320
Foot-washing guy.

1149
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,400
Sorry.

1150
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,520
You switched to foot massage, right?

1151
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,240
Uncle Naiwen will wash your feet.

1152
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,640
Uncle, all of this is...

1153
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
It's so cool today.

1154
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,520
This feels amazing.

1155
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,080
With a gentle breeze blowing,

1156
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,560
it's so comfortable.

1157
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,680
It feels like a sea breeze.

1158
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,360
Ning, are you tired today?

1159
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,800
Ning,

1160
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm okay.

1161
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,960
My shoulders are a bit tight.

1162
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,320
Your shoulders?

1163
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,760
Alright.

1164
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,200
The pool.

1165
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,440
Is it an infinity pool?

1166
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,840
Perfect chance for you to show off your muscles.

1167
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,880
No need, I don't have any muscles.

1168
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,520
Let me show you the "Number One Suite."

1169
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,880
Are you sleeping with me tonight?

1170
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,800
I don't know.

1171
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,040
Right, we need to give everyone a pillow.

1172
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,520
Seriously.

1173
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,840
We don't have to be this close, do we?

1174
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
There's a private bathroom.

1175
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,800
And a balcony too.

1176
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,000
It's beautiful.

1177
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,400
Come on, let's eat.

1178
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
This is great.

1179
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,160
Thank you.

1180
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,520
Sure.

1181
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,920
Look, my three plates, bro.

1182
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,920
Bro.

1183
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,880
Hurry, eat while it's hot.

1184
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,240
It's delicious.

1185
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
You don't eat cheese, do you?

1186
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,000
This cheese is really tasty.

1187
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,960
Just this cheese.

1188
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,040
I don't like cheese.

1189
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,640
Then how did you grow so tall?

1190
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,560
Born beautiful.

1191
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,040
How did you get so tall?

1192
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,480
I don't know.

1193
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
Why don't you two go outside?

1194
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,200
Even 1.82 meters feels short here.

1195
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,600
Did you know that?

1196
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,080
That's normal.

1197
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,320
I want to know.

1198
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,760
Was there a clue in the last round just now?

1199
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,320
Yes.

1200
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,480
Honglei

1201
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,360
Let's go to the side, I'll tell you the clue.

1202
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,520
Clue.

1203
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,400
Lots of leg hair.

1204
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,640
This clue is making me dizzy.

1205
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,040
What clue?

1206
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,720
This "chili powder."

1207
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,720
This clue is almost

1208
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,280
a giveaway.

1209
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,600
It's basically giving it away.

1210
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,480
It's like forcing this person into a corner.

1211
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,920
The clue is that the surname is Sun.

1212
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Likes to wash socks.

1213
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,640
You have to tell the truth.

1214
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,720
The clue I just got was

1215
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,760
has a lot of leg hair.

1216
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,880
Then Naiwen is cleared of suspicion.

1217
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,800
At least make it as hard as mine.

1218
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,520
"Chili extract"

1219
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,600
Everyone has to pull out a leg hair or something.

1220
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,960
Yours is so sparse.

1221
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Because I play this game a lot.

1222
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,480
Is my leg hair the longest?

1223
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,640
Let me tell you,

1224
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,520
Those of us with the surname Chen,

1225
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,960
you all basically come with built-in wool pants.

1226
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,120
Is my leg hair the longest?

1227
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,640
It must be He.

1228
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,040
He has a ton of leg hair.

1229
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,520
A few months ago,

1230
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,240
when I got a hair transplant,

1231
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,560
there was some extra of this stuff.

1232
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,040
Hair follicles.

1233
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,040
A whole batch ended up on my leg.

1234
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,920
Xingxu also has thick leg hair.

1235
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,240
My leg hair is thick too.

1236
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,000
Let me see whose is thicker.

1237
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,000
You like this...

1238
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,320
Didn't you notice today?

1239
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,120
I didn't really pay attention.

1240
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,520
There's nothing after that.

1241
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,200
There is, too.

1242
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,240
I forgot.

1243
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,600
Really?

1244
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,680
I have to see this for myself. Come on.

1245
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,160
So I said,

1246
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,640
After my hair transplant, before and after,

1247
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
I got a whole patch.

1248
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,480
Even the back of my knees grew hair.

1249
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,800
Bro, you have hair behind your knees too.

1250
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,560
What's it to you?

1251
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,560
"Chili extract"

1252
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,840
Choose one of two.

1253
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,000
Me and Xingxu

1254
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,480
And then, that brother and big brother

1255
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,720
None of us have been tested.

1256
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,880
Actually, that's right.

1257
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,920
Actually, I think

1258
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,880
the content of this clue

1259
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,040
is about fifty percent true, in my opinion.

1260
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,760
There's one more person

1261
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,840
who hasn't said a word this round.

1262
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,720
The person sitting across from me.

1263
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,920
What did you do to my mussels?

1264
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,880
Let me tell you,

1265
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,360
No matter how much I eat, it's still not as much as your leg hair.

1266
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,920
I think it must be He.

1267
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,840
Yeah, bro.

1268
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,280
He really has a ton of leg hair.

1269
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,560
His leg hair is as much as his scheming.

1270
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,240
Honglei might be lying.

1271
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,680
I believe he's telling the truth.

1272
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,040
Then you two should team up.

1273
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,800
Then Naiwen,

1274
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
You just wouldn't come up and let me check your leg hair.

1275
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,680
I think there's something wrong with your hair.

1276
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,080
There's something wrong with your hair.

1277
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,720
What does that mean?

1278
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,080
A problem.

1279
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,120
Wearing glasses without lenses.

1280
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,440
Legs without hair.

1281
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,280
A brain that doesn't think.

1282
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,560
You're "chili sauce" now.

1283
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,000
Okay.

1284
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,400
I'm done arguing, guys.

1285
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,240
I'm done arguing.

1286
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,440
If you vote for me,

1287
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,480
you won't have a chance.

1288
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,280
For my "chili" boss,

1289
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,240
I'm willing to sacrifice.

1290
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,160
I've been blessed.

1291
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,400
I accept it.

1292
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,320
Vote for me.

1293
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,880
You only have one chance.

1294
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,840
Vote for me.

1295
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,680
Wait a moment, Chen He.

1296
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,080
Wait a moment.

1297
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,600
Come on.

1298
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,160
Wait a moment.

1299
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,080
Chen He.

1300
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,480
Do you dare to say that?

1301
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,960
You've been blessed, right?

1302
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,720
I've been blessed.

1303
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay.

1304
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,840
I've been blessed too.

1305
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,640
See?

1306
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Bet you didn't expect that.

1307
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,080
Jumped.

1308
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,280
Wait, let me be honest.

1309
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,720
You've confused me.

1310
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,960
What are you trying to do?

1311
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,800
Alright.

1312
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,240
Actually, it's just for an effect.

1313
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm being serious now.

1314
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,080
Anyway, I'll tell you.

1315
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,960
Sit down.

1316
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,360
Let me tell you humans.

1317
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,360
You only have one chance.

1318
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,520
Vote for me.

1319
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,000
All the big beds

1320
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,280
belong to us, the "Chili Clan".

1321
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,280
You sit too. Bro, sit down first.

1322
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,800
To make a long story short,

1323
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,360
but actually, it's a long story.

1324
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,240
I've already said a lot just now.

1325
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,440
If there's anything,

1326
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,040
talk to my mom.

1327
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,360
Is it you?

1328
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
I think it's Xingxu.

1329
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,080
I think it's Xingxu.

1330
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,800
Xingxu, who do you think it is?

1331
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,000
Yes.

1332
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,600
Me.

1333
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,040
Me.

1334
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,200
Take your time.

1335
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,760
Take your time, no rush.

1336
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,680
Make sure you speak slowly.

1337
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,680
I definitely have to suspect Honglei.

1338
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,560
It's because...

1339
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,200
Is it possible...

1340
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,800
He tied me up...

1341
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,160
...here.

1342
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,360
He didn't hurt me.

1343
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,200
He left you here to protect him.

1344
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,840
Xingxu, I'm going to cry.

1345
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,360
A pair of innocent eyes just looks at you like this.

1346
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,800
Alright, shall we vote?

1347
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,400
Let's do it.

1348
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,160
Three, two, one.

1349
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,480
Raise your hand if you vote for Xingxu.

1350
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,520
None.

1351
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,360
One.

1352
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,880
One vote.

1353
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,480
Okay.

1354
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,280
Raise your hand if you vote for He Ge.

1355
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,880
Three votes.

1356
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,640
Wow.

1357
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,480
Raise your hand if you vote for Honglei Ge.

1358
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,640
Honglei Ge, four votes.

1359
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,440
Honglei Ge's initial role is

1360
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,080
a good person.

1361
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,800
Thank you.

1362
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:26,840
Thank you.

1363
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,240
That's enough, bro.

1364
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,000
That's you.

1365
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,720
We are the "Chili Clan."

1366
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,160
Come on, let's applaud.

1367
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,920
Come on, applause.

1368
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,720
You rascal.

1369
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,600
"Chili"

1370
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,920
Thank you.

1371
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,800
"Chili King"

1372
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
You guys are in cahoots with him.

1373
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,800
I'm telling you, the four of us are together.

1374
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,000
Come on, let's have Xingxu say a few words.

1375
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,960
Xingxu, go ahead and say something.

1376
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,200
I won't give a speech.

1377
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,920
I'll just briefly talk about what happened.

1378
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,360
After I found out my identity,

1379
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,360
I completely broke down at that moment.

1380
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,280
Honestly, my first reaction was thinking

1381
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,640
maybe I should just lose and be done with it.

1382
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,160
It would be nice to just go live alone in that tent.

1383
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,640
Already broken down.

1384
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,760
Almost at my breaking point.

1385
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,000
But I never expected

1386
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,720
that at this very moment, I would run into

1387
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,080
my first "chili sauce."

1388
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,280
They came to me on their own.

1389
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,000
They delivered themselves to me.

1390
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,760
A "chili sauce" that came right to my door.

1391
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,040
There's even something like this?

1392
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,920
How could I have expected that?

1393
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,440
Who could have expected that?

1394
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,720
Bro, tell me,

1395
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,440
how did you end up breaking this rule?

1396
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,040
Why?

1397
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,400
I wanted to work out.

1398
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,240
I ran right into trouble.

1399
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,240
The "chili sauce" came straight to me.

1400
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,120
So I just went along with it and talked about it.

1401
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,920
Then my task was done.

1402
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,720
I was really shocked at the time.

1403
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,720
You were right to be shocked, let me tell you.

1404
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,360
The second "chili sauce"—

1405
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,640
I never expected that at all.

1406
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,240
Because—

1407
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,000
Again, I totally didn't see it coming.

1408
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,800
Ran into trouble again.

1409
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,480
Yeah.

1410
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,200
No one told me

1411
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,960
that the first "chili sauce" had already been informed

1412
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,560
that they'd been made into "chili sauce."

1413
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,080
So at that time, I was

1414
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,080
with my second "chili sauce."

1415
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,920
He just kept me there.

1416
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,400
I was totally confused.

1417
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,440
I was like, what do I do now?

1418
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,760
Honglei is really

1419
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,760
so smart.

1420
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,760
I really had no way

1421
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,880
to do anything right under his nose

1422
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,080
at such close range

1423
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,160
to do it,

1424
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,360
to make a "chili sauce."

1425
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,640
Then

1426
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,720
No one expected

1427
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,200
the first bottle of "chili sauce"

1428
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,360
the first bottle of "chili sauce" was notified

1429
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,120
I was totally confused when he came in

1430
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,840
I didn't even know he had already been notified

1431
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,720
"chili sauce"

1432
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
After coming up

1433
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,360
he started

1434
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,760
When he said his first sentence

1435
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,360
Master

1436
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,600
This is my master, now

1437
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,560
When he said "master," I said

1438
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,520
Then

1439
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,320
my second bottle of "chili sauce" appeared

1440
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,720
I was still confused

1441
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,880
Right after my first bottle of "chili sauce"

1442
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,840
and the second bottle of "chili sauce"

1443
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,280
led me to finish my

1444
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,320
third bottle of "chili sauce"

1445
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,520
I was forced to make "chili sauce"

1446
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,840
Come on, let's reenact it

1447
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,720
Let's reenact it, come on

1448
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,120
Honestly, for me

1449
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,960
it felt like two bottles of "chili sauce" had already

1450
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,240
smeared all over me

1451
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,960
I had no choice

1452
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,360
so I went straight for the "chili essence"

1453
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,960
That's how it was

1454
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,320
Naiwen, this side is the shop

1455
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,920
You act it out

1456
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,080
I'm watching

1457
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,640
Yeah, I said, what are you doing

1458
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,640
What are you doing

1459
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,480
What are you doing

1460
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,520
I just turned into "chili sauce"

1461
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,960
I was the most guilty at first.

1462
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,880
But there was no choice, it was for the mission.

1463
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,760
I also paid the price.

1464
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,840
That was part of the mission too.

1465
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,240
Right?

1466
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,920
I haven't received a single cent yet.

1467
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,960
The two of us also

1468
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,320
exchanged gifts.

1469
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,560
Yeah, cups.

1470
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,840
Alright, it was worth it.

1471
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,800
So mine was the least valuable.

1472
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,160
No.

1473
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,200
It's like drinking tea.

1474
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,240
The first brew, the second brew,

1475
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,600
by the third brew, it's weak.

1476
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,280
No flavor left.

1477
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,920
We can definitely make up for it.

1478
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,200
We can make up for it.

1479
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,840
Okay.

1480
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,760
We'll make up for it later.

1481
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,160
Make up for it later.

1482
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,280
Because the situation was urgent at the time.

1483
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:58,720
Right?

1484
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,800
We don't feel guilty toward ourselves.

1485
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,720
Not a bit guilty toward you.

1486
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,080
A toast to the losers.

1487
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,400
Come on.

1488
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,360
That smug little look.

1489
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,680
Today, besides the best player,

1490
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,440
which is Xingxu,

1491
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,400
we also have

1492
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,760
Best Planner,

1493
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,640
Best Director,

1494
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,000
Best Actor,

1495
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,400
Best Action Director,

1496
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,480
and this one.

1497
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,360
They are, respectively,

1498
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,720
Gong Jun, Liu Yuning,

1499
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,480
Chen He, Sun Honglei,

1500
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,080
Wang Yuwen, Ouyang Didi,

1501
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,040
Li Naiwen.

1502
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,840
That's awesome.

1503
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,680
Wait a second.

1504
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,920
Welcome to

1505
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,080
"Earth Super Fresh."

1506
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,720
Welcome to "Earth Super Fresh."

1507
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,360
Xingxu, how about this—

1508
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,720
Can you go over it again?

1509
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,840
Are you guys messing with me?

1510
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,920
Is every single one of them—

1511
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,640
I don't believe it.

1512
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,280
How come you never suspected me?

1513
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,760
This can't be right.

1514
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,640
What's not right?

1515
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,680
Isn't it? Why does it feel so weird?

1516
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,560
I don't need to go over it again.

1517
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,680
I'm just going to be dizzy for a bit.

1518
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,600
I have a feeling right now.

1519
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,760
Let me say a few words—

1520
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,520
There is no worse.

1521
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,000
Only the worst.

1522
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,320
I just like the bad ones.

1523
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,960
Impossible to guard against.

1524
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,800
When the three old guys

1525
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,040
turned into "chili sauce,"

1526
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,480
Xingxu immediately relaxed.

1527
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:55,800
Yeah.

1528
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,000
The difference in him was obvious.

1529
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,680
It was

1530
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,560
when he first arrived

1531
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,520
and when he saw us again later.

1532
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,440
He was like a completely different person.

1533
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,920
This is what you call

1534
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,520
feeling secure.

1535
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,880
He suddenly felt safe.

1536
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,360
I don't have it now.

1537
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,720
Now it's completely gone.

1538
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,280
Not even a little bit left.

1539
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,800
Even less than when I first came.

1540
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,880
Feels like he doesn't even know us anymore.

1541
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,280
Right?

1542
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,400
You guys really

1543
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,520
matured so quickly.

1544
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,720
This is the crash course I signed you up for.

1545
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,920
Alright.

1546
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,760
Today really was

1547
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,960
a rollercoaster of life.

1548
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,080
Thinking back on it is just too funny.

1549
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,320
Xingxu.

1550
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,400
Xingxu is such a pure kid.

1551
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,080
Brother.

1552
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,760
Brothers.

1553
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,560
Brothers.

1554
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,240
Love you.

1555
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,720
Welcome home, owner.

1556
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,960
Cheers

1557
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
Always remember the city of Sorrento

1558
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,080
This is a city that makes me

1559
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,200
both love and hate it

1560
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,960
Let's take a group photo

1561
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,200
We don't have this here

1562
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,880
We don't have this here

1563
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,400
No, I want to stand here today

1564
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,000
Okay, that's fine, come on

1565
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,040
Then move forward

1566
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,560
This side looks better, little brother

1567
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,840
Three, two, one

1568
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,440
Okay

1569
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,240
Great

1570
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,560
Just a little closer, just a bit more

1571
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,840
My heart

1572
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,480
Have we thought of a name?

1573
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,960
Have you figured it out?

1574
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,160
Earth is super fresh

1575
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,360
The world is right in front of us

1576
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,160
The second gesture is this

1577
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,720
This one, with both hands

1578
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,320
"The world is right in front of us," right?

1579
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,400
The world is right in front of us

1580
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,120
Okay

1581
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,360
Earth is super fresh

1582
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,120
The world is right in front of us

1583
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,000
See you in Sicily

1584
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,160
Yuning is the main focus today.

1585
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,640
We're all your assistants today.

1586
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,560
My voice is hoarse, bro.

1587
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,600
Xingxu.

1588
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,040
If you don't want to be the "spicy pepper",

1589
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:24,720
then just sing one song.

1590
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,120
The one from Les Misérables.

1591
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,840
"Stars".

1592
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,680
"Stars" is the hardest song

1593
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,880
to sing in Les Misérables.

1594
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,720
Xingxu.

1595
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,120
Please stop randomly

1596
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,280
showing off your charm.

1597
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Welcome everyone to Earth 808.

1598
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,880
I like how unique you are.

1599
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,640
I have eighty-eight concerts this year.

1600
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,960
Teacher Gong, I'm your fan.

1601
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,240
Just teasing you.

1602
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,680
First, tell us where you're from.

1603
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,360
Hello, students.

1604
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,480
I'm from...

1605
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,520
Why do I feel

1606
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,680
like the atmosphere is a bit off now?

1607
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,120
You can tell who looks more like a mentor, right?

1608
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,640
Teacher Ouyang.

1609
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,080
Whichever team you join,

1610
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,160
we'll join that team too.

1611
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,920
Just switching sides directly.

1612
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,360
Give yourself a hand.

1613
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:04,840
On your body.

1614
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,080
Like this.

1615
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,280
They'll always remember

1616
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,280
their left shoulder and left hem.

1617
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,040
Let's go over it.

1618
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,600
Let's go over it.

1619
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,560
Here we come.

1620
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,720
Okay, right here.

1621
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,920
Solo performance.

1622
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,800
You're pretty good at blocking.

1623
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,480
Go away.

1624
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,480
Get out of the way.

1625
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,280
He winked at me.

1626
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,080
He's distracting me.

1627
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,120
Jun Jun, do a solo performance.

1628
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,120
Music, start.

1629
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,120
Since I can't stay in your embrace,

1630
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,600
Friends walk together for a lifetime.

1631
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,240
Walk together for a lifetime.

1632
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,480
You reckless guy.

1633
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,200
Jumping so high.

1634
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,720
Just like that, I'm conquered by you.

1635
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm too embarrassed to watch.

1636
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,960
Way out.

1637
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,800
Let's have some dignity.

1638
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,160
Elephant Square.

1639
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,320
In this kind of atmosphere,

1640
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,680
I love China.

1641
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,840
Thank you.

1642
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,040
Today, the eight siblings of the Earth family

1643
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,840
are discussing the family business merger plan.

1644
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,200
But everyone has serious disagreements about the merger plan.

1645
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,840
We will have three rounds of voting

1646
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,200
to identify the two people who oppose the merger.

1647
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,280
Control your expressions.

1648
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,880
Naiwen looks a bit suspicious.

1649
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:21,640
Number Six,

1650
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,960
why aren't you saying anything?

1651
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,200
My throat just isn't feeling well today.

1652
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,560
You're overacting a bit.

1653
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,120
Eighth Sister,

1654
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,480
what's written on your sign?

1655
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,840
I choose not to say.

1656
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,160
Today's situation will be tough.

1657
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,680
You can also choose

1658
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,200
the most trusted leader

1659
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,280
and let them take two people in to vote.

1660
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:39,960
I'll be the captain.

1661
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,680
I'll be the captain.

1662
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,440
I'll be the captain.

1663
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,360
Why are you suddenly so energetic?

1664
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,040
Because I've never played this game before.

1665
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,160
Weren't you just quiet a moment ago?

1666
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,640
You've never played?

1667
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,680
Why are you trying to be the captain?

1668
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,280
You'll probably get us all sunk.

1669
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,360
Revolution, rotation.

1670
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,520
Spin up and down.

1671
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,160
Spring.

1672
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,320
Trampoline.

1673
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:56,880
Go!

1674
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,040
So many people.

1675
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:58,880
What are you doing?

1676
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,480
Up.

1677
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:00,760
Down.

1678
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:01,920
Left.

1679
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,640
Right.

1680
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,160
Me.

1681
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Marilyn Monroe

1682
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,800
How did you know that?

1683
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,080
Older people are wiser.

1684
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,680
Which two do you think are the bad guys?

1685
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,760
I suspected him from the start.

1686
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,160
The captain said it was you.

1687
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,680
It's me.

1688
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,720
Who's the second one?

1689
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,280
It's you.

1690
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,000
It's me.

1691
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,680
It's me.

1692
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,400
Has this song been passed down all along?

1693
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,040
What?

1694
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,960
Was this song passed down directly?

1695
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,560
What?

1696
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,720
Let me see.

1697
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,760
You cried and told me

1698
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,040
In fairy tales

1699
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,200
Beautiful heavenly voice

1700
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,480
Not this one.

1701
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,000
Girl across from me, look over here

1702
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,480
Look over here

1703
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,880
This is killing me.

1704
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,320
I've seen heavy rain in the desert

1705
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,480
I've seen the ocean

1706
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,600
Wait, put it back on.

1707
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,720
You've seen too much.

1708
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,000
I praised you for nothing.

1709
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,720
This is really a bit hard.

1710
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,040
Look at my expression.

1711
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:10,360
I won't say anything.

1712
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:10,760
I won't sing.

1713
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,040
I won't sing.

1714
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,440
Yes.

1715
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:12,760
I know

1716
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,800
I know that song

1717
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,760
I've seen rain pour down in the desert

1718
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,600
I've seen the ocean kiss a shark

1719
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,760
Go ahead, charge

1720
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,600
I've seen dusk chase after dawn

1721
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,040
So who are the two wolves in your mind?

1722
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:27,760
Just vote

1723
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,600
One hundred percent

1724
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,480
He isn't

1725
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,160
One hundred percent

1726
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,280
I'm an old "killer"

1727
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,480
Danger

1728
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:33,920
Very dangerous

1729
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,920
Take responsibility yourself

1730
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,600
Just say it once

1731
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,400
Don't say more than that

1732
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,280
Otherwise, you two admit defeat

1733
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,160
Do we even need to admit losing?

1734
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,240
He was always the uncle

1735
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,560
I'm planning to leave this show

1736
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,240
Naiwen

1737
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,080
Stop acting, that's enough

1738
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,400
A little bit

1739
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,160
Not even a little bit

1740
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:47,960
That performance

1741
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,080
Under what circumstances

1742
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,280
What's your pivot point?

1743
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,600
A long time ago

1744
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,400
A little bit

1745
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,200
Even just a little bit

1746
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,560
Is this the Lemon Family's dance?

1747
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,880
We're both crickets

1748
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
Cricket duo

1749
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,280
Do you know

1750
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,640
I've been waiting for you for a long time

1751
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,920
Do you really think

1752
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,240
you're so stunningly beautiful

1753
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,200
that you can fool me

1754
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,080
It's definitely in the rhythm

1755
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,280
What rhythm did you give him

1756
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,600
Even Liu Yuning can match it

1757
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,880
It's so hard to guess, this of his

1758
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,920
Even if we're really clueless

1759
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,880
we still have to vote for you this round

1760
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,960
Yeah, I think it might be wrong, but
