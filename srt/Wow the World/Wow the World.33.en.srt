1
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,400
Sicily

2
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,920
It's not just a dream destination for travelers,

3
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,520
but also the inspiration for countless classic films.

4
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
A source of creativity.

5
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,760
Ancient streets,

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,040
grand architecture,

7
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,320
and azure coastlines

8
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,480
have provided filmmakers

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,120
with natural epic backdrops.

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,400
It's the filming location for many famous movies.

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,520
Every frame

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,160
is etched with Sicily's

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,560
unique dramatic tension.

14
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Today,

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,520
the Earth Family will be here

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,360
to stage a brilliant movie story.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,680
The Earth Family's leader

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,760
is determined to merge the businesses of the eight siblings

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,880
and forge a business empire.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,200
Supporters believe

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,960
a single spark may start a prairie fire.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,440
But opponents think

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,080
scattered, we shine like the stars.

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,760
A storm that will decide the family's fate

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,880
is about to arrive.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,560
Tricks.

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,560
It's all tricks.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,520
What about life?

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,640
What about the environment?

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,120
What about the business?

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
Alright.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
Don't rush.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Okay.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Can you control your emotions?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,880
Otherwise, it will affect your professional judgment.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't forget,

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
we were invited here.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
We're here to merge.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
To become a powerful business empire.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Excuse me, Leader Nai,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
the person who proposed this plan,

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,400
has never even visited the group.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,920
How can we merge the businesses?

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,400
Is it in Beijing?

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Is it in a hutong?

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Are we merging a business over a bowl of zhajiangmian?

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,480
Our family has always operated independently.

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,520
It's not really about independence.

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,600
If you ask me,

50
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,840
we should stay away from these amateurs.

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,640
No.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,720
They're very professional.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,960
And they're famous experts.

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
But their ideas are amateurish.

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
That's true.

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,800
But just remember,

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,480
never let others

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,880
see what you truly think.

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,200
So how do we merge?

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Why don't we give it a try?

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,800
You.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
And me.

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Yes.

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200
Yes, let's try.

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
Let's just try.

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,760
Try.

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,160
Let's go.

68
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
Good idea.

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Family business.

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,400
This name

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
is in my blood.

72
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,120
Without the Earth Family name

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
to guarantee this deal,

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
I can't imagine

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
those open transactions

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
would be so unconvincing.

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Who would use the family's reputation

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
as a bargaining chip?

79
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,120
An overly loud declaration

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,480
often reveals a fatal weakness.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,640
Rashness.

82
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
This will make other families think

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
we're a bit

84
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,040
careless in our planning.

85
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
What you just said

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,920
makes this cup of coffee

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,800
taste especially bitter.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,240
If you want to hold the reins of fate,

89
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
then you need to know

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,160
capital,

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,360
technology,

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
and partners in cooperation—

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
they're all pieces on the chessboard.

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,520
Learn from this.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Then let's wish ourselves good luck.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,520
This time,

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
we won't stay silent.

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,920
How do we advance the merger plan?

99
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,360
In my heart,

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
I laid out the plan ten years ago.

101
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640
We need to understand our family business,

102
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,360
just as we understand every inch of land,

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
and every breath of wind.

104
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,200
But ten years ago,

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,960
Brother,

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,680
in my world,

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
there were no bouncing numbers or struggles.

108
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,680
Is that not okay?

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,280
Listen carefully.

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,160
The key point

111
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,160
that determines the family's future

112
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,280
is not the terms of the merger.

113
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Unless

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,640
they have clauses that forever

115
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,280
make us unable to refuse.

116
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Do you understand?

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,360
Persuasion

118
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,040
is like snow in spring,

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
falling on the land of Sicily,

120
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,360
gone in an instant.

121
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,760
It means nothing.

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,480
My judgment

123
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,800
is the law of this land.

124
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
The direction

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,360
must be decided by me.

126
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,040
Tell me,

127
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,840
your law—

128
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,960
on which land

129
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
has it ever borne the fruit we desire?

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,480
The family's order

131
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
cannot change because of a single voice.

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,360
In the face of fate and will,

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,760
there is no wall of impossibility.

134
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
What I want to do

135
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,320
is to leave a mark on the family's journey,

136
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,040
one they will never

137
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
forget, even in death.

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,160
Alright.

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,840
For the last time,

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,840
I place my trust in that piece of land

141
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,960
in your hands, unknown to me.

142
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,800
The eight siblings, each with their own thoughts, gather together.

143
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
This time,

144
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
the family will face

145
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
what kind of decision?

146
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,000
Xingxu could play a cop or something.

147
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,360
No, I mean you look righteous.

148
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
Like a police officer.

149
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,080
Justice.

150
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,800
That kind of justice.

151
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,120
Good eye.

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,720
But don't be fooled by his appearance.

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,520
The family elder isn't here.

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,160
The "groom" hasn't arrived yet.

155
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
The "groom" isn't here.

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Welcome the "groom" to the stage.

157
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,360
Please have a seat.

158
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
This is our family leader.

159
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,320
Today we're marrying off the "groom," right?

160
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Who is

161
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,840
my groom?

162
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
In this kind of setting,

163
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
is it inappropriate to sing this song?

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,200
Don't let me keep looking around.

165
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,360
Don't let me keep daydreaming.

166
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,919
Who is my groom?

167
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,600
Put on the red veil.

168
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,679
Today the family gathers together,

169
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,000
mainly to discuss marrying you off.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,720
What can our family get from the other family?

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,240
What can we gain?

172
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
How much property can we split?

173
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,200
Who gets what?

174
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Give it to—

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,920
Bold move.

176
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
Bring investment as a dowry.

177
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,680
So it's marrying in with capital, right?

178
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
So we're marrying off the "groom," right?

179
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,360
This is a conspiracy.

180
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,280
Such a big conspiracy.

181
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
It's not a conspiracy, it's an open plot.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,560
We kids here,

183
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,840
look really good dressed up.

184
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,400
How are we supposed to compete with that?

185
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
You guys should change out of those suits.

186
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,040
Take them off.

187
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
For this kind of segment in the future,

188
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,400
let's not wear formal clothes.

189
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,080
That's right.

190
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
Maybe a contrast will give us a better chance to win.

191
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,640
Right?

192
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
When I saw you from behind today,

193
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,480
I thought you looked like

194
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,640
an Arab billionaire.

195
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Welcome everyone to beautiful Sicily.

196
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,640
The castle we're in today

197
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,000
is a historic residence over a hundred years old.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,920
It's now inherited by two brothers.

199
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,240
Today, we're here as well

200
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,080
to experience a movie-like life.

201
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,400
As everyone knows,

202
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,440
the success of famous business tycoons

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,000
often comes from family unity.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,640
Today,

205
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,800
the eight siblings of the Earth Family

206
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,720
as family decision-makers,

207
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,200
have gathered here to discuss

208
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
the family business merger plan.

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
But there are serious disagreements about the merger.

210
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,040
Two members oppose the merger.

211
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
We will have three rounds of voting

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,120
using a best-of-three system

213
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,240
to identify the two who oppose the merger.

214
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,000
The winning side will receive a reward.

215
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
Today is

216
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
the day to try and divide our eight siblings.

217
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,040
Isn't it?

218
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,640
Yeah.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
I think Naiwen might be suspicious.

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,480
We haven't even drawn yet.

221
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,400
Suspicious before the draw even starts.

222
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
Naiwen looks a bit shady.

223
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,760
Those sunglasses are hiding something.

224
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,280
Everyone, go to the room behind you one by one

225
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
to draw your identity card.

226
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,800
Go ahead, Honglei.

227
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm the eldest son of this family.

228
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm honest and sincere.

229
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
Not good at expressing myself.

230
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
I have no desire

231
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,720
to inherit the family fortune.

232
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,240
Taking care of my siblings

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,480
is my duty.

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
I am

235
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,320
naturally

236
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
pure

237
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360
a good person.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,960
See you in a bit.

239
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,960
Doesn't look like a good person.

240
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,440
Where to?

241
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
The first door here.

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,200
Here?

243
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,560
Big brother,

244
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,440
are you really that unfamiliar with your own home?

245
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600
That's scary.

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
I'm already getting nervous.

247
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,160
I just introduced myself

248
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
as a very good person.

249
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,000
The eldest son of the family.

250
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,000
I have to take good care of my siblings.

251
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
I definitely can't be

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,240
What's this?

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
It's taking too long.

254
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
Control your expression.

255
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Are the rules in this game complicated?

256
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,360
What are the rules for drawing cards?

257
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,560
Here we go.

258
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
Pretending to be relaxed.

259
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,760
I told you, I'm a good guy.

260
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
Everyone, look into my eyes.

261
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,720
Can't see.

262
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,320
Seventh brother.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,920
Why did you take so long, bro?

264
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,680
Yeah.

265
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,000
Chatting.

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Chatting.

267
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,440
Chatting? Were you learning the rules?

268
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,520
Were you checking the rules, bro?

269
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,720
Ran into Aunt Liu from the neighborhood.

270
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,400
Had a little chat.

271
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,240
Just so you know, I'm a good guy.

272
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm saying this while looking into your eyes.

273
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,160
Good guy.

274
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,680
Good guy.

275
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,200
Come on, second brother.

276
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm the second child in this family.

277
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
Actually, this family

278
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm a pair of socks.

279
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
That's how it was built up.

280
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
Our family owns a sock factory.

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We started out by washing socks.

282
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,600
I carry a heavy responsibility.

283
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,800
I won't let what I built with my own hands

284
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
this family

285
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,920
be ruined by two undercovers.

286
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,520
mess up our family.

287
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,000
So I will definitely find them out.

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,480
Alright.

289
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,760
Bro, don't take more than ten seconds in there.

290
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,960
Okay, I'm done drawing.

291
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
No tricks.

292
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,440
No tricks.

293
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,640
What does this mean?

294
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,960
You can vote in favor or against.

295
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,600
Attention.

296
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,560
Your recognition gesture with your partner is

297
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
crossing arms over your chest.

298
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,440
Please observe everyone around you carefully.

299
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,120
Don't tell or trust anyone.

300
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,000
Now it's getting fun.

301
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,680
Now it's getting fun.

302
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,920
Isn't this interesting?

303
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,120
Now it's getting fun.

304
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
Whose turn is it?

305
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,520
I'm the third child in this family.

306
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,000
My hobby is playing computer games.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,840
So I work in esports.

308
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,640
Cool.

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,080
Really cool.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,880
Actually, I hope I can draw

311
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,000
the supporter role.

312
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Jun Jun.

313
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,760
How many roles are there in this game?

314
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
Are there only two roles?

315
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,600
There are only two roles.

316
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,520
Supporter and antagonist.

317
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,160
The supporter's mission

318
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,560
is to find these two people.

319
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Right.

320
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Suddenly, I feel like today's game

321
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
is very

322
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,720
hard.

323
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,680
very hard.

324
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm this family's

325
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,880
fourth child.

326
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,400
And also one of the family's

327
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,040
chefs.

328
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
I play a role

329
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
connecting the past and the future.

330
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,520
Okay.

331
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,640
Bro, what does your card say?

332
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,440
Your recognition gesture with your partner is

333
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
crossing arms over your chest.

334
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,600
It's my turn.

335
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,240
Hello everyone.

336
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm from this family.

337
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,120
Pulling up your pants? Why do you always do that?

338
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,160
Do it again.

339
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,520
Sagging.

340
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,200
You are our

341
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,280
family tailor.

342
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,080
Try again.

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,960
Hello everyone.

344
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm from this family.

345
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,720
fifth child.

346
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,200
Very cool.

347
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,520
And very kind.

348
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
You have to trust me.

349
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Whatever role I draw

350
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,920
I'll tell everyone right away.

351
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay.

352
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,600
There really is this.

353
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,320
What does this mean?

354
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm ranked in this family as

355
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,960
the sixth child.

356
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm number six.

357
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm number six.

358
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
I think the number six

359
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,040
is a very

360
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,480
lucky number for me.

361
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,760
So I'm definitely a supporter.

362
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,280
Sixth brother, I believe this round

363
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,440
you don't have a special role.

364
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm not sure about the others.

365
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm sure you're a game black hole.

366
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,640
That's true.

367
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,240
Not necessarily.

368
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
They can't all be the same, right?

369
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,200
I don't know about that.

370
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,120
You don't know?

371
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,240
Number six, how's it going?

372
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,560
What card did you get?

373
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,240
What does it say, number six?

374
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,480
You can't say either.

375
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,680
The mic is broken.

376
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,839
I want to say something.

377
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,680
Supporters, do you understand the rules?

378
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,200
We need to say it out loud.

379
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,120
Number six, why aren't you talking?

380
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm just

381
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,120
not feeling well today, my throat hurts.

382
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
You're overacting a bit.

383
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,160
I really don't feel well.

384
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,920
It's your turn.

385
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,640
Number seven.

386
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm the seventh child in this family.

387
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,840
You're a landlord, right?

388
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,560
Yes.

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,720
I manage the keys.

390
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,680
So many keys.

391
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,800
You're basically property management.

392
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,520
A professional locksmith.

393
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,240
If you need a lock opened, come to me.

394
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,280
This family has fallen on hard times.

395
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,600
Why has the family declined?

396
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,840
We're actually on the rise.

397
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,080
How's it going?

398
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,960
How's it going?

399
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,560
I'm a good person.

400
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,840
Go ahead, there's a surprise waiting for you.

401
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,480
Hello everyone, I'm the eighth child in this family.

402
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
I'm the youngest sister.

403
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,080
My world is full of bouncing

404
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,960
cartoon characters.

405
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,720
All cards have been drawn.

406
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,080
Tell us honestly

407
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,800
what's written on your card.

408
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,400
What's written on your card?

409
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,840
Can I tell you, sixth brother?

410
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Eighth sister.

411
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
What does your card say?

412
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
I choose not to say.

413
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
If you're a good person,

414
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,120
you can say it boldly.

415
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,160
Because good people need to find their teammates first.

416
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,680
Let me remind everyone,

417
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,960
they have a recognition gesture among them.

418
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,760
You can also watch their gestures

419
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,640
to see

420
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
if anyone is acting strange.

421
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,400
They might be a candidate for the antagonist.

422
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,560
I really am yawning.

423
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,520
Both of them are covering their mouths.

424
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,680
No way, this is such a coincidence.

425
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,920
What if we all get it wrong?

426
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,840
What do we do if we make a mistake?

427
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
Seriously, it's tough being a good guy.

428
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,760
Today's game is going to be hard.

429
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,920
I think you two are stirring things up.

430
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,440
If neither of you drew the antagonist card,

431
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
that means in this group,

432
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,240
there are four antagonists.

433
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
So I really hope you two

434
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
drew the antagonist card.

435
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,960
We're about to start

436
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
the first round of voting.

437
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,840
There will be three rounds of voting.

438
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,000
The number of voters in each round is

439
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,360
three, six, and five.

440
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,680
Supporters can only vote in favor.

441
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,240
Antagonists can vote either for or against.

442
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,400
If there are votes against in two rounds,

443
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,440
the antagonists win.

444
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,800
Now, you can pick three people to start the first round of voting.

445
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,920
We haven't done anything yet.

446
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
It's just the first round of voting.

447
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
It's a pure vote.

448
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,640
It's a blind selection.

449
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
Just a random pick.

450
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Supporters can only vote in favor.

451
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,000
And antagonists

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
can vote for or against.

453
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,280
Right.

454
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,320
Everyone should vote in favor in the first round.

455
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,680
No one will reveal their identity.

456
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,280
Pick three trustworthy people to vote.

457
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
Yes, you can also choose

458
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,520
the most trusted captain.

459
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,120
Let them take two people in to vote.

460
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
Why are you raising your hands?

461
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,120
I'll be the captain.

462
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,800
I'll be the captain.

463
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,840
I'll be the captain.

464
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
Why do you want to

465
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,600
Why are you suddenly so active?

466
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,720
Because I've never played this game before.

467
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,880
Weren't you just quiet a moment ago?

468
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,560
If you haven't played, why are you fighting to be captain?

469
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,280
You'll probably sink us.

470
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,760
You need to help the good guys.

471
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,960
Then you should be quieter.

472
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Do I look like a bad guy?

473
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
I'm not one either.

474
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
You really do look like a bad guy today.

475
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,720
Why do you

476
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,320
keep posing like a boss?

477
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,880
Just now.

478
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Born to be a boss.

479
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,320
Boss by nature.

480
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,320
Boss by nature.

481
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,800
No, not now.

482
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
I think you're all judging too soon.

483
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,040
Just throw someone in quickly.

484
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,880
Your own teammate, right?

485
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,440
No.

486
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,600
No.

487
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,960
Vote for the captain.

488
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,840
Vote for me.

489
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,840
Yuning is reliable.

490
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,920
Okay, I have the most votes.

491
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,560
Me, Gong Jun, and Wen'er.

492
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
This is really hard to guess.

493
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,400
First round of voting.

494
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,560
Everyone supports.

495
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,320
Every vote is stressful for the opponents.

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
Supporters.

497
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,160
Have the advantage.

498
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,360
It's tough for the opponents.

499
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,000
Everyone,

500
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
Next, we're heading to

501
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,760
the filming location of "Malèna".

502
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Syracuse.

503
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Let's go.

504
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,240
Let's move.

505
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,720
So cool.

506
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,480
Really handsome.

507
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,040
You're handsome too.

508
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,280
I saw your concert today.

509
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,120
Saw that poster.

510
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,800
The one with the spoon and fork.

511
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,160
Yeah.

512
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Because I was in

513
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,840
Shenzhen was the first stop.

514
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,000
Back in my hometown,

515
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
I learned to be a chef.

516
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,880
Then I worked at a restaurant in Shenzhen.

517
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,320
I was really touched when I saw it.

518
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,600
Fans said it's

519
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,040
the one wrapped in dreams.

520
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,360
Right.

521
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Will there be a show in Beijing?

522
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,640
Yes, bro.

523
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,000
After I pulled up the schedule,

524
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,480
I sent it out.

525
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,280
Let's go whenever we're free.

526
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,000
His tickets are always hard to get, bro.

527
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,080
We're here.

528
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,640
Let's go.

529
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,880
It's so hot.

530
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,400
Let's change clothes first.

531
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,840
Come on.

532
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,000
Everyone's style matches so well today.

533
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,520
Green.

534
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,280
It's beautiful here.

535
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,160
So beautiful.

536
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,240
Syracuse.

537
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,040
A city that blends history and culture

538
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,920
with the charm of cinema perfectly.

539
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,040
This is where the movie

540
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,640
"Malèna" was filmed.

541
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,360
When you step into this city,

542
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,120
it's like entering a dream world from a movie.

543
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,600
So stunning, so beautiful.

544
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
The lighting is perfect too.

545
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,960
So fast.

546
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,160
Our Italy trip is almost over.

547
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,480
Yeah, luckily we made it yesterday.

548
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,760
At Elephant Square,

549
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,440
partying with foreigners was worth it.

550
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,040
Wenzi, why so quiet?

551
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Tired, right?

552
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,880
Last night was too wild.

553
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,560
I'm still not back to normal.

554
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,120
I'm just thirsty and tired.

555
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,160
That's not good.

556
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,040
We're at the "Malèna" filming location.

557
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,480
We have to check in here.

558
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,240
Yeah, it's so beautiful.

559
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,920
We can't waste time resting.

560
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,280
Our good friend Mizone is always here.

561
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,120
Refreshing and thirst-quenching.

562
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,360
Helps us get back on track.

563
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,960
Feels great.

564
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Feels great.

565
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,640
A sip of Mizone.

566
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Instantly back to normal.

567
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
Back again.

568
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm going to take pictures.

569
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,040
Since we're here,

570
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,480
let's recreate

571
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,040
some classic movie scenes, right?

572
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,360
How can we take a group photo

573
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,680
without our Mizone buddy?

574
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,880
Thanks to it today. Let's go.

575
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
Let's go, Honglei.

576
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,880
Let's set off.

577
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,120
Bye-bye.

578
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,120
I acted in that movie.

579
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,280
It's called "Untouchable."

580
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,840
I've seen it.

581
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,680
I've practiced this before.

582
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,600
I forgot, totally forgot.

583
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
I just did it for a living.

584
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,600
We can spin too.

585
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,240
Like this.

586
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,400
Two, three.

587
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,080
That's good.

588
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,520
Why am I here?

589
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,480
Can you dance?

590
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,000
No, I can't.

591
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,720
You try dancing.

592
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,960
I can't.

593
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,680
Let's dance together, come on.

594
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,640
One, two, three.

595
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,560
Like this.

596
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,720
One, two, three.

597
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,440
Bro, remember to circle back.

598
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Don't keep going straight.

599
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,560
If you keep walking, you'll reach the end.

600
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,920
Go on.

601
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,520
Why can't you do it?

602
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,360
Didn't we learn this?

603
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,160
I forgot.

604
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
I only learned that stuff to make a living.

605
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,440
You really have to come here.

606
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,920
Have you seen "Malèna"?

607
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,480
Yes, I have.

608
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,600
Some movies, when you're a kid,

609
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,720
you totally don't understand them.

610
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:17,960
Yeah.

611
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,440
Can't get it.

612
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,480
But now, with more experience,

613
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,120
watching them again feels different.

614
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,400
Completely different.

615
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
I really love "Cinema Paradiso."

616
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,320
And that piano piece,

617
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,440
I even learned to play it.

618
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,080
"Cinema Paradiso" is amazing.

619
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,280
Was that scene filmed right here?

620
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,400
The camera rises up,

621
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
then moves into the room, right?

622
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,440
Yes.

623
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,200
The one in Sicily.

624
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,240
It was shot right here.

625
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,000
That's right.

626
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,080
The scene with the lawyer.

627
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,200
Let's do the Sicily style.

628
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,480
I really want to have some fun, let's give it a try.

629
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,280
Suppose,

630
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,960
Yu Wen leaves.

631
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,480
Di Di and I pretend to be a couple.

632
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,320
Then I turn around.

633
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,200
She gives me a slap.

634
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,880
You know?

635
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
Try serenading.

636
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay.

637
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,600
Or you can be the drummer.

638
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,200
Right.

639
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,960
You sing.

640
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,920
I'll play the guitar.

641
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,320
How about that?

642
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,040
Sure, I'll play the drums.

643
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,880
Let's go.

644
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,640
Are there any flowers?

645
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,520
Look, when a beautiful woman passes by,

646
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
just react a little.

647
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,240
Alright.

648
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,840
How about this,

649
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
let's play the street punks.

650
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,040
Just us two.

651
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,520
Street punks.

652
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,280
The three of us will play three street punks.

653
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Three street punks.

654
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,120
Three punks make six tricks.

655
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Three punks.

656
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,800
Alright, let's do it.

657
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,520
How about fitness swimming?

658
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,240
Interested in fitness swimming?

659
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,200
Want to try fitness swimming?

660
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
Fitness swimming.

661
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,680
It's not bad.

662
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,720
Drag out the fitness swimming guy and "finish him."

663
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,080
Where's the fitness swimming guy?

664
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,480
Uh...

665
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,560
Bro, want to sign up?

666
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,560
Want a membership?

667
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,360
I think it's awesome.

668
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,040
So cool.

669
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,720
Let's go.

670
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,160
I'm starving.

671
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,840
Me too.

672
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,640
Okay.

673
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,440
This tastes so good.

674
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,880
This place is really delicious.

675
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,520
The family wants to merge and grow stronger.

676
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,800
We need all the siblings

677
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,960
to work together in harmony.

678
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,240
The next task

679
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,200
is designed to test

680
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,320
how well you cooperate.

681
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,640
This round is called

682
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,240
Body Charades.

683
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,720
Form teams of two as you like.

684
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,960
One person moves the other's body

685
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,400
to help them guess the word.

686
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Within five minutes,

687
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,680
the team with the most correct guesses wins.

688
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,120
Winners have a chance to become team captain.

689
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,160
They can choose voting members.

690
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,520
Then we have to pick someone we trust.

691
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,040
I think this way,

692
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,240
you two form a team, and we two form a team.

693
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
That way, we won't interfere with each other.

694
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
I think the undercover wants to win too.

695
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,200
The undercover needs to win to get in.

696
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,480
Right.

697
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,320
Let's go.

698
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,240
I trust Xingxu quite a bit.

699
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
But I don't trust his gaming skills.

700
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,320
Mainly,

701
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
why does it feel so weird?

702
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,320
It's so contradictory.

703
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,680
What if I actually win?

704
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,480
Wait, if you say that,

705
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,360
now I feel like you're suspicious.

706
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,160
You know?

707
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,760
He's a bit excited.

708
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,800
I just want to win the game.

709
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,040
I'll team up with Gong Jun.

710
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,880
I'll team up with Didi.

711
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,760
I'll team up with Xingxu.

712
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Then He-ge and Honglei-ge team up.

713
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,720
Alright, we're ready.

714
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Do I move you or do you move me?

715
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,320
You move me.

716
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,560
Okay.

717
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,600
But with your build,

718
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,480
can I even move you?

719
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,320
Just treat it as a workout, bro.

720
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,880
Alright.

721
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,640
Right?

722
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,360
Just lift weights.

723
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,280
Just pretend we're lifting weights.

724
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Like this, weightlifting, go.

725
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,440
Here we go.

726
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:06,920
This one's hard.

727
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,600
Bro, the first few words,

728
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,920
can you tell me?

729
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Erase and start over.

730
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,080
Erase it, my hand...

731
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,000
Erase one, right?

732
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,960
Four.

733
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,600
My fingers are about to break, bro.

734
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,680
Wait a second.

735
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,080
Bro.

736
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,160
Let me think.

737
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,280
This is really tough.

738
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,840
This is "one".

739
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,280
This is "pass".

740
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,000
So we skip the first word, right?

741
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,680
Alright, that's fine.

742
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,040
Let's guess the second word.

743
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,080
Second word.

744
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,440
Do we need the second word?

745
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Or just skip it too.

746
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,120
Let's do the third one.

747
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,960
Skip them all.

748
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,840
Skip them all, okay.

749
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,800
Nothing at all.

750
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,760
Which word?

751
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,160
Which one, squat.

752
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,920
Horse stance.

753
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,560
Just lift weights.

754
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,120
Spin up and down, bro.

755
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,160
Bro.

756
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Spring, trampoline.

757
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,520
Bro.

758
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
Don't mess with me, okay?

759
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,160
What does that mean?

760
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,920
Bro.

761
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,160
You're making yourself out of breath.

762
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,560
How many words? Which word out of four?

763
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,680
This is hard, it's a bit tough.

764
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,600
What are you doing?

765
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,920
Giddy up.

766
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Giddy up.

767
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,480
There are so many people, what are you doing?

768
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Wait a second.

769
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,840
Clap.

770
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,320
Pat your butt and clap.

771
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,280
Giddy up!

772
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,680
Go!

773
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,400
This is too abstract.

774
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,080
Later, you know, this is really abstract.

775
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,080
Okay? It's a bit abstract.

776
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,560
Look, what are you spinning and clapping for?

777
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,320
Spinning your butt?

778
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,840
Spinning the drum?

779
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,120
What are you even dancing, bro?

780
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Alright, come down, okay.

781
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
We...

782
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Let's get hyped!

783
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,200
This move is kind of...

784
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,600
Pat, hold.

785
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,000
Hold and clap, clap and hold, clap and spin.

786
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,840
My back is all wet.

787
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,199
This is so hard.

788
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,440
My back is soaked.

789
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,639
Just treat it as a workout.

790
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,440
Bro, I'm sweating.

791
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,960
I'm sweating so much.

792
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,600
My whole performing career...

793
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,000
has never been this tough.

794
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm just completely lost.

795
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,120
Come on, it's fine.

796
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,480
Very good, really good, bro.

797
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,719
Very good, really good, bro.

798
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,719
Where are you?

799
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,440
He's not there.

800
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,600
Where are you?

801
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,520
Went to wipe off sweat.

802
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,560
Went to wipe off sweat.

803
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,880
No problem.

804
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,880
No rush.

805
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,320
Honestly, this is pretty tiring.

806
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,920
Bro, your logic is a bit abstract.

807
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,199
Spin, rotate.

808
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,120
Right.

809
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,719
Keep guessing.

810
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,560
Spin.

811
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,440
Giddy up!

812
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,320
Carousel.

813
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,000
Carousel.

814
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,880
You have to know,

815
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,760
someone did this to me alone.

816
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,680
Pat my butt.

817
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,560
Giddy up!

818
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,920
How could I guess it's a carousel?

819
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
This is fun.

820
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,360
Come on.

821
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
Don't rest yet, there's more, bro.

822
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360
There's more.

823
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,440
I want to rest.

824
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
Bro wants to sit down.

825
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,880
One word, two words, three words, four words.

826
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,960
Four.

827
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,520
Here we go again.

828
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,080
Okay.

829
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,200
No.

830
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,880
Bro, I want to tell you something.

831
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,120
It's already limiting my thinking.

832
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,480
Really.

833
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,880
It's really hard for me to think now.

834
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,920
Little swan, Swan Lake.

835
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,080
Swan, right?

836
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,320
Yeah, just tell me if I'm right or not.

837
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,320
Swan.

838
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,560
He just keeps nodding.

839
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,520
He thinks he can see.

840
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,400
The only thing I can't sense is nodding.

841
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,640
The only thing I can't sense is nodding.

842
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,120
Bro.

843
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,840
We're really in sync now.

844
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,160
We're unbeatable.

845
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,560
One.

846
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,640
Waving swan.

847
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,040
Look at you laughing.

848
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,640
Even the swan is laughing.

849
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
Can you guess what this is?

850
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,000
Is one and two the swan, right?

851
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,160
Three and four are the swan.

852
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,200
Or is it two and three?

853
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,360
Or is it one and four?

854
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,160
One and two are the swan.

855
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,880
One is "sky".

856
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,240
Then where's the "swan"?

857
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,560
Just now you said...

858
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,120
The word "swan" is correct, right?

859
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
So "swan" is this one and that one.

860
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,000
Or is it that one and that one?

861
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
It's this one and that one.

862
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,200
Three and four are the swan.

863
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,480
Isn't that it?

864
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,840
One, two, three, four.

865
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,160
One, two, three, four.

866
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,200
One, two, three, four

867
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,800
I know three and four mean "swan"

868
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,800
I got it right

869
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,040
Three, four, swan

870
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,400
That's not correct

871
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,720
Not correct

872
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,000
You got one character right earlier

873
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,880
Four Little Swans

874
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm exhausted

875
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,520
He keeps signaling "four, four"

876
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,600
The first character is "four"

877
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,920
The first character is "four"

878
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,960
I just can't figure it out

879
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
No, let me try another one

880
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,040
One, two, three, four

881
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,120
The second character

882
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,560
What does it mean?

883
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
Give, offer, take

884
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,480
Eat

885
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Is this one character, bro?

886
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,600
It's one character

887
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,880
It's already

888
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,720
become a whole story

889
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,040
One is spinning and stuffing it in his mouth

890
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
This character is hard to describe

891
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,160
This one's not working

892
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,680
This is too hard

893
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,400
Let me try, come on

894
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,720
Come on, I'll give it a shot

895
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,440
Let me try, bro

896
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:54,880
No

897
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,200
Because I just got used to his style

898
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,800
When you switch styles, I just...

899
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,280
Let me try

900
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
Too complicated

901
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,360
Let me try

902
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,120
Here we go again

903
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
Don't do it like this

904
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,480
Stand properly

905
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
You're making me uncomfortable

906
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,120
Look at me

907
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,040
You're making me uncomfortable

908
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,920
Look at me

909
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,880
Where should I look?

910
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,400
I know

911
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,640
I can't see

912
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,960
Can't see

913
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,760
Turn stone into gold

914
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,880
Spring roll, wrap spring roll

915
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,120
Anyway

916
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,320
Four characters

917
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,320
Fried spring roll

918
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,120
Fried dough stick

919
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,760
What's this?

920
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,280
What is this?

921
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,640
Make jianbing guozi

922
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,840
This is way too hard

923
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,800
Good job

924
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,880
Thanks for your effort

925
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,440
Come on

926
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,040
So bright

927
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,680
You act, I guess

928
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,640
Alright

929
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,320
Let's go

930
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,440
Three characters, okay

931
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,840
Ballroom dance

932
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,080
You made me dizzy, bro

933
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,920
Three characters, is it a dance?

934
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,760
Isn't that ballroom dance?

935
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,560
Latin dance

936
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,120
Impressive

937
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,280
Two characters

938
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,360
He can't see again

939
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,160
What are you doing?

940
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,560
Bullfight

941
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,960
You can even guess that?

942
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,000
Come on

943
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
I don't trust his gaming skills

944
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,880
Four characters

945
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,840
Sorry

946
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,840
Sit-up

947
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,320
Correct

948
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,880
What's going on?

949
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
Mainly, the move wasn't finished

950
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,200
He still guessed it

951
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,920
Marilyn Monroe

952
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,680
Three characters

953
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,920
It also made me feel

954
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,600
Someone who guesses better without looking

955
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,800
Not bad

956
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
You guessed way too fast

957
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,920
That's amazing

958
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,720
That's good

959
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,440
So impressive

960
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,000
Let's do it

961
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,320
Two characters

962
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,320
Smell

963
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,400
Eat

964
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:30,720
How do we do this?

965
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,400
What should we do?

966
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,480
You get the essence.

967
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,960
Alright.

968
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,360
Is it a person's name?

969
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,600
A person's name.

970
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,400
Like this.

971
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,200
Yang... Yang Kun.

972
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,360
Okay.

973
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,440
Eight characters.

974
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,240
First, second.

975
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,440
Spin.

976
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,840
Three, four.

977
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,440
Raise.

978
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,680
That's amazing.

979
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,240
Spinning and jumping, I close my eyes.

980
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,040
Oh no, our record is about to be broken.

981
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,840
Didi.

982
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,000
Let's switch.

983
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,480
This one's hard.

984
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,640
This one's tough.

985
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,040
One, two, three, four, five.

986
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,040
Smile.

987
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,640
It's fine.

988
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,080
Put it here and feel it.

989
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,400
After some time,

990
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,600
she'll slowly figure out what it is.

991
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,640
Mona Lisa's smile.

992
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Let the bullet fly for a while.

993
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,640
High.

994
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,840
Let me show you.

995
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,000
What a real pro looks like.

996
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Let me show you what being number one means.

997
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,000
This one's already set to win.

998
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,040
Come on.

999
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,600
I'll guess.

1000
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,720
I'll try to imagine.

1001
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,120
I'll write the characters on your hand.

1002
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,680
Okay.

1003
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,160
This is eight.

1004
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,160
And like this, how about this?

1005
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,440
You go in front.

1006
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,960
Alright.

1007
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,280
Four characters.

1008
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,040
First character.

1009
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,320
Hand like this.

1010
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,120
Person.

1011
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,640
Person.

1012
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,280
Okay.

1013
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Person up, down, left, right.

1014
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,040
Me.

1015
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,720
Like this, this is...

1016
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,960
Pinch the philtrum.

1017
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,160
Squeeze that person.

1018
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,800
Philtrum.

1019
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Right.

1020
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,400
Philtrum.

1021
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,720
Person... rescue? First aid?

1022
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
No.

1023
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,160
Philtrum, yeah! Philtrum heart gesture, philtrum.

1024
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,840
No.

1025
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,400
Suddenly remembered, what else is there?

1026
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
There's also the upper lip.

1027
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,440
Can't speak.

1028
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,560
And...

1029
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,520
Above the person, philtrum.

1030
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,160
Dragon and phoenix.

1031
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,080
That's right.

1032
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,320
They've already pinched your philtrum.

1033
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,560
Hurry.

1034
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,120
Okay.

1035
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,200
How many characters?

1036
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,560
How many characters?

1037
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,320
This is "shoot".

1038
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Hou Yi shoots the sun.

1039
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,120
A thousand arrows pierce the heart.

1040
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,800
Hou Yi's ultimate move.

1041
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,840
Hou Yi's ultimate move.

1042
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,200
Very imaginative.

1043
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,280
One.

1044
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,840
Yes.

1045
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,400
One.

1046
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,040
Okay.

1047
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,520
Alright.

1048
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,600
One.

1049
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,400
Hit with a single shot.

1050
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,000
One strike, one hit.

1051
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,520
Breathe one's last.

1052
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,480
Hit two targets with one shot

1053
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,360
Kill two birds with one stone

1054
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,080
Getting close

1055
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,080
Extremely close

1056
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,640
Shoot two hawks with one arrow

1057
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,800
Okay

1058
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,840
Quick

1059
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
No rush, don't panic

1060
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,400
I'm anxious

1061
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,880
Don't panic

1062
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,080
This one's a bit hard

1063
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,560
Alright

1064
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,880
This is way too difficult

1065
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,040
Four characters

1066
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,880
First character

1067
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,920
Playing golf

1068
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,960
This is slapping

1069
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,920
You're a real pro

1070
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,440
They're about to start fighting

1071
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,760
Okay, second one

1072
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,040
Alright

1073
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,720
This

1074
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,400
It's acupoint pressing

1075
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,880
I have a fever

1076
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,920
Wiping sweat

1077
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,480
That's right

1078
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,240
Second character: sweat

1079
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,040
One

1080
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,080
One

1081
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,240
This

1082
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:38,800
This one

1083
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,400
Fan sweat

1084
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,720
It has nothing to do with sweat

1085
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,720
Forget about sweat entirely

1086
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,240
Compare the scenario

1087
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,760
Like this

1088
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,520
Four

1089
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,800
I'm a little scared

1090
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,240
This is

1091
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,000
That one

1092
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,400
Sweat

1093
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,880
Welded shut

1094
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,400
Very imaginative

1095
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,480
He can't see

1096
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,360
Your pose is really difficult

1097
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
Our pose is a bit ambiguous

1098
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,440
It's fine

1099
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,360
Okay

1100
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,000
Come on

1101
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,280
No

1102
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,600
Come

1103
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,120
Sweat

1104
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,600
Sweating buckets

1105
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,920
This is way too hard

1106
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,320
How did you guess "sweating buckets"?

1107
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,160
Umbrella, right?

1108
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,760
Bullet—let the bullet fly for a while

1109
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,040
It's almost time to hit, you know?

1110
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,400
Welcome, advanced player, please take a seat

1111
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,520
For the show's effect

1112
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,200
So, first place

1113
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,000
Congratulations to the winner

1114
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,120
Congrats

1115
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,760
Naiwen and Xingxu

1116
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,320
Six people need to go in and vote this round

1117
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,120
Which of you should be the team leader?

1118
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,480
I think Xingxu is great

1119
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,680
Awesome

1120
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
It's him

1121
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
His understanding of each word

1122
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,640
Including expressing it with gestures

1123
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,640
Is spot on

1124
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,080
I believe

1125
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,480
Everyone here

1126
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,840
As long as he makes a gesture

1127
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,040
Everyone can guess it

1128
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,920
That's Xingxu

1129
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,760
That's Xingxu

1130
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,200
Bro, you do it

1131
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,640
Sure

1132
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,360
You do it

1133
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,560
I think I can be the team leader

1134
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,120
He finally became the team leader

1135
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,760
Finally, from washing socks

1136
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,400
Sock worker

1137
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,040
Suddenly promoted to team leader

1138
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,760
Feels great.

1139
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,040
That's what I think.

1140
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,160
You've got that captain vibe now.

1141
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,080
Bro, you choose.

1142
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:08,760
Show us your cool side.

1143
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,960
Let us see how cool you are.

1144
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,600
If six people go in,

1145
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,760
it's best

1146
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,480
to leave those two undercover

1147
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,800
outside.

1148
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,200
Excuse me, teacher,

1149
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,720
how can we achieve this?

1150
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,240
You be the vice captain.

1151
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,120
And then?

1152
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,720
Yuning can also be vice captain.

1153
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,760
Two vice captains.

1154
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,600
Then let's analyze together.

1155
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,680
Is that okay?

1156
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,120
So you couldn't figure it out yourself.

1157
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,200
Let the two vice captains analyze it.

1158
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,400
If I go with my logic,

1159
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,400
then I definitely have to go in.

1160
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,920
I'm definitely going in.

1161
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,960
So who do you think is good, bro?

1162
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,440
I think Xingxu is good.

1163
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,800
Why?

1164
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,040
I think he’s

1165
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,920
normal.

1166
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,040
This isn’t a normal game, bro.

1167
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,800
It’s about voting.

1168
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,360
If he were undercover,

1169
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,160
he wouldn’t act like this.

1170
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,320
When he came out and we asked him to talk, he

1171
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,560
didn’t even want to speak.

1172
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:09,760
He said

1173
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,440
his throat.

1174
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,160
Then later he became unusually active.

1175
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,480
Yeah.

1176
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,240
Anyway, it’s my first time playing this game.

1177
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,640
I’m just going with my gut.

1178
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,880
Because Xingxu is just

1179
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,200
way too normal, you know?

1180
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
You can’t defend anyone.

1181
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,640
If you defend someone, you’re suspicious.

1182
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,160
Imagine if you were

1183
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,680
the bad guy,

1184
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,400
what would you do?

1185
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,440
Which two do you think are bad?

1186
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,560
Captain, what’s your reasoning?

1187
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,720
I suspected her from the start.

1188
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,240
Just based on that.

1189
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,880
So whoever the captain says, that’s it?

1190
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,360
No.

1191
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,480
Then it’s you.

1192
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,280
Then it’s you.

1193
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,560
The captain says you.

1194
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,280
Sorry.

1195
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,000
If the captain says you, then it’s you.

1196
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,520
It’s me.

1197
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,800
Who’s the second one?

1198
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,720
The second.

1199
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:05,720
You guys say.

1200
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
We say.

1201
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,480
Vice captain, you say.

1202
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:09,840
It’s you.

1203
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,480
It’s me.

1204
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,120
I want to be the only vice captain.

1205
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,440
Okay.

1206
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:13,840
“Take him out.”

1207
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,120
Alright.

1208
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,520
So,

1209
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,360
The captain tells the vice captain to say

1210
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,360
The vice captain says it’s me.

1211
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,160
Then it’s me.

1212
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,760
How about that?

1213
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,680
This round,

1214
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,800
I’ll stay outside with her.

1215
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,200
Let’s play a round.

1216
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,400
Sure.

1217
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,720
Is it really this rash?

1218
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,160
That’s how bold it is.

1219
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,320
Actually, if you calm down,

1220
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,320
you’ll notice He is acting out today.

1221
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,760
He’s never acted like this before.

1222
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
I think we should leave Xingxu and He outside.

1223
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,760
Alright.

1224
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,520
Okay, sounds good.

1225
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,040
Why am I suddenly left outside?

1226
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,560
Six people going in is too risky.

1227
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
Let me say a couple words.

1228
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,480
Let me say something.

1229
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,800
Yeah.

1230
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,720
You say something.

1231
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,680
No matter what this round,

1232
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,280
I think it’s a loss.

1233
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,960
That’s right.

1234
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
So it doesn’t matter anymore.

1235
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,440
Yeah.

1236
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,160
If you don’t lose,

1237
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,440
you’ll never know who the undercover is.

1238
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,040
Right.

1239
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,000
Opponents have to vote.

1240
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,840
If you don’t vote, it’ll be too late.

1241
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,600
Okay.

1242
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,160
Then it’s He and Honglei.

1243
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,760
Alright.

1244
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,360
Stay.

1245
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,640
He and Honglei.

1246
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,440
Alright, the captain has chosen.

1247
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,600
The captain chose, go ahead.

1248
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,280
Go ahead.

1249
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,200
Can’t match.

1250
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,920
It’s me.

1251
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,800
Sorry, everyone.

1252
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,160
Just kidding, just joking.

1253
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,760
Good guys, you’re done.

1254
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,600
I should have already

1255
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,080
matched signals with my undercover partner.

1256
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,800
We're on the same team.

1257
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,520
What do you mean?

1258
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,080
What do you mean, "what do you mean"?

1259
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,680
What are you playing at?

1260
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,120
No, bro.

1261
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,800
Why don't you get it?

1262
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,560
You are...

1263
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,440
You are...

1264
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,640
You're the undercover, bro.

1265
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,640
What are you?

1266
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
We're both undercover.

1267
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,120
How come I didn't see you?

1268
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,200
What about you?

1269
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,080
Cross your arms.

1270
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,840
Why do I think it's Yuning?

1271
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,400
What if we get everyone wrong?

1272
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,520
If the two of us

1273
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,440
are in the same mission room,

1274
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,440
I'll mark an X.

1275
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,120
You just mark "good," that's enough.

1276
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,160
That way, only one of us is exposed.

1277
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,000
If I'm not mistaken,

1278
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,400
he'll draw a check.

1279
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,200
Then I'll draw an X.

1280
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,600
That's what we agreed on.

1281
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,440
It's the tacit understanding between "killers."

1282
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,240
I go forward, he holds back.

1283
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,840
I trust him a lot.

1284
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,560
I disagree.

1285
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,560
Good guys, you're done for.

1286
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,920
Goodbye.

1287
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,040
I'll leave this here on purpose.

1288
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,480
Leave a mark on purpose.

1289
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
This needs to be wiped clean.

1290
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,360
Otherwise,

1291
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,720
you can see the previous person's mark.

1292
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,360
Wipe it clean, really clean.

1293
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,760
Otherwise, it's too obvious.

1294
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,080
You two...

1295
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,080
What's with the look between you two?

1296
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,600
Why are you smiling so happily?

1297
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,160
What's so funny about this?

1298
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,560
Why are you so happy?

1299
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,880
Why are you so happy just voting?

1300
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,000
Did you make eye contact with your undercover partner?

1301
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,320
Xingxu, are you really a good guy or not?

1302
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,280
Of course I'm a good guy.

1303
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,480
Then why are you mumbling?

1304
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,800
Why are you making those faces?

1305
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,520
No, he can't be that dumb.

1306
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,360
If there's a secret signal...

1307
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,120
Alright, everyone.

1308
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,880
Let me announce something.

1309
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,720
The result of this round.

1310
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,480
We failed.

1311
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,440
Someone voted against.

1312
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,480
Just as expected.

1313
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,160
Next, we'll head to the next location.

1314
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,880
Let's do the final round.

1315
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,480
Let's go.

1316
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,760
Why did it go wrong as soon as you went in?

1317
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,080
Yeah.

1318
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,680
It failed right away.

1319
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,400
That's nonsense.

1320
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:01,840
Why?

1321
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,760
Why ask why?

1322
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,560
It's you.

1323
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,160
If you're going to be so unreasonable,

1324
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,200
and accuse people without logic,

1325
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,520
then you're suspicious.

1326
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,720
No, I'm not being unreasonable.

1327
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,480
I'm just asking you.

1328
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,400
So pretty.

1329
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Really beautiful.

1330
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,840
I want to buy it and take it home.

1331
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,480
Which one would you buy?

1332
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,400
It's too big.

1333
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,000
Put this at home?

1334
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,720
They're all nice.

1335
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,000
Just for a corner or something.

1336
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,080
Not saying you have to do anything special.

1337
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,720
If you get up in the middle of the night,

1338
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,200
it'd be scary.

1339
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,760
Just put it like that.

1340
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,800
Not somewhere you get up at night.

1341
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,680
Looks nice.

1342
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,320
Is this modern dance?

1343
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,640
I don't know, maybe.

1344
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,760
This is beautiful.

1345
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,640
But it's probably closed.

1346
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,160
No, maybe there's a show at night.

1347
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,040
A night performance.

1348
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,480
Should we go in and take a look?

1349
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,400
Let's go.

1350
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,480
Just take a look.

1351
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,360
Come on, let's join in.

1352
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,560
Honglei, come on.

1353
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,080
Like this, arm in arm.

1354
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,160
Okay.

1355
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,360
Look at me.

1356
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:21,640
Okay.

1357
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,160
Take a photo.

1358
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,440
Sit down.

1359
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,320
I'll sit down.

1360
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,600
Hello.

1361
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:43,720
Hello.

1362
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,720
Thank you so much.

1363
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,880
Thank you.

1364
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,840
Thank you very much.

1365
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,600
Thanks.

1366
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,840
Let's go.

1367
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,360
Goodbye.

1368
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,640
Thank you.

1369
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,240
Bye.

1370
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,920
They're so happy.

1371
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,160
This is really nice.

1372
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,760
Hello.

1373
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,040
We're from China.

1374
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,520
Thank you.

1375
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,320
Hello.

1376
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,560
Thanks.

1377
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,400
I love China.

1378
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,320
China is amazing.

1379
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,760
I love China.

1380
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,960
I've been to China twice.

1381
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,360
Thank you, I love Italy.

1382
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,320
I've got goosebumps.

1383
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:31,680
Really.

1384
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,800
So proud.

1385
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,480
Really proud.

1386
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,600
I really...

1387
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,720
Honglei.

1388
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,520
Quick, take a photo over there.

1389
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,160
Darn it.

1390
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,280
Got goosebumps.

1391
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,040
Seriously.

1392
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,160
The key is we met so many

1393
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,120
Italians who can say "hello" in Chinese.

1394
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,600
Really.

1395
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,520
I really...

1396
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,040
feel proud of my country.

1397
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,440
Honestly.

1398
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,480
This moment's

1399
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,720
national pride

1400
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,880
has reached its peak.

1401
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,280
I totally understand.

1402
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,840
Same here.

1403
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,240
Let's move forward a bit.

1404
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,040
Alright.

1405
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,000
I really feel

1406
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,000
grateful to our country.

1407
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,760
Really grateful.

1408
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,400
At this moment, being abroad,

1409
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,480
I found so many people love China.

1410
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,840
So many people shout "I love China."

1411
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,560
I truly feel

1412
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,960
I'm really emotional right now.

1413
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,600
But I feel so proud.

1414
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,120
Powerful.

1415
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:12,920
Right?

1416
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,840
What is true strength?

1417
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,400
I'm sure we all feel the same.

1418
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,200
So wonderful, so beautiful.

1419
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,280
Really.

1420
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,040
This moment is so rare, so random.

1421
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,720
So happy.

1422
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,760
Where should we take it? Here.

1423
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,400
We all can.

1424
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,520
Let's just take a selfie.

1425
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,080
Okay.

1426
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,560
We can put all the selfies together.

1427
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,400
Honglei, come here.

1428
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,760
Three, two, one.

1429
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,000
Why am I so suspicious of Didi?

1430
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,160
No.

1431
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,280
Why are you protecting Chen Xingxu? I don't get it.

1432
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,280
I think Xingxu is normal.

1433
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,880
No, he couldn't hold back his laughter many times.

1434
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,760
So beautiful.

1435
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,360
Beautiful, look.

1436
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,600
This is gorgeous.

1437
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,520
So pretty.

1438
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,560
That pier is stunning.

1439
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,360
That...

1440
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,800
It's all mussels up here.

1441
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,560
My brother.

1442
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,080
Look, so many little mussels.

1443
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,240
Bro.

1444
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,480
If they grow a bit more,

1445
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
I can eat them.

1446
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,120
You can see a really big fish here.

1447
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,640
See it?

1448
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,800
Can you see that dark shadow?

1449
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,680
Such a big fish, do you see it?

1450
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:44,680
Two.

1451
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,640
Several, do you see them?

1452
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,320
Did you see them?

1453
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,440
It's so beautiful.

1454
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,040
It's stunning.

1455
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,120
Where is this place?

1456
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,600
What is this place?

1457
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:41,960
So beautiful.

1458
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,920
Really.

1459
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,480
It's gorgeous.

1460
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,960
I took so many photos, they're amazing.

1461
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,400
Family business merger.

1462
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,800
It's not a one-person job.

1463
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,480
We all need to work together.

1464
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,640
Next, we'll do

1465
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,920
a teamwork challenge.

1466
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,560
Everyone, put on your headphones.

1467
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,600
The first person uses the melody they hear

1468
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,320
to sing the lyrics they see.

1469
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,880
And the second person listens.

1470
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,600
The last person

1471
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,760
guesses what song

1472
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,320
was played in the first person's headphones.

1473
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,480
Darn it.

1474
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,040
No, sorry.

1475
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,040
I didn't get it.

1476
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,680
So,

1477
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,880
I need to sing the song in my headphones?

1478
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:18,920
For example,

1479
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,560
you're supposed to pass on "Long Time No See,"

1480
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,280
but the lyrics you get are from "Little Apple."

1481
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,880
"You are my little, little apple,"

1482
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,560
"No matter how much I love you, it's never too much."

1483
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,160
That's how it works.

1484
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,560
That's hard to guess.

1485
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,120
Sounds fun.

1486
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,840
I can't even sing the original melody

1487
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,200
correctly sometimes.

1488
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,120
So the first person is crucial.

1489
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,040
Then we're doomed, bro.

1490
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,160
He's not good as the first.

1491
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,040
Gong Jun goes first.

1492
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,040
You go first.

1493
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,360
Him.

1494
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
He can do it.

1495
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,200
He can.

1496
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,200
This year's goal is to sing well.

1497
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:56,680
Alright.

1498
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,440
Become a singer.

1499
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,720
Gong Jun, the nightingale.

1500
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,440
I'm pretty accurate.

1501
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,840
You have to be the first.

1502
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,680
You're important.

1503
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,760
I'm accurate now.

1504
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,080
Okay.

1505
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,560
So Junjun goes first.

1506
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,840
Put Xingxu in the middle.

1507
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,120
That's like restarting.

1508
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,280
Let him guess the song at the end.

1509
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,640
No, he doesn't know many songs.

1510
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,480
His playlist isn't as big as ours.

1511
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,960
So I can't go anywhere, huh?

1512
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,920
Can I just hold up the lyrics?

1513
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,720
I think it's better to be at the front.

1514
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,280
Put Xingxu

1515
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:34,840
in the second spot.

1516
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,560
Xingxu, you're second.

1517
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,200
It's fine.

1518
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,400
Worst case, we just don't win.

1519
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,520
Are you the last one?

1520
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,360
I'm not the last.

1521
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,160
You should be last.

1522
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,560
No, I need to pass it on.

1523
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,400
Listen to me.

1524
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,120
Here's the logic:

1525
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,120
If he sings off-key,

1526
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,280
I can use a few notes

1527
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,560
to get him back on track.

1528
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,520
I play a correcting role.

1529
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,280
Correction role.

1530
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,760
I don't really like that example.

1531
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,600
Why?

1532
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,160
So I guess?

1533
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:03,920
No.

1534
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,640
He can't guess.

1535
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,840
Can't let

1536
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,280
Wenge guess.

1537
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,920
Are you sure you want me to guess?

1538
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,640
What?

1539
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,520
What's that?

1540
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,760
So, bro,

1541
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,680
you're last.

1542
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,200
Trust me.

1543
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,000
You're last.

1544
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,120
Let's try a round.

1545
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,200
Bro, you're after me.

1546
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,640
Let's try this lineup first, okay?

1547
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,240
Alright.

1548
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:20,920
If it doesn't work, we'll adjust.

1549
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,480
Let's do one round.

1550
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,280
Let's do a few rounds.

1551
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,920
The ace needs to be wild.

1552
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,760
The night in Ulaanbaatar

1553
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,520
is so quiet,

1554
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
so quiet,

1555
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:12,680
you can't even hear the wind.

1556
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,080
Not a sound.

1557
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,960
Clouds drifting toward the horizon,

1558
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,520
please move slowly.

1559
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,400
Okay.

1560
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,720
Awesome.

1561
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,080
Nice, very accurate.

1562
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,240
Darn it.

1563
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,960
Now the pressure's on me.

1564
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,520
Is it the same song passed down each time?

1565
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,240
What?

1566
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,160
Is it just one song passed along?

1567
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:48,640
What?

1568
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,680
Or does everyone change the song in the middle?

1569
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,120
What?

1570
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,120
What are you saying?

1571
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,520
Forget it, bro.

1572
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,040
Forget it.

1573
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,160
What?

1574
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:01,880
Darn it.

1575
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,240
Darn it.

1576
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,480
Me.

1577
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,560
Let me see.

1578
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,080
I see.

1579
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,240
All over the place.

1580
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,760
A sea of bitterness stirs up love and hate.

1581
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,520
Got it.

1582
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,280
Okay.

1583
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,520
As long as you know.

1584
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,360
Looks very confident.

1585
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,400
Seems like the result is good.

1586
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,600
They.

1587
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,200
Should be correct.

1588
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,520
How much love can start over?

1589
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,680
How many people are willing to wait?

1590
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,120
You know it from just one line.

1591
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,640
Alright.

1592
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,160
Wait for this chorus to finish.

1593
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,800
How much love can

1594
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,200
start over?

1595
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,320
How many people

1596
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,280
How much love can

1597
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,760
How much

1598
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,720
little love can

1599
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,200
Heavenly, moving voice.

1600
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,840
Heavenly, moving voice.

1601
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,480
And this one too, right?

1602
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,400
Darn it.

1603
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,480
What's wrong?

1604
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,200
Is the song finished?

1605
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,120
It's finished.

1606
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,040
I think it was sung very accurately.

1607
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,880
You're not even as good as Xingxu.

1608
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,840
Darn it.

1609
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,479
Darn it.

1610
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,240
Darn it.

1611
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,439
Hege is about to do a remix.

1612
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:34,760
How much

1613
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,359
This is a strange world.

1614
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:36,840
Sorry.

1615
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,640
Give me a moment to memorize it.

1616
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,720
It's just unfamiliar.

1617
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,760
How much love can

1618
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:45,800
Okay.

1619
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,120
Heavenly, moving voice.

1620
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:49,640
Okay, that's it.

1621
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:58,080
Is it my turn?

1622
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,439
Let me apologize first.

1623
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,520
Anyway, I feel like that side isn't quite right either.

1624
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,760
But I

1625
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,279
I'll try my best to copy for you

1626
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,479
everything I heard.

1627
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:10,960
Alright.

1628
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,720
Sorry, everyone.

1629
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,160
I really don't know how I sang.

1630
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,920
I feel like it's all correct.

1631
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:18,560
Here we go.

1632
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,240
You cried and told me

1633
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,720
in fairy tales

1634
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,600
it's all lies.

1635
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,840
It's all lies.

1636
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,920
Darn it.

1637
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,000
I can't be your

1638
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,680
prince.

1639
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:43,600
Heavenly, moving voice.

1640
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,120
That line wasn't there.

1641
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,600
Darn it.

1642
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,680
Brother.

1643
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,200
You might think I'm joking,

1644
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,720
but when the show airs,

1645
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,280
you'll see

1646
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,160
I copied her exactly.

1647
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,400
Heavenly music

1648
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,240
This doesn't affect me anymore

1649
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,160
You told me in tears

1650
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,760
In fairy tales

1651
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,360
It's all a lie

1652
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,680
Heavenly music

1653
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,880
Not this one

1654
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,760
Darn it

1655
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,400
Darn it

1656
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,280
Look how happy he is

1657
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,680
I knew it was over, seriously

1658
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:34,680
Sorry

1659
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,600
I don't think it matters who's after me

1660
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,520
Come on

1661
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:53,800
Okay

1662
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,600
Here we go

1663
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,400
Yuning

1664
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,720
I have no clue

1665
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,240
It's fine

1666
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,680
I can only

1667
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,640
copy it

1668
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,080
Okay

1669
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,000
You told me in tears

1670
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,120
Told me in tears

1671
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,120
How did it turn into rock?

1672
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,160
See, it's engraved in my heart

1673
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:12,480
Did you see that?

1674
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,400
Look over here

1675
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,040
Look over here

1676
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,400
Girl across, look over here

1677
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,280
Look over here

1678
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,520
This is killing me

1679
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,400
This is killing me

1680
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,600
There's even rap in this

1681
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,160
Look over here

1682
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,640
Darn it

1683
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:46,840
Got it

1684
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:47,960
Okay

1685
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,840
You got it

1686
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,480
No, he

1687
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,000
Did you understand?

1688
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,520
I don't care anymore

1689
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,200
I guess it's this one, here

1690
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,600
I'll just pass on what I heard

1691
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,480
My home is

1692
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,800
on the Songhua River in the northeast

1693
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,400
My home is

1694
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,040
on the Songhua River in the northeast

1695
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,600
There are fields of soybeans and sorghum everywhere

1696
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,080
Alright

1697
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,680
Soybeans and sorghum, my home

1698
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,680
is on the Songhua River in the northeast

1699
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,000
You're this one

1700
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You're this one

1701
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,560
You guessed it

1702
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,320
I don't know

1703
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,760
Impressive

1704
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,880
No wonder you're a singer

1705
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,760
No wonder you're a professional singer

1706
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
That's right

1707
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,720
He can sing it right

1708
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,840
It's all because you sing so well

1709
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,680
Yeah

1710
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,080
That's the one, right?

1711
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,120
Do you know what song it is?

1712
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:01,520
No idea

1713
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,040
I don't know this one

1714
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,480
He said wind and rain

1715
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
This little pain is nothing

1716
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,760
Wipe your tears, don't be afraid

1717
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,000
At least we still have dreams

1718
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,680
Still have dreams

1719
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,040
In the middle

1720
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,160
Now there's a Tianjin accent too

1721
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,320
Impressive.

1722
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,280
That's awesome.

1723
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,880
Come on, let's give ourselves a round of applause.

1724
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,320
Seriously.

1725
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,880
You're the best.

1726
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,280
You really nailed it.

1727
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,560
That was incredible.

1728
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,200
Spot on.

1729
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,000
Amazing.

1730
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,600
Have you heard "Monkey Brother" before?

1731
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,560
Monkey Brother, Monkey Brother.

1732
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,000
You're truly remarkable.

1733
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,320
Monkey Brother, this one.

1734
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,040
I haven't heard it.

1735
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,600
I really haven't heard the song.

1736
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,960
No, let me tell you.

1737
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,000
Actually, Brother Honglei

1738
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,080
passed it on very accurately.

1739
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,560
Wait a moment.

1740
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,240
Hold on, let

1741
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,360
Ning, it's not this song.

1742
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,200
Not this one.

1743
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,000
Didn't you notice?

1744
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,480
It's not this song.

1745
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:32,920
What's this?

1746
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,880
Liu Yuning only heard two lines.

1747
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,160
Isn't it this one?

1748
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:38,840
I'm telling you.

1749
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,000
Xingxu.

1750
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,880
Just two words.

1751
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,880
I already know what it is.

1752
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,480
Put on your headphones and sing.

1753
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,640
Let us guess.

1754
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,160
If...

1755
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,680
Before night falls.

1756
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,120
Sea of bitterness.

1757
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,000
There's still time.

1758
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,480
I remember now.

1759
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,720
This beautiful melody.

1760
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,600
Then it's my turn.

1761
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,360
Come on, it's my turn, friends.

1762
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,600
I want to forget your eyes.

1763
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,760
For a lifetime.

1764
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,080
Beautiful melody.

1765
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:20,800
Don't say it.

1766
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,920
They're all related to Sun Wukong.

1767
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,480
That's true.

1768
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,280
Monkey Brother, Monkey Brother.

1769
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,480
It really is.

1770
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,640
What about Fairy Zixia?

1771
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,560
Seriously.

1772
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,120
It's not easy for us to find Monkey Brother here.

1773
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,280
It's not easy.

1774
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,280
The theme hasn't changed.

1775
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,680
Going on a pilgrimage.

1776
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,320
I don't want to go after Chen He.

1777
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,840
I'll go.

1778
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,880
I'll sit next to Brother He.

1779
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,160
I think Ning should be here.

1780
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,240
Just let He go over there.

1781
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,400
I think I'm really good at guessing songs.

1782
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,000
I should be the last one.

1783
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,400
Alright then.

1784
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,000
Brother He, come over here.

1785
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,040
Brother He is next to me.

1786
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,480
Let me tell you.

1787
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,640
There's just one of me missing between you two.

1788
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,400
Are you sure you understand what I'm singing?

1789
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,720
I don't care if you do.

1790
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,040
I'll help you remix it.

1791
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:18,800
Come on.

1792
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,880
I should cooperate with your performance.

1793
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,560
But I can't see.

1794
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,760
As someone who loves you most.

1795
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,000
Improv performance.

1796
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,720
When did we

1797
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,440
start to hold back?

1798
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,720
Give it to me.

1799
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,520
Corresponding.

1800
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,160
Change.

1801
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,400
Watching those clumsy performances.

1802
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,280
I should cooperate with your act.

1803
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,760
But I act

1804
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,680
Changed the key.

1805
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:18,840
Is that okay?

1806
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,120
Feels like a year has passed.

1807
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,840
Are we already in the next round?

1808
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,120
Did I miss it, right?

1809
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,720
Is it really that hard?

1810
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,480
I'll go along with your act.

1811
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,720
But I pretend not to see.

1812
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:43,200
As someone who loves you most.

1813
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,800
Improv performance.

1814
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,280
When did we

1815
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:49,640
Got it, right?

1816
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,320
Put it on first.

1817
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,320
Put it on first.

1818
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:54,960
I've been waiting a long time.

1819
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,400
I'm begging you.

1820
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,080
Put it on first.

1821
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,080
I've always looked forward to this

1822
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:11,720
working with you

1823
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,040
Really, I'm excited

1824
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:14,520
I feel like we haven't

1825
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,320
You're like the comfort

1826
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,240
of curling up in a blanket

1827
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,040
but also

1828
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,200
committing every sin

1829
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,000
like the wind, impossible to catch

1830
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,680
you

1831
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,040
like the lingering scent

1832
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,360
of perfume on my wrist

1833
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,080
like a beloved

1834
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,360
pair of red high heels

1835
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,120
Anyway, that's the idea

1836
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:46,640
Pretty much

1837
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,160
You're like me in a

1838
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,360
blanket

1839
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,240
I get it

1840
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,840
You're amazing

1841
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,760
Yeah

1842
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,600
Exactly

1843
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,480
Right?

1844
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,600
Isn't it?

1845
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,120
This is a bit tricky

1846
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,280
That's right

1847
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,400
It's okay, you don't have to

1848
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,280
feel embarrassed with me

1849
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,880
Even if I try harder

1850
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,440
I want to sing it again

1851
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,240
Okay, got it

1852
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,320
He can do it

1853
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,920
He's really good

1854
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:07,040
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1855
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,080
I praised you for nothing

1856
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,680
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1857
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,440
I've seen the ocean

1858
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:24,600
Wait a second

1859
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,520
Put it back on

1860
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,640
Put it back on

1861
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,400
It's really a bit hard

1862
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,120
Come on

1863
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:38,560
Okay

1864
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,560
Alright

1865
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:40,880
Come

1866
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,600
Come, hurry up

1867
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,560
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1868
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,960
I've seen the ocean

1869
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:02,520
No

1870
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,560
Put it back on

1871
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,160
Don't

1872
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,320
Put it back on

1873
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,120
Can you give him another chance?

1874
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,360
Put it back on

1875
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,640
Put it back on

1876
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,480
Okay, try again

1877
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,320
Put it down first

1878
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,000
Calm down

1879
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,160
Look at my expression

1880
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,520
I'm not saying anything

1881
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,520
Look at my face

1882
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,000
Let me try

1883
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,280
Yes, I know

1884
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,240
I know that song

1885
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,880
You know that song

1886
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,240
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1887
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:33,680
No

1888
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,760
I've seen the ocean kiss a shark

1889
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,720
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1890
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,240
I've seen the ocean kiss a shark

1891
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:48,680
You can go

1892
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,600
Go for it

1893
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,320
I've seen dusk chase the dawn

1894
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,760
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1895
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,400
I've seen the ocean kiss a shark

1896
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,840
I've seen dusk chase the dawn

1897
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,840
But I've never seen you

1898
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,440
I've seen rain pour in the desert

1899
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,280
I've seen the ocean kiss a shark

1900
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,040
I've seen dusk chase the dawn

1901
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,800
But I've never seen you

1902
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
Never seen you

1903
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,760
You've seen so much, really

1904
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,120
It's not bad

1905
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,000
It's okay

1906
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,840
Can I hear it one more time?

1907
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,600
Because I believe

1908
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,920
I just remember the melody

1909
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,760
and pass it to him

1910
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,920
But I don't know what song it is

1911
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,160
I've forgotten what song it is

1912
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,080
Wait

1913
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,000
You can sing this song, right?

1914
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,520
Yes

1915
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,040
That's fine

1916
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,080
I...

1917
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,560
I've seen rain pour down in the desert,

1918
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,840
seen the ocean kiss a shark,

1919
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,640
watched dusk chase after dawn,

1920
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,640
but I've never seen you.

1921
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,840
Every line in a different key.

1922
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,200
This song starts in C.

1923
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,240
Then it shifts to D.

1924
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,360
Then switches to G.

1925
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,600
And then moves to F.

1926
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,400
I've memorized it all anyway.

1927
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,640
It's catchy.

1928
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,200
It's pretty nice.

1929
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,640
I've seen rain pour down in the desert,

1930
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,040
I've seen the ocean kiss a shark,

1931
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,360
Haven't you heard it?

1932
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,720
It's really familiar.

1933
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,120
Is it "The Ocean and the Fish"?

1934
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,160
Okay.

1935
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:52,880
"The Ocean and the Fish."

1936
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:53,880
Not bad.

1937
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,160
Not bad.

1938
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:55,520
Not bad.

1939
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,000
I've kind of forgotten what I was singing.

1940
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,400
Kiss a shark.

1941
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,400
Stop searching.

1942
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,360
Stop searching in your head.

1943
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:15,800
You won't find it.

1944
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,640
Just copy it.

1945
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,120
Come on.

1946
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,920
It's my turn, right?

1947
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,120
I trust you.

1948
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,160
I think Yun Ning is ahead of me.

1949
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:25,640
I feel confident.

1950
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:26,200
Bro.

1951
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,680
I haven't learned it either.

1952
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,000
I don't even know what song it is.

1953
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,480
You'll find out soon.

1954
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,720
I'm so talented.

1955
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,400
Sitting next to you.

1956
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,080
Even Yun Ning can't save this song.

1957
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,160
Yun Ning.

1958
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,320
I can only copy theirs.

1959
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,560
No, take it down first.

1960
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,200
You say, bro,

1961
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,240
do you know what your predecessor

1962
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,120
sang?

1963
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,160
Stable and calm.

1964
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,680
It's fine.

1965
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,520
You've got me, you've got bro.

1966
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:03,040
Two people shining together.

1967
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,400
Our light outshines the stars at night.

1968
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,520
I cross mountains for you,

1969
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,520
but don't care about the scenery.

1970
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,600
Scenery.

1971
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,840
That's how I sang it just now.

1972
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,640
No.

1973
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,120
He sang it.

1974
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,040
Not as good as you.

1975
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,520
You won.

1976
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,760
Do you know why?

1977
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,800
Because you sang it more smoothly than him.

1978
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,040
Especially that line, "kiss a shark."

1979
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:36,920
Right?

1980
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,960
I really like it.

1981
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,480
He sang it a bit hesitantly.

1982
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,040
There was hesitation.

1983
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:40,480
Right?

1984
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:41,760
He got scared.

1985
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,720
Alright, come on.

1986
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,360
Try again.

1987
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,920
Two people shining together.

1988
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,200
Our light outshines the stars at night.

1989
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,680
I cross mountains for you,

1990
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,360
but don't care about the scenery.

1991
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,840
I lost confidence singing it.

1992
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,360
So-so.

1993
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,320
What's going on?

1994
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:02,720
So-so.

1995
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,280
By the end, I had no confidence left.

1996
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,920
I've never heard a song this bad.

1997
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,000
I think it's nice.

1998
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,160
Kiss a shark.

1999
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,960
I just like that line.

2000
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,240
Isn't it good?

2001
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,120
Release a song.

2002
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,800
Let's make a song called "Kiss a Shark" for Jun Jun.

2003
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:21,800
How about it?

2004
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,680
Our theme song.

2005
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,240
"Earth Super Fresh."

2006
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,840
The theme song is called "Kiss a Shark."

2007
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,320
Got it.

2008
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:37,920
Okay.

2009
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,520
He guessed it.

2010
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,240
Is it this song?

2011
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,880
How could I bear to let you make a mistake?

2012
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,760
He guessed it.

2013
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,360
He guessed it.

2014
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:48,880
He guessed it.

2015
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,760
Did I just sing this song?

2016
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,360
Is it this song?

2017
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,320
No.

2018
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,080
I was mainly listening to you sing.

2019
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,400
I forgot what I sang.

2020
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,440
Because what you just sang

2021
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,600
took up all my

2022
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,880
How could I bear to let you make a mistake?

2023
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,960
For no reason, I just like you.

2024
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,840
Deeply.

2025
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,840
Fell in love with you.

2026
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,080
No reason.

2027
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,840
This song is different from the one before.

2028
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,720
No kissing sharks.

2029
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,360
For no reason, I just like you.

2030
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,160
Is it this one?

2031
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,000
Yes.

2032
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,880
Very good.

2033
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,680
That's about it.

2034
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,160
Come on.

2035
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,960
Who married the sentimental one?

2036
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,160
Who? Wait a second.

2037
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,720
Who married the sentimental one?

2038
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,480
A quiet summer.

2039
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,120
Really.

2040
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,480
Seriously?

2041
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:18,360
Wrong.

2042
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,000
Is her pitch accurate?

2043
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,440
Anyway, what Yuning conveyed to me

2044
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,680
I couldn't tell at all.

2045
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,800
Yes, my original voice, just

2046
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,920
Copied to him without missing a single note.

2047
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,240
You choose.

2048
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,120
Who do you want to hear sing?

2049
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,200
Jun Jun's.

2050
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,480
The problem is actually with him.

2051
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,520
Come on, go back.

2052
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,680
Go back to "kissing sharks."

2053
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,040
I've seen rain pour in the desert.

2054
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:51,000
I've seen the sea kiss a shark.

2055
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,600
I've seen dusk chase the dawn.

2056
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,240
But I've never seen you.

2057
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,360
I've seen it.

2058
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,280
Made a mistake.

2059
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,000
Is it "Too Much Love"?

2060
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:15,560
Yes.

2061
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,000
You made a mistake.

2062
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,040
That's the song I sang.

2063
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:19,480
Wrong.

2064
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:20,320
Not this one.

2065
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,680
The problem isn't "Too Much Love."

2066
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,400
It's not "Too Much Love," it's "Too Much."

2067
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:24,720
Which song?

2068
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,200
How could I blame you for making a mistake?

2069
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,120
My brain's not working.

2070
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:31,840
What's wrong with you?

2071
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:33,320
What's wrong with me?

2072
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,760
I can't take it.

2073
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,840
All I can think about is "kissing sharks."

2074
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,040
Bro, how did you sing it just now?

2075
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:40,960
I want to hear He Ge.

2076
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,840
The root of the problem must be with He Ge.

2077
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,000
It's okay, you

2078
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,240
don't have to feel guilty toward me.

2079
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,600
Maybe I actually like it.

2080
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,360
You try so hard to make it up.

2081
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,600
No matter how hard I try,

2082
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,160
to fall in love with someone else,

2083
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,360
I could hear all of that.

2084
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,920
In the end, it's still "kissing sharks."

2085
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,600
"You Make Me Drunk"

2086
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,920
"You Make Me Drunk"

2087
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,680
These two songs really sound alike.

2088
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,680
How could I blame you for making a mistake?

2089
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,160
You make me drunk.

2090
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,360
They're not related at all.

2091
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,520
But they're really similar.

2092
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,960
I've confused myself.

2093
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,840
They're nothing alike.

2094
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,520
Mistakes and getting drunk.

2095
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,560
Jun, you're really talented.

2096
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,080
Okay.

2097
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,000
You could write lyrics and compose now.

2098
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,200
Not bad.

2099
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,000
You wrote a song.

2100
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,640
Whose lyrics are these? Did you buy them?

2101
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,560
When you release this song,

2102
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,200
can you let me sing one line?

2103
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,640
You always repeat the chorus twice.

2104
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,040
Right?

2105
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,120
Yes.

2106
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,000
Can I sing the first chorus?

2107
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:50,680
Just let me enjoy it.

2108
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:53,880
How about this?

2109
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,600
It's our last round.

2110
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,240
Everyone together.

2111
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:56,960
Kiss the Shark.

2112
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,680
Let's sing together.

2113
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:58,840
Thank you all.

2114
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,320
Sure.

2115
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,680
I'm sweating.

2116
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,040
This key change is really complicated.

2117
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:08,560
It's hard to sing.

2118
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,760
I've seen rain in the desert.

2119
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,840
I've seen kissing sharks.

2120
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,160
Kiss the Shark.

2121
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,400
Chasing the dawn.

2122
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,120
But I've never seen you.

2123
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,040
Your fans already learned it.

2124
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,920
These fans are awesome.

2125
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,040
Come on.

2126
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,680
I've seen rain in the desert.

2127
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,800
I've seen the sea kiss the shark.

2128
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,520
I've seen dusk chase the dawn.

2129
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,440
But I've never seen you.

2130
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,760
Amazing.

2131
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,000
It's really hard.

2132
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,560
All I can think about is Kiss the Shark.

2133
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:54,640
Stop talking.

2134
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,440
Before the final vote,

2135
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,320
let's taste some food first.

2136
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,280
This restaurant

2137
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,880
uses fresh local ingredients from Sicily.

2138
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,120
It perfectly showcases Sicily's

2139
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,360
unique cuisine.

2140
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,480
Including truffles picked directly from Mount Etna

2141
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,800
and the Iblei Forest,

2142
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,560
as well as mushrooms.

2143
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,760
It's really delicious.

2144
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,080
Really tasty.

2145
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:26,520
Delicious.

2146
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,040
Especially tasty.

2147
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:32,880
This bread.

2148
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,520
Do you want to try one?

2149
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,320
Yes.

2150
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:35,760
This one.

2151
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,040
This bread is really

2152
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,160
This bread is really

2153
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:48,760
delicious.

2154
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,520
This bread is so good.

2155
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,640
It's pretty tasty.

2156
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,640
I think it's delicious too.

2157
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:54,960
So tasty.

2158
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,360
Super delicious.

2159
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,160
He almost wanted to lick the plate clean.

2160
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,000
He finished everything on his plate.

2161
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,760
Since 2023 until now,

2162
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,000
I haven't eaten anything this delicious.

2163
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,240
It's so embarrassing.

2164
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,560
Mainly, he's a fitness guy.

2165
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,320
I can eat the same meal plan for two months straight.

2166
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,280
For two months,

2167
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,640
I eat exactly the same food.

2168
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,000
His food is really bad.

2169
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,160
Yeah, she's tried it.

2170
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,480
He uses the air fryer every day

2171
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,040
to fry all sorts of things.

2172
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,320
Low-fat stuff.

2173
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,520
It's especially bad.

2174
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,800
Then at night, I say I'm hungry.

2175
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,520
He gave me a protein bar, which tasted even worse.

2176
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,720
Protein bar.

2177
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,080
What I remember most

2178
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,880
is Pompeii.

2179
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:54,960
That Roman restaurant.

2180
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,080
I want to know what it is.

2181
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,840
It was great, really tasty.

2182
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,560
They were stingy with that drink.

2183
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,880
They didn't save any for you.

2184
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,920
I didn't get to try it.

2185
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,160
You could tell he was disappointed.

2186
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,840
He Ge,

2187
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,920
do you want some?

2188
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,240
Hurry, bring it over.

2189
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,400
And this too, He Ge.

2190
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,880
Bro.

2191
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,480
Here.

2192
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,000
Bro.

2193
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,200
Bro.

2194
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,080
This is delicious.

2195
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,200
Only by sitting next to He Ge

2196
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,040
can you see how strong his desire for food is.

2197
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,720
His eyes look like a cheetah's.

2198
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,320
For dinner, we saved

2199
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,920
the restaurant's most famous chef's dessert.

2200
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,720
The winning team

2201
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,080
gets to taste it.

2202
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,080
Five people need to go in and vote this round.

2203
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,320
And the winning team

2204
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,840
will get to eat the dessert.

2205
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,400
So this round decides

2206
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,000
whether we tell the chef

2207
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,560
to make two desserts

2208
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,560
or six desserts.

2209
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,560
I hope those two "bad guys"

2210
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,080
will step forward themselves.

2211
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,520
Then we'll give you a bite.

2212
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,240
Otherwise, eight of us will fight over two portions.

2213
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,480
You probably won't get any.

2214
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:21,960
Yeah.

2215
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,000
Okay.

2216
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,680
The one I trust most right now

2217
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,600
is the head chef here.

2218
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,240
Reliable.

2219
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,880
I hope this chef

2220
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,040
can help me pick those two people.

2221
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,720
Thank you.

2222
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,160
I will follow the chef unconditionally.

2223
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:44,880
Chef.

2224
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,480
I suspect Wen.

2225
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,480
It's really not me, bro.

2226
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,920
So who are the "two wolves" in your mind?

2227
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,280
One is me, who's the other?

2228
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:00,960
Naiwen Ge seems like one.

2229
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:01,640
Naiwen Ge seems like one.

2230
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,640
I suspect Didi.

2231
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,040
And Xingxu.

2232
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,040
Let's just vote.

2233
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,040
Honglei Ge, I guess.

2234
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,640
Honglei Ge.

2235
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,480
I pick Honglei Ge.

2236
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:28,920
Three votes.

2237
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,120
I also pick Honglei Ge. Four votes.

2238
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,040
The four who voted for Honglei Ge

2239
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,920
are also suspicious, I think.

2240
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,080
I still want to vote for Junjun.

2241
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,520
Because to me, his status is the highest.

2242
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,360
I pick Didi.

2243
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,760
I pick Didi.

2244
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,720
I pick myself.

2245
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,720
The last round's captain is Honglei Ge.

2246
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:47,200
Xingxu.

2247
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,320
Pick four more teammates for me.

2248
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,720
I'll pick you first.

2249
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,680
Xingxu is feeling dizzy from the carbon.

2250
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,360
I really can't guarantee anything.

2251
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,480
I'm really dizzy right now.

2252
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,280
So that's one of my teammates.

2253
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:06,840
Second one.

2254
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,200
Naiwen,

2255
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,640
Do you want to join this team?

2256
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,320
I do.

2257
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,520
Pick two more for me.

2258
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:22,880
Jun Jun.

2259
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,400
Yu Wen, I guess.

2260
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,320
Yu Wen.

2261
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,480
I'm in.

2262
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,840
So we've formed a team.

2263
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,440
One, two, three, four, five.

2264
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,240
Five of us are in the team.

2265
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,080
Risky, very risky.

2266
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,480
A bit risky.

2267
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,440
Think again.

2268
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,320
What about Xingxu?

2269
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,040
What?

2270
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:43,760
Cast the final vote.

2271
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,240
Yu Wen and He Ge.

2272
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,440
I think Yu Wen.

2273
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,160
You choose Yu Wen as your teammate.

2274
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:49,760
Yes.

2275
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,600
I'm telling you, you can't leave me out.

2276
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,040
Let's just vote.

2277
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,240
Everyone knows about me.

2278
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,640
No need to say it.

2279
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,360
Sorry.

2280
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,640
Enjoy your desserts.

2281
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,960
Even though I'm the undercover,

2282
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,360
but

2283
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,600
I won't order for you.

2284
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,600
Was my wolf teammate inside just now?

2285
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,720
He drew an X, right?

2286
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,080
No one is allowed to speak.

2287
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:27,960
Naiwen.

2288
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:28,920
Do you think our choices now

2289
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:29,760
are correct?

2290
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:30,720
I don't know.

2291
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,320
You were showing off inside just now.

2292
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,320
As a non-supporter,

2293
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:35,400
you still blended into this team.

2294
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,920
And you still don't know

2295
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,920
if we picked the right teammates.

2296
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:39,880
No idea.

2297
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,600
But I feel like we're likely to lose.

2298
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,080
You think we've already lost?

2299
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:43,640
Pretty likely.

2300
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,760
If we all win,

2301
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,440
it would be awesome.

2302
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,760
He's definitely not it.

2303
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:55,840
Naiwen isn't.

2304
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,120
Absolutely.

2305
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,000
For sure.

2306
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,800
I'm an old pro at this.

2307
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,400
Yeah.

2308
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,840
Xingxu.

2309
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:08,840
Come on.

2310
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,040
Really looking forward to the answer.

2311
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:10,480
Let's go.

2312
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,280
Will two people enjoy the chef's dessert,

2313
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,920
or will six people enjoy the chef's dessert?

2314
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,480
Prepare two desserts.

2315
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:24,880
That's amazing.

2316
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:28,800
Naiwen.

2317
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,760
Shall we stand up?

2318
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,520
We're both on board.

2319
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,280
Sorry.

2320
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,480
When Xingxu pointed at Naiwen just now,

2321
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,440
I was sure it wasn't him.

2322
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,480
At that moment, I really couldn't hold it in.

2323
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,960
I have just one question.

2324
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:00,240
The check mark on the front of my card,

2325
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,440
was that left there on purpose?

2326
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,320
Yes.

2327
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,440
I left it there on purpose.

2328
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,080
It was me.

2329
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,160
Left it dirty on purpose.

2330
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,840
Left a little check mark.

2331
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,760
This needs to be cleaned.

2332
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,000
Just now, the two of us were

2333
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:24,920
on the way here.

2334
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,440
He said, "I have some outside info."

2335
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,600
I wasn't sure if I should mention it.

2336
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,520
There's a loophole in the middle.

2337
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,520
Just not sure if I can say it.

2338
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,680
Would this be misleading?

2339
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,200
What loophole do you mean?

2340
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,280
It's not a loophole.

2341
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,480
It's about whether it's misleading.

2342
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,200
Should we go in and take a look?

2343
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,360
I think that's what he wanted to say.

2344
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,160
Yeah.

2345
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,520
I thought I was being kind.

2346
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,880
I said, "Give this thing..."

2347
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,560
If he had said it, I would've burst out laughing.

2348
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,120
I think

2349
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:47,960
I'm still too naive.

2350
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,040
I think Naiwen and Yuwen

2351
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,960
played really well.

2352
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,520
Here, two desserts for the winners.

2353
01:40:59,240 --> 01:40:59,960
Thank you.

2354
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,240
I've decided to give this dessert to Didi.

2355
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,880
I've decided to give this dessert to Junjun.

2356
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,240
I was just like a "fool."

2357
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,200
Didn't guess a single one right.

2358
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,600
Congrats to the two who opposed the family merger.

2359
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,720
You win the dessert reward.

2360
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,560
Whether the family's businesses merge or stay separate,

2361
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,480
our feelings

2362
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,760
will always remain.

2363
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,280
Goodbye.

2364
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,600
Malèna

2365
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,400
We'll unlock even more.

2366
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:32,040
Let's go.

2367
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:32,800
Time to sleep.

2368
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,440
Yes.

2369
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,040
Our first task today

2370
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Make a heart gesture

2371
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,160
You do it with me

2372
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,800
Switch hands, switch hands

2373
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,880
Aren't we supposed to be different?

2374
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,800
Try acting cute

2375
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,440
Xingxu is on the subway

2376
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,960
Walking in that little alley

2377
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,000
It's always been like this

2378
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,200
In the Earth Family

2379
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,920
Who sings the best?

2380
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,080
Liu Yuning

2381
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,960
Gong Jun

2382
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:03,760
In the Earth Family

2383
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,360
Who is the sexiest man?

2384
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,280
That's too much

2385
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,440
We have to drag him into this

2386
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,680
You two have no shame

2387
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,960
Who will do a move for me?

2388
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:12,800
I'll give you a hundred

2389
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,360
What do you take us for?

2390
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,080
I'll do one, I'll do one

2391
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,360
Bro, I'll do it, let me

2392
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,400
Let me do it

2393
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,320
I want to do one, let me do one

2394
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,000
Naiwen

2395
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:21,760
Naiwen

2396
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,160
Naiwen is so handsome

2397
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,360
This group is crazy

2398
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,400
Hello

2399
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,080
Hello

2400
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:27,840
China

2401
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,800
We really enjoy this place

2402
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,000
Living here feels like

2403
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,960
I don't want this show to end

2404
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,320
I'm so happy

2405
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,640
Shark, drink first, bottoms up

2406
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,960
A toast to the most handsome in our group

2407
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:43,000
The best singer and the best at games

2408
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,920
I'm really happy to join this show

2409
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,320
Really happy

2410
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,200
We really vibe well together

2411
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:49,760
I just saw Gong Jun's eyes getting watery

2412
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,880
Not watery

2413
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,240
Yes, they are

2414
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,040
No

2415
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,000
He's holding back

2416
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,640
No

2417
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,600
Alright then

2418
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,080
I'll go first

2419
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,720
What are you doing?

2420
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,720
A cup also means a lifetime

2421
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,200
Right, bro?

2422
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,760
Isn't this what you like?

2423
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,080
So annoying

2424
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,480
Starting off so intense?

2425
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,040
That's how Jun is

2426
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,800
I just didn't expect to meet

2427
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,440
Someone I click with so well

2428
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,960
What is this? What kind of show is this?

2429
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,000
You just have to make me cry

2430
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:22,640
Come on

2431
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:25,880
Welcome everyone to

2432
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,520
Passionate Spain

2433
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,480
Let's give a big hand to Jin Jing and Lin Yi

2434
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,400
Jin Jing, change your surname

2435
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:32,920
Surname Leng

2436
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:34,480
Calm down

2437
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,200
Lin Yi, you got set up

2438
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,600
These two legs and those two legs

2439
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,480
Two pairs of chopsticks

2440
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:48,600
Two compasses

2441
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,400
How do you do this?

2442
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,800
Come on, ready, go

2443
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,960
I’m already like this, so of course I’ll eat a lot

2444
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:57,480
Of course

2445
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,360
Are you deciding not to talk?

2446
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,400
I’m embarrassed

2447
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,400
I’m Li Naiwen

2448
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,000
Do you think this has oxtail?

2449
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,040
There’s ham here

2450
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,080
Here it comes

2451
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:08,920
Hello, friend

2452
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:09,520
Don’t scare him

2453
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,760
Hello, friend

2454
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,920
Dash over, take a quick step

2455
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,360
Hello, friend

2456
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,080
You describe it

2457
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,280
Which Northeastern dish is this again?

2458
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,360
Garlic-mixed smashed cucumber kept in the fridge

2459
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,640
Add some vinegar, then the taste after a night

2460
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,560
Tastes good

2461
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,920
Serve the dish

2462
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,240
Zero points

2463
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,200
Zero points

2464
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,640
Zero points

2465
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,680
This could get eight points

2466
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,280
Nine points

2467
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,160
The move is just to make it hard for others

2468
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,000
You have to bend your finger at this angle

2469
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,720
Let him win, let him win

2470
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,320
Three, two, one, spin the thread

2471
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,640
It hurts for everyone, sorry

2472
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:45,920
Spinning the thread, I saw it go in

2473
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,800
I’m still watching the show

2474
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,440
I’m still here

2475
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,920
You two aren’t joining in, right?

2476
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,080
I know why now

2477
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,320
From this angle, we’re the audience

2478
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,200
We can do it

2479
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,080
Bend your finger

2480
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:54,720
Squat down

2481
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,520
Dear audience

2482
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,480
We can do it

2483
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,920
I told you this position is weird

2484
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,000
I don’t believe it, bro, I’ll come here

2485
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:11,520
I pray to have a

2486
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,320
clear heart

2487
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,880
Changing the lyrics again

2488
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,480
Of course

2489
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,240
That’s so hard

2490
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,200
You ask if I love you

2491
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:23,920
Please

2492
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,680
Coming, I’m about to

2493
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:27,920
Wait a moment

2494
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:29,040
Darn it

2495
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,080
He Ge is about to do a remix

2496
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:33,680
Darn it

2497
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,440
Come on

2498
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:31,440
Apply some setting powder.

2499
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,440
Why use setting powder?

2500
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:35,160
No, your face is really oily right now.

2501
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,560
Is it possible that it's not?

2502
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,800
It's not the powder.

2503
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,520
I'm just naturally oily.

2504
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,520
Okay.

2505
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,360
Even this puff is oily now.

2506
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,800
My powder puff...

2507
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,000
This time, let's not stay silent.

2508
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,920
Come on, pinky swear with me.

2509
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,240
Do we really have to?

2510
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,640
Standing next to you two,

2511
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,400
it's like being beside giants.

2512
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,720
I can't believe you're 1.67 meters tall.

2513
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,560
And you know, in those candid photos,

2514
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,080
when I'm next to you,

2515
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,400
I look like a little kid.

2516
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,000
We're filming here, sir.

2517
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:16,960
Could you please not disturb us?

2518
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,920
Sorry, this scene

2519
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,560
is actually rented by us.

2520
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:20,480
Is your crew

2521
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,360
having major production issues?

2522
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:22,840
Let me tell you,

2523
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,800
it's still just you and me.

2524
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,000
Feels a bit like Sicily.

2525
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,440
Yeah.

2526
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,160
You two are still working on it?

2527
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,800
I thought it was over—I already changed out of my costume.
