1
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,291
Hey

2
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:06,741
Little brother

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:07,491
Come here, quick

4
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:11,491
Xuan

5
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:15,791
You look especially good when you're nervous

6
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:16,941
Come on, come on

7
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:18,041
Thanks for your hard work

8
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:18,541
Thank you for your effort

9
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:19,691
Brother Honglei

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,920
Look, you're sweating

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,020
This is so hard for me

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,720
Why is your face all red?

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,795
Did you two just find out?

14
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:28,908
I did it

15
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:29,895
We both did it together

16
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:30,920
Give one to Honglei

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm the first to perform

18
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,145
Watch Brother Honglei

19
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:35,270
Then Brother Honglei will show you

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,220
You got scared.

21
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,610
Xin just wanted to have some fun and interact.

22
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,160
Just interact a bit.

23
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,135
I still haven't figured it out yet.

24
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:47,810
From that... from that round, wait a moment.

25
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,510
Think about it, you guys choose.

26
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,160
We choose, you choose.

27
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,460
You choose.

28
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,285
I think it's okay to eat.

29
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,560
Because the first round should be done in reverse.

30
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:00,880
Then,

31
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,930
The second part is done normally.

32
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,530
That's usually how it goes.

33
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,355
You check it.

34
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,680
Check one and show us.

35
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:14,380
I think it's fine.

36
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,580
It's okay to eat.

37
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,005
It's okay to eat.

38
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:16,380
It's okay to eat.

39
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,105
If we can eat, what's the rule?

40
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:19,780
Enjoy alone.

41
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,830
You can only pick one person to eat.

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,275
You can include yourself, that's fine.

43
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,000
That's nothing.

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,775
You eat.

45
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:26,050
Bro.

46
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,800
You eat.

47
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,750
Xianxu is older.

48
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,675
Let Xianxu do it, it's fine.

49
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:30,900
Bro.

50
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,725
You eat first, me.

51
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:32,800
Any flavor is fine for me.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,200
You're really not picky?

53
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,700
I don't have any special preference for taste.

54
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,850
Working out every day, strong body.

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,055
I think it's hard to find.

56
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:53,230
It'll be easier to find when we come back.

57
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,730
The general manager called me.

58
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Sun Honglei is going to travel with me.

59
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,430
The general manager called me.

60
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,055
He asked me to work overtime.

61
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:01,080
I took the general manager...

62
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,880
General manager.

63
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,850
Then we can turn it back.

64
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,650
Right?

65
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,250
Is Brother Nao really that tall?

66
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,050
He must be tall.

67
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Why does it have to be the tallest?

68
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,900
He spit, right.

69
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,375
So its level is high, right?

70
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,850
Yes, that's right.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,950
He's a three.

72
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,425
Is it two or three?

73
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,850
That one is the highest.

74
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,660
Why is the level of anger so high?

75
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,710
Actually, four and five are pretty hard for me to act.

76
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,760
I thought Brother Long was a three.

77
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,310
I thought he was a five.

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
So we'll just act at this level.

79
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,600
It shakes a lot.

80
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,050
Just set the level a bit.

81
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,700
1212345

82
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,100
1234512345

83
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,950
Among 12345, people especially like him.

84
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,300
I can't even do it.

85
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,830
Yes.

86
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,480
Like this.

87
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,780
This.

88
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,080
Sit on the right.

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,755
Then I'll sit next to you.

90
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:14,005
Hey.

91
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:14,330
Okay.

92
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,630
You're sitting so close to the worst one.

93
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,630
No, he's not the worst.

94
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,530
Gong Jun is the worst.

95
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,805
Not you, bro.

96
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:21,430
I meant you.

97
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,880
I'm the worst.

98
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,170
I'm not bad.

99
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm the kindest woman.

100
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,395
Get to know me slowly.

101
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:28,170
You'll see.

102
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,370
Xianxu's conducting was good too.

103
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,870
It's so hard for me, I can, I can, I can tell.

104
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,095
Repeating it so many times.

105
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:37,045
There must be a problem.

106
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:38,970
But I don't know what the problem is.

107
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,845
Because I've never experienced this routine.

108
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,770
I haven't either.

109
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,905
Hello, uncle.

110
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:45,255
Sorry.

111
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:45,530
Sorry.

112
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:45,780
Bro.

113
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,630
I...

114
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,255
I've really never experienced his reaction.

115
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:51,030
None at all.

116
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,955
I just didn't know how to respond, you know?

117
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:54,730
We were watching on the monitor.

118
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,030
It was hilarious.

119
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
You were laughing so hard.

120
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,080
I was scared to death.

121
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,530
Really.

122
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,780
Third time.

123
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,255
One more round.

124
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:16,780
Let me see.

125
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,655
No way.

126
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:21,330
I don't want to go over there.

127
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,135
Bro.

128
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,510
I've never lost this game.

129
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,310
Don't jinx it yet.

130
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,610
Don't jinx it yet.

131
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Last time you jinxed it, something went wrong.

132
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,400
Get ready.

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,150
I'll pull you back first.

134
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,350
Wait, sing first, then talk.

135
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,000
It doesn't deduct points anyway.

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,700
Where are you going?

137
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,250
Well done.

138
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,450
Bro.

139
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,150
Love comes with rights and wrongs.

140
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,850
So many come, faces full of excitement.

141
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
at such occasions.

142
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,370
Alright, alright.

143
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:14,370
There's more.

144
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,700
Come on.

145
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,025
Wait a second.

146
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:28,625
Wait, you'll understand when your tears fall at the end.

147
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,333
Tears fall.

148
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,400
Tears come.

149
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,150
By betraying my love, you've burdened yourself with a debt of conscience.

150
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,420
In the end, when I learned the truth, tears fell from my eyes.

151
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,070
Next person, it's your turn.

152
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,220
What's the name of that song from Journey to the West?

153
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,870
What's the name of the theme song?

154
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,150
Wait a moment, just a year.

155
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,025
The song is called "Talking about Journey to the West."

156
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:05,000
No, that's not right.

157
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,050
Right, it's not called Journey to the West.

158
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,788
It's called "The Great Wall Will Never Fall."

159
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:10,650
Isn't it not that one?

160
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,450
No rush.

161
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't hold it in.

162
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,600
It's okay.

163
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,250
This doesn't count as a point for wishing.

164
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
Hurry up and start talking.

165
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,950
That's right.

166
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,880
What's it called?

167
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,330
The Heavenly Road is wide and broad.

168
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,130
Stand up.

169
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,030
Zebra.

170
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,130
Is it?

171
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,080
Why does it sound like "ban"?

172
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,030
That does sound a bit like it.

173
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,730
Seems like it.

174
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,650
Is it "Father"?

175
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,250
That song.

176
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,250
I really want to listen to it.

177
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,100
What exactly is the sound in these headphones?

178
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,725
Your jacket misses you.

179
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:58,150
The white socks remember your scent.

180
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,490
Beijing Welcomes You.

181
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,140
Creating a new world for you.

182
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,890
Beauty in motion, full of vitality.

183
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,190
Beijing Welcomes You.

184
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,470
Running to breathe under the sun.

185
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,370
Setting new records on the yellow earth.

186
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,310
You and I are heart to heart

187
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,310
Living together on the same Earth

188
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,410
of

189
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,310
For dreams

190
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:05,440
Hearts meet across a thousand miles in Beijing
