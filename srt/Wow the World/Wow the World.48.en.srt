1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Alright, everyone.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Let me explain.

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,440
We're about to finish the Madrid round.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,640
Tomorrow, we're heading to Barcelona.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,800
Barcelona is also known as the City of Dragons.

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,960
There are many dragon elements and legends there.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,920
All of them come from one story.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,840
The legend of Saint George.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,120
A long, long time ago,

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
there was a small village in Catalonia.

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,720
A terrifying dragon appeared.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,560
It brought

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,800
serious suffering to the village.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,160
To calm the dragon,

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,600
the villagers tried to appease its anger.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,720
Every year, they offered a young girl.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,440
One day, after many sacrifices,

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
it was the princess's turn.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,400
Wasn't it the duke?

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,960
No, the princess.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
Just before the dragon ate the princess,

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,640
a handsome and brave

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,040
knight appeared.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
He was Saint George.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,160
He pierced the dragon with his spear.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,600
He killed the dragon and saved the princess.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,680
So,

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,240
today we have a mission.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,520
The mission is:

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,400
Who is my princess?

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,280
Who is my princess?

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,440
Who is my princess?

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,960
Stop making me look around.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,560
Stop making me daydream every day.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
This is our Duke of the Northeast.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
Who is my princess?

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
Me? Never mind.

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,320
Alright.

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Let me explain the rules.

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Among the nine members,

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
there is one princess and one knight.

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,120
The two need to

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,120
secretly recognize each other with specific actions.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,080
The knight has four chances to attack.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
But doesn't know who the targets are.

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
He must, within six minutes,

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
use the princess's hints

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,080
to attack three designated Evil Dragons.

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
After six minutes,

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,840
if the knight hits all three Evil Dragons,

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
the princess and knight get one point.

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,640
Otherwise, everyone else gets one point.

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,520
Also, after each round,

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
the other players vote

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,040
for the hidden princess.

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
If the vote is correct,

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,720
the Evil Dragon players get one point.

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760
Otherwise, the princess and knight get another point.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
Okay.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,160
Alright.

61
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,400
Okay.

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,840
During the mission,

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,160
if the princess is

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,720
found,

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,400
or attacked by mistake,

66
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,560
the game ends immediately.

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,640
A wrong attack

68
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
means the princess is "eliminated."

69
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,200
Right.

70
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,680
Alright.

71
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,040
Let's do a practice round first.

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,080
Get familiar with the rules.

73
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll send everyone their roles.

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
And the recognition actions.

75
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,840
Okay.

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,960
Turn off.

77
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
Mute and turn off vibration.

78
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,160
Can I turn on airplane mode?

79
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Airplane mode on.

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,280
Wait a second.

81
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,480
Alright, princess and knight can recognize each other now.

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
Six-minute countdown.

83
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Start.

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,160
Evil Dragons can disguise their identities.

85
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
What? What's going on?

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,160
What does that mean?

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Aren't we supposed to protect

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
the knight and...

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,840
Of course not.

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440
We're Evil Dragons, we're the "bad guys."

91
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,800
We're the "bad guys," bro.

92
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
So what are you confusing?

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,840
Confusing them so they can't recognize each other.

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,800
If we last six minutes, we win.

95
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Makes sense. Let's go.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Tickle.

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,920
We can talk, but...

98
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,120
We can talk.

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Everyone's pretty sneaky.

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
The Knight only has four minutes left.

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
Knight, hurry and reveal yourself.

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
Come out, Knight.

103
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
The Knight needs to reveal themselves.

104
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Because no one can target the Knight.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
Hehe, just reveal yourself.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,520
Go ahead, reveal yourself.

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right, looks like you can't hide anymore.

108
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,400
Eliminate you.

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Lin Yi.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Knight's attack successful.

111
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,280
So now I am...

112
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,560
I can even move around now.

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,920
Yes.

114
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,240
Right.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,480
Disappear, Big Dumb Dragon.

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,000
Attack successful.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
Disappear, Big Dumb Dragon.

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,040
Attack successful.

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,520
It worked.

120
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,040
Success.

121
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Everyone on the hit list has been eliminated.

122
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,240
Yeah.

123
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,000
When did they get it right?

124
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
How is that possible?

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
Let's give the Princess and Knight

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,160
a round of applause.

127
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,240
Very successful.

128
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
Impressive.

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
This game is really hard.

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,640
So impressive.

131
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,520
Every shot hits the mark.

132
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
Everyone can try to identify the Princess now.

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
If you can vote for the Princess,

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and get the vote right,

135
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,600
you can turn the game around.

136
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Who gave him instructions?

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,880
So you're the Evil Dragon.

138
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,360
Why did you start leading the conversation right away?

139
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,280
What does that mean?

140
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm going to pretend to be the Princess.

141
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Listen to us first.

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
I think it's Yu Ning.

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
What did I do?

144
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
You're questioning someone irrelevant.

145
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,000
I think that's pointless.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,440
No.

147
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm accusing him like this

148
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
just to see who reacts.

149
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,160
You think it's me?

150
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Then it must be Nai Wen Li.

151
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Nai Wen Li.

152
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,040
The more you talk, the more suspicious you seem.

153
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
I think it's Nai Wen.

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I think it's Nai Wen.

155
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,720
Is it you?

156
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,200
It's best to keep your eyes closed in this situation.

157
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,880
You look suspicious as soon as you open your eyes.

158
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
Why don't we vote?

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Let's vote.

160
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,240
Alright, please vote.

161
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,840
I'll go with this one, this one.

162
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,840
That many?

163
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,520
I'm so popular.

164
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,720
Nai Wen Li, you really...

165
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,800
You look like a spy, what should we do?

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
Nai Wen, next time talk with your eyes closed.

167
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,360
Got it?

168
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,080
Darn it.

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,560
Is Nai Wen the Princess?

170
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,080
Revealed.

171
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,160
No.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
Let's give a round of applause

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
for our Princess to stand up.

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,320
It really is Didi.

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
He really is my brother.

176
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,640
Wait a second.

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,880
He really is my brother.

178
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,560
Listen to me.

179
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
I

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,600
didn't find the Princess.

181
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,360
Until she stood up,

182
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,320
I had no idea who the Princess was.

183
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,960
No, I knew.

184
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,120
I knew it was you.

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,640
I didn't know it was you.

186
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,280
What was your recognition gesture?

187
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
The gesture was this.

188
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
So I kept thinking

189
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
I’d recognized you hundreds of times.

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
I saw you do this.

191
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,640
But Yun Ning did it too.

192
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,760
Then across from me,

193
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
Xiao Yi did it too.

194
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,000
I thought, darn it.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,240
Are the two sucking lollipops

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,000
the ones with roles?

197
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,960
Did I get the wrong role?

198
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
He thought he wasn’t.

199
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,120
I made a blind attack.

200
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
So I was really confused.

201
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,400
But we got it right all thanks to you, bro.

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,120
Just lucky.

203
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Alright, everyone.

204
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Let’s officially start.

205
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,400
Countdown: six minutes, go.

206
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Your moves are too scattered.

207
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,880
It’s definitely not you.

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760
What did the crew write?

209
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,040
First, a fist bump, then play a tune.

210
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,120
Then suck a lollipop.

211
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,640
Then check your phone.

212
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,720
Then look around.

213
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
Check your phone, scratch an itch.

214
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
The crew can write so much.

215
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,640
Take a guess.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Let’s go.

217
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,040
This is fun.

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
So much fun.

219
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,160
Jin Jing.

220
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,560
Jin Jing.

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,880
This is fun.

222
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,880
So much fun.

223
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,400
Hong Lei.

224
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,000
This is fun, bro.

225
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
Sit down, hurry up and sit.

226
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
We’re like security guards.

227
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,840
Patrolling the place.

228
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,600
On patrol.

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Put your phone on the table.

230
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,400
Five-minute countdown.

231
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
It’s a bit tough.

232
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,120
Weird, everyone’s quiet.

233
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,680
Alright, Knight, jump out.

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,720
It’s you.

235
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,880
Big Dumb Dragon, disappear.

236
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,720
Alright, congrats.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Nai Wen Li.

238
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,160
Nai Wen Li.

239
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,320
That was a precise strike.

240
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,760
Wait a moment.

241
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,280
Nai Wen Li.

242
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,440
This is the happiest moment today.

243
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,040
Hold on.

244
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,360
Hold on.

245
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,560
Nai Wen Li.

246
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,520
Nai Wen Li, tell us quickly.

247
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,320
No.

248
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,560
Yu Ning.

249
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
Weren’t you the first to clap?

250
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:32,920
Yeah.

251
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,920
He clapped first.

252
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,560
He did this.

253
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
I predicted your prediction.

254
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
So I thought you were the Knight.

255
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
So I thought you were the Knight.

256
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,680
When I got to you,

257
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,960
I stared at him again.

258
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,840
When I got to you,

259
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
I pointed here.

260
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I stared at him again.

261
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
When I got to Ouyang Didi,

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,560
What’s up, sis?

263
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
He gave me a look.

264
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
I said okay and sat down quickly.

265
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,720
Big Dumb Dragon, disappear.

266
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,160
Well done.

267
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,560
Nice job.

268
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,920
Is it really such a coincidence?

269
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
You think he’s the Knight.

270
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,800
I think he’s the Princess.

271
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Amazing.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
You’re so smart.

273
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,200
You figured out my gesture.

274
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
No, I didn't guess.

275
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,840
Just a wild guess.

276
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,320
Nice.

277
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
It's way too confusing.

278
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,960
I was thinking, finally,

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
I got a role.

280
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,360
No one leaves tonight, let's keep playing.

281
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,920
Last round.

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,960
Last round.

283
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,720
Last round.

284
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,320
Six-minute countdown, go!

285
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,480
What's wrong with you?

286
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,080
Sorry.

287
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
Not even talking now.

288
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,200
Just acting like an animal, right?

289
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
Bro, do that thing.

290
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,960
Hurry.

291
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,200
She's definitely getting "eliminated."

292
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,160
Forget it.

293
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,400
Hands on hips.

294
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,720
Go for it!

295
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,440
This is so fun.

296
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,880
Such a weird person.

297
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,840
Uncle Nai finally got a role.

298
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,720
How many minutes left?

299
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,720
Three and a half.

300
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,680
The Knight still hasn't revealed themselves.

301
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
Guess they haven't gotten the signal.

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Right?

303
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
Lin Yi, who are you signaling to?

304
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,160
One of those three.

305
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
These three are suspicious.

306
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,680
He just signaled someone.

307
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,720
What does that mean?

308
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,920
Eliminate.

309
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,280
Gone for talking too much.

310
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,440
It's you.

311
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,480
Attack successful.

312
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,640
I can only guess.

313
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,600
Seriously, I can only guess.

314
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Didn't confirm each other.

315
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,880
It's not him.

316
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,720
Did any of you just look at me?

317
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,680
I didn't, really.

318
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,920
You.

319
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,880
Disappear, Big Dumb Dragon.

320
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,080
Attack successful.

321
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Let me try again.

322
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
Disappear, Big Dumb Dragon.

323
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,680
Attack failed.

324
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
Only one chance.

325
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,040
Then he's not the Princess.

326
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,800
I'm not the Princess, I'm a good guy.

327
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,040
He looked at Ning first.

328
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,160
You should've "eliminated" Ning first.

329
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,760
Don't "eliminate" me.

330
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,560
Don't "eliminate" me.

331
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,640
I'm begging you.

332
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,400
Don't "eliminate" me.

333
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,560
Then who do you want to "eliminate"?

334
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,840
Give me a name.

335
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,400
I'll say it.

336
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,840
Xing Xu.

337
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,120
Okay.

338
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
Disappear, Big Dumb Dragon.

339
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,240
Attack successful.

340
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,080
Bro,

341
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
because you guys have played this kind of show before,

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you're more experienced.

343
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,800
No, not really.

344
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,160
Wait, do you have to play at such a high level?

345
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,359
We're kind of tricky.

346
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,280
Let's do the opposite.

347
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,839
Just vote for him.

348
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
Why are you trying to lead the game right away?

349
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,119
Or just don't vote for him.

350
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,560
No, it's definitely not him.

351
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
Definitely not him.

352
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,680
Definitely not me.

353
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Because I suspect him.

354
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040
So I want to take him out.

355
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
How did it end up like this?

356
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
High-level game.

357
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
The odds are pretty high.

358
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,640
I think she still

359
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,040
hasn't figured out who it is.

360
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,080
Let me tell you,

361
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,720
I never revealed myself.

362
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,080
She might not be telling the truth.

363
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,800
She doesn't know.

364
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,440
Definitely not.

365
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,400
I get it, you definitely know.

366
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,000
I really don't know.

367
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,920
I listened to him for the last one.

368
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
Attacked me first, but got it wrong.

369
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
Because that person pointed in that direction.

370
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,240
It's this way.

371
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
But you're not sure who it is.

372
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
You can see it that way.

373
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,640
Yeah, actually I know.

374
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,600
Didn't coordinate well.

375
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,800
Where's Honglei?

376
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,560
I'm already out.

377
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,440
Got "eliminated."

378
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,480
You got out again.

379
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,520
You get out every round.

380
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,240
Every round.

381
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,520
Are you "dead"?

382
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm a good guy.

383
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,360
Tried to "kill" me but failed.

384
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,120
What about you?

385
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,920
I'm out too.

386
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,080
Then I'm the good guy.

387
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,440
There's He, and her.

388
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,360
And this one.

389
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,800
Naiwen Li.

390
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,160
So Naiwen Li,

391
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,680
it must be you, right?

392
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,400
Absolutely not.

393
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,160
So who do you pick, Naiwen?

394
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,560
Who do you choose?

395
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
Because now it's just you three.

396
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
I haven't ruled you out yet, seriously.

397
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,000
It's him.

398
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,560
Ning really can't rule him out.

399
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,320
I'll pick Nai Shu, anyway.

400
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not me.

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
I can't be that much of a loser, right?

402
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
It's really not me.

403
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
It's him.

404
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,240
I'm being honest, it's not me.

405
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,840
Trust me.

406
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,640
Did you forget our family?

407
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,360
Then it's him.

408
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,280
Bro, that's so mean.

409
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
I've already figured it out.

410
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
I'm telling you now,

411
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,080
you're already talking about this.

412
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,480
It's getting off track.

413
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,800
It's really not me.

414
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,080
Alright, everyone,

415
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,840
point to whoever you think it is.

416
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,320
Wait a second.

417
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
I still have no idea who it is.

418
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,280
You're so nervous.

419
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,760
This isn't nervousness.

420
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,640
I really don't know how to judge now.

421
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
I don't think it's Naiwen.

422
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,760
He doesn't really seem like it.

423
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
Then it's He, vote for him.

424
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,520
I think it's He.

425
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,240
Wait.

426
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,000
He, is it you?

427
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
It's not me, definitely not me.

428
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,880
Why?

429
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,600
My whole logic just now was trying to find the person.

430
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,160
And I was still searching at the end.

431
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,880
Couldn't find anyone later.

432
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
I sat down to watch.

433
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,080
Okay, three, two, one.

434
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,440
Please vote.

435
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,200
Vote successful.

436
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,320
So it was when Jing asked Ning.

437
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,200
You looked.

438
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,320
No, he kept saying over there.

439
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,840
But I thought walking over there was too obvious.

440
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
I wanted to take a chance.

441
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,400
Let him say whatever.

442
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
Really took a gamble.

443
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
He, I think, already did very well.

444
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
Did a pretty good job.

445
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,880
But the two of them—

446
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,680
Their debate was so genuine.

447
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
In the end, it pointed to you.

448
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,840
And you two recognized each other, right?

449
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,480
You recognized each other from the start.

450
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
How did you recognize each other? What gesture?

451
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,720
And I just happened to ask you to do that.

452
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,200
Bro, do that thing.

453
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,160
Quick.

454
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,160
Hands on hips.

455
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,040
Saw it.

456
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,360
Did someone just look at me?
