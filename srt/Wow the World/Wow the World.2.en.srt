1
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,520
How big is the world we live in

2
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,080
Is it this big

3
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,120
Or this big

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,640
Or maybe this big

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,920
The world

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,800
Is it made up of grid squares

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,320
Screens of various sizes

8
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,160
And all kinds of rectangular widgets

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,920
Is that what builds it

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,200
But

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,880
On the latitude and longitude of geography books

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
On the timeline of history books

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,560
In the timeless poems and songs

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,120
The other side of the world is

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,840
This world is still hard to define.

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,000
But the footprints of human exploration

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,160
have long been etched on the path of time and space.

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,640
They are Zhang Qian's camel bells,

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Marco Polo's travelogues,

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,720
and Xu Xiake's bamboo staff.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
The pulse of human exploration

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,520
has never stopped.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,280
Every time,

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
we can always find

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,120
some fresh answers.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Around the 40th parallel north,

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
if you travel from east to west,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,200
you'll discover a series of historic cities.

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,840
The 40th parallel north

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
is also a place where many cultures

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
interact with each other.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Today, a group of people is ready

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
at the Great Wall in Beijing

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240
to set foot on the 40th parallel north,

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,960
connecting the world.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,520
The Great Wall

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
is one of the prides of the Chinese nation.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
We set out from the Great Wall

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
to see

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
a different world.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,280
To see the world

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,360
for me,

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
the most important thing is that you have to see it first.

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,880
You have to see it first

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,080
Only after seeing it will you know

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,520
if it matches what you imagined

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
Whether you like it or not

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,440
doesn't really matter

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,240
The most important thing is that you've seen it

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,080
I really haven't traveled much

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
I've never been abroad

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,520
I think I should go out and see

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,760
more of what the world is like

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,680
and enrich my own experiences

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
and life stories

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,280
Maybe, whether it's through music

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,160
or through theater

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,400
I'll gain something from it

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Maybe

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,040
there are some things

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,760
that in a familiar environment

62
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
I can't figure out

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,240
but maybe they'll be easily solved there

64
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,680
I also want to

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,000
connect with young actors

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,240
and really interact with them

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,200
to see how they think

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520
and explore

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,880
a fresh new world

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
I need my core to be more stable

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,880
I want to understand

72
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,760
more of this world's diversity

73
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,240
I want to see a wider world

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,800
In the midst of busy work

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,480
I want to experience something different

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,360
I can share this happiness with everyone

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,840
Many times, there is hesitation

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,080
Sometimes, when you hesitate

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,520
you stop moving forward

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,600
The outside world is actually quite nice

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,760
Be brave and go take a look

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,120
See what other worlds are like

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,400
Let them see us too

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
Let's look at each other

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
From our perspective

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,520
let's look at a

87
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,200
super fresh Earth

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,680
How did you set this up?

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
Old man

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Old man

91
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
About to get old soon

92
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,400
Very soon

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,160
Youngster

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
Pretty young lady

95
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,120
There's definitely a generation gap here

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,399
These four kids

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,360
I really

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,839
don't know any of them

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Liu Yuning

100
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,080
Gong Jun

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,840
Chen Xingxu

102
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
Wang Yuwen

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,760
I don't know them

104
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,400
This kind of gathering is quite interesting

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,320
Usually, it's with people you know

106
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,200
But this time, it's all strangers

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
Here is a familiarity survey.

108
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,280
Level of familiarity.

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,880
Please rate

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,160
how well you know the members of this tour group.

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,280
One point means not familiar.

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Ten points means very familiar.

113
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
The one I'm most familiar with is Yuning.

114
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,840
He's my good friend.

115
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,880
We've already talked to each other.

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,080
I messaged Gong Jun.

117
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,360
I told him I'm an introvert.

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm just a bit introverted.

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
Bro, please look after me.

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,240
Then he said,

121
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,640
It's okay.

122
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm also an introvert.

123
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
Later, I'll take care of you.

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,200
That made me feel much more at ease.

125
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm waiting for Gong Jun to guide me.

126
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,480
The person I'm most familiar with

127
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,880
is Li Naiwen, he's my senior.

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
From the acting department at the Central Academy of Drama.

129
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,040
He was in the class of '93.

130
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,080
I was in the class of '95.

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
As for Sun Honglei and me,

132
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,920
thirty-two years ago,

133
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,680
we already knew each other.

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,080
We were very close in school.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Then we gradually became a bit less close.

136
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
Now we're about seventy percent familiar.

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,200
When he sees you, he has to call you "senior."

138
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
Is that true?

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
But he's older than me.

140
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,560
He was born in 1970.

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,480
He's already fifty.

142
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
Right?

143
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,840
Medium well.

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,560
And as for Chen He,

145
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,120
I've been seeing him more often lately.

146
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
He's a really cute younger brother.

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,760
But also quite annoying.

148
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,360
Please have Li Naiwen leave.

149
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
I hope he leaves this show.

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,480
I don't want to record with him.

151
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
Honestly, he's pretty annoying.

152
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,680
Also very annoying.

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm definitely closest to Xingxu.

154
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,080
We've known each other for sixteen years.

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
We grew up together.

156
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,480
We used QQ.

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,920
I mean,

158
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,880
just hearing that,

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,760
it sounds so old-school.

160
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,000
He's a bit shy around strangers.

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
He has social anxiety.

162
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,240
If you put him in a room with five strangers

163
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
and lock them in together,

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
and ask them to chat,

165
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,840
I think for him,

166
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,200
today would be a terrifying day.

167
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,760
Like a horror movie.

168
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,800
Absolutely a horror movie.

169
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,800
He's already messaged me on WeChat.

170
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
First, "Save me."

171
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Then, "Help me."

172
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,440
And finally, "Protect me."

173
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Welcome, Chen Xingxu.

174
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
Welcome.

175
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,280
Alright.

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm really nervous right now.

177
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,160
Right now,

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm very anxious.

179
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,080
Because this is also my first time joining a variety show.

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,800
Well, I can't really call it my first time participating.

181
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
It's my first time joining this kind of

182
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,920
regular variety show.

183
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,840
So I don't really know what I'm supposed to do.

184
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
I also don't know how to do it.

185
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,880
I...

186
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm so scared.

187
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,920
I've never met Honglei before.

188
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,720
This is my first time meeting him.

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,760
So that's a one, right?

190
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,280
Same with Naiwen.

191
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,080
Also a one.

192
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
Same with He.

193
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,080
Also a one.

194
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,800
Only Gong Jun is a 9.9.

195
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,840
Everyone else is just a one.

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm not familiar with them at all.

197
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,840
I don't know them at all.

198
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
The other teachers

199
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm actually not very familiar with any of them.

200
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,840
Yuning

201
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,520
It seems like in real life,

202
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,560
I've never met them.

203
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,400
One.

204
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
I'll give Naiwen a one.

205
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,960
If there wasn't a one,

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,320
I'd even write zero.

207
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,520
Liu Yuning

208
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,520
Zero.

209
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
Gong Jun

210
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,440
Minus one.

211
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,880
Chen Xingxu, minus two.

212
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,880
Wang Yuwen, minus six.

213
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,760
Not familiar at all.

214
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm a little nervous.

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,320
Why?

216
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,040
That's true.

217
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm a bit uneasy.

218
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
A little nervous.

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,480
But also a bit excited.

220
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm already starting to feel nervous.

221
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,560
You humans...

222
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,240
The anxiety before meeting strangers.

223
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
It's practically a default setting.

224
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,920
Since I'm here, I'll just go with the flow.

225
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,920
Even if you're Sun Honglei.

226
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm really scared.

227
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,360
What should we talk about?

228
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,640
I think it's really awkward.

229
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,200
I don't even know what to talk about when we meet.

230
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,600
It seems that before connecting with the world,

231
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,160
we need to connect with each other first.

232
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
So today,

233
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,160
let's get to know each other better.

234
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,400
Hello, everyone.

235
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm Gong Jun.

236
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
Gender: Male.

237
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
Age:

238
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
In my thirties.

239
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm very happy to be here on "Earth Super Fresh."

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
This is a conversation.

241
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
A one-on-one talk.

242
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
With whom?

243
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,600
Who will I be with?

244
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm singer and actor Liu Yuning.

245
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,440
I used to brag

246
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,560
that the word "awkward" doesn't exist in my dictionary.

247
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,000
But the thing is,

248
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm also worried that when we meet in a bit,

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,160
it might be a little awkward.

250
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,320
It really is you.

251
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,320
I suddenly feel relieved.

252
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
You know what?

253
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,840
Before I came here, I was really worried

254
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
that if it was another teacher,

255
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
I would really...

256
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
What's there to be nervous about chatting?

257
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Long time no see.

258
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,040
They asked me to rate how familiar I am with you.

259
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,720
Did you mark it?

260
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,480
I did.

261
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,880
How many points did you give me?

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,520
Two points.

263
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,040
Is that okay?

264
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,520
Two points?

265
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,160
Really?

266
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,960
Why only two points for me?

267
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,040
So you counted it the other way around?

268
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,360
No.

269
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
Is zero the most familiar?

270
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,760
No.

271
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
Then why two points?

272
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
I feel like we're pretty unfamiliar with each other.

273
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,200
Because we haven't seen each other in a long time.

274
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,720
Very unfamiliar.

275
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,760
Because it's been a long time.

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,920
Liu Yuning is my good friend.

277
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,680
I gave you 9.9 points.

278
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,480
Are you really that familiar with me?

279
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm not exaggerating.

280
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,840
In my heart, it's just that

281
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Honestly, you really

282
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
I really

283
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
For me, it's a 9.9 out of 10

284
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,800
Everyone else is just a 1

285
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
Only you get 9.9

286
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
How many points would you give me?

287
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,680
Seven

288
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
Seven

289
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,920
I just hit the table

290
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
Seriously, man

291
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it's just three

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,320
Still need to, in this show

293
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,280
deepen it a bit more

294
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,920
the impression

295
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
You really know what to say

296
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,760
Yeah

297
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,320
It's true, the two of us haven't

298
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,920
hung out together on the show

299
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
I've always wanted to do that

300
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
This time, the wish finally came true, right?

301
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm so happy

302
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,040
Who are you closer with?

303
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,760
Besides you, just He-ge

304
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,040
I worked with He-ge once

305
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm a seven

306
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,200
What about He-ge?

307
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,680
Three

308
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,760
How can you only give him three?

309
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,920
You're so cold

310
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,160
How many points would you give him?

311
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,880
I'd give him one

312
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,360
Even colder

313
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,080
Yes, I give one point.

314
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,640
Is there anything you want to know about me?

315
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
What are we eating after work today?

316
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,360
I don't want to know anything at all.

317
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,080
That's enough.

318
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,920
What else is there for us to talk about?

319
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,040
How do we get familiar?

320
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
We're already very familiar.

321
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,040
It seems you two are already quite familiar with each other.

322
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,960
Then please write one for each other.

323
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,760
A social profile card to introduce them.

324
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
A social profile card.

325
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,640
That's right.

326
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,040
It's to recommend them to everyone, right?

327
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120
He's a really great person.

328
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,480
Why is that?

329
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,920
Because after becoming good friends,

330
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,880
you get VIP treatment every year.

331
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,160
He'll send you big strawberries from Dandong.

332
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
He sends them to me every year.

333
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,240
His strawberries are big and delicious.

334
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
Every year he sends me his mom's

335
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,040
homemade

336
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,280
Don't stop there.

337
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,560
homemade

338
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,200
sausage.

339
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Sichuan sausage.

340
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,240
He sends it every year.

341
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,520
That's also the VIP treatment from my good friend.

342
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,080
That's right.

343
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Sincere.

344
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,120
Sincere.

345
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,720
He's very sincere when making friends.

346
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
What I wrote for you is

347
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,560
Tall.

348
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,920
A pure model figure.

349
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,720
That photo of you from a couple of days ago

350
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,440
made me so envious.

351
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,920
Where did you go? A couple of days ago, I...

352
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,200
Why should I care where you went?

353
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,640
The next one is "innocent."

354
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,160
Okay.

355
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,920
Do you recognize this one?

356
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
Super generous.

357
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,320
Super generous.

358
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
After getting to know you,

359
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,960
they'll transfer money to you directly.

360
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Just ask for it.

361
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,400
Alright.

362
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,640
It's written down.

363
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
I feel like I'm the innocent one now.

364
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,520
What about the others?

365
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
Who's the second most familiar?

366
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,880
They're all tied for second.

367
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,520
None of them. I don't know any of them.

368
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,320
Yeah, I don't know any of them.

369
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,080
To help you all get familiar quickly,

370
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,280
we've set up a chat observation room.

371
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,920
Inside the observation room,

372
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,080
you can watch everything in real time on the big screen.

373
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,760
Everything that happens here.

374
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
In a bit, Yuning will stay here.

375
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
I'll stay here.

376
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,800
Right.

377
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,800
Because Gong Jun arrived first,

378
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
Jun Jun will be in the observation room.

379
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
He'll guide your actions through the earpiece.

380
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,280
Okay.

381
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,800
Like in a lot of movies,

382
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,240
for example,

383
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,720
the guy doesn't know how to date,

384
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,000
so they let him...

385
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,520
and then someone

386
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,040
coaches him on how to talk to girls.

387
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,120
It's kind of like that.

388
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
I can play like that later.

389
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,960
Yuning

390
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,240
Come here.

391
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,200
Put on the headset.

392
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,160
I'll head out first, then.

393
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,520
Okay.

394
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,600
Social psychologist

395
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
Elliot Aronson proposed

396
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,040
the "Pratfall Effect"

397
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
also known as the "Blunder Effect"

398
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,640
He tells us

399
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,720
that absolute perfection in social situations

400
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,320
is not the best strategy.

401
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Making small mistakes or minor blunders

402
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
can actually reduce the sense of distance.

403
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,080
It helps remove the mask of perfection when meeting for the first time.

404
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
What does that mean?

405
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
Did you guys come here tipsy?

406
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm just really hot.

407
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm leaving.

408
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,280
So, will this special first meeting

409
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,520
really help them break the ice effectively?

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,320
Can you hear me?

411
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,040
Loud and clear.

412
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
Yuning, you get up first.

413
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
Then

414
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,360
turn your back.

415
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,880
Turn your back.

416
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,600
Okay.

417
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,440
For our new friend,

418
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
let's enjoy some singing.

419
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,200
Let's enjoy some singing.

420
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,720
The sun shines in the sky,

421
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,840
the flowers smile at me.

422
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,720
I won't get beaten up, right?

423
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,800
Depends on who your opponent is.

424
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,440
Who could beat me?

425
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,400
If it's

426
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,520
Brother Honglei...

427
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,080
Hello, everyone

428
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm Sun Honglei

429
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,680
Male

430
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,000
I have a house

431
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,760
I'm good-looking

432
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,440
Right now, I'm at

433
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,000
the prime of my youth

434
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm looking for someone

435
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,200
who understands me

436
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
is curious about the world

437
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,200
lively

438
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,280
innocent

439
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,240
meticulous

440
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,520
humorous

441
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,280
who stays up late and wakes up late

442
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,440
not picky about food

443
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,560
loves to learn

444
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,320
always gives me positive feedback

445
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,000
has a mild temper

446
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,560
whose personality complements mine

447
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,280
can cook well in the kitchen

448
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,160
and is thriving in their career

449
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,320
preferably an extrovert

450
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,120
Alright

451
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,680
Basically, these are my

452
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,200
simple and basic requirements for a travel companion

453
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
Looking forward to meeting you soon

454
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,400
I can't forget this painful longing

455
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,880
Why do you still make my heart race

456
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,400
Sing louder, come on

457
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,240
Even louder

458
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,640
Baby

459
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:51,960
Baby

460
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,160
Our relationship is like a drop tower ride

461
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,760
Okay

462
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,720
It suddenly lifts me up

463
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,560
Stop

464
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,080
Sit down

465
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,280
Brother Honglei

466
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,040
Hello, Brother Honglei

467
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,560
Brother Honglei

468
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Hello, Brother Honglei

469
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,480
Speak English

470
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
Hello

471
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,280
Nice to meet you, Brother Honglei

472
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,640
I've seen quite a lot myself

473
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,040
What does that string of beads in your hand mean?

474
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,760
It's for stress relief

475
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,840
Just simply playing with beads

476
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm under a lot of stress right now

477
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,880
It's fine, you can play with it for a while

478
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,400
You play with it for a bit

479
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,080
No need

480
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,680
Bro, have a seat

481
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,200
Sit

482
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Let's sit and chat, bro

483
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,720
Are you wearing height-increasing shoes?

484
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
No

485
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,360
You're so tall

486
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
How tall are you?

487
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
My height is 190.5 centimeters

488
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,440
Just looking at you makes me feel hot

489
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
I'm sweating

490
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,360
And you're even wearing high heels

491
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,920
No high heels

492
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
I'll take off my shoes and chat with you, bro

493
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,760
Come on

494
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,240
Today we're just here to relax

495
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
Does this count as being open with each other?

496
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,240
Yes, being open with each other

497
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,920
Come on, have a seat, bro

498
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,840
Alright

499
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,720
Put on my jacket

500
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,800
Completely open with each other

501
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Come on, bro

502
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm a bit cold, bro

503
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm a bit cold today, bro

504
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,280
Sit down, bro

505
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,520
It's okay, bro.

506
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll wash it for you when I get back.

507
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,920
Don't overthink it.

508
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,480
It's fine.

509
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,560
I'll wash it for you in a bit.

510
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,640
Start singing after you sit down.

511
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,520
A B C D E F G

512
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,560
A B C D E F G

513
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,320
A B C D E F G

514
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,520
Tap the rhythm with your hands.

515
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,920
H I J K L M N

516
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,079
L M N

517
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,160
O P Q R S T

518
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,520
U V W X Y Z

519
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,040
X Y Z

520
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,240
No, it's just that today I'm a bit...

521
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,200
No, it's you...

522
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,319
It's all good now, bro.

523
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,119
You're really knowledgeable.

524
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,160
You've met all kinds of people in this industry.

525
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
I really haven't seen this before.

526
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,920
This one today,

527
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,000
is actually pretty interesting.

528
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,520
A new model, the 2025 edition.

529
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Bro, have you been on set lately?

530
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,880
Or are you busy with other work?

531
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Yeah, we're working on the script on set.

532
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
Take me with you.

533
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
Can you take me along?

534
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Can you take me along?

535
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,680
I don't dare take you.

536
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,120
Come on, take me with you.

537
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,600
I can help you relax on set.

538
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,960
Sing for you.

539
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
I can even give you a massage.

540
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,840
I can be here

541
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I can join your crew and help you relax

542
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
No need

543
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,440
No, really, there's no need

544
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,320
I can give you a massage

545
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm a professional at ear cleaning

546
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,880
I can do it for you

547
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,080
I'll go and massage Brother Honglei's legs now

548
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,520
Massage your legs

549
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,280
Wait a moment

550
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,760
For you

551
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,680
What are you doing

552
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,000
You've worked hard

553
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,480
What are you trying to do

554
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,280
I'll massage your legs

555
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,840
Because

556
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,480
No need

557
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,720
Try out this service

558
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,320
No need

559
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,960
Check out this technique

560
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,760
Don't trouble yourself

561
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,920
Give me a moment

562
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, sure, bro

563
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,400
You're progressing so fast

564
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,360
I can't take it anymore

565
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
I also think it's a bit too fast

566
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm sweating

567
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,720
Alright, bro

568
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,560
I'll stop messing around, bro

569
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,080
I'll stop

570
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,640
Who

571
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,440
You were just messing with me, weren't you

572
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,520
No, just kidding

573
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:36,880
Bro, sit

574
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,160
Alright

575
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,400
Sit down, bro

576
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,840
Okay

577
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,160
I'll stop

578
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,600
Okay

579
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,560
Bro, you're wearing a hat, this hat.

580
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,800
Is it hot, bro?

581
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,960
Bro, you're wearing this hat.

582
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,760
Is it hot, bro?

583
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,360
Not hot.

584
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,560
Let me cool you off, bro.

585
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I'll cool you off.

586
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,960
Just kidding.

587
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,360
Have a sip of Mizone.

588
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,920
Drink.

589
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Bro.

590
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,640
Cheers.

591
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,920
Sorry, let me toast to you.

592
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Cheers.

593
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
Done.

594
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
I haven't left the house in years.

595
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
I haven't acted in three years.

596
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,560
I just wanted to come out and see the world.

597
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,360
And then,

598
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,120
the world has changed again, hasn't it?

599
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
I run into these young people.

600
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,600
Maybe I should just go home.

601
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:29,720
Maybe I should just go home.

602
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,400
Okay.

603
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,080
No, it's not that, bro.

604
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,480
No.

605
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,280
I really do want to

606
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,360
with people in our circle,

607
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,320
the younger ones,

608
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
get to know them better.

609
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,440
Talk to me in that cutesy voice.

610
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,080
Let's get to know each other.

611
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,720
I want to understand your inner world.

612
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,440
And your views on acting.

613
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,240
That's great.

614
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,280
I was thinking the same thing.

615
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,120
I'm leaving.

616
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
I was thinking the same thing.

617
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
No, bro, just kidding.

618
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,280
Because I was just acting as Mickey Mouse.

619
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,800
You know that, right?

620
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,680
That's great.

621
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,760
It's this Mickey Mouse.

622
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,160
We're at the third floor.

623
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,360
Young people are all into this now.

624
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,920
What do you think, bro?

625
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,000
And then I thought,

626
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
No particular thoughts.

627
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,920
You two have a good chat.

628
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,240
Okay.

629
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm really hot.

630
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,840
I mean it, I'm hot.

631
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,840
You're hot too.

632
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,160
I get hot just seeing you.

633
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,040
I'm sweating.

634
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,360
Look, you've made me sweat from talking.

635
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,440
This is my first time.

636
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
Who is it usually?

637
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,120
Huang Bo, Yixing, Huang Lei.

638
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,200
People like Huang Zitao.

639
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
Yeah, they sweat.

640
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,640
It's never my turn to sweat.

641
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
You are...

642
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,080
What's your zodiac sign?

643
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,400
Capricorn.

644
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,280
As expected, Capricorns can handle me.

645
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm a Leo.

646
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,720
Let me tell you.

647
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,960
Among the twelve zodiac signs,

648
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,000
the only sign that can handle me is Capricorn.

649
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,800
But they're all female Capricorns.

650
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,360
So what's up with you?

651
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,680
How come you can handle me too?

652
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm not trying to handle you on purpose.

653
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm also being handled by someone else.

654
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,040
Here's the thing.

655
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,960
I've got an earpiece in my ear.

656
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,320
Everything I'm doing right now

657
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,760
is being directed by them.

658
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
This person is called Gong Jun.

659
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Do you know him?

660
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,480
No, I don't know him.

661
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,080
Get to know him later.

662
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm pretty normal, bro.

663
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,400
What happened ten minutes ago

664
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,520
That wasn't the real me.

665
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
It feels like it's been a year.

666
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,280
It's only been ten minutes?

667
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,560
So what are you really like?

668
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,880
This is the real me, bro.

669
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,560
Like I am right now.

670
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,080
Yeah, bro.

671
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
Hi, bro.

672
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,240
Bro.

673
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm not shaking your hand.

674
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
I don't think this misunderstanding can be cleared up.

675
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
He's already made up his mind about me.

676
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
He already has this impression of me.

677
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
Yeah, he does.

678
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,160
That thing doesn't have any wires either.

679
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,360
Can you still hear with it?

680
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,960
Is it wireless?

681
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,680
You'll be using this thing in a bit too.

682
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,880
Do I need to put it on now?

683
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah, it's a new headset.

684
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,840
I'll act just like him.

685
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
I'll do whatever the headset tells me.

686
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,680
Right.

687
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,640
What if I don't do it?

688
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
What happens then?

689
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,800
You don't have to do it.

690
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,600
So I don't have to, right?

691
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
That's not what you said earlier.

692
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,400
You definitely didn't say that before.

693
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,480
Now you say I don't have to do it.

694
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,960
It's so rare for me to meet my idol.

695
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Seriously, let me be in front of him...

696
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,160
Yuning, go meet Junjun.

697
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,680
Okay.

698
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm leaving, bro.

699
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
See you later.

700
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,640
See you later, Yuning.

701
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
Alright, don't blame me later, bro.

702
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,360
That's good.

703
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I wouldn't dare blame you.

704
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,000
Kids are so interesting.

705
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He really has that kind of

706
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,960
mysterious power about him.

707
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,840
An actor like this

708
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,000
can play all kinds of roles.

709
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,680
This is something actors of our generation

710
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,360
couldn't do.

711
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,480
Anyway, Liu Yuning,

712
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,520
I want to get to know this person.

713
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,320
He's quite interesting.

714
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,280
I messaged Gong Jun.

715
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,360
Then he said, "Big bro will take you."

716
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,040
Say it in English.

717
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,360
Put on bro's clothes.

718
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,680
Blow on them for bro.

719
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,840
Gong Jun.

720
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,600
Come out.

721
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Come out.

722
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,800
We can come up with ideas together.

723
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,440
Come on.

724
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,960
If your idea isn't as

725
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,160
ruthless as mine just now,

726
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,920
let's block each other today.

727
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,280
Is Gong Jun coming later?

728
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
He's going to hit you.

729
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,400
Just wait for him.

730
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,880
He said that was Gong Jun just now, right?

731
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,000
Gong Jun.

732
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,880
I'll remember this name.

733
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,920
Gong Jun.

734
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,920
I'll remember this name.

735
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,680
Bro.

736
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,560
Can you hear me, bro?

737
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,440
I can hear you.

738
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,120
Yes.

739
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,880
That's great.

740
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,520
Bro, I'm Gong Jun.

741
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,760
Hello, Gong Jun.

742
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,240
Don't talk.

743
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,360
Don't talk, bro, you slipped up.

744
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,200
Hello everyone, I'm Chen Xingxu.

745
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,120
I'm twenty-nine years old.

746
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I'm an actor.

747
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,760
I'm from Shenyang, Liaoning.

748
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,000
I heard that Honglei is here this time.

749
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
That makes me really happy.

750
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,440
But I also

751
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,320
feel very nervous.

752
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm really scared.

753
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,320
But I still hope others will talk to me.

754
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,880
Brother Honglei

755
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,760
Brother Honglei

756
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,280
Brother Honglei

757
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,920
Hello

758
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,800
Chen Xingxu

759
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,520
Hello

760
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,640
Chen Xingxu

761
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,480
Hi

762
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,760
Chen Xingxu

763
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,880
I am Sun Honglei

764
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,600
I know

765
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,680
Don't talk

766
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,320
Brother, don't talk

767
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,920
Keep not talking

768
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,320
Just like this

769
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,080
Smile

770
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,840
I

771
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,920
First time meeting

772
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Very

773
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
Nice to meet you

774
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,520
I hope others talk to me

775
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,280
What should I do

776
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,120
Bro, speak English.

777
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,840
Please sit down.

778
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,280
Please sit down.

779
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,200
Please sit down.

780
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,080
Okay.

781
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,640
Alright.

782
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,280
Bro, where should I sit?

783
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,600
You.

784
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,520
You sit first.

785
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,080
Bro, ask him.

786
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,560
What's your English name?

787
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,480
What's your English name?

788
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,760
I...

789
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,280
don't have an English name.

790
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Pick one now.

791
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
I...

792
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,520
Anything is fine.

793
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Maybe...

794
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Superstar.

795
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,440
Superstar.

796
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,760
That works.

797
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,680
Whatever you say goes.

798
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,440
Alright.

799
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,400
Please sit down.

800
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,040
Why don't you sit first?

801
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,560
Please sit.

802
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,440
Please sit.

803
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,840
Okay.

804
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Bro, don't sit.

805
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,080
You just stand.

806
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,640
You sit first, bro.

807
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,160
Alright, you sit.

808
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,960
Go ahead and sit.

809
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,840
Okay.

810
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,480
Sit.

811
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
You sit first, it's fine.

812
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,880
Okay.

813
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,760
Bro, sing a couple of lines.

814
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
Let him continue.

815
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,640
This is

816
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,640
Qingzang.

817
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,040
Your turn.

818
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,520
I can't hit that note.

819
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Honglei bro,

820
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,880
stop messing with me.

821
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,280
I'm begging you.

822
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Please, have a seat.

823
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,480
Sit.

824
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,200
Sit.

825
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,000
Have some water.

826
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,480
Drink some Pulse.

827
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,440
Okay.

828
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
What have you been up to lately?

829
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,760
I've been filming.

830
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
Do you think I could get a role?

831
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,080
Can I get a role?

832
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,160
It's so hot.

833
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,320
How about you let me...

834
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,120
Bro, please stop messing with me.

835
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,440
I'm begging you.

836
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,080
Or maybe I could play the male lead.

837
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
No.

838
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,800
Alright.

839
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,640
Alright.

840
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
This is the final test, bro.

841
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,520
Extend the index finger of your right hand.

842
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,480
Point it at him.

843
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,520
Then wait for him

844
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,480
to touch your fingertip with his.

845
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,320
Bro, what are you doing?

846
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,720
What's wrong?

847
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,200
His face is all red.

848
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,880
Did you see that?

849
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,120
That's enough.

850
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,720
Bro, that's enough.

851
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,080
Stop messing with him.

852
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
That was hilarious.

853
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
It wasn't me.

854
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,360
Just now, it wasn't me.

855
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,720
He made me do it.

856
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,240
So little.

857
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,720
If he tells me to sing, I sing.

858
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,880
If he tells me to do this, I do this.

859
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,640
You get it now, right?

860
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm totally normal.

861
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,680
Gong Jun.

862
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm totally normal.

863
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,280
Who's Gong Jun?

864
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,400
His name is Chen Xingxu.

865
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
Let's shake hands again.

866
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,000
This is the real me.

867
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,040
Hong Lei.

868
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Jun Jun.

869
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,360
Jun Jun.

870
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,000
You got the wrong person again.

871
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,760
Gong Jun.

872
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,720
Gong Jun.

873
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,960
Sorry if I offend you later.

874
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,760
Please don't.

875
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,600
It's fine.

876
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,120
You can call me whatever.

877
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,960
Jun Jun.

878
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,160
Xingxu

879
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,800
Xiao Xu

880
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,520
Call me Xingxing from now on.

881
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
It's fine, anything's okay.

882
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,120
I always forget.

883
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,680
Anything's fine.

884
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,360
It's okay.

885
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,920
If anything goes overboard later,

886
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,800
don't take it to heart.

887
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,480
It's fine.

888
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,040
Please.

889
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,680
It's okay.

890
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,040
Gong Jun

891
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,920
Bro

892
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,040
Come on, bro.

893
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,920
I was wrong, bro.

894
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,480
This is Gong Jun.

895
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm Chen Xingxu.

896
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,160
Gong Jun

897
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,320
Hello, bro.

898
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,080
Hello.

899
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,400
Hello.

900
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,120
Offended.

901
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,040
Offended.

902
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,800
I've got it here.

903
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,640
Who is he dealing with?

904
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,200
I don't know.

905
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,880
Swan.

906
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,680
Hello everyone, I'm Chen He.

907
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,560
Thirty-nine years old.

908
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,160
Male.

909
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,040
This is actually quite pretty.

910
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,400
Hello.

911
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,920
He Ge

912
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,560
Hello

913
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
He Ge

914
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
You seem a bit burdened.

915
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,800
I'm not burdened.

916
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,520
Are you in a bad mood?

917
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
No

918
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,760
Your makeup looks a bit cakey today.

919
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,880
Just now, I...

920
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,960
It's a bit hot.

921
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,280
It's my first time participating.

922
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
It's really hot.

923
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Your outfit today is...

924
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,840
What do you mean?

925
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,560
Do you know how hot it is?

926
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,120
You're wearing so much.

927
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,520
Take one layer off.

928
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:46,840
Take one layer off.

929
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,640
Relax a bit.

930
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,240
Is it that you can't take off this outfit, right?

931
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,960
No, that's not it.

932
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,680
The main thing is...

933
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,440
Sit

934
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,160
Come

935
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,520
Let's talk about our show.

936
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,480
Suddenly shout out.

937
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Xingxu, shout.

938
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Shout loudly.

939
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,360
What, is your mind somewhere else?

940
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,680
No

941
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,040
No

942
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,920
Let me introduce myself first.

943
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,480
My name is Chen Xingxu.

944
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm from Shenyang.

945
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:19,960
From Shenyang.

946
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,320
Yes.

947
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,520
Shout loudly.

948
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,600
Yell as loud as you can.

949
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,680
How come he didn't hear? Feels like it.

950
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,920
Feels like he didn't hear.

951
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,400
Maybe there's something wrong with the earbud.

952
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm Chen He.

953
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,640
I'm from Fujian.

954
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,760
He didn't hear.

955
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,440
It's out of battery.

956
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,520
Xingxu, shout.

957
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,160
It's out of battery.

958
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,000
Tell him to come out and change it.

959
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,480
Switch to one with battery.

960
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,240
Pause for a moment.

961
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,360
Pause quickly.

962
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,680
Me.

963
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,800
I'm twenty-nine.

964
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,600
Twenty-nine.

965
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm thirty-nine.

966
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,320
Stop for a moment.

967
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,280
Tell him to come in.

968
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,320
It's not a full round yet, still okay.

969
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,920
Honglei is older.

970
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Can you hear?

971
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
If you can hear, blow your nose.

972
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:57,960
I can hear.

973
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,760
He can hear.

974
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,400
Suddenly shout out loud.

975
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,280
Shout loudly.

976
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,000
Are we on a date?

977
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,760
Not loud enough, shout again.

978
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,240
Like in those fantasy dramas.

979
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
The kind where you howl at the sky.

980
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,880
Yes.

981
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,680
When the forest is big,

982
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,640
there are all kinds of birds.

983
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,360
Take off your jacket and put it on Chen He.

984
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,040
Take off your jacket.

985
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,800
Give it.

986
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,560
Put it on him.

987
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,480
You look a bit cold.

988
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,400
Take off your jacket and put it on Chen He.

989
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,600
Take off your jacket and put it on Brother He.

990
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,760
Take off your jacket and put it on Chen He.

991
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,639
Let me guess.

992
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,880
Is someone controlling you?

993
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,000
He guessed it.

994
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,760
No.

995
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,639
No?

996
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,600
Feels like your brain is all in your ears.

997
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:40,920
Now.

998
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,320
No.

999
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,320
I think

1000
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,600
the person controlling you isn't very creative.

1001
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,320
So far,

1002
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,840
it's average.

1003
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,080
Pretty average.

1004
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Go over and give him a kiss.

1005
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,360
Go hug Brother He.

1006
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,720
Go hug him.

1007
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,640
Just ahead.

1008
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,920
The ones who came in first, right?

1009
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Take off your clothes.

1010
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,960
Put it on him.

1011
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,440
Take off your clothes and put them on him.

1012
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:08,800
No.

1013
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,760
No.

1014
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,120
Why are you talking to yourself?

1015
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,800
No.

1016
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,200
No.

1017
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Wait a bit, then jump twice.

1018
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,920
Isn't this surveillance?

1019
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
Is this machine for surveillance?

1020
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,560
How did I not notice?

1021
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,080
No.

1022
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm speechless.

1023
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,640
It's over.

1024
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,240
It's over.

1025
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,040
Xingxu, give the earpiece to He.

1026
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,680
Wait a second.

1027
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,360
Someone wants to talk to you.

1028
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,840
You're reacting pretty quickly now.

1029
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,040
He.

1030
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:54,920
Bro.

1031
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,560
Alright.

1032
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
Now that we know you have an earpiece in your ear,

1033
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,680
it's not fun anymore.

1034
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,400
Yeah.

1035
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,440
You need to switch to someone else.

1036
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,720
Do I have an earpiece?

1037
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,080
Seems like it's all the same.

1038
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,360
Alright.

1039
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,440
You guys do it yourselves.

1040
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,400
Come on, let's do it normally this time.

1041
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,920
Why did you come to join this variety show?

1042
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,200
Wait a minute.

1043
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,040
How did it get reversed?

1044
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,080
No.

1045
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,720
Bro, no.

1046
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,120
This is a reverse move.

1047
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,200
Someone just asked me a question.

1048
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,920
He said, "He,"

1049
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,120
"Do you think you're more handsome, or is Honglei more handsome?"

1050
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,360
What do you think?

1051
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,800
But to be honest, He,

1052
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,200
bro,

1053
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,920
who do you think is more handsome, you or me?

1054
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,520
bro,

1055
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,000
in previous shows,

1056
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,840
you were called the "King of Looks."

1057
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,520
My nickname is

1058
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,080
"Face Demon."

1059
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,520
How about this:

1060
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,680
for this show,

1061
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,400
since it's the first episode anyway,

1062
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,680
right?

1063
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,760
all the way to the end,

1064
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,160
let's have an online vote.

1065
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,880
Sure.

1066
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
I accept the challenge.

1067
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,320
Also,

1068
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,560
let's include Li Naiwen too.

1069
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,080
How about finding a scapegoat?

1070
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,320
You know what Naiwen said,

1071
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,480
he wouldn't do variety shows.

1072
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,400
He said he couldn't do variety shows.

1073
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,800
But now,

1074
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,520
he's on every variety show.

1075
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,080
This guy is unbelievable.

1076
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,760
You don't have headphones.

1077
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,520
So you're not going to talk?

1078
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,280
People who are more introverted

1079
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,920
need to get more familiar with everyone.

1080
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,880
So, the more introverted Xingxu

1081
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,680
should stay a bit longer.

1082
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,120
What did he say?

1083
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,680
Hege left.

1084
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,760
Left him here again.

1085
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,360
Bro,

1086
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,080
you already guessed it.

1087
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,280
Yeah, it was so obvious.

1088
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,560
Sit.

1089
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,360
Come on, bro.

1090
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,880
Liu Yuning.

1091
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,080
You're so tall.

1092
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,760
How are you so tall?

1093
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,880
Come over here for a bit.

1094
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,680
Direct us, you be the director.

1095
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,440
You take over for a while.

1096
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,600
Bro, you have to make sure to

1097
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,760
You saw, as soon as I came in,

1098
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,080
I felt like you were being controlled by someone.

1099
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
You have to

1100
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,720
make sure you're flawless.

1101
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,960
Leave no trace.

1102
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,000
Xingxu, let me tell you,

1103
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,040
if you don't do this well,

1104
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,600
how will directors cast you in the future?

1105
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,040
Exactly.

1106
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,360
Now the fighting spirit is here.

1107
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,280
Who?

1108
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,280
No idea who it is.

1109
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,360
Hello, everyone.

1110
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
I'm the actor Li Naiwen.

1111
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,560
I was born before the 90s.

1112
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,880
Not yet sixty.

1113
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,680
Libra.

1114
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,000
What are you doing?

1115
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,840
Blind date.

1116
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,080
And my height,

1117
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,800
used to be 1.8 meters.

1118
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,400
Now I've shrunk a bit.

1119
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,080
Shrunk to about 1.79 meters.

1120
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,080
If you could choose one person

1121
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,920
you'd most like to get close to,

1122
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,120
who would you choose?

1123
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,160
Maybe

1124
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,480
Chen Xingxu.

1125
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,960
Because I

1126
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,640
looked up his information.

1127
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,800
He graduated from the Central Academy of Drama.

1128
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,880
Right?

1129
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
We could talk about

1130
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,080
who your teacher was.

1131
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,040
He might be my junior.

1132
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,120
Very likely.

1133
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,360
He's probably my junior.

1134
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,000
Hello.

1135
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,520
Hello, uncle.

1136
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,200
Hello, uncle.

1137
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,000
Hello, uncle.

1138
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,600
He's my junior.

1139
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,120
Hello, uncle.

1140
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,560
Greet first.

1141
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,040
Then say "Hello, uncle."

1142
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,160
See?

1143
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,040
Don't show your expression.

1144
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,480
Don't let your expression show.

1145
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,360
Brother

1146
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,120
Brother

1147
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,040
Don't say it like that.

1148
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,080
Hello.

1149
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,640
Hi.

1150
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,240
Watch your words.

1151
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
Junior

1152
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,400
Right.

1153
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Old trick.

1154
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,000
Still calling me junior?

1155
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,280
He called you uncle.

1156
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,720
Come, sit.

1157
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,600
Why did you call me uncle?

1158
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,120
Who taught you that?

1159
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,200
Push-ups.

1160
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,560
Start doing push-ups.

1161
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,280
Hurry.

1162
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,960
What year were you born?

1163
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,720
Me?

1164
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,400
Born in 1996.

1165
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,600
Hurry, push-ups.

1166
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,160
Wait a second.

1167
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm a bit warm.

1168
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm a little nervous.

1169
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,480
A little nervous.

1170
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,880
No.

1171
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,120
Is this how people greet each other now?

1172
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
Then let me return the gesture.

1173
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,600
Don't.

1174
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,760
Don't.

1175
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,720
Don't.

1176
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,960
No, I'm just warming up.

1177
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm just warming up.

1178
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,560
You're nervous.

1179
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,160
A little.

1180
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,560
What are you nervous about?

1181
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,520
Don't sit down yet.

1182
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,600
I just worked out, you know.

1183
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,440
Feel it.

1184
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,400
I just...

1185
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,240
You...

1186
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,160
Go ahead.

1187
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,600
Take a look at this.

1188
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,520
I've been working out lately.

1189
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,960
Right?

1190
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,720
Not bad.

1191
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,280
Not bad.

1192
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,680
What do you mean?

1193
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,280
Working out.

1194
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,440
Come here.

1195
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,440
Actually, just warming up.

1196
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,920
I don't work out.

1197
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Feel this.

1198
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
There's actually a little bit.

1199
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,080
Not bad.

1200
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,440
Right?

1201
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,880
Not bad.

1202
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,560
Pinch him.

1203
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,240
Pinch him.

1204
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,880
Really.

1205
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,720
But about you...

1206
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,480
Don't pinch me.

1207
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,360
No.

1208
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,480
I just did that fascia treatment a couple of days ago.

1209
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,800
Really?

1210
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,480
It hurt a lot.

1211
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,920
That's because...

1212
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,480
So do you usually do any cardio or something?

1213
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,760
Right?

1214
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,480
My cardio is just breathing.

1215
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,280
My cardio is just breathing.

1216
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,240
Breathing.

1217
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,320
Then can you teach me, uncle?

1218
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,240
Uncle, can you teach me this?

1219
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,400
Watch your mouth.

1220
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,880
Just call me senior.

1221
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,200
Senior.

1222
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,840
Master Naiwen.

1223
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,880
As for breathing...

1224
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,640
Is there any...

1225
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,880
Do you have your own unique method?

1226
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,280
Breathing goes like this.

1227
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
What are you laughing at?

1228
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
I'm being serious.

1229
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,200
Are you for real?

1230
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,280
You really want to talk about this?

1231
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,400
Breathing is like this.

1232
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,480
Look, we...

1233
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
Didn't we all have diction classes at Central Academy of Drama?

1234
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,040
Yeah.

1235
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,200
Hurry up, I don't want to hear it.

1236
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,320
Go ahead, I don't want to listen.

1237
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Since back then...

1238
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,480
Actually, what the teacher taught...

1239
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,360
Forget it.

1240
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,160
I'm not listening.

1241
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,520
Not listening.

1242
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,560
I'm not listening.

1243
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,160
Not listening.

1244
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
As soon as you mention that...

1245
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,680
Can I start cursing?

1246
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,080
Little brother, take off your shoes.

1247
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,040
No, what do you want to know?

1248
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,120
Put the coat over him.

1249
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,200
Are you guys setting me up?

1250
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,080
No.

1251
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,400
Your name is Chen Xingxu, right?

1252
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,240
Yes, I'm Chen Xingxu.

1253
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,160
Are you feeling a bit...

1254
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Don't catch a cold.

1255
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:50,840
Wait a moment.

1256
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,600
No.

1257
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,440
I'm hot.

1258
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,880
Really hot.

1259
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,760
Honglei.

1260
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,280
Exactly the same reaction as you.

1261
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,040
Got scared.

1262
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,680
Like this.

1263
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,160
The two of us...

1264
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,280
Come on.

1265
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,240
Let me tell you.

1266
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,480
My joint hurt for a moment.

1267
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,360
It's too high.

1268
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,640
Little brother.

1269
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,840
Since we're fellow disciples,

1270
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,640
let's become sworn brothers right here today.

1271
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Otherwise...

1272
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,240
We, as fellow disciples,

1273
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,000
the two of us, right here,

1274
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,440
let's swear brotherhood.

1275
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,000
Wait a minute.

1276
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,800
Do you have a mission?

1277
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,840
I don't have a mission.

1278
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,440
Do you know me?

1279
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,280
Let's just become sworn brothers.

1280
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,360
I...

1281
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,120
You already call me uncle.

1282
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,280
I don't need to know you.

1283
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,600
I don't need to know you.

1284
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,920
Really, I don't need to know you.

1285
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,080
You don't?

1286
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,480
That's right.

1287
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,920
What if I'm a bad person?

1288
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,880
It doesn't matter.

1289
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,680
I actually like bad ones.

1290
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,520
I just...

1291
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,680
like bad ones.

1292
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,760
I just like bad ones.

1293
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,480
Uncle isn't a bad person.

1294
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,320
The child just doesn't like him.

1295
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,440
Anyway, there are a few who are even worse.

1296
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,840
I wonder if they're setting me up.

1297
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,680
Why are we swearing brotherhood again?

1298
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,880
And putting a robe on me again?

1299
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,680
I think that's enough.

1300
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,760
That's enough.

1301
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,520
Bro, I'm really not that kind of person.

1302
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,720
I was being controlled.

1303
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,160
By whom?

1304
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,320
Whatever they told me to do,

1305
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,400
I had to do it.

1306
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,440
Bro, I really...

1307
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,440
I'm sorry.

1308
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,560
Wait a second.

1309
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,280
Who?

1310
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,960
Thanks for your hard work.

1311
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Who's controlling this?

1312
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,440
Are you the one controlling it?

1313
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,320
Yeah, it's me. So what?

1314
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,320
It's me.

1315
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,360
Take a break.

1316
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,000
Why did you tell the kid to call me uncle?

1317
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,400
It's because of your age.

1318
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,200
Xingxu.

1319
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,280
Thanks for your hard work.

1320
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,040
It's nothing.

1321
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,880
Do you not want to record anymore?

1322
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,920
Are you leaving?

1323
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,520
I'm leaving.

1324
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,560
Come on, Xingxu.

1325
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,520
That's great.

1326
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,600
Hello.

1327
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,920
You look so nervous.

1328
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,200
No, I'm not.

1329
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,840
Come on.

1330
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,400
Thanks for your hard work.

1331
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Bro.

1332
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,640
Honglei.

1333
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,400
Bro.

1334
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,120
Have a seat.

1335
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,000
You come up with something.

1336
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,880
Revenge.

1337
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,560
Let's do it together.

1338
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,040
No.

1339
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't dare.

1340
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,240
Revenge.

1341
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,880
Give me another headset, right?

1342
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,880
Why wear a headset?

1343
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,200
Wear a headset to give ideas.

1344
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,920
Honglei is controlling the two of us.

1345
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,120
Honglei.

1346
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,960
Go easy on us.

1347
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,520
Who's up next?

1348
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Hello, everyone.

1349
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,120
I'm actress Wang Yuwen.

1350
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,320
I'm about to turn twenty-eight.

1351
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Because I'm a very spontaneous person,

1352
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,760
I hope to find someone who connects with me on a soul level,

1353
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,400
who acts on their ideas as soon as they have them,

1354
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,320
and is a bit abstract as a friend.

1355
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,920
Hello.

1356
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,440
Hello.

1357
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,360
Hello.

1358
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,960
Naiwen.

1359
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,120
Nice to meet you.

1360
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,400
Hello.

1361
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm Xiao Wang.

1362
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,480
Wang Yuwen.

1363
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,160
Hello.

1364
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,000
Have a seat.

1365
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,240
Hello, He.

1366
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,320
Aren't you two going to sit?

1367
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,600
This is the usual routine.

1368
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,480
Should I sit in the middle?

1369
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:17,800
Yes.

1370
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,400
Is that okay?

1371
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,120
Sit.

1372
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,120
Good morning.

1373
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,280
What are you doing?

1374
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,680
Smile and look at her.

1375
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,400
You guys can sit too.

1376
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,360
What do you mean?

1377
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,280
I'm not getting up.

1378
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,800
So bold.

1379
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,880
That's just her personality.

1380
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,480
Yeah.

1381
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,440
I think

1382
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,880
you guys can sit too, right?

1383
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,480
This stool

1384
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,440
isn't it prepared for us?

1385
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,440
You two

1386
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,040
Let's open a bottle of Mizone now.

1387
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,280
Open a bottle of Mizone and drink it all at once.

1388
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,400
Why did you come to this show?

1389
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,760
Why did you come to this show?

1390
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,480
Why did you come to this show?

1391
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,040
Because they told me

1392
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,720
that I could, um...

1393
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,600
He just came on his own.

1394
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:20,960
They told me

1395
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,840
that no one does abstract stuff on this show.

1396
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,120
I'm really impressed.

1397
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,240
Did you guys come here tipsy?

1398
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,560
No.

1399
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,400
Very drunk.

1400
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,560
Very drunk.

1401
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,960
I can tell.

1402
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,880
Wang Yuwen, I really...

1403
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,160
Just Yuwen.

1404
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,480
Just Yuwen.

1405
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,880
I really don't want to work with you.

1406
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,960
I actually didn't want to come to this variety show.

1407
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,880
I really don't feel well.

1408
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,920
I'm very uncomfortable.

1409
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,840
Which one of you said it?

1410
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,840
Come on.

1411
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,200
Come on.

1412
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,000
One, two.

1413
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,160
What do you mean?

1414
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,320
I...

1415
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,680
Let me tell you.

1416
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,920
Let me tell you.

1417
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Listen carefully.

1418
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,880
No, you have to speak honestly.

1419
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,120
I...

1420
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,320
I don't really want to work with you.

1421
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,200
Actually, it's just this show.

1422
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,280
And then...

1423
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,280
And there's also this.

1424
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,920
Why are you all wearing headsets?

1425
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,040
It's over.

1426
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,880
It's over, we've been found out.

1427
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,080
Earpiece.

1428
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,760
Hearing aid.

1429
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,680
Okay.

1430
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,760
Both of us have bad hearing.

1431
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,680
Alright.

1432
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,080
Yeah, right, as if I’d believe you.

1433
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,160
Do you really have to obey the voice in your earpiece

1434
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,280
so obediently?

1435
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,560
Yeah, why do we have to listen to him so much?

1436
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,640
Yeah, why?

1437
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,200
Can’t we just take it off?

1438
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,160
Not at all.

1439
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,160
We totally fooled them.

1440
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,360
After our first small group meeting,

1441
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,560
maybe we’ve warmed up to a “medium rare” level.

1442
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,360
Welcome everyone to "Earth Super Fresh."

1443
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,840
Now we can match names to faces.

1444
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,080
The story has just begun.

1445
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,720
This is the start of our journey.

1446
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,200
Our social “steak” is medium rare.

1447
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,480
It’s time to flip it over.

1448
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,920
Let’s cook it a bit more with some honesty.

1449
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,880
Next,

1450
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,240
we hope everyone can be open with each other.

1451
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,240
Let’s get to “medium” as soon as possible.

1452
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,440
Please go change your clothes.

1453
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,680
That open, huh?

1454
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,880
Alright.

1455
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,560
Let’s get to know each other better, then.

1456
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,880
Let’s go.

1457
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,760
Okay.

1458
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,440
Has Xingxu already broken down?

1459
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,920
I really am broken.

1460
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,200
I'll sit here.

1461
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,600
Everyone likes to sit by the edge.

1462
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
Then I'll sit next to you.

1463
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,120
Okay.

1464
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,000
Come on, bro.

1465
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,560
Just like the old man.

1466
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,520
There's nothing you can do about it.

1467
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,400
For one thing, he's already this old.

1468
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,840
Uncle Wen.

1469
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,800
Uncle Wen.

1470
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,160
I wasn't familiar with any of you before.

1471
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,880
Even with Naiwen, us...

1472
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,040
See, I even told them,

1473
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,720
I said, back in school,

1474
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,640
we were really close.

1475
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,800
Did I mistake you for someone else?

1476
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,280
Let me say something.

1477
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,480
While we were waiting outside just now,

1478
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,080
he was still memorizing everyone's names.

1479
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,800
That's right.

1480
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,160
I said,

1481
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,160
Chen Xingxu.

1482
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,400
Right?

1483
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,920
Liu Yuning.

1484
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,440
Right?

1485
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,160
Wang Yuwen.

1486
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,840
And then "Gong Qijun."

1487
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,960
"Gong Qijun."

1488
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,480
"Gong Qijun"

1489
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,960
I was just scared to death.

1490
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,960
"Gong Qijun"

1491
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,360
This name is so easy to say.

1492
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,560
"Gong Qijun"

1493
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,680
It's really fun.

1494
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,080
You called my name.

1495
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,560
He was

1496
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,080
completely confused.

1497
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,720
It's his first time on a variety show.

1498
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,040
It's so hard for me.

1499
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,360
I always hear them tell me

1500
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,480
Gong Jun

1501
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,960
In my impression, it should be

1502
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,160
someone as good-looking as Xing Xu.

1503
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
He is pretty good-looking.

1504
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,880
When he said that

1505
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,520
can you cut me out of the shot?

1506
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,840
What do you mean?

1507
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,840
You didn't get it?

1508
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:08,880
I didn't get it.

1509
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,360
It's okay.

1510
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,280
Just watch the show.

1511
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,960
I really didn't expect it.

1512
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,600
There's even something about headphones.

1513
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,840
I didn't notice it at all.

1514
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,600
I just thought Liu Yuning

1515
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,400
I mean now

1516
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,720
this young version

1517
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,880
the 2025 new model

1518
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
What happened to them before?

1519
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,520
And there's another one who's always

1520
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,720
always offline.

1521
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,560
Did you see this?

1522
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,680
I once heard Jiaojiao tell me

1523
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,240
I mean, my wife.

1524
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,200
She said I'm a looks-obsessed guy.

1525
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,160
I said, then I need to think about that.

1526
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

1527
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm listening.

1528
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,200
And then

1529
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,080
she said,

1530
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,960
"You're a guy who's obsessed with looks."

1531
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,160
Do you want me to translate for you now?

1532
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,840
Yes.

1533
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,760
I think, except for the three of us,

1534
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,360
everyone else looks good.

1535
00:52:59,160 --> 00:52:59,760
You two—

1536
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,360
That's between you two.

1537
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,600
Alright.

1538
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,800
It's your business.

1539
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,760
When Chen He was thin,

1540
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,120
he was actually pretty handsome.

1541
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,600
I don't think so.

1542
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,040
He is

1543
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,360
ugly-handsome, you know, ugly but handsome.

1544
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,680
Well said.

1545
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,960
Yuwen, you can't do that.

1546
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,000
Sis, you're really bold.

1547
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,440
Sis.

1548
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,200
Yuwen, sum it up for us.

1549
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,800
Sis.

1550
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,280
Naiwen also said it.

1551
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,440
Earlier, we were still memorizing names.

1552
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,240
That shows we're not familiar enough with each other.

1553
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,240
That's right.

1554
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,120
At most, we're only a little familiar.

1555
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,040
Next, we need to get to know each other better.

1556
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,720
It's important as good friends

1557
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,240
to always compliment your good friends.

1558
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,920
But good friends usually don't compliment each other.

1559
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:43,920
They usually tease.

1560
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,560
They all tease.

1561
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,400
We've been teasing each other for a while now.

1562
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,840
In a moment,

1563
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,720
one-on-one,

1564
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,160
you must compliment the other person.

1565
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:50,920
Okay.

1566
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,160
Both people compliment each other.

1567
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,320
There must be physical contact at the same time.

1568
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,240
And make eye contact.

1569
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,920
The one being complimented must reply

1570
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,480
"Of course!"

1571
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,720
Of course!

1572
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,720
When being complimented,

1573
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,880
if someone laughs,

1574
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,480
they lose.

1575
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,240
I can't take it anymore.

1576
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,360
No.

1577
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,240
If you don't say anything, no one wants to laugh.

1578
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,040
But when you say we can't laugh,

1579
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,080
I already want to laugh.

1580
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,960
Yeah.

1581
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,200
It's hard.

1582
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,120
I definitely won't team up with Liu Yuning.

1583
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,840
I can give you a massage.

1584
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,680
I'm a professional at ear cleaning.

1585
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,720
I can massage your legs.

1586
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,640
I want to team up with Brother Honglei.

1587
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,120
Why?

1588
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,720
He thinks

1589
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,240
He...

1590
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,920
No, I can't do it.

1591
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,560
I can't keep translating for you.

1592
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,280
I'm really tired.

1593
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,160
I have to listen to what's being said here,

1594
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,240
and I still have to translate for you.

1595
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,560
How can you not laugh when you look at him?

1596
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,480
Why?

1597
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,080
And why again?

1598
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,960
That's too scary.

1599
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,920
Let's pick who everyone thinks

1600
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,040
is a challenger we can take on.

1601
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,200
Go with the flow.

1602
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,320
I'm just here watching the show.

1603
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
This variety show appearance really traumatized you.

1604
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,120
Let me tell you.

1605
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,120
First time on a variety show,

1606
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:23,920
and you wanted to quit right away.

1607
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,400
Come on.

1608
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,160
Let's play "Black and White."

1609
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,080
It's just palm up or palm down.

1610
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,840
Palm up or palm down.

1611
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,240
Let's go.

1612
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,800
Black and White.

1613
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,040
Whoever loses goes down.

1614
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,920
Bro, the three of us will go down.

1615
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,560
The loser plays.

1616
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,760
Let's do rock-paper-scissors, the three of us.

1617
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,560
Okay, let's do it.

1618
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:37,840
Come on.

1619
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

1620
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,840
Then you two.

1621
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
You two go first.

1622
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,640
Go ahead.

1623
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:49,960
Please.

1624
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,240
Go.

1625
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,040
Go ahead.

1626
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,560
Which side are you sitting on?

1627
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,200
I'm sitting on this side.

1628
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,040
Come on.

1629
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,080
Let's have some physical contact.

1630
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,520
Those two.

1631
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,560
Excuse me.

1632
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,400
Did you two know each other before?

1633
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,320
The person I'm least familiar with is probably this girl.

1634
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,160
Jun.

1635
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,640
Not familiar.

1636
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,080
Did you two just meet today?

1637
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,320
Yes.

1638
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,160
Is this your first time meeting?

1639
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,560
I guess so.

1640
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:18,960
Yes.

1641
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,640
So you two are already holding hands.

1642
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,520
Isn't that the rule?

1643
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,120
Then you go first.

1644
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,960
I'll go first.

1645
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:35,800
Gong Jun.

1646
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,640
Are you the one in the whole world

1647
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,680
who sings the best?

1648
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,000
Are you the one in the whole world

1649
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,920
who sings the best?

1650
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,120
Fake and noisy.

1651
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,040
Don't be afraid.

1652
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,280
Of course.

1653
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,040
He really admits this.

1654
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,320
He really admits it.

1655
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,480
Is this year's goal to sing well?

1656
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,600
Sure.

1657
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,320
Become a singer.

1658
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,680
Sing your theme song.

1659
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,920
That really hits home.

1660
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,640
You said exactly what I feel.

1661
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,520
Aren't you a singer?

1662
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,680
Yes, I sing.

1663
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,440
So you admit he's the best at singing.

1664
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,880
Yes.

1665
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,960
Come on.

1666
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,480
Keep going.

1667
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,600
He also acts.

1668
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,080
There's even someone from the musical theater class.

1669
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,680
Start.

1670
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,000
I sing well too.

1671
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,600
I'm not bad at singing either.

1672
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,000
How about showing off a bit?

1673
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,840
Why don't you guys try?

1674
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,760
Sorry.

1675
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,680
Why don't you guys try?

1676
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,120
Come on.

1677
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,360
Naiwen.

1678
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,200
My bad.

1679
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,360
I'm sorry.

1680
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,000
Give the two of us some background music.

1681
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,720
Put it in the background.

1682
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,080
You interrupt as soon as he speaks.

1683
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,360
Sorry.

1684
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,080
Sit.

1685
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,000
Come on.

1686
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:46,880
Alright.

1687
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,720
Continue.

1688
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,200
Alright, it's my turn to compliment you.

1689
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,240
I think it should be a bit more cheesy.

1690
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,320
Make it as cheesy as possible.

1691
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,480
"Gong Qijun"

1692
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,560
Make it cheesier.

1693
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,880
Make it as cheesy as possible.

1694
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,040
Your face is so small.

1695
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,160
Why?

1696
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,240
I lost.

1697
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,280
They all fell to the ground.

1698
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,520
That means you lost.

1699
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,600
Yeah, I lost.

1700
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,120
The eliminated person picks the next one.

1701
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,840
Ning, your turn.

1702
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,640
Okay, I'll go.

1703
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,480
Come on.

1704
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,840
Go.

1705
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,760
Come on.

1706
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,000
Come on, okay.

1707
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,840
Alright, here I come.

1708
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,040
Good friends usually don't compliment each other.

1709
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,840
They just tease.

1710
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,480
Your nose is really high.

1711
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,800
You’re pulling this on me?

1712
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,160
Right?

1713
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
So that’s how you play it.

1714
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,560
Isn’t this how it’s supposed to go?

1715
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,040
Alright.

1716
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,440
That’s how it’s done.

1717
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:03,920
I’m leaving.

1718
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,880
You pick the next one.

1719
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,840
You pick the next one.

1720
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,160
It’s you.

1721
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,040
I absolutely won’t team up with Liu Yuning.

1722
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,520
I request to be with Brother Honglei.

1723
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,280
Bro.

1724
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,120
Come on, bro.

1725
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,280
Come on.

1726
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,320
Nice to meet you, Brother Honglei.

1727
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,080
I’m a bit cold, bro.

1728
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,360
Let me warm you up.

1729
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,760
Nice to meet you, Brother Honglei.

1730
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,480
I’m a bit cold, bro.

1731
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,360
Let me warm you up.

1732
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,560
Come on, that’s fine.

1733
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,960
It’s okay, bro.

1734
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,240
Wait a second.

1735
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,200
Let me tell you.

1736
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,280
Get a little closer, bro.

1737
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,680
Physical contact.

1738
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,960
So awkward, bro.

1739
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,880
Feels like I just set up a chair.

1740
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,320
Bro, you have to look at him.

1741
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,040
Bro.

1742
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,920
Your eyes are so big.

1743
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,720
Of course.

1744
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,240
Yuning.

1745
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,800
Seeing you, my heart is racing.

1746
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,520
This is too hard.

1747
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,200
I lost.

1748
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,440
Let me try.

1749
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,160
Naiwen, come here.

1750
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,280
Come on, bro.

1751
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,200
You sit down.

1752
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,560
I challenge you.

1753
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,200
Trying to run away?

1754
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,720
Come on.

1755
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,280
Can you stop covering your mouth?

1756
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,040
This face right in front of me...

1757
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,400
Everything below his eyes...

1758
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,480
I can't look at it.

1759
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,480
Come on.

1760
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,640
Wait a second.

1761
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,280
Not seeing you off.

1762
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,200
Hold on.

1763
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,720
Slowly.

1764
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,120
Are you ready?

1765
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,040
Naiwen.

1766
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,720
Isn't this called "harassment"?

1767
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,400
Come.

1768
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,120
Okay.

1769
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,360
Naiwen.

1770
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,840
You really are beautiful.

1771
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,840
Of course I am.

1772
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,360
I got it.

1773
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,400
The hard part is

1774
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,000
when it comes to

1775
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,840
Of course, it's

1776
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,600
It really is.

1777
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,320
If you had even a bit of

1778
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,840
self-awareness,

1779
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,640
you really couldn't say that.

1780
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:16,760
I lost.

1781
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,560
He, you're good at this, right?

1782
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,320
Come on, man.

1783
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,560
He, hurry up.

1784
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,560
Of course.

1785
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,600
Go ahead.

1786
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,480
You can do it!

1787
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,440
What's this?

1788
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,200
Absorbing the essence of the sun and moon.

1789
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,600
Give it a try.

1790
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,640
He, you...

1791
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:45,800
Your weight...

1792
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,240
With your weight...

1793
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,400
With your weight...

1794
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,640
Judging by how my fingers feel,

1795
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,040
it must be about this much.

1796
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,560
Too heavy.

1797
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,000
Come on.

1798
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,480
You know,

1799
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,720
it's actually pretty hard.

1800
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,720
You know,

1801
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:29,800
watching from the side,

1802
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,920
it didn't seem that hard.

1803
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,680
I'm sweating.

1804
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,560
I'm done for.

1805
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,960
I'm sweating.

1806
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,600
My good buddy.

1807
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,680
Look at each other.

1808
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,720
He.

1809
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,320
You're too skinny.

1810
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,400
You're too skinny.

1811
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,560
Wait a moment.

1812
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,360
Of course.

1813
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:31,680
That's not right.

1814
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,360
Why did I laugh?

1815
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,200
This is hard.

1816
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,880
This is really hard.

1817
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,520
Should I still go up?

1818
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,640
I probably don't need to go up, right?

1819
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,080
Go.

1820
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,960
Go.

1821
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,680
You have to experience it once.

1822
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,240
Xu.

1823
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:49,840
Don't take it to heart.

1824
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,760
Don't take it to heart.

1825
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,640
Here it comes.

1826
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,320
What was that just now?

1827
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:02,720
A frog.

1828
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,040
Outside interference.

1829
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
You go first, bro.

1830
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,560
I'll go first.

1831
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,080
I can do it.

1832
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,880
Jun Jun.

1833
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,040
Wait a second.

1834
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,640
What?

1835
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,320
You really are

1836
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,280
You really are

1837
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,680
as good-looking as I imagined.

1838
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,600
Of course.

1839
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,560
Very confident.

1840
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,600
That's great.

1841
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,960
Honglei.

1842
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,520
Your hairline

1843
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,760
is much better than mine.

1844
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,600
Much better.

1845
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,480
Of course.

1846
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,160
Everyone is very confident.

1847
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,880
Xingxu.

1848
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,400
Should we fast-forward this part?

1849
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,800
Xingxu

1850
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,640
I think your acting is really good.

1851
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,160
Really good acting.

1852
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,160
You lost.

1853
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,720
Honglei won.

1854
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,360
Me, I...

1855
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,480
Impressive.

1856
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,880
Of course.

1857
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,960
Of course.

1858
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,000
Can you stop practicing?

1859
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,160
He keeps practicing right next to me.

1860
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,920
Of course.

1861
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:25,600
No.

1862
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,360
Your hearing is amazing.

1863
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,280
Already getting into character.

1864
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,880
Really showing conviction now.

1865
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,880
Say ten different

1866
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,360
ways to say "of course."

1867
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,600
Of course.

1868
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,520
Of course.

1869
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,240
Why do I feel like I can do it again?

1870
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,280
Let's have a one-on-one.

1871
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,200
Come on.

1872
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,040
Come on.

1873
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,080
Honglei, let me have a one-on-one with him.

1874
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,720
This is a personal grudge.

1875
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,480
Personal grudge.

1876
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,080
He thinks he can do it now.

1877
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,240
Of course.

1878
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,560
Of course.

1879
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,880
Of course.

1880
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,160
Very confident.

1881
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,320
Do you want me to say it,

1882
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,640
or do you want to say it?

1883
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,920
Naiwen

1884
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,360
You are the

1885
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,440
cutest person I've ever met.

1886
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,320
Hold it in.

1887
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,480
A tacit understanding quietly begins to grow.

1888
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,520
A medium-rare social thermometer.

1889
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,840
Finally starts to steadily rise.

1890
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,440
But making new friends

1891
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,920
might need a little physical help.

1892
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,800
30 degrees.

1893
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,160
I'm especially good at withstanding the steam.

1894
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,040
The first time I went to a sauna

1895
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,399
was when a classmate took me.

1896
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,840
That was my first sauna experience in my life.

1897
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,600
I just felt comfortable inside.

1898
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,760
Then all my classmates thought

1899
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,080
I had "died" in there.

1900
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,560
It's so hot.

1901
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,840
Is it really this hot?

1902
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,080
Everyone is already almost medium-rare.

1903
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,960
So how

1904
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,600
can we get closer to medium-well?

1905
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,520
This room

1906
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,600
is now a 50-degree room.

1907
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,319
Not familiar

1908
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,240
Steamed until cooked

1909
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:05,359
Pun based on similar sounds

1910
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:05,880
Okay

1911
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,120
This challenge is called "We're All the Same"

1912
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,040
We'll randomly split into two groups on the spot

1913
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,080
You need to find among your group members

1914
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,120
three things you have in common

1915
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,160
If most of the audience already knows it

1916
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,040
it doesn't count

1917
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,479
You have to open up your hearts

1918
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:18,479
and really talk to find some

1919
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:19,439
Alright

1920
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:20,200
Then we're doomed

1921
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,120
Just the two of us can't find anything in common

1922
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:23,800
Come on

1923
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:24,800
How about the three older brothers

1924
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,800
You guys are relatively more familiar with each other

1925
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,720
Let's do it

1926
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:28,439
Why are we sitting so close

1927
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:29,160
What does this mean

1928
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,840
Chen He can sit here alone

1929
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,520
That's enough

1930
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,760
Your weight

1931
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,319
That's actually true

1932
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:38,960
Let's spread out a bit

1933
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,840
This area

1934
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,800
Each person think of one first

1935
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,080
I think the three of us are all especially kind

1936
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,359
And as

1937
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,160
the older brothers

1938
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,400
I think we all have

1939
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,920
the ability to connect the past and the future

1940
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,200
Anything else to add?

1941
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,160
This kid is way too mischievous.

1942
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,680
What did you say?

1943
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,560
The "up" in "connecting the past and the future."

1944
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,320
Is there more?

1945
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:14,720
Up.

1946
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:16,880
That's awesome.

1947
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,840
You're ruthless.

1948
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,520
Come on, let's do a group "hot hot" (cheer).

1949
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,200
No one asked you to join.

1950
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,640
This "useless teammate" has nothing to do with us.

1951
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,640
The three of us are all a bit clueless.

1952
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,280
Does this count?

1953
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,520
This counts.

1954
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,400
This one is obvious.

1955
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,040
How do you prove it?

1956
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,000
Does that even need proof?

1957
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,240
I'm fat.

1958
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,040
Would I be this fat if I weren't clueless?

1959
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,440
I clearly knew

1960
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,520
that Wang Yuwen is in this crew,

1961
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,280
but I still came.

1962
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,720
Isn't that clueless?

1963
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,240
Definitely clueless.

1964
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,640
Alright, you guys are in.

1965
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,520
The three of us at the drama academy

1966
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,040
were all known for our comedic style.

1967
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,720
That's true.

1968
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,840
This is no joke.

1969
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,080
Don't stand up, it's hot when you stand.

1970
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,000
It's really hot when you stand.

1971
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,360
Yeah.

1972
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,000
I thought I was blocking the camera.

1973
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,440
It's especially hot when you stand.

1974
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,960
Is this a common trait?

1975
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,720
I guess so.

1976
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,520
Studied acting at the drama academy.

1977
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:19,840
Yeah.

1978
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,520
In stage plays,

1979
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,120
there are only one or two in each class.

1980
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:22,720
Right.

1981
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,480
Yeah.

1982
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,400
Galyiman's "The Bench"

1983
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,600
"The Cat Who Wanted to Become Human"

1984
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,600
"The Cat Who Wanted to Become Human"

1985
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,480
"The Threepenny Opera"

1986
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,160
"The Threepenny Opera"

1987
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,640
Right?

1988
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,000
Yeah.

1989
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,120
There are countless examples.

1990
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:32,960
Yeah.

1991
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,560
And we

1992
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,840
have all performed in tragedies too.

1993
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,760
The essence of comedy is tragedy.

1994
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,040
That doesn't count.

1995
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,440
There's still one more.

1996
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,480
Do you have wisdom teeth?

1997
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,000
Did you get them removed?

1998
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,720
Removed.

1999
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,160
Removed.

2000
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,480
None of the three of us have wisdom teeth.

2001
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,120
How do we prove it?

2002
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,240
That's too abstract.

2003
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,160
Let me tell you,

2004
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,440
he unlocked your payment password.

2005
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,080
After you clicked it,

2006
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,600
you really have to open your mouth,

2007
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,920
and then verify your identity,

2008
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,880
scan your face,

2009
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,520
open your eyes,

2010
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,440
shake your head,

2011
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,800
blink your eyes,

2012
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,040
Yeah, blink.

2013
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,200
All three passed.

2014
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,520
Let them come.

2015
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:22,920
Okay.

2016
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,440
Right.

2017
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:23,760
Isn't that right?

2018
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,320
That's correct.

2019
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,880
Bro, what are you doing?

2020
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,080
Bro.

2021
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,560
Why do you get to go out?

2022
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:38,800
I'm going out.

2023
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,240
Bye.

2024
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,880
I'll cheer you on, okay?

2025
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,560
Go for it!

2026
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,120
Cheering enthusiastically!

2027
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,400
On our hands,

2028
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,280
we all have visible veins.

2029
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,360
The kind that really show.

2030
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,000
That doesn't count.

2031
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,240
Doesn't count.

2032
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,720
Bro, you're staying inside too.

2033
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,920
That's too much.

2034
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,480
You hid yourself in there.

2035
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,240
He has round hands.

2036
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,640
Then I'll reach out my "round" hand to you.

2037
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,360
Yes.

2038
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,480
Our tendons are all on the outside.

2039
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,240
This kind won't do.

2040
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,320
This kind won't do.

2041
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,520
Savory zongzi or sweet zongzi?

2042
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,880
Which do you like?

2043
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:27,960
Sweet ones.

2044
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,040
I like sweet ones too.

2045
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,120
Really?

2046
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,800
Really?

2047
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,560
Of course.

2048
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,000
Is that so?

2049
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,800
That's right.

2050
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,240
I agree.

2051
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:35,920
Sure.

2052
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,360
So childish.

2053
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,440
Our dramas

2054
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,320
all have them.

2055
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,440
Ning sings the original soundtracks for movies and TV shows.

2056
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,200
That's true.

2057
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,360
That's true.

2058
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:46,840
Say it.

2059
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,160
Including my own.

2060
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:48,960
I have some too.

2061
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,160
He also sang the theme for "Vacation of Love."

2062
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:50,960
Yes.

2063
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,520
"Till the End of the Moonlight"

2064
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,600
And "Your Lies Are Beautiful Too"

2065
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,560
"The Legend of Anle"

2066
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,760
The one we both acted in together.

2067
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,640
"Lonely Boat"

2068
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,400
I definitely sang that one myself.

2069
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,240
This one works.

2070
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,200
Give me another one.

2071
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,280
Okay.

2072
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,320
Give me an even more intense one.

2073
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,120
Like, as soon as you hear it,

2074
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,320
the audience is blown away.

2075
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:12,800
For example,

2076
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,000
you all have

2077
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,840
an unforgettable love experience.

2078
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,360
"Drink as a penalty."

2079
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,280
Give it to me.

2080
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,960
Two penalty drinks.

2081
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,520
Do you have rhinitis?

2082
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,080
No.

2083
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,720
Have you ever been an outstanding student?

2084
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,720
No.

2085
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,440
Have you ever been a team leader?

2086
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,240
No.

2087
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,080
Squad leader?

2088
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,000
No.

2089
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,520
I have an idea.

2090
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,560
You mean to say,

2091
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,360
we all love watching "Zhe Yao".

2092
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:48,880
Right?

2093
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,520
It's airing recently.

2094
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,160
On Tencent Video.

2095
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,240
That's true.

2096
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:55,480
Right?

2097
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:55,840
Yeah.

2098
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,480
I'm following the show.

2099
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,200
Of course.

2100
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:58,640
Yeah.

2101
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,200
Yeah.

2102
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,320
I love watching it so much.

2103
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,040
I watch it every day.

2104
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,200
It's so good.

2105
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,240
That doesn't count.

2106
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:06,920
Because everyone

2107
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,160
loves watching "Zhe Yao".

2108
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,320
Teacher Naiwen, tell us

2109
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,640
what story "Zhe Yao" is about.

2110
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,800
Countless heroes have bowed in admiration.

2111
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,960
That's right.

2112
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,800
That's what I mean.

2113
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,440
Isn't that so?

2114
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,120
The land is so beautiful, isn't it?

2115
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:24,840
Yes.

2116
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,880
This counts as one too.

2117
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,320
We're about to hit thirty thousand.

2118
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,480
Good buddies.

2119
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,400
Good brothers and sisters.

2120
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,000
Good brothers.

2121
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,640
Everyone has passed.

2122
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,360
Good.

2123
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,280
You're still the best.

2124
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,320
Making new friends can't be rushed.

2125
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,360
Just the right amount of warmth.

2126
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,400
Perfectly balanced.

2127
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,080
The rest is mutual understanding.

2128
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,160
It will slowly develop during the journey.

2129
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,760
Tomorrow.

2130
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,600
We will continue preparing to connect the world together.

2131
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,520
Earth Group

2132
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,120
will prepare for the upcoming journey

2133
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,320
by doing some preparations.

2134
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,920
If you think you're good-looking, stand up.

2135
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,320
You guys are so shameless.

2136
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,040
No.

2137
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,280
Who's the shameless one?

2138
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,320
So ruthless.

2139
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,120
If you're wearing pants, stand up.

2140
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,440
Four, three...

2141
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,880
Let's switch.

2142
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,560
Why are you playing dirty?

2143
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,680
One-hit kill.

2144
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,680
I'll play the pest.

2145
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,720
Such a pest.

2146
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,800
Alright.

2147
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:25,920
Such a happy bug.

2148
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,160
Sing it out.

2149
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,520
Two correct lines from the song.

2150
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,360
Passion.

2151
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,640
Why are there so many twists and turns?

2152
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,600
Gong Jun

2153
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,880
Bailing Gong Jun

2154
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,520
But Gong Jun is my idol.

2155
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,000
Thank you so much.

2156
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,800
I hope the reality show

2157
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,320
won't be edited at all.

2158
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,240
Not a single cut.

2159
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,600
Let's finish it at the Great Wall

2160
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,960
with a group performance of "You and Me."

2161
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,080
Okay.

2162
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
Come on, friends.

2163
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,040
Let's decide based on He Ge's expression

2164
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:00,960
whether to eat or not.

2165
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,640
Come on.

2166
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,040
Go ahead.

2167
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,600
Watch closely the whole time.

2168
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,240
You seem to suffer with every bite.

2169
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,640
Are you averse to food, bro?

2170
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,320
I can smell it.

2171
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,160
I know what it is now.

2172
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,040
You smelled it?

2173
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,280
It smells like Chen He.

2174
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:19,920
Let them eat it.

2175
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,040
That's good.

2176
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:26,680
I'll sit here.

2177
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,760
I don't dare sit there.

2178
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,360
Why?

2179
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,600
You don't like Teacher Chen He, right?

2180
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,760
If you feel that Brother Honglei

2181
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,720
makes you uncomfortable,

2182
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,880
you can just tell me directly.

2183
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,640
I just don't like Chen He.

2184
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,560
That's how you achieve great things.

2185
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,760
Eat well.

2186
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,000
How about this, let's play a game.

2187
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,520
We're all actors here.

2188
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,320
Director.

2189
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,280
We've practiced our line delivery.

2190
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,320
This is too easy.

2191
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,360
Are you teaching me how to do things?

2192
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,520
Man, you're playing with fire.

2193
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,880
Stop fighting.
