1
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,680
Welcome everyone to "Earth Super Fresh"

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
This is our first stop of filming

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,960
Before the journey officially begins

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,920
we'll have a

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,240
small activity to share food together

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,320
to help everyone get to know each other better

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,040
First, let's pick two team captains

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,720
You definitely deserve to be a captain, bro

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,120
Captain

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,920
Agreed?

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,680
Okay

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,160
Now we have two captains

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,680
In a moment, the two captains

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
will each pick their team members

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,160
One team is called "Solo Joy Team"

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,680
The other is "Shared Joy Team"

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,240
Soon

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840
we'll bring out various foods

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,360
The two teams will

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,760
say whether they want to eat it

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,200
or

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,440
don't want to eat it

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
For the Solo Joy Team

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,160
the captain can choose anyone

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,840
including themselves, to eat the food

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
For the Shared Joy Team

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,440
everyone must share the food

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,840
The two captains,

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
now you need to decide

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,760
who will be the captain of the Solo Fun team

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,120
and who will be the captain of the Group Fun team.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,160
You choose first, Yuning.

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,800
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,720
Whoever wins gets to choose first.

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,120
Alright.

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,640
To make it fair.

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,520
Rock, paper,

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,200
scissors!

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,320
I'll choose first.

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,640
Then I'll pick

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,360
Group Fun.

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,960
Alright, we eat together.

43
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,520
Then I have to be Solo Fun.

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,200
Right.

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,640
You decided the team type first.

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,960
Then Honglei gets to pick team members first.

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,080
I choose Xingxu.

48
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,480
He really cares about looks.

49
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
Look at me,

50
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
I looked at him so affectionately,

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,160
and he still didn't pick me.

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Bro, I choose you.

53
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,000
Come on.

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Thank you.

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,680
Bro, you fit in any team.

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,160
Right?

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,240
Then what was the point of winking at him just now?

58
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
I don't know either.

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
Let's continue.

60
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Gong Jun.

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,960
Okay, bro.

62
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,360
Then

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,920
Wen.

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,720
Alright.

65
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,160
There's one more.

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
There's still one person left unchosen.

67
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,040
I

68
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
Everyone enjoys together, or enjoy alone

69
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
Enjoying alone

70
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,160
Is this also

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,200
a natural process?

72
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
I think we should have He Ge blindfolded

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,400
and let him eat first

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,760
Then

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,880
He Ge has to eat it himself

76
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,840
and show us as an example

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,520
and say, "This one is okay"

78
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
Then make a face for us

79
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,600
I think He Ge can do it

80
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,200
Then you guys are done for

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm telling you

82
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,280
Come on

83
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,840
Go

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
Get a point for eating something good

85
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,000
Lose a point for eating something bad

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,080
Whether it's tasty or not

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
He Ge decides

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,280
Okay

89
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,760
Like this

90
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,640
Whoever loses gets punished

91
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,320
Make them stand guard at our door

92
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
I think

93
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,600
Wash everyone's socks

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
That's going too far

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
You're too ruthless, bro

96
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Washing socks is a bit gross

97
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,240
Cooking is fine too

98
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,920
Cooking

99
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,000
No

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,760
It's just washing socks, cooking, or standing guard

101
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,720
There are exactly three of us

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,440
Not a single good idea.

103
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Bro, you can't do this.

104
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,520
You think we've got this in the bag, don't you?

105
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
Bro.

106
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
What about me?

107
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,520
Then how about this.

108
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,560
I'll even act it out for you.

109
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
I have to be on the winning team, no matter what.

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,320
Alright.

111
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,520
Come on, let's go.

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Watch closely the whole time.

113
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,160
What's that expression?

114
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,040
Hege showed a look of asking for help.

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Why do I feel like I don't get it?

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
Definitely this one.

117
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,040
Can you eat this thing?

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
It's over.

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
Not eating it.

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,920
He can act it out in reverse, bro.

121
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
Makes sense.

122
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,520
Scoop it up with a spoon.

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,120
You can't pick it up with your hands.

124
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
I saw your micro-expression.

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,520
It's really sour, isn't it?

126
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,440
It's okay.

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,680
Very sour.

128
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,640
Such a complicated expression.

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Definitely not tasty.

130
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
I really don't think it'll work.

131
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
It's definitely a condiment.

132
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,520
Let me tell you guys.

133
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,400
Naiwen bro.

134
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
What do you think of this?

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,880
I think it's pretty bad.

136
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,120
I think so too.

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
He, your turn.

138
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Can I smell your mouth?

139
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,840
Stay away from me.

140
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
This is just a small part.

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't go overboard.

142
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,840
Went to smell the spoon.

143
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
This is getting a bit more intense.

144
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
Not bad.

145
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,760
You smell it.

146
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
I'll smell it.

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,880
It's fine.

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,280
Right?

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm sure this is fine.

150
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
We won't choose.

151
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,720
Then let him eat it.

152
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,080
Not choosing.

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,320
We'll eat.

154
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,800
Lift the lid.

155
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,800
What's the big deal?

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Rice with lard.

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,320
Right?

158
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah.

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,640
Tasty.

160
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,480
It's one to zero now.

161
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,160
Second dish.

162
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I ate it.

163
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
The taste is very strong.

164
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,160
You seem to suffer with every bite.

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,880
Are you a picky eater, bro?

166
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,120
Why does it feel a bit like seafood?

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,200
I'll go smell it.

168
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,200
I smell it.

169
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
I know what it is now.

170
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
You smelled it?

171
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

172
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,680
I don't want it.

173
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,560
I smell stinky tofu.

174
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,040
A whiff of Chen He.

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,120
I think this time should be fine.

176
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,880
That's Uncle Nai.

177
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,120
Wait a moment.

178
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,000
Kids,

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,040
do you want to eat?

180
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,280
Yes.

181
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,000
Go ahead, then.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,760
Eat.

183
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,800
Let them have it.

184
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,160
You guys eat.

185
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
Wait a second.

186
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,200
So eager?

187
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,200
Stinky tofu.

188
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,400
Stinky tofu.

189
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,280
It smells so bad.

190
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Cover it.

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,120
This is the really smelly kind of stinky tofu.

192
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,640
For people from the south,

193
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,280
this is hard to accept.

194
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah.

195
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm from the south.

196
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,360
I can eat it.

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,080
I'll eat it, bro.

198
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,640
You'll smell bad after eating it.

199
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,280
You can't lose, Junjun.

200
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,799
Junjun.

201
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,960
Eat it all in one bite.

202
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,720
This is really salty.

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Don't eat it.

204
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,120
I'm already used to the smell.

205
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,800
Eat half.

206
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,520
Half.

207
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,120
But I think for someone from the south,

208
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,680
being able to enjoy this flavor is already quite something.

209
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,920
Here, let me spread it for you.

210
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
Just spread it like this, that's enough.

211
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,640
Here.

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,160
Right?

213
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,360
Spread it on the steamed bun, right?

214
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,320
Yes.

215
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Just spread it on half.

216
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
It's not about how much.

217
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,840
The main thing is to enjoy the flavor.

218
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,440
This is...

219
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,880
That's too much.

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,480
This stinky tofu...

221
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,040
That's a lot.

222
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
One bite is enough.

223
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,200
Half.

224
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
It's so delicious.

226
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,560
A kid from the south

227
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
can actually eat this stinky tofu.

228
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,720
I think he

229
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
It's too smelly.

230
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,040
No,

231
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,280
it's really smelly.

232
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,040
I think

233
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,680
what kind of stinky tofu is this?

234
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
How can there be this kind of stinky tofu?

235
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,400
Gong Jun, go to that group.

236
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,320
Jun Jun, go undercover.

237
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
This is something that will lose you points.

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
What counts as losing points?

239
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,520
Stinky tofu is really delicious.

240
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,560
When we were kids,

241
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,600
this was the tastiest thing.

242
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,160
It stinks.

243
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,680
It's too smelly.

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,520
It's really way too smelly.

245
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
I want to eat it like it's the most delicious thing in the world.

246
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
What should I do?

247
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,480
I'll give it to you, your acting is good.

248
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,160
That makes sense.

249
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,560
That's pretty good.

250
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
I'll sit here.

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,720
Hurry up.

252
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,800
I don't dare sit there.

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Why?

254
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,040
You don't like Mr. Chen He, right?

255
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,000
Or are you...

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
Are you...

257
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,720
If you think Brother Honglei

258
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,680
makes you uncomfortable,

259
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
you can just tell me directly.

260
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,880
I just don't like Chen He.

261
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,560
Can achieve great things

262
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
Take a look

263
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,560
Serve the dishes

264
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,840
Because today

265
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,480
we have people from all over the country

266
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,320
so we have seafood from Fujian

267
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
Mapo tofu from Sichuan

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
and dumplings from the Northeast

269
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
Thank you

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Okay

271
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,520
Yuwen

272
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,880
As someone from Hubei

273
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,440
we've prepared a dish

274
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,160
called "Suan Niao"

275
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,240
"Suan Niao"

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,800
Okay

277
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
"Suan Niao"

278
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,480
What's that?

279
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,360
What is "Suan Niao"?

280
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
"Suan Niao" is what people from Hubei

281
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,680
say when trying to break up a fight

282
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,200
They say

283
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
"Suan Niao"

284
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,120
It means "let it go, let it go"

285
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,600
Forget it

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
Where is the "Suan Niao"?

287
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,720
This is it

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,480
Where's the bird?

289
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm the bird, right?

290
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm "Suan Niao"

291
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,480
I think we should just enjoy this meal

292
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
It might be tough after this

293
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
No wonder they set up a long table like this

294
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,160
This is the last supper

295
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,840
That's right

296
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Is that what you mean?

297
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,440
Let's eat

298
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,720
Delicious

299
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
So tasty

300
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
This is so delicious.

301
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,160
Thanks, bro.

302
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,920
Here, with the skin.

303
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,360
Give me a piece.

304
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,760
Yeah, definitely.

305
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,440
Here you go, darling.

306
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,880
Thanks, bro.

307
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,280
Do you want a piece?

308
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,840
With the skin.

309
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,160
Let’s have this one.

310
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,360
This lamb feels

311
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
really tasty.

312
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,120
Delicious.

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,640
This lamb is so tender.

314
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,240
Bro, do you eat crab?

315
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,880
I’ll get one for you.

316
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,440
I’ll pass.

317
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,880
No, thanks.

318
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,480
Okay.

319
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,080
Do you guys eat this?

320
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
Should I get some for you?

321
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,480
No.

322
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,040
We’ll just go get it ourselves.

323
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,960
It’s fine, don’t worry about us.

324
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,400
You guys eat.

325
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,280
Thanks.

326
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,360
The kid is so considerate.

327
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,200
Let’s just pass the dishes around.

328
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,720
The dishes.

329
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,280
On your side.

330
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,560
We’ll go over and get some.

331
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Get it while standing.

332
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,800
Eat while standing.

333
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Yuning, you’re really so tall.

334
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
You even hunched over when you came over just now.

335
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
It felt like a pillar was coming over.

336
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,200
Right?

337
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
Yuning, when I just walked in,

338
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,280
I said, we haven’t seen each other for a few hours,

339
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,520
how come it feels like you’ve grown taller again?

340
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,760
Let's do this.

341
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,840
Let's play a game.

342
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,600
How do we play?

343
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
Let's play this one.

344
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,280
Accent King.

345
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,240
It must have something to do with accents.

346
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,280
The rules are very simple.

347
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,000
In a moment, I have a stack of lines here.

348
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,480
For example, I give you five characters now.

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,880
Then you say it once, emphasizing the first character.

350
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,200
Then say it again, emphasizing the second character.

351
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,280
Then say it again, emphasizing the third character.

352
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,400
Then say it again, emphasizing the fourth character.

353
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,520
Then say it again, emphasizing the fifth character.

354
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,640
Keep going until you finish the sentence.

355
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,960
You have a total of 90 seconds.

356
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,240
If anyone makes a mistake in the middle,

357
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,920
you go back to the first person.

358
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,920
We're all actors, after all.

359
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,680
Director.

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
We've practiced accenting our lines.

361
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,600
Logical emphasis, emotional emphasis—

362
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,560
We can do all kinds of accents.

363
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,960
Right.

364
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,280
Isn't it? Should be fine.

365
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
This is too easy.

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Then "garlic bird" goes to that girl.

367
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,800
Give him the dumplings.

368
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,400
I'll eat the dumplings.

369
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,000
Here, you guys split the rest.

370
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm fine with anything.

371
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm easy.

372
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,400
The young lady has arrived.

373
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,520
Give it to him.

374
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,760
Let's see who dares touch him.

375
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
Let's see who dares touch him.

376
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,880
Who goes first?

377
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,280
I'm fine with anything.

378
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,560
I'll do it.

379
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
Give him the dumpling.

380
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,680
Okay, give him the dumpling.

381
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,040
Sounds like Spanish.

382
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,000
Give him the dumpling.

383
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,080
Here it comes.

384
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Start.

385
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,800
Awesome.

386
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,280
Is it moving?

387
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,320
Restart the timer.

388
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,280
I'll admit defeat this round.

389
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,720
Lost.

390
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,360
How about restarting the timer?

391
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,760
Okay, three, two, one.

392
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,120
That's good.

393
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,760
Perfect.

394
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,840
That's good.

395
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,200
Okay.

396
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Continue.

397
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,440
Honglei.

398
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,560
This loss...

399
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah.

400
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,800
Yeah, just a few lines.

401
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
This is a bit...

402
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,760
Messed up.

403
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,240
Really messed up.

404
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,360
You're confused, man.

405
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,080
I'm confused.

406
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,920
Let me try again.

407
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,520
This time it's correct.

408
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,120
This one is right.

409
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,840
Let's do another one.

410
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
I think this round should start with them.

411
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,880
Is that okay?

412
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,840
Otherwise, we might not get to play tonight.

413
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,040
How about we go around from this side?

414
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
Otherwise, you guys won't get the experience.

415
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,040
Seriously, bro.

416
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Right? Gong Jun, go ahead.

417
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,560
Gong Jun, you start.

418
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,760
Okay.

419
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,280
Alright, let's go.

420
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,600
Then I'll start from here. Let's go.

421
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,520
There's also no "no" character.

422
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
You're right.

423
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,280
Start from that side.

424
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,960
Yuning.

425
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,640
Let them play for a while.

426
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Let's eat for a bit first.

427
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
Come on, have some food.

428
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
Eat for a while.

429
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,640
Why?

430
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,960
Then how should it be said?

431
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,880
Can't do it.

432
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,520
The emphasis should be varied.

433
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,440
There should be a big contrast.

434
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,000
It's about how we actors understand this line.

435
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
Emphasis doesn't have to mean shouting.

436
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
It could be...

437
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,560
Being soft is also a kind of emphasis.

438
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,359
This is the kind of emphasis used in variety shows.

439
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,240
What he wants isn't necessarily pitch.

440
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,319
He wants volume.

441
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,119
Naiwen, you start.

442
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,440
Like this.

443
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,319
He'll go last.

444
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:24,720
Is that okay?

445
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,480
Let him take a break for a bit.

446
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,880
This way, he has a round to rest.

447
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,040
Otherwise, our He...

448
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,720
And Yuwen haven't played yet either.

449
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Seriously.

450
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,240
This thing.

451
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,920
Eat a bit more.

452
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,320
Eat for a while.

453
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Come on, I'll start.

454
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,480
Okay.

455
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,200
Three, two, one.

456
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,680
Hurry.

457
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,680
Hurry.

458
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No one said anything.

459
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
Oh no, there are so many mistakes.

460
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,560
Oh no.

461
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,280
We can handle all kinds of accents.

462
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,600
Wait, are you sure?

463
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,920
This is too easy.

464
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,280
Oops.

465
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,120
I just had it in my head.

466
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,320
No problem at all.

467
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,200
Don't let me rub off on you.

468
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,520
I don't want to speak Wuhan dialect anymore.

469
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,240
Then let's switch.

470
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
Let's change to a new set.

471
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,920
Switch it up.

472
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
Change to a new set.

473
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,720
Right.

474
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,960
Wait, why are we switching?

475
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,600
We didn't even figure out the last one.

476
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,440
Why are we switching?

477
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
We didn't get the last one.

478
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
It's just that it might be a bit hard.

479
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,480
Let's pick an easier one.

480
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,560
This one only has five characters.

481
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Okay.

482
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,160
Starting from me.

483
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,200
Alright, I'll pass it to you, bro.

484
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,720
Here we go.

485
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Stop hitting.

486
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,040
Alright, get ready.

487
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Three, two, one, go.

488
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,280
Okay.

489
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,040
Keep going.

490
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,640
Feeling the pressure now.

491
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,800
Keep going, hurry.

492
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,840
Alright.

493
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,280
Keep going.

494
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,840
Okay.

495
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,120
Alright.

496
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
One minute and four seconds.

497
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,040
Piece of cake.

498
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,000
Isn't it really easy?

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,680
We have to give you some footage for the show.

500
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
We can't say we passed on the first try.

501
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,640
Yeah.

502
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,920
We have to look a bit clumsy at first.

503
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
It's all for the show's effect.

504
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,080
This is actually pretty easy.

505
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
Yeah, very easy.

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,800
Next time when designing it,

507
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,360
Do your best.

508
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,920
We all make a living by delivering lines.

509
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,440
And you couldn't even tell we made a mistake in our performance.

510
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,680
There were traces of mistakes, right?

511
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,440
Right.

512
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
You couldn't tell at all.

513
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,880
It was very lively.

514
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
And we even coordinated with each other.

515
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,040
Look, come over here.

516
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,960
You come over here.

517
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,000
Catch your breath over here.

518
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,760
Then you go again.

519
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,600
Actually, Yuníng was controlling the whole rhythm.

520
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Not really.

521
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,160
Right?

522
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,960
That's not what I meant.

523
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,680
Just saying.

524
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,840
That's really all there is to it.

525
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,280
Yeah.

526
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,000
I didn't mean that.

527
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,480
After spending a day together and getting to know each other,

528
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,720
I believe everyone has already established

529
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,880
a basic understanding before the trip.

530
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,040
Usually, everyone comes up with a slogan for the show.

531
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
So you guys think of a slogan.

532
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,960
Yeah, let's brainstorm together.

533
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,080
Let's come up with one together.

534
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,320
Earth is super fresh.

535
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,680
If we can't think of it today, we'll think about it tomorrow.

536
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,720
I think what you said is right.

537
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,760
We can't decide everything on the first day,

538
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,000
especially something this important.

539
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,760
That makes sense.

540
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
This is a big deal.

541
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,400
We need to have three group meetings about it.

542
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,400
Let's assign some homework.

543
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,480
Everyone should come up with a few ideas.

544
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,240
Yes, you all should think of a few too.

545
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,040
We'll come up with some as well.

546
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
Let's really think about it seriously.

547
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,560
Then together,

548
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,200
let's shout out our show's slogan.

549
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,480
Earth Super Fresh!

550
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Everyone together

551
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Come on

552
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,840
Okay, come

553
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,680
Come

554
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,240
Cover your mouth

555
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,600
Is it real or fake?

556
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,600
Are you guys for real?

557
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
We can just come up with one for now

558
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,320
Shouldn't we do this gesture?

559
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
Earth is super fresh

560
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,920
That's fine

561
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,560
This one, bro

562
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,400
And this one

563
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,720
This one

564
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,880
Earth is super fresh

565
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,400
Let's start with this one

566
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,960
That works

567
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,760
Earth is super fresh

568
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,520
And then?

569
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,040
Then cover your mouth

570
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Is it real or fake?

571
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,480
Okay

572
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
Earth is super fresh

573
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,640
Maybe there won't be one at the end

574
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,840
We'll just use this one directly

575
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,680
This will be the last one

576
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,400
It's this one

577
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,960
Alright

578
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,560
Let's go

579
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,360
Ready

580
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,080
Earth is super fresh

581
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,040
What a loud slogan

582
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,440
Everyone probably looked really unsure just now
