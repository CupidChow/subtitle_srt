1
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,360
Let's go.

2
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm going grocery shopping. Let's go.

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,120
Come on, let's just go in and look around.

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,240
Okay, thank you.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,520
Are we buying tableware?

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,360
I want to get a wine cup.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,440
Just for the vibe.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,440
This one looks nice. It's a Pink Elephant.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,240
What is this?

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
That's so ugly.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Is this turtle upside down?

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,200
That one's actually cute.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
This is...

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,800
I think it's a mistake.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,800
A mistake.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,720
I love you more every day.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't care, even if love is hard.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
What's this?

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,080
It's so big.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Chili pepper.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,440
Eggplant.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,160
Grilled eggplant, grilled chili, grilled onion.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,800
Grill everything.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,080
Grilled potato.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,040
Is this potato cooked?

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,080
It's cooked.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,680
What's this?

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,000
Pickled. Pickled eggplant.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,200
This seems pretty famous.

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,280
Should we get one of those?

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,600
Like that mixed eggplant dish.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
With those chili peppers.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,560
Let's mash one together.

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,120
This one's good. This eggplant.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,560
No, this one.

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Should we buy this?

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
I pointed at the chili and said eggplant.

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
The chili looks good.

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,360
They said their eggplant is famous.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,640
Darn it, the eggplant is getting attention.

41
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,760
I think potato, eggplant, and chili...

42
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
Let's get one of each.

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,280
Which one do you want?

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,840
Definitely get an eggplant.

45
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,400
This one.

46
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,280
I want a potato too.

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,920
One potato.

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Let's get two potatoes.

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,000
Two potatoes.

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,400
Do you speak Italian?

51
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Just a little.

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Go ahead.

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,440
He wants a bunch.

54
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,480
Two.

55
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,920
This one.

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,280
A bunch. A pile.

57
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,560
How many do you want?

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,000
Two.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,280
Two.

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,600
Two.

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Two.

62
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,080
How much is it?

63
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,640
All together.

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
How much?

65
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,120
Just how much?

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,479
Did you study it specifically?

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,640
Just learned the basics.

68
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,800
Two.

69
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Let's move forward then.

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,600
You guys pay.

71
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,120
I'll pay.

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,800
Let me do it.

73
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,000
No, I'll pay together.

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,080
Bro, he has change.

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,760
If it's not enough, I have change.

76
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
If it's not enough, then...

77
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,640
They can't break a big bill.

78
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,720
Buy me some water later.

79
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm a bit thirsty.

80
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll treat you to ice cream.

81
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,920
How much is this?

82
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,600
How much?

83
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,560
Six yuan.

84
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Six yuan.

85
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,960
I've got it.

86
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
Did we buy enough chicken legs?

87
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,640
It's enough.

88
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,360
How many did we get?

89
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,960
We bought them.

90
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
Four.

91
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
So, four legs, three legs...

92
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,880
I can eat two.

93
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,360
Guys, should we get some more chicken legs?

94
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,280
Sure.

95
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,320
If there's anything else, just get it.

96
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Bro

97
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,480
Are these tomatoes?

98
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,080
These are tomatoes.

99
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,600
Do you want to eat some?

100
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,640
Do you want to eat them raw or...

101
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,600
Raw.

102
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
Raw.

103
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,240
Try one.

104
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
He means for you to taste it.

105
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,640
See how it is.

106
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,800
Let's get a bunch.

107
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,920
It's probably not as good as ours.

108
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,040
Like those cherry tomatoes, right? They're tastier.

109
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
But it still tastes like tomato.

110
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,600
So when we stew it,

111
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,320
we can add some of these.

112
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
Besides the big tomatoes,

113
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,440
add some small ones for flavor.

114
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
Okay.

115
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,920
That's enough.

116
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,440
Enough.

117
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,880
So pretty.

118
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,240
All in bunches.

119
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,640
Is it because

120
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,360
the red light is shining, bro?

121
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
Plus your glasses,

122
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,920
it looks even nicer.

123
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,960
Look for number forty-eight.

124
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
Next stop.

125
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Greens, I want some greens.

126
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,560
We can check out the greens, yeah.

127
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,480
Do you want cilantro?

128
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,600
Cilantro's good.

129
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,040
Should we get some?

130
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,960
Cilantro, spinach, cabbage.

131
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,680
Is this cilantro?

132
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
This isn't cilantro.

133
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,320
Sis, is this cilantro?

134
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,120
How is this not cilantro?

135
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,840
It doesn't smell.

136
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,520
This isn't cilantro.

137
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
What is this?

138
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,520
Celery leaves.

139
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,720
It's some kind of celery, right?

140
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,000
Celery leaves.

141
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,400
Similar.

142
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,160
Not celery.

143
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,880
Something like celery.

144
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Fennel.

145
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,520
Fennel.

146
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,560
We could use cucumber for Moo Shu Pork too.

147
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,160
Bro

148
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,320
Let's make Di San Xian for you.

149
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,440
Eggplant, potato, and pepper.

150
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,160
Do you want garlic?

151
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Want some garlic?

152
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,840
Onion.

153
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,560
Garlic, onion, and stuff.

154
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,200
What's this?

155
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,000
We definitely need to buy this.

156
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,120
This is olive.

157
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,519
Olive.

158
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And dates.

159
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Look at his tomatoes.

160
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
They're those iron tomatoes.

161
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,680
Iron tomatoes.

162
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
There are some slightly bigger ones.

163
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Just go for those.

164
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
Let's buy those, let's go.

165
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,440
We're getting those tomatoes.

166
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,840
Let's get some.

167
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,000
And grab a white onion and a red onion too.

168
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,880
Let's get one of each.

169
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
Get some that are a bit softer.

170
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The kind that gets mushy.

171
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:35,960
Yeah.

172
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,280
Not sure, never cooked this kind of tomato before.

173
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,280
Should be fine.

174
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,080
That kid is so cute, look.

175
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,440
Look at him.

176
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,440
His eyelashes are so long.

177
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Can we pick like this?

178
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,320
Should be okay.

179
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,760
Is this enough?

180
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,880
That's enough.

181
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,400
Give me another bag.

182
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,720
Bag.

183
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,840
Thank you.

184
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,880
Thanks.

185
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,320
That's a lot.

186
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,200
Pack some onions, yeah.

187
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
You can just pack some onions.

188
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,960
Red or white ones?

189
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Get two of each.

190
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,400
Two of each.

191
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,280
What should we pack?

192
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Eggplant works too.

193
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,120
Pack some eggplant.

194
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
We already bought eggplant.

195
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,760
We got the steamed kind.

196
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,360
Didn't we?

197
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,400
That's roasted.

198
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,320
Roasted.

199
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,560
Potato.

200
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,320
You pick, then.

201
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,960
It's fine, these are all good.

202
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,560
They're all good.

203
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
Who can make Braised Eggplant?

204
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,560
I can. Anyone can.

205
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,160
We all can.

206
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
We have a chef.

207
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Our chef is here, but the heat's too low.

208
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
The heat's too low.

209
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,520
Are three enough?

210
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,200
Let's get one more.

211
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,320
One more.

212
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,360
No, green chili.

213
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Green chili.

214
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,760
Get some green chili.

215
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,160
Sure.

216
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,440
We just bought Di San Xian.

217
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,400
Eggplant, chili, potato.

218
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,880
You stir-fry the eggplant.

219
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,640
Don't you need green chili and potato for that?

220
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,000
Di San Xian.

221
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
The chili is huge.

222
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
What should we do with it?

223
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
The one you stuff with meat.

224
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,400
Then use that one.

225
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,640
If you want to stuff it with meat, use that.

226
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,000
The stuffed one, I know.

227
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
You put meat inside.

228
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,720
Right.

229
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
If Brother wants that, we'll make it.

230
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:06,960
Okay.

231
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Pick them, then.

232
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,960
Pick.

233
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
That must be spicy.

234
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,560
You're from Wuhan and afraid of spicy food?

235
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm really afraid of spicy food.

236
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
Don't worry, it's fine.

237
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,760
How many should we get?

238
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
Gong Jun, get the straight ones.

239
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
The straighter, the spicier, right?

240
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,640
No, straight ones are better for stuffing.

241
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Spices.

242
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Are these spices?

243
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,520
Yes.

244
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
Should we buy some spices?

245
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,080
No need.

246
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,320
Why not?

247
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,560
Buy some spices for Junjun.

248
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
No, it's for Xingxu to mix a drink.

249
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,760
That's a lethal dose.

250
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,640
He hasn't tried it yet.

251
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,160
This is their famous specialty here.

252
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,640
That one.

253
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,160
Nut butter.

254
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,560
Nut butter—I saw an ad for it at the airport.

255
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,840
Do you want to try it? We can take some back.

256
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,880
How do you eat this?

257
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,560
Just dip things in it, all kinds of dips.

258
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
Spread it on bread and stuff.

259
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,960
Yeah.

260
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,440
It’s really famous here.

261
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,320
Sure.

262
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,400
We can have it for breakfast.

263
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
Do you want some? Let’s buy a little.

264
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,120
Get a box of pistachio butter.

265
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,880
Okay.

266
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,760
Wait a second.

267
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
See if there’s any left.

268
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,840
I’m worried—will we have enough?

269
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,440
We’ll spread it on bread in the morning.

270
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,520
We won’t use much for dipping.

271
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,280
Let me pay this time, is that okay?

272
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,400
Sure.

273
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,640
Of course.

274
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,720
I want to break the routine for once.

275
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
Let’s grab some more potatoes, just in time.

276
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
Are we making stir-fried shredded potatoes?

277
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,760
No, just saying you can.

278
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,920
Stew potatoes with beef brisket.

279
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,520
Sounds good.

280
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
We can stir-fry them too, either way.

281
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,400
It’s easier to peel the big ones.

282
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,880
Yeah, just get one.

283
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:33,840
This one.

284
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
Good thing your arms are long.

285
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,880
Did we get any greens, guys?

286
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Did anyone buy vegetables?

287
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,720
No, we didn’t.

288
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
Alright, that’s about it.

289
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Anything else? Spices?

290
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,800
Let’s get some spices, yeah.

291
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,280
It’s not that.

292
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
It’s that sauce.

293
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,880
No, aren’t these spices?

294
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,320
Yeah.

295
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,520
Make a special drink for Xingxu.

296
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,760
What’s this?

297
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,320
We smelled this last time.

298
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
This is...

299
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
Isn’t this that thing?

300
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,640
This must be made from tomatoes.

301
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,000
Smell it.

302
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,080
Yu Ning, do you know how to cook snails?

303
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
No, I don’t.

304
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,880
Eating snails.

305
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,640
Eat snails? How?

306
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,720
No.

307
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,880
I know.

308
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
It can be done.

309
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,760
But the question is, can you eat it?

310
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Can’t you eat it?

311
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
It’s pretty tasty.

312
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
Snails.

313
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,280
You’ve never tried it?

314
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,200
No, I haven’t.

315
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,520
Me neither.

316
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,080
Ask them.

317
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
Has anyone here eaten snails?

318
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,960
Gong Jun.

319
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,120
Who wants to try snails?

320
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Brother Naiwen is asking who wants to eat snails.

321
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,919
Where are the snails?

322
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,360
Do you know how to cook snails?

323
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,159
Just the usual way.

324
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,720
Braised, stewed in sauce, any style works.

325
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,840
Snails are tricky to prepare.

326
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,400
Yeah, there are bugs.

327
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,760
What’s this?

328
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,640
Avocado—isn’t this avocado?

329
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,120
Avocado.

330
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,480
Avocado.

331
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
Do you want to eat this?

332
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,000
Tiaotiao, mango.

333
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Papaya.

334
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,280
Papaya strips.

335
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,800
Do you want some?

336
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,000
I’m fine with anything.

337
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,280
I think it’s not as good as the ones back home.

338
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,640
Let’s just get this one.

339
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
This should taste great when soaked in water.

340
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,640
Yeah, I want to make something for everyone.

341
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,320
Soda water.

342
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
Do you guys want to eat avocado?

343
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,640
I don't want any.

344
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
Avocado is something that, in my whole life,

345
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,800
I never want to eat.

346
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,520
Why's that?

347
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,360
Because I just don't get why people eat it.

348
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,240
How do you eat it?

349
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,880
I know.

350
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,280
You eat it like salmon.

351
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,640
Yeah.

352
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,760
No thanks.

353
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,240
Isn't it good?

354
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,640
It's not good.

355
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
Because I don't really like salmon either.

356
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
Alright, we're done shopping for ingredients.

357
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,880
Let's play a game and take a break.

358
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
The game is called—

359
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
We'll split into two teams: the Hole-Covering Team and the Observation Team.

360
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
The Hole-Covering Team secretly picks one person.

361
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
On the outside of their clothing,

362
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,240
they stick a "hole" sticker.

363
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
And during the whole dance,

364
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,840
they must not be found out by the Observation Team.

365
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,760
Cover the hole.

366
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,880
The Observation Team can ask the Hole-Covering Team

367
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,480
to change their moves and formation.

368
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
If they guess who really has the hole,

369
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,520
they win.

370
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
Let's do a practice round first.

371
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,000
What is this?

372
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,640
The hole, right?

373
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,360
Hole.

374
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,800
Let's think about it now.

375
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,040
If we have to place it, how should we do it?

376
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
Come on, let's discuss it too.

377
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
Let's talk it over.

378
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,720
If we put it somewhere, where should it go?

379
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,040
I think we can put it here.

380
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,320
Is this the body surface?

381
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
You can't put it inside.

382
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,000
That's way too obvious.

383
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Let me think.

384
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,360
So, everyone

385
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,760
actually needs to find a fake spot too.

386
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,440
A spot to disguise it.

387
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
Right, we definitely

388
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,880
For example,

389
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,520
on his body.

390
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Then we have to cover it up.

391
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
We have one on ourselves too.

392
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,680
Everyone has to pretend

393
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
Everyone has to act

394
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
like they have one.

395
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,760
Yeah.

396
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,560
Stick it on the sole.

397
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Sole doesn't work either.

398
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
The sole isn't the body surface.

399
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,880
Let's put our hand like this.

400
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
We can actually stick it in the armpit.

401
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,160
Right.

402
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,400
That's too easy.

403
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
The armpit is way too easy.

404
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,000
If you don't cover your armpit,

405
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,160
he won't see the armpit.

406
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,280
What do you mean?

407
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,520
For example,

408
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,800
Look, if I jump now,

409
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,640
say I cover here,

410
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,040
lift my hand,

411
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
you can still see it, see?

412
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
Put it a bit further back.

413
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Tuck it in.

414
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,880
Then turn around, turn.

415
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,280
If you turn, he definitely won't see it.

416
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Such a small ball.

417
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,760
I know.

418
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,000
You stick it on your armpit.

419
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
Just put it right here.

420
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,800
This is too easy.

421
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,160
No, this is way too easy.

422
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,040
Seriously, it's too easy.

423
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
This is too easy.

424
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
No.

425
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,880
Let me tell you,

426
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,760
It's not just this, everywhere is easy.

427
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,280
Put it on the sole.

428
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,640
You can't put it on the sole.

429
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,280
You can.

430
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,480
Okay, put it on the sole and lift your foot.

431
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
You can see it right away.

432
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,000
As long as someone thinks of it,

433
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,640
you can't even cover it up.

434
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
At least your hand can hide it.

435
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,240
It's a bit hard.

436
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
So it's actually pretty tough.

437
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,440
On the foot.

438
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,160
Not on the foot.

439
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,640
On the foot.

440
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,960
Not on the sole of the shoe.

441
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,120
Stick it on the sole.

442
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,560
No.

443
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,280
Not on the sole of the shoe.

444
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,280
There's nothing special about this.

445
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,640
I think we can put it here.

446
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,280
You can't fold it inside, right?

447
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,880
No, my color is too light.

448
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
This is way too obvious.

449
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,280
I think like this.

450
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,760
Let's not overthink it.

451
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,480
Because no matter where you stick it,

452
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,640
it's all just the body surface anyway.

453
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,880
Under Brother Hong Lei's armpit.

454
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
We can actually stick it in the armpit.

455
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,280
Under Brother Hong Lei's armpit.

456
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,600
Just remember, don't lift your hand.

457
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,160
Just a little inside the armpit.

458
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
Brother Hong Lei, keep your left hand down.

459
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,520
And for our dance,

460
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,680
Try to form a circle like this.

461
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,000
Right.

462
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
We just need to stay in sync.

463
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,640
All four of us together.

464
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,160
Try to cover me, I'll lean back a bit.

465
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,040
And then,

466
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,880
But there's one problem.

467
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Don't cover on purpose.

468
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,280
Let's pretend to hide it, but not too obviously.

469
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,120
Let me see.

470
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,320
Later, let's see where they sit.

471
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,400
If they ask us to raise our hands, right?

472
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,040
Raise our hands, right?

473
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,760
Then we'll just

474
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,520
do it appropriately.

475
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I'll move toward Brother Hong Lei.

476
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
Block their view from that direction.

477
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
I'll lean over that way.

478
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
We have to make them think

479
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,400
it's on He.

480
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,880
Yeah.

481
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,400
You know?

482
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,160
Let's pretend to cover it first.

483
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,760
I'll pretend to tuck it in here.

484
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,520
Let them see.

485
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,120
Pretend to look, too.

486
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,040
Like this.

487
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,800
No, let's do a relay like this.

488
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,160
Like this.

489
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
How about the Four Little Swans?

490
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,280
Come on.

491
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,880
No, I can't be first.

492
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,640
Then step with your left leg first.

493
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,240
When we walk.

494
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Left leg.

495
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
Move slowly, don't make big moves or we'll bump.

496
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
Aren't we supposed to jump over like that?

497
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,040
It's definitely not here.

498
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,520
Let them jump first.

499
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,400
Let's have them jump for a bit.

500
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Come on, let's get a feel for it.

501
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's go.

502
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,160
Jump, jump!

503
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
Left, right.

504
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,040
Left, right.

505
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Come on, twist!

506
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Left, right.

507
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,760
Left, right.

508
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,640
Left—hey, you stepped on my foot!

509
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,880
No.

510
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,400
Sorry, bro.

511
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,280
Left, right.

512
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,360
Left, right.

513
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Left, right.

514
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,120
You're moving too fast.

515
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,760
Left, right.

516
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,800
Darn it, it's a mess.

517
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,520
Come on, form a circle.

518
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,280
Form a circle.

519
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,880
Try to cover me.

520
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,040
I'll lean back a bit.

521
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,520
Don't get too close.

522
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,240
Yeah, you guys need to sit properly.

523
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,160
Sit properly.

524
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,480
Switch, keep switching.

525
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,880
Right.

526
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,000
Change positions.

527
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,000
You have to dance for us.

528
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Where are you going?

529
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,160
All our moves are on the back.

530
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,920
We can make them change moves, right?

531
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,520
Yeah.

532
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,040
Open up the armpit.

533
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,640
Solo dance.

534
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,280
Solo dance.

535
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,240
Come on.

536
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,600
Bro.

537
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,680
Brother Hong Lei, solo dance.

538
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,760
Brother Hong Lei, solo dance.

539
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,160
Follow the rhythm.

540
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
If they ask us to raise our hands,

541
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
I'll move closer to Brother Hong Lei.

542
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,120
Follow the rhythm.

543
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,360
Open up the armpit.

544
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Open up the armpit.

545
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,240
Open up the armpit.

546
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,000
Raise your hand, I see it.

547
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Raise your hand, I see it.

548
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,120
I see it.

549
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,760
I see it.

550
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,280
The first one is out.

551
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,160
The first one is out.

552
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,640
Isn't this just like before?

553
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,440
Our armpit strategy, right?

554
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,040
See? You can't stick it here.

555
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,880
It's different.

556
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,280
Mine will definitely get stuck.

557
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Not like his.

558
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,760
His is on the clothes.

559
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,640
How did it end up there?

560
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,760
I'm blocking you here.

561
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,200
Why is it still there?

562
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Stick it a bit further inside.

563
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,560
It's already as far in as it goes.

564
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,240
It's already all the way in.

565
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,040
The technique isn't good.

566
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,520
It's the sticking technique that's off.

567
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
No problem.

568
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,160
This one.

569
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,920
That's fine.

570
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,880
It's fine, it's fine.

571
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,040
Come on.

572
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,520
Let's go.

573
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Let's discuss quickly.

574
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,400
Come on.

575
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,160
Come on.

576
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Bring our stickers over.

577
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,640
Here, stickers.

578
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Everyone, put your hands out first.

579
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,640
Hands out.

580
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920
Big hands have an advantage.

581
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
But we can do the opposite.

582
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,280
I know, I know.

583
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,160
We can do it the other way.

584
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
The best is to stick it here.

585
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,760
Can we overlap it?

586
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,480
But we can't cheat.

587
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,640
This isn't cheating.

588
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,920
We mustn't cheat.

589
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,440
We need to be different from them.

590
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,920
Like this.

591
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,160
We'll pick someone at the end.

592
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,960
Pick someone to stick it on.

593
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,040
Let's move a bit further away.

594
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,760
It's one out of four.

595
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,160
If it's on you, keep your movements small.

596
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
Don't make big jumps, right?

597
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,880
You jump, she jumps like crazy.

598
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,160
The two of us will act suspicious.

599
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,240
The two of us will act nervous.

600
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,920
Will this work?

601
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,640
Can we overlap it completely?

602
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,280
No, we can't.

603
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,240
Then Brother Ning, you make small moves.

604
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't make big jumps.

605
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
Make them think...

606
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,760
Right.

607
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
So it can't be on me.

608
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,240
This one has to be on you.

609
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,760
Are you sure?

610
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay, that's fine.

611
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
Okay, let's go.

612
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,760
Get ready to go on.

613
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Where's our music?

614
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,880
Where's the music?

615
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,120
Come on, you go in the middle.

616
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,000
Come on.

617
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,360
Follow her and dance.

618
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,240
What about their jackets?

619
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
It has to be on the outside of the jacket.

620
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,120
Right.

621
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,520
They'll definitely cover it with their hands, right?

622
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,080
Let them dance for a bit, we won't say anything.

623
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,600
This left hand.

624
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,080
Left hand doesn't have it.

625
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This won't work.

626
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,160
We're doomed.

627
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay.

628
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
Can we ask them to show their hands?

629
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,360
You can only switch hands, not stretch them out.

630
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,520
Switch hands.

631
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,240
So actually, just now—

632
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,720
You can't stretch out your hand.

633
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,320
So it should be stuck on the palm.

634
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
You can move it anywhere on your body.

635
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,160
No one would ever notice.

636
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,480
Right.

637
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,760
Isn't that right?

638
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,119
Come on, say it.

639
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,119
Go ahead.

640
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,240
Gong Jun's left hand is out.

641
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,760
It's not movable.

642
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,359
Whoever has it, has it.

643
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,280
Of course.

644
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
Let's go.

645
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Who's dancing solo?

646
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,680
Hurry, we all want to dance.

647
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,520
So tired.

648
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Jump and dance like crazy!

649
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,360
Just have fun.

650
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,080
Just have fun.

651
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,440
Just have fun.

652
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,160
It probably isn't on Brother Ning.

653
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,360
Because Brother Ning switched just now.

654
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,120
He switched hands once.

655
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,880
The covered spot is different.

656
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
You can't put it in your pocket.

657
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Anyway, it's in my palm.

658
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
It's in my palm.

659
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,360
I can put it anywhere.

660
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,120
It's in my palm.

661
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,800
Anyway, it's in the hand, right?

662
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,720
They're all in the palm, confirmed.

663
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,800
All in the hand.

664
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Of course, right in the palm.

665
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
Dance a bit more, it looks good.

666
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
Come on, are we dancing through the whole song?

667
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,320
Let's do something slower.

668
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
Yeah, something slow.

669
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Getting a bit tired.

670
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,880
Let's move with smaller steps.

671
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,520
Wenzi.

672
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,000
Do five ballet turns.

673
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,680
Switch hands.

674
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,720
Okay.

675
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,560
If I sweat, it'll fall off.

676
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,800
It might fall off if I sweat.

677
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,160
It won't stick anymore.

678
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
Seriously.

679
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
My hands feel really slippery now.

680
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm sweating like crazy too.

681
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,920
Jun Jun, switch hands.

682
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,080
Spin twice and switch hands.

683
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,400
How do you switch hands?

684
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,120
How do you switch hands?

685
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,800
It's not Jun Jun.

686
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,360
When he picked up his glasses just now,

687
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,360
he naturally used his left hand.

688
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,120
He didn't use his right hand.

689
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,040
I think Jun Jun doesn't have it in either hand.

690
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,400
Yeah.

691
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,080
Jun Jun.

692
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,880
Jun Jun can take a break now.

693
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,560
You don't have to work so hard, bye.

694
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,360
Yeah, take a rest.

695
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,400
Sit down.

696
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,640
No resting! Why should you rest?

697
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,320
Dance for me.

698
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
Dance in front for me.

699
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Why should you rest?

700
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,360
Love to dance.

701
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,120
Just love to dance.

702
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,440
Dance.

703
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,120
Look.

704
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,000
Look.

705
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
He definitely doesn't have it.

706
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,040
Otherwise, he would've let him leave.

707
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,160
Didi.

708
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,880
Stay in this pose.

709
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,760
Also switch hands after five spins.

710
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,360
Five spins.

711
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,760
This isn't it either.

712
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,640
I think it's with Wen Zi.

713
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,240
I think so too.

714
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
Me too.

715
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,760
I think Wen Zi has it.

716
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,600
So tired.

717
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,280
Hurry.

718
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,120
Are we deciding?

719
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Let's decide.

720
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,120
Done.

721
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,400
Okay.

722
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
We've made our choice.

723
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,360
It's decided.

724
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,920
We've picked someone.

725
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,120
Yeah.

726
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,440
Alright.

727
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,680
Okay, let's stop jumping.

728
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,400
It's set.

729
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,520
Okay.

730
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,360
Go ahead and guess.

731
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Ours.

732
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
We all agree

733
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,400
that Wang Yuwen has it.

734
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,880
No way.

735
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,840
Pick.

736
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Come on, pick me.

737
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,560
We're picking you.

738
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,000
Done picking.

739
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,520
Want to think again?

740
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,320
No, that's it.

741
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,000
You'll lose.

742
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,240
Doesn't matter.

743
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
Can't tell.

744
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
It's in your hand.

745
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,200
You have it.

746
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,560
You acted the most relaxed.

747
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,520
Then it must be you.

748
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
It's with you.

749
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,120
Look, the other three are all nervous.

750
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,840
Alright, let's go.

751
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,560
Reveal it.

752
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,200
Come on.

753
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,440
You guys are going to "die," I'm telling you.

754
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,360
It's fine.

755
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,920
Music ready.

756
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,880
If it's you, step out alone.

757
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Three, two, one, go.

758
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
Let's go.

759
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,960
Show it.

760
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,880
Dance like crazy.

761
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,800
Awesome.

762
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,600
You switched at the last second, right?

763
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,120
That scared me to death.

764
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,440
I'm telling you.

765
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,880
That was amazing.

766
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,840
Even the crew didn't know who it was.

767
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
That's true.

768
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
We switched it secretly.

769
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,440
The glasses fell on purpose.

770
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
No, he picked them up with his left hand.

771
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
Hold on, Jun Jun.

772
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,280
Was dropping the glasses planned?

773
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,720
No.

774
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
You two didn't see me give it to him, right?

775
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,640
It was over there, right?

776
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:13,960
Yeah.

777
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,080
I had no idea.

778
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,760
Yeah, the goal was to fool our teammates.

779
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,440
I'm telling you.

780
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,600
We had to trick all our teammates.

781
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
That was a good move.

782
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,960
No one knew.

783
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,360
That way, you two lost your focus.

784
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,680
Yeah.

785
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,400
So awesome.

786
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,880
We basically put on a show.

787
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,680
When we play for real, the rules are upgraded.

788
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,120
The sticker can't be placed on the body surface anymore.

789
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,880
It must be stuck on the outside of the clothing.
