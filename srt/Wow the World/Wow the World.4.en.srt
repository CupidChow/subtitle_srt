1
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Welcome, everyone, to "Earth: Super Fresh".

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,080
The first stop of our 40° North Latitude world tour

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,880
is our great capital, Beijing.

4
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,560
Our Earth team will start at the Great Wall

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,080
to connect with the world

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,840
and set out to explore

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
a bigger and fresher world.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,640
Before we set off,

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,120
we need to have some basic understanding

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
of the 40° North Latitude.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,160
We have invited Professor Shi Zhan

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,000
from the Institute of Global Civilization History at Shanghai International Studies University.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,080
Let's welcome Professor Shi Zhan.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,680
Hello, everyone.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,160
Welcome.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
Hello.

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,240
Welcome, welcome.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,320
Professor Shi, please have a seat.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,480
Class begins.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,320
Class begins.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello, teacher.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
Hello, students.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,840
Class dismissed.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,000
Class is over.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
Goodbye, teacher.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,120
Be sure to listen to the teacher.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,080
Once class is dismissed, you absolutely can't start class again.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,480
Class again.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,880
You're the class monitor, right?

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,280
Class monitor, now you're the class monitor.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,280
No, this is a student's parent.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
The parent can sit first.

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,760
Then the student can stand for a bit.

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Come on, let's sit here.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
Go ahead, teacher.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,520
What is it?

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,280
Everyone, take a seat.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
Come on.

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,720
Sit down.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,840
Let me introduce myself first.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,440
I am from Shanghai International Studies University.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,920
My name is Shizhan from the Institute of Global Civilization History.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,960
Hello, teacher.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,240
Because this time,

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,800
we are going to travel around the world.

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,039
So today, we'll have a trial run here first.

47
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,000
We'll go through a few quiz questions.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
This is to help everyone

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,480
learn more about the cities we'll visit.

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,680
If you know the answer, raise your hand.

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,040
Those who answer correctly will get a small reward.

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,280
But I should tell you what the reward is.

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,720
I want to see

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
how much effort we put into answering.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
There’s no punishment.

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,120
It's a house nearby.

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,560
Now that's exciting.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,040
If you succeed, you can become a BA.

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
That's a big enough reward, right?

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Alright, let's begin.

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,960
First question.

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,320
Quick answer

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,720
C

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,280
Why

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
Because of the process of elimination

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,440
Fried dough sticks

67
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,320
There are fried dough sticks

68
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,560
They also fry big dough pieces

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
There is also ham

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
Spanish ham

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
China's Jinhua ham

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
Jinhua ham is the most famous

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,320
I think it's tofu pudding

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Tofu pudding

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,080
Tofu pudding

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,560
Then I'll guess fried dough sticks

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,600
Fried dough sticks

78
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,320
Three fried dough sticks

79
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,520
These three old fried dough sticks

80
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,680
Three old fried dough sticks

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,600
Fried dough sticks

82
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,240
No

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,560
Because there's a Spanish snack

84
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,800
Called

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,880
It's very similar to China's fried dough sticks

86
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
Both are long strips of fried dough

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,320
They can be eaten with sugar or chocolate

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
It really is tofu pudding

89
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
See

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Come on

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
A small victory for us

92
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,320
Keep it low-key

93
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
Just a taste, don't go too far

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
Low-key

95
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
This isn't a brain teaser

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,320
Second question

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
Due to unique geographical advantages

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,120
A

99
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,960
Durian

100
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,480
It must be durian.

101
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,240
It must be A.

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
Because at 40 degrees north latitude,

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
the other three are all present.

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,720
Durian.

105
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,440
Everyone got it right.

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,120
Great job.

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,880
We all answered correctly.

108
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
From 40 to 50 degrees north latitude,

109
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
there are distinct seasons,

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,120
the climate is mild,

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,800
and precipitation is moderate.

112
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
This is very favorable for the growth of pasture.

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,480
It ensures the health of dairy cows

114
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,120
and the high quality of milk.

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,760
And in France at 40 degrees north latitude,

116
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,279
everyone knows about Bordeaux wine.

117
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,440
Similarly, in China,

118
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,720
Huailai County in Hebei also produces wine.

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
As for corn,

120
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
for example, Jilin in China,

121
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
the Corn Belt in the United States,

122
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
and the Corn Belt in Ukraine

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,320
are the world's three major golden corn belts.

124
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,200
They are all around 40 degrees north latitude.

125
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,840
Alright.

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
I think you all qualify

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
to move on to the next question.

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,480
Teacher, give us a harder one.

129
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,840
Okay.

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
The Central Axis of Beijing

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,600
was in 2024

132
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,560
included in the World Heritage List.

133
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,800
This one is pretty tough.

134
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
Tiananmen is definitely included.

135
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,960
Definitely included, yes.

136
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,240
The Forbidden City is definitely included.

137
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,160
They're in sequence.

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Right.

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Then I think the Olympic Tower

140
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,080
should also be related to our central axis.

141
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,600
The Olympic Tower is definitely included.

142
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
Because it was built for the central axis.

143
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,160
I think

144
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
You need to listen to the question.

145
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,120
What the teacher just said was

146
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,000
the traditional central axis.

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,480
So only

148
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,720
I think only the Olympic Tower

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
was built later.

150
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,200
Right.

151
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Hepingmen, Yongdingmen.

152
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,200
You already figured out the answer just now.

153
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,680
Traditional.

154
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
Why didn't you stick to it?

155
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
Right.

156
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,520
The Olympic Tower isn't traditional.

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,120
Right.

158
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
The traditional central axis.

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,040
Starts from Yongdingmen in the south.

160
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,320
Extends north to the Bell and Drum Towers.

161
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,080
Includes buildings like Tiananmen and the Forbidden City.

162
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,560
But the Olympic Tower

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,640
is a modern building.

164
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,520
This is "Dad".

165
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,440
This is the top student.

166
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,000
The last question.

167
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,360
Okay.

168
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,000
I choose Madrid.

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,040
I choose Madrid too.

170
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,680
Why?

171
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
Because we're going to Spain.

172
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,080
Because Madrid is the farthest west, right?

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,600
Isn't it?

174
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
Because Madrid is amazing.

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
Madrid is amazing.

176
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
Yiwu-Xinjiang-Europe China-Europe freight train

177
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,080
On November 18, 2014,

178
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
departed from Yiwu, China,

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,680
exited China through Alashankou in Xinjiang,

180
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,320
and finally arrived in Madrid, the capital of Spain.

181
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,960
Correct.

182
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,680
Madrid.

183
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,040
Easy.

184
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,720
Here we go again.

185
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,360
Thank you, teacher.

186
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
After spending these two days together,

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
everyone has gone from barely knowing each other

188
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,240
to being almost completely familiar.

189
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,840
So next,

190
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,920
we will officially begin

191
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
the preparations before going abroad.

192
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,840
Because the country we are going to

193
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
uses a different language,

194
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
when communicating with foreigners,

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,720
we will likely need to use body language as well.

196
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,280
We have prepared

197
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,480
five cards showing different levels of expression, from low to high.

198
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,840
Based on your own understanding,

199
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,720
you will act out the given scenario

200
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,320
to the corresponding degree.

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Our topic is

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
to act out

203
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
your feelings about traveling with different numbers of Honglei

204
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,880
when going on a trip.

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
So how would I travel with Honglei?

206
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,200
You observe.

207
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,120
You, as the main character, will observe.

208
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,320
Just He Ge.

209
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,920
I'll guess.

210
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,760
Okay, the remaining five people, draw a card.

211
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,400
The card you draw determines your level.

212
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,160
Okay.

213
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,680
Alright, let's go.

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,720
Be careful not to let others see your number.

215
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
I'll check mine in the restroom.

216
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,400
Two.

217
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,560
I saw them all.

218
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Collect them and redraw.

219
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
For this kind of activity in the future,

220
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,400
let those who have done variety shows go first.

221
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,120
Alright?

222
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm really impressed.

223
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
You have to say, "I'm really impressed."

224
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,280
Impressed.

225
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Yes.

226
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
You are, right?

227
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

228
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Come on.

229
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,880
I'll go first.

230
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,000
Still saw it.

231
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,800
Did you see it?

232
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,200
I don't believe it.

233
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,920
You tell me, bro.

234
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Five.

235
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
I saw it with my own eyes.

236
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,880
So why did you look?

237
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,760
Couldn't help it.

238
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:07,960
You go first.

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,040
Okay.

240
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,040
What should we do now?

241
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,600
You said the subtext out loud.

242
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,320
Is it that serious?

243
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,800
This is "Seven of Me."

244
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,080
Don't make wild guesses.

245
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,400
You look at the second one first.

246
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,679
You take another look first.

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Take another look, bro.

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,200
Okay.

249
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Watch me perform.

250
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,720
It's over.

251
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
So it can be done like this.

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,840
If we play like this, I'll just do it this way.

253
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,160
He didn't expect that level at all.

254
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,040
Two Sun Honglei.

255
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,960
Come on.

256
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
Come on, little brother, go for it.

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Is that okay? Come on.

258
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Mine is...

259
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Everyone is wondering

260
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,400
why all the endings are "death."

261
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,280
I object.

262
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,560
This is slander against me.

263
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
I'll do it, bro.

264
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,640
Here I come.

265
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,400
This is about my level.

266
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,440
Honestly, it's really hard.

267
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
To be honest, it's quite difficult.

268
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,920
It would've been better if you just did it yourself earlier.

269
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,160
At least one could survive.

270
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Because not even one and a half "deaths" happened.

271
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,960
They're all exposed, you know?

272
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,080
Alright, it's my turn.

273
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm like this.

274
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
Me too—let me take a call.

275
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
Hello?

276
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,320
That's one more "death."

277
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,720
It's all written down.

278
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,240
Start from here.

279
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay.

280
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Five, four, five, two.

281
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,600
Two.

282
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
Let me explain.

283
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,640
One Sun Honglei.

284
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay.

285
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,840
Okay.

286
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,520
Just now.

287
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,680
It wasn't like that just now.

288
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,280
Okay, you didn't act just now.

289
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,960
You didn't act just now, okay.

290
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,080
Your expression clearly didn't show satisfaction.

291
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
What do you mean by "okay"?

292
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Earlier, you just fell down as soon as it started.

293
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,320
Okay.

294
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,720
Watch the process.

295
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,960
One Sun Honglei, okay.

296
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,200
Two Sun Hongleis.

297
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,960
Both security captains are safe.

298
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,320
Okay, that makes sense.

299
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
Okay.

300
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,120
No problem, right?

301
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
That's how mine is.

302
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,080
Come out and play.

303
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,200
Honglei.

304
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Is Honglei really this short?

305
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,080
Super Mario.

306
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
Super Mario.

307
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,320
Calabash Brothers.

308
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,960
Very far.

309
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm standing above.

310
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,200
He's down below.

311
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,920
Second floor windowsill, open the window.

312
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,440
Looking down at Honglei.

313
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,640
There's even a scenario.

314
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,040
Honglei.

315
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,560
The thermal shirt is a bit tight.

316
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,720
Sleep.

317
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,240
Sleep.

318
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,600
That's how it is.

319
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,680
Okay.

320
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,160
Come on.

321
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,760
Okay.

322
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
Come on, Xingxu, let's see how you turn this around.

323
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm number one.

324
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,480
That's right, Honglei.

325
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
You want to travel with me? No way.

326
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,720
No way.

327
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,600
Can't do that.

328
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,400
Can't do that, you...

329
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
That's just too happy.

330
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
So this is how everyone plays, huh?

331
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,240
Is this really how everyone plays?

332
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,080
Alright.

333
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,640
Let me tell you.

334
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,720
Fine, everyone plays like this.

335
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,880
Got it.

336
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,240
I've already figured out what to do.

337
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,800
Now the problem is on your side.

338
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
The important scene is on you now.

339
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,560
Everyone's playing me like this.

340
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,080
Okay.

341
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,600
Xingxu.

342
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
Starting today,

343
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,600
my perception of you has completely changed.

344
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm three.

345
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
Hello?

346
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
One Sun Honglei goes.

347
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,080
Two Sun Hongleis go.

348
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,160
Three.

349
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
No need to pick up the phone.

350
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
Just play while lying down.

351
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,360
You don't even need to pick up the phone.

352
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,040
No need to pay.

353
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
I think this is too far-fetched.

354
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,080
Still far-fetched.

355
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,800
They're not far-fetched.

356
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,960
The fourth person is—

357
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
I guessed it right.

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,720
Yuning, I guessed it right.

359
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,840
You acted pretty well.

360
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,600
I think Yuning acted very well.

361
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,560
Yuning's performance was good.

362
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah, my brother approves of me.

363
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,240
Yeah.

364
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
You get it now, right?

365
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Got it, nice acting.

366
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,400
Good actors have this kind of connection.

367
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,040
Thank you, Yuning.

368
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,760
I really admire you guys.

369
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,320
You guys—

370
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,080
Explain yourselves properly.

371
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,200
Two-faced, saying one thing to our faces and another behind our backs.

372
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
No, we didn't.

373
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
We all said it to your face.

374
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,880
Alright, I'll give it a try.

375
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm number five.

376
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,200
I'm on my way to work.

377
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,440
They said I get to travel with Brother Honglei.

378
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,400
Such a great opportunity.

379
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,960
How could the company give it to me?

380
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
I'm so honored.

381
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,280
I sighed.

382
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,360
This opportunity is amazing.

383
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
Then I walked over.

384
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
I saw

385
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,920
the legendary idol.

386
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,800
I want to touch you.

387
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,920
You want to strangle me, right?

388
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
I want to gently stroke your neck.

389
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
I don't agree with Gong Jun's performance.

390
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
I request that Gong Jun perform again.

391
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,200
Like this, do it again.

392
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,080
No, let me help him.

393
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,200
Let me help explain for him.

394
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Do it again.

395
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,560
Just now, Junjun was acting as someone

396
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,520
who isn't good at expressing himself.

397
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
So when he got the call,

398
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,320
Hello?

399
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,760
From now on,

400
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,280
I can travel with you.

401
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,120
We are now sworn friends.

402
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,360
Sworn friends.

403
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,280
Sworn friends.

404
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,760
Blood brothers.

405
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,880
I think this is really great.

406
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,800
That's exactly what I mean.

407
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,320
I got so excited in the end that I just lay down.

408
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,160
That's what I mean.

409
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,280
Bro, you really get me.

410
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,720
No wonder you're on our team.

411
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Next time, keep something up your sleeve.

412
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,560
Okay.

413
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,320
This is hard to explain too.

414
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
Let's just become sworn brothers.

415
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,200
I didn't guess it right either.

416
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,920
Then let's all take the car together.

417
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,000
And head to the next location.

418
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
It's really beautiful.

419
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
Where we are now

420
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,440
is Bohai Town, Huairou, Beijing.

421
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,760
Located at the foot of the Mutianyu Great Wall.

422
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,920
At the end of 2024,

423
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
China introduced

424
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,960
a 240-hour visa-free transit policy.

425
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,840
This allows more and more foreign friends

426
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,800
to include this place in their in-depth travel plans.

427
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,280
They say music knows no borders.

428
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,960
Next,

429
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,800
you need to invite foreign friends

430
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,640
to join us.

431
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,560
Okay.

432
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,440
Let's go find them now.

433
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
Hurry.

434
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,640
Who among us speaks better English?

435
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,560
I'm okay, I can communicate.

436
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm just average.

437
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
You're definitely better than me.

438
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,880
I'll speak Dandong dialect to him.

439
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,760
You're going to speak Dandong dialect to him?

440
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,360
Let's see if he can understand.

441
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
Can you speak Chinese?

442
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,360
Beautiful woman

443
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,640
The girls all have a good sense of music

444
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,520
Hello

445
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
My name is Honglei

446
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,120
What is your name

447
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
Lily

448
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,360
Leilei

449
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,720
Lily, Leilei

450
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,080
The handsome guy in front with the guitar

451
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,119
Look at yourself with the guitar, what else can you say

452
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,200
Hello, sir

453
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Hello

454
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
Where are you from

455
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,200
Excuse me

456
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,400
Romania

457
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,920
Romania

458
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,960
Handsome guy

459
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
Chinese handsome guy

460
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,960
I am a chef

461
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,800
Did you know

462
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,520
Chef

463
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm a chef

464
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,400
There are two experts below, it feels fast

465
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,680
Where are you from

466
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm from Cameroon

467
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,880
Côte d'Ivoire

468
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,080
Côte d'Ivoire

469
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
Let's use a performance

470
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,480
or something like that

471
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,520
to get them to join us, okay?

472
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,160
Is that how it works?

473
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,280
Alright, that's fine

474
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,240
I think we should nominate Wenzi

475
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,200
Wenzi can do a dance

476
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,320
Everyone just sings, it's not that interesting

477
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,280
Wenzi can dance

478
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,080
No

479
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,240
Then I'll dance

480
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
Is there music?

481
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Bro, what kind of song should we find?

482
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,320
Disco

483
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,960
What kind of disco?

484
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,440
Street dance

485
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,280
Hip-hop

486
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,720
What should we look for?

487
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,160
It needs to be copyright-cleared

488
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,600
If you use a Lay Zhang song, it should be fine

489
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,920
That's awesome, bro

490
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,200
It's your turn

491
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,960
Let's sing a song

492
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,160
Which song?

493
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,880
Let's keep it low-key

494
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Let's sing "Beijing Welcomes You"

495
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,800
"Beijing Welcomes You" works too

496
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,440
Let's sing it enthusiastically for them

497
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,640
Okay

498
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,200
Come on, let's look it up

499
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,680
Sorry

500
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,520
Please wait a moment

501
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,800
We'd like to sing a song for you

502
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
A special song

503
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,960
After we speak in English

504
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,440
Everyone's starting to go a bit quiet now.

505
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,240
We're ready.

506
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,040
One, two, three.

507
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,120
Beijing welcomes you.

508
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,440
Sharing the air under the sun.

509
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,040
Setting new records on the yellow earth.

510
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,480
That's good.

511
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,840
Come on, bow again.

512
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
One, two, three.

513
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,480
Thank you.

514
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,640
Don't say anything.

515
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,480
That was really well sung.

516
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Really nice.

517
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,320
Forget it, maybe we should just lose.

518
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,680
That was really moving.

519
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,520
Okay.

520
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,120
Bro.

521
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
Bro.

522
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,760
Alright, it's settled then.

523
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,480
You said it.

524
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,080
Alright.

525
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,520
Come on.

526
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,000
Go for it!

527
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,760
Honglei.

528
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Three.

529
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,560
Two.

530
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,160
One.

531
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,000
Start.

532
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,800
Why can't you do it either?

533
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,440
The mime didn't come out.

534
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,040
No, why did you...

535
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,760
No words.

536
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Who could guess this?

537
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,040
He was just criticizing others.

538
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
Can I give it a try?

539
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
I just find this kid strange.

540
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
How can he act like this?

541
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,480
I could never act like that, right?

542
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,320
Musical.

543
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,600
Bro, don't speak too soon.

544
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,320
And don't set goals yet, bro.

545
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,040
Right?

546
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,120
That's about the same.

547
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,120
Why does it feel like he's talking in his sleep?

548
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,960
Who among you could have imagined it?

549
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,680
He was the most abstract one up there.

550
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,880
That's about the same.

551
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,320
Really.

552
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,480
Are you okay?

553
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,840
Yeah.

554
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,160
I think this rap

555
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm totally out of it.

556
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,320
Rap.

557
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,640
This rap, I...

558
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
Rap, huh.

559
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,960
I think we should play a song.

560
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,520
If you can, play a song.

561
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
Alright, come on.

562
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,760
Chorus part, get ready.

563
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,120
Don't wake me up.

564
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,360
"Kirin"

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,120
"Kirin"

566
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,680
The one with the pose, right?

567
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,440
How do you learn this?

568
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,760
Strike a pose.

569
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,400
Still have to hold it.

570
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,800
Southern Shaolin.

571
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,720
You sang it right.

572
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
We just didn't recognize it.

573
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,960
Bro, what you just did was about right.

574
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
We could've guessed it.

575
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,040
It's not my fault you didn't get it, right?

576
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,320
If anyone disagrees, come up.

577
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,640
I really can't do it.

578
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,680
Let Yuning sing.

579
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,400
Yeah, let Yuning sing.

580
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,720
Cheer up, man.

581
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,880
He'll definitely sing it accurately.

582
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,640
So I have to

583
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,080
grab it right away.

584
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,960
Three, two, one, go.

585
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I've really never heard this song.

586
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,920
Alright, you have your off days too.

587
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,360
You're about the same, man.

588
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,480
I'll say the singer first.

589
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,080
Eason Chan

590
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,120
This melody sounds really familiar.

591
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,760
The chorus is coming up soon.

592
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,400
I know what this song is now.

593
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,920
I hear it, I hear it.

594
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,640
Everyone has probably heard this song.

595
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,840
Alright, go ahead.

596
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,240
You guys have definitely heard it.

597
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,400
Okay, go ahead.

598
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,040
Alright, play it.

599
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,120
Is that polite, what you're doing?

600
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,400
Seriously.

601
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,920
Stop, you can stop now.

602
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,080
Because as soon as I start singing,

603
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
you'll all know what it is.

604
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,400
Okay, three, two, one.

605
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,280
Naiwen bro

606
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,280
You go ahead.

607
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,840
Okay.

608
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,200
Go.

609
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,840
Three.

610
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,200
Two.

611
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,040
One.

612
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
Start.

613
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,400
You can't just make

614
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,360
sounds only they can hear.

615
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,280
We can't hear it over here.

616
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,240
Louder.

617
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Right.

618
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,280
Such a confused look.

619
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,920
He's frozen.

620
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,360
Is it controlling your brain or what?

621
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,000
This kind of sounds like rap again.

622
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
Bro, have you heard it before?

623
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,320
Yeah.

624
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,280
Did he sing it right?

625
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes.

626
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,640
What song is this?

627
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,160
"First Day"

628
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,040
"First Day" by Stefanie Sun.

629
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,480
I haven't heard it.

630
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,840
None of us have heard it.

631
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,600
Sis must have heard it.

632
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,440
I actually have heard it.

633
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,280
I actually can sing it.

634
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,280
But just now, I really

635
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,320
didn't recognize it.

636
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,000
It has to be Naiwen bro being a bit more abstract.

637
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,200
Why not let him sing?

638
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,720
He sings.

639
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,080
Then you guys won't recognize anything.

640
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,560
I'm telling you,

641
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,440
No way.

642
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
It's okay, Xingxu.

643
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,160
We're from the musical department.

644
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
Three.

645
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
Two.

646
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,360
One.

647
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,400
Sing loudly, Xingxu, it's fine.

648
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,480
Start.

649
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,040
Intro.

650
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,080
No need to explain, it's okay.

651
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,320
Intro, still the intro.

652
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,120
Haven't started the lyrics yet.

653
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,200
You just tried the intro earlier.

654
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,600
Got it.

655
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,040
You startled me.

656
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,880
Awesome.

657
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,120
Not bad.

658
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,360
Impressive.

659
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,880
I haven't even heard that song yet.

660
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,080
That just startled me.

661
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,080
Perfume.

662
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,560
Is poisonous.

663
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
I almost slipped up.

664
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
This one's really tough.

665
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,960
This song is really hard.

666
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,120
This is impressive, really impressive.

667
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,640
Very impressive.

668
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,720
How did you guess that?

669
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,120
This person just reads a lot.

670
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,080
They know a lot of songs.

671
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,120
We're getting ready to go to the Great Wall.

672
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,680
To complete our final task.

673
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,280
Alright?

674
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
Everyone, let's go.

675
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,080
Let's go, bro.

676
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,880
Let's go.

677
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,720
Have you ever been to this section of the Great Wall?

678
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,480
Mutianyu Great Wall.

679
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
It's my first time here.

680
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,160
Me too.

681
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,480
I think when my daughter is a bit older,

682
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,280
I'll bring her here.

683
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
And tell her about it.

684
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,880
There's a section of the Great Wall in Dandong, where I'm from.

685
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,760
The Hushan Great Wall.

686
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,320
I've been to that one.

687
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,520
But the Great Wall in Beijing, honestly,

688
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,480
I've lived in Beijing for so many years and never climbed it once.

689
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah.

690
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
And we didn't climb it this time either.

691
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah.

692
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
We took a shortcut this time.

693
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,320
We took the shortcut route.

694
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,680
I climbed Badaling once when I was a kid.

695
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,760
It took a long time to get to the top.

696
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,680
After reaching a beacon tower, there was still another section to go.

697
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,560
I really couldn't go any further.

698
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,080
Then I wondered how to get back down.

699
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,240
I couldn't climb down anymore.

700
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,280
So I took their slide, there was a little cart.

701
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
A little cart, and then

702
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,560
It slid down really fast.

703
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,160
The place where you come down from the Wall and the parking lot where you started

704
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
are at opposite ends.

705
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,440
It takes half an hour to walk from one to the other.

706
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah, you might as well just climb down.

707
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,840
Yeah, might as well climb down.

708
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,040
It's really high, this place.

709
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,640
We're already this high up just taking the cable car.

710
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,960
Imagine when they built it back then,

711
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
Just think about it, right?

712
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,280
Yeah.

713
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,360
Do you know why I'm afraid of heights?

714
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,880
I tend to overthink things.

715
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
What about flying on a plane and such?

716
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
Flying is fine for me.

717
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Because I often

718
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,040
before the plane even takes off,

719
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
I fall asleep.

720
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,720
Once, when I was filming, I was really tired.

721
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,760
Before the plane took off,

722
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,320
I fell asleep.

723
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,160
When I woke up after we landed,

724
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,000
I wondered why we hadn't taken off.

725
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,040
Then I looked around,

726
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,080
and saw the lights signaling and people getting their luggage.

727
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,720
Everyone was already pulling out their luggage.

728
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,120
You know?

729
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,040
No one woke you up?

730
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
It's not that no one woke me up.

731
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,920
I just didn't know.

732
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,480
We had already landed.

733
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,520
I didn't hear a thing.

734
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,840
I didn't even know when we took off or landed.

735
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,400
That was the only time.

736
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,760
You slept really well then.

737
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,480
Yeah, I slept well.

738
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,000
Look, there's a sunset today.

739
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Look over there.

740
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,720
Hey, bro.

741
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,520
It's so beautiful.

742
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,640
It was raining when we came yesterday, right?

743
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,600
We're pretty lucky.

744
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,560
We really are.

745
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,440
I feel like today, for me,

746
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,120
it's the best timing,

747
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,720
and the best mindset to be here.

748
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,840
Yeah.

749
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
These steps are really big.

750
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
Yeah, I even said at the time,

751
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,160
were people in ancient times this tall?

752
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,680
Even He Ge would have trouble getting up here.

753
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,000
Let's take a selfie.

754
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,080
Three, two, one.

755
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,040
Okay, now one with this ball.

756
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
This is actually really cool.

757
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
Go over there, I'll take a picture of you. Hurry!

758
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,600
Give the phone to the staff, or hand it over.

759
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,840
Help us take a group photo.

760
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,880
Let's switch places.

761
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,400
Switch places.

762
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,520
Then turn around and look back, that feels nice.

763
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,440
Can we make it look cooler?

764
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,080
Cool.

765
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,400
Okay.

766
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
Send it to the group.

767
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
The weather is amazing today.

768
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,160
It's so awesome.

769
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,000
Look at the sunset, the colors are changing.

770
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,040
It's super beautiful.

771
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,800
Wait a second.

772
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,960
I want to take a picture of them.

773
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
What they're doing is so cool.

774
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,920
Now that's cool.

775
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,520
It feels like they're

776
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,160
storming a castle or something.

777
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,720
Yeah, we're backing up.

778
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,680
And then the army is closing in.

779
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,920
Thank you, everyone.

780
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,760
Great job, everyone.

781
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,080
You sang so well.

782
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,600
I was moved too.

783
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,600
I almost couldn't hold it together.

784
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Professionalism.

785
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
At least the tears didn't fall.

786
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
But my nose was running.

787
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
I couldn't hold back from the very first line.

788
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,360
It was so beautiful.

789
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,160
You’re all college students, right?

790
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,280
Yes.

791
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,160
Which university are you from?

792
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,960
Communication University.

793
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,520
Nice to meet you, juniors.

794
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,800
Hello, senior.

795
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,240
Well, we’re kind of in the same field.

796
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,640
I’m from the Central Academy of Drama.

797
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,280
Where are you going?

798
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,000
What? What?

799
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,360
Communication University is sort of in the same industry.

800
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,160
Really, because

801
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,720
many teachers at Communication University

802
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,000
graduated from the Central Academy of Drama.

803
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,520
A lot of your teachers

804
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,640
are graduates from our Central Academy of Drama.

805
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
It’s so beautiful over there.

806
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,080
It’s so beautiful over there, Honglei.

807
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
What is this light called?

808
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,720
Does it have something to do with density?

809
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,720
At this moment, we should sing

810
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,760
"Sunset Glow," right?

811
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,560
Have you heard it?

812
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,360
Nothing is more beautiful than the sunset glow.

813
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,120
Seeing the most beautiful sunset on the Great Wall.

814
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,320
I hope we can

815
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,800
share this moment with everyone, okay?

816
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,320
Let’s thank once again

817
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,720
the university students from the choir.

818
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,320
Thank you, everyone.

819
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,240
Thank you.

820
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,480
Come quickly.

821
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,840
Let's take a group photo.

822
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,240
Okay.

823
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,920
Like it.

824
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
I think this one.

825
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Great Wall.

826
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,680
Everyone, come.

827
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,800
Three, two, one.
