1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,240
Next up,

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,400
we're going to do

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,800
a Cantonese-related challenge.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,560
Cantonese Singing Challenge.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,040
The members will split into two teams.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,880
One team has four people.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,680
The other team has five.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,320
One person describes in Cantonese.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
The others guess.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,160
The describer can only use descriptions

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
to convey the lyrics to the guessers.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,480
During the process,

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,520
you can't say any actual words from the lyrics.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,120
If the guesser gets it right

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,960
and sings the lyric in Cantonese,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,800
that's a success.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,280
The team with the shortest total time wins.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,480
Take your time.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,040
Okay.

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,160
One word.

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,000
My antonym.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,880
You.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,720
You.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,160
Two or three words.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,560
Meteor.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,080
No.

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,400
Swimming pool.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,120
Swimming pool.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,760
There's a swimming pool outside.

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,120
Water.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
There's water.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,640
Definitely has water.

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,560
The water is deep.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,200
Spring water.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,120
No.

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
There's also a conch.

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,840
Stop talking, okay.

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,880
Don't speak.

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,480
Swimming pool.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,160
Swimming pool.

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,960
There's water.

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,360
There's water.

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
Very deep.

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
Deep end.

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,400
Deep is correct.

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,080
What's the opposite of deep?

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,560
Shallow.

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
Two.

49
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Shallow.

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,920
Your gentle smile is like plum sauce.

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,720
Wait a second.

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,600
Pause for a moment.

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,479
You sing it solo.

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,040
Your gentle smile is like plum sauce.

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,120
Is that right?

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
Hurry.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,600
That's correct.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
Go back quickly.

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,480
Hurry up.

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,320
Next.

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,920
David Tao.

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,680
Yes.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,080
Then you can guess David Tao.

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,640
Your Cantonese is totally messed up now.

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,280
The last part.

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
The last three words.

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,120
The last three words.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,720
What is this?

69
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,160
Hand.

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:00,880
Hand.

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,440
No, hand.

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,120
Hand.

73
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Hand.

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Palm.

75
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,680
Hand.

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,120
Hold.

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,200
Hand touching hand.

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Hand holding.

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,560
Out of battery.

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
Palm.

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,680
Palm center.

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,560
Hold your hand.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Hold.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,080
Describes two people.

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,920
For a very long time.

86
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Grow old together.

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,400
This girl.

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,160
Goes to the city.

89
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Long-distance relationship.

90
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,120
Work.

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,920
Work part-time.

92
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,600
This girl.

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
I'm not talking about the lyrics.

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm talking about the story.

95
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,480
Small town.

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,880
"Small Town Girl"

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
"Small Town Girl"

98
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,720
How does it go?

99
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
I forgot too.

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,200
I can't sing it.

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,320
Right.

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,440
Heard you became a big manager.

103
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
No.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Not this line.

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,320
Go back a bit.

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
Yes, that's the line.

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,880
The lyrics.

108
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,680
What are they?

109
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,640
Two people in love.

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
Can't look into your eyes.

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
Too shy to lift my head.

112
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Right.

113
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,400
That's the second line.

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,040
Second line.

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
We hold hands.

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
Makes me too shy to lift my head.

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,960
Right.

118
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,400
Finished singing.

119
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,160
Too shy to lift my head.

120
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,040
When?

121
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,080
When I was little.

122
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,080
Sometimes.

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
How do you describe childhood?

124
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,400
Childhood.

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,640
Childhood.

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,320
Childhood.

127
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Not childhood.

128
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,320
I got it.

129
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,960
When we were little, we held hands.

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
But I was too shy to lift my head.

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,440
When I was little.

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,280
When I was little, my mom told me.

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
Your Cantonese is really good.

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,520
Small.

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
When I was little.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Lyrics

137
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,840
The third word

138
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Write it down

139
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,920
Write and remember

140
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,600
Remember

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,360
Remember

142
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,080
Earth

143
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,000
Sky

144
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,760
Sky

145
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,960
Earth

146
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,320
Earth and memory

147
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,200
Earth

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,560
Get

149
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,200
Remember

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Remember

151
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,440
Small

152
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,680
Small is one

153
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,320
What is many

154
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,840
Very

155
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,760
Many

156
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
Right

157
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Many

158
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
Many

159
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,880
2025

160
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,800
Year

161
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,160
Year

162
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,560
Year

163
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,520
Age

164
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,640
Many years ago

165
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,200
Still remember many years ago

166
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Still remember holding hands with you many years ago

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Sing it out

168
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,680
Holding hands with you many years ago

169
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
Holding hands with you

170
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,680
You were too shy to look up

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay, next

172
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
We're here like a top class meeting

173
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,000
We said

174
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,680
We must give both specific and general descriptions

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,840
And we keep reviewing

176
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,680
Overall approach

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
We've covered the main idea

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,240
If the approach is wrong

179
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,000
You'll go further off track

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Further off track

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
If the approach drifts, pull it back immediately

182
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,840
Right

183
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,080
It's too easy to say the antonym

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,880
How do you say invisible

185
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
There's a type of plane you can't see

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,520
Right

187
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,080
I got it right away

188
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
That's the right approach

189
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
You don't have to say it

190
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Just say wings

191
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,880
There are a pair of wings

192
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,640
Isn't that

193
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,080
Right

194
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,960
No need to say

195
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
No need to describe every single one

196
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,400
Right?

197
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,520
Right

198
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,640
Highlight the key points

199
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
I think it's all about the approach

200
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,000
It's that understanding

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,560
Okay

202
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,520
I feel like I'm in a top class

203
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,400
We are the top class

204
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,880
Just messing around

205
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,560
Director, are we still playing?

206
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,080
We're on a whole different level

207
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
Actually, I think this game

208
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Is great

209
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm a bit hungry now

210
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay

211
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,280
There's still a chance

212
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,840
The first five words

213
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
The first five words

214
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,920
Remember

215
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,280
Antonym

216
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Forget

217
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
Give me a glass of Forget Love Potion

218
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,400
The third and fourth words are "forget"

219
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,560
What

220
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,840
What to forget

221
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
Can't forget

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,040
Can't forget

223
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,760
Can't forget

224
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,400
Who is it?

225
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,320
Can't forget you

226
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,800
Can't

227
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,640
What are you even singing?

228
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,880
Can't forget you

229
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,240
You

230
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
With a pen

231
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Write you in my diary

232
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,640
Can't forget you

233
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,880
All I think about is you

234
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Your antonym

235
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,360
Me

236
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,080
You and me

237
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,440
You and me

238
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,120
Heart to heart

239
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,000
You and me

240
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Girls and boys

241
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
Fall in love

242
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
You and me

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Kiss goodbye

244
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
You and I kiss goodbye

245
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,559
Kiss goodbye

246
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,000
You and I kiss goodbye

247
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
On an empty street

248
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,120
You and I kiss goodbye

249
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,919
On an empty street

250
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,000
Others laugh at me

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
No

252
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,880
The first and second characters below are correct

253
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Third line

254
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,840
Let

255
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
Let the wind

256
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,200
Let the wind mock me, I can't refuse

257
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,960
You and I kiss goodbye

258
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,160
On an empty street

259
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
Let the wind and rain

260
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,960
I can't refuse

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
"Let the wind" is correct

262
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,960
Let the wind and rain

263
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,320
That character

264
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
Let the wind

265
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,320
Let the wind laugh at me

266
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,760
Let the wind blow on me

267
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,680
Let the wind mock me

268
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
Mock me, I can't refuse

269
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
Can't refuse

270
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,800
That's the right idea

271
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,640
What are you?

272
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,400
I am

273
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,280
First

274
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
Second character

275
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,760
Second character

276
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,400
Is

277
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,160
Is "beautiful"

278
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
Woman

279
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
What am I?

280
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
You are a man

281
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,600
Man

282
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,800
No

283
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,400
What am I?

284
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
You are a person

285
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,160
Right

286
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,800
Woman

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,560
Right

288
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,440
Be your lovely woman

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,840
You're also a woman

290
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,680
Flower woman

291
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,760
Woman Flower

292
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Woman Flower swaying in the world

293
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,360
Come

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Third one

295
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,800
Come

296
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,080
Me

297
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,680
Woman

298
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
Beautiful woman

299
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,480
No

300
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
No more abstract stuff

301
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,160
What does spinning around mean?

302
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,120
Restart it

303
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
First character

304
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,560
Me

305
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,000
You

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,560
You

307
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,360
You

308
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,960
You

309
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,600
You

310
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,080
You

311
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,920
Yesterday

312
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,680
Yesterday

313
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,120
You say

314
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,520
What does "eight o'clock's ting" mean?

315
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
Yesterday

316
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
I understood

317
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,680
I understood too

318
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,960
I got it

319
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,560
No internet

320
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't say it

321
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,280
Don't speak that English

322
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,680
Yesterday

323
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,640
Power outage

324
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,080
The second character

325
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
Electricity

326
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,040
You electrify me

327
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
You are electricity

328
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,800
You are electricity, you are light

329
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,960
You are the only legend

330
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,800
It's my turn

331
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm going

332
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Come

333
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,320
What's the opposite of "there"?

334
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Here

335
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,480
Here

336
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,960
Here

337
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,520
The first character is

338
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,000
The third character is

339
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,360
It's not "move mountains"

340
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Yu Gong Moves the Mountain

341
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
So cultured

342
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,840
Two, three, four, five, six

343
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,080
One

344
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,960
Yes

345
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
The third character is

346
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,680
One

347
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
What is this?

348
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,920
One hand

349
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,000
A lifetime

350
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,120
You're not in this channel

351
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,440
Hand

352
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,560
Combine it with the previous character

353
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,440
This move

354
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,000
This move

355
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
This simple love song

356
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,560
Yes

357
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,920
Sing it

358
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,400
Wait a moment

359
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I can't sing this song

360
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,160
What's the opposite of "big"?

361
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,680
Small

362
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
This is a

363
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,600
Simple little love song

364
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,560
There's more

365
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,440
No, there's another line

366
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,680
This is a simple little love song

367
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,920
After that

368
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,040
Singing about the dove in our hearts

369
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
No

370
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,680
On the head

371
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,400
In the heart

372
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Singing about the dove in our hearts

373
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
Impressive

374
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,440
A bit difficult

375
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,720
Okay

376
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,960
What time is it now?

377
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,840
The year 2025

378
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,560
No

379
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,000
Noon

380
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,040
Afternoon

381
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,680
Evening

382
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,320
Another word for "evening"

383
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,160
Nighttime

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,840
Night

385
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,120
Night

386
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
The night is so beautiful

387
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
Even if it's dangerous

388
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,640
There's always someone

389
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,960
Staying up all night with dark circles

390
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,200
Let's get ready to eat now.

391
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,800
Come on, bro.

392
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,040
Let's go.

393
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
Let's do it.

394
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm hungry.

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,080
Really hungry.

396
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,320
This looks amazing.

397
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,040
Look how well it's grilled.

398
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,640
So good.

399
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
Really great.

400
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,200
Thank you.

401
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,920
Is this pork?

402
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,280
Yes, we're having pork.

403
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,360
Thank you.

404
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,280
Thanks.

405
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,040
You're welcome.

406
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,040
Hungry.

407
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,560
Really hungry now.

408
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,080
Super hungry.

409
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,160
Here, grilled artichoke.

410
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,440
What's this?

411
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,080
Grilled artichoke.

412
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,680
It's unique to the Mediterranean.

413
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,280
Fruit.

414
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,800
Vegetable, fruit.

415
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,440
This is fruit.

416
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,320
Vegetable.

417
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,840
There are many.

418
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,920
Back when I played games,

419
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,200
I often searched for this plant.

420
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,920
Used artichoke to make herbal medicine.

421
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,400
Restores health.

422
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Snail.

423
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,840
Snail.

424
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,360
Okay.

425
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,880
Thank you.

426
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
This is potato.

427
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,680
This is really, really hot.

428
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
It's hot, be careful.

429
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,280
Okay, thanks.

430
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,440
I'll have a potato.

431
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,280
It's a bit hot.

432
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,560
Do you want one, bro?

433
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,320
Potato.

434
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,280
I'll pass.

435
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,560
Thanks.

436
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,160
I'll have one.

437
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
He really grills well.

438
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,440
This avocado salad is delicious.

439
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,800
Right?

440
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,320
It's really tasty.

441
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
It's made with olive oil and something else.

442
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
Mashed avocado.

443
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,200
With this dressing, it's so good.

444
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Okay, thank you.

445
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,880
You're welcome.

446
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
This dip is awesome.

447
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
Let me mix it.

448
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,400
Mix it up.

449
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
This dip is really tasty.

450
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,600
Delicious.

451
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,200
This sauce is delicious.

452
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,440
Yeah.

453
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,760
Awesome.

454
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,440
Tasty.

455
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,440
Unbelievable.

456
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,800
Thank you so much.

457
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,640
Thanks.

458
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
Let me have a bite.

459
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Happy birthday.

460
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,400
Happy birthday.

461
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
Last time.

462
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,320
It's the last day.

463
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,920
Sunshine.

464
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,280
Blue sky.

465
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,120
Great food.

466
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,040
This is Barcelona.

467
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,920
Once we're done eating, let's go sightseeing.

468
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,040
Can you tell us

469
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
about Crayon Shin-chan's family visiting this park?

470
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,400
What was the situation?

471
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,880
They came to Barcelona for a trip.

472
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
Let's watch it again later for details.

473
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
We'll sit there and watch another episode.

474
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,560
I don't remember exactly.

475
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,040
They went to

476
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
Sagrada Família too.

477
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
Sagrada Família.

478
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
They also visited the Gaudí trio.

479
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,560
I've already checked in at all of them.

480
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Same angle.

481
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,480
Really?

482
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,960
Let me take a photo for you.

483
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
Yeah, right here.

484
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,480
Stand here.

485
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Trust me, let's take one.

486
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,240
Don't move.

487
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,599
One, two, three.

488
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,440
One, two, three.

489
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,359
One, two, three.

490
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
How is it, Crayon Shin-chan?

491
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,839
Good, let's go.

492
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,480
Let's recreate this.

493
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,280
This is Yoshito Usui.

494
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,800
This is Hiroshi.

495
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,680
No, this is Yoshito Usui.

496
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,560
That's the author.

497
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
There's a character of the author in here.

498
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,200
Let's use this to take that photo.

499
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,920
Alright.

500
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,040
Let's assign roles today.

501
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm Hiroshi.

502
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm Misae.

503
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,880
He is...

504
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm Yoshito Usui.

505
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
Go away.

506
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
Why did you just...

507
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm Shin-chan.

508
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,040
Shin-chan.

509
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,720
Shin-chan.

510
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,160
Who's Hiroshi?

511
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,880
I'm Hiroshi.

512
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,520
You're Hiroshi.

513
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,560
But I'm not wearing socks.

514
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,320
That smell comes up right away.

515
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
You're Misae.

516
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,360
Then I think I can act it out.

517
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,080
Three layers of belly.

518
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,680
I might have more than two layers.

519
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,600
And I'm the one whose smell comes up instantly.

520
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,360
So what are you?

521
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm just...

522
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,840
I am...

523
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,600
You are...

524
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
Sister, pretty.

525
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,720
No, pretty sister.

526
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
Pretty sister.

527
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,360
Okay.

528
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,760
Okay.

529
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm Crayon Shin-chan.

530
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,680
Then call me once, let me hear it.

531
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:18,920
Let's go.

532
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,520
Let's go.

533
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,800
If I call you, would you dare to answer?

534
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Is there really such a good thing?

535
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,840
The main thing is this.

536
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,960
It was built a hundred years ago.

537
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,360
It was built in 1900.

538
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,440
It was officially abandoned in 1914.

539
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,120
In modern terms,

540
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,640
this project

541
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,600
was basically an unfinished building project.

542
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,560
These are

543
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,920
He originally wanted to build

544
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
a super luxurious villa district.

545
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,560
A villa district.

546
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,680
So this place was supposed to become

547
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,040
sixty luxury villas.

548
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,080
That was his plan at the time.

549
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
But it failed.

550
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,840
After it failed,

551
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,800
only three houses were built.

552
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,320
And then it failed.

553
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
They stopped building after that.

554
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,080
Why?

555
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,600
It was too far away.

556
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,360
It took four hours to travel back and forth by car.

557
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,880
Two hours to get there.

558
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,680
Two hours to come back.

559
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,800
So,

560
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,520
no one wanted to come.

561
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,200
Where was the developer from?

562
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,720
Mr. Güell.

563
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,880
When Mr. Güell passed away in 1918,

564
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,840
he left this project

565
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,800
to his son.

566
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,600
He had ten sons.

567
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
The inheritance went to the eldest.

568
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
The eldest was responsible for the other nine.

569
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,880
The eldest thought it was useless.

570
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,120
So,

571
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
he sold the entire park.

572
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,160
He sold it very cheaply.

573
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,960
Sold it for a low price.

574
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,160
Sold it to the government.

575
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,640
This house must always

576
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,040
be a public school.

577
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,880
So it's still a public school today.

578
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,920
This one.

579
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
The red one.

580
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,720
It's an elementary school.

581
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,960
Yes.

582
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,840
It's still an elementary school.

583
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,320
That's so cool.

584
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,320
This was the market back then.

585
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,360
Market.

586
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,440
This is the market.

587
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,160
The old market.

588
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:51,920
Come on.

589
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,080
Hey, Xingxu.

590
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,880
Just stand by this pillar.

591
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,920
Right.

592
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,560
I'll take a photo of you two.

593
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,960
Okay.

594
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,720
Alright.

595
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,040
So what's our story?

596
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,880
Well,

597
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,040
Okay.

598
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,440
Let's call our story

599
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,840
Corridor Through Time.

600
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,520
This is us.

601
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,160
Me now.

602
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,320
Then him in front.

603
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,440
Me before.

604
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,760
And finally, the youngest you.

605
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,360
Sounds good.

606
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,080
Okay.

607
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,600
Okay.

608
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,640
Okay.

609
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,280
Your turn.

610
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,920
The bag.

611
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,440
Give me the bag.

612
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,120
Okay.

613
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,880
Okay.

614
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,440
Alright, come on.

615
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,720
Your turn.

616
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,080
I'll take your photo.

617
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,720
I'll stand farther away.

618
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,360
I'll stand the farthest.

619
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,120
A little farther.

620
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,480
Okay.

621
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,400
That's about right.

622
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,160
That's about right.

623
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,640
Got all three.

624
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,160
Took a lot of photos.

625
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,920
Bro, is there another cup for me?

626
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,280
Of course.

627
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,520
I'm so touched.

628
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,440
I was just craving coffee.

629
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
Thanks.

630
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,960
This coffee smells amazing.

631
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,200
Is it okay?

632
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
Yes, absolutely.

633
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Ning is live streaming.

634
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
I wanted to go find him.

635
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,040
He's live.

636
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,480
Yeah.

637
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,240
Is he here?

638
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,080
Yeah, he's on the way.

639
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
I've never live streamed before.

640
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,440
No idea what it's like.

641
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,200
Let's connect with him.

642
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,120
Bad signal, right?

643
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,680
Can you see us, bro?

644
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,520
I can see.

645
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,760
I can see you.

646
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,080
It's so laggy.

647
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,480
Where are you?

648
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,080
Jing, are you nearby too?

649
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,600
Look quickly.

650
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,120
Should be nearby.

651
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,800
Naiwen.

652
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,480
Is Naiwen there too?

653
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Yeah, they're all here.

654
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,480
Xuxu.

655
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,320
Where are they?

656
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,840
Where are you guys?

657
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,320
Let's just go find him.

658
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,480
We're on Gothic Street.

659
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,200
Seems like we're right next to you.

660
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,080
Fan shop.

661
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,280
We'll come find you.

662
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,800
Is it beautiful?

663
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,000
Someone said I'm beautiful.

664
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
Nice, impressive, looks great.

665
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,840
This angle looks better.

666
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,280
Okay, the angle was a bit low just now.

667
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,520
Don't stream that part.

668
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
This part can be streamed.

669
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Can't see me?

670
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,880
It's frozen like a picture.

671
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
I can see.

672
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,480
Bro.

673
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Walk a bit further and you'll see us.

674
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,080
Go a bit further and you'll see them.

675
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,360
Are you guys on a tree-lined avenue?

676
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,720
Yeah.

677
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,840
Why do I feel like

678
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,200
I see them now.

679
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,320
The sun.

680
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,720
That's not it.

681
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
There's no sun here.

682
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,240
It's way too laggy.

683
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,000
This café looks really nice.

684
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,280
Stop connecting.

685
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,840
It's too laggy.

686
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,560
Everyone's here.

687
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,000
Are you at the cathedral?

688
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:38,960
Yeah.

689
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,600
They're at the cathedral.

690
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,560
Right next to us.

691
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,880
I know where you are now.

692
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,440
They found us.

693
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,800
It's too laggy.

694
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,720
Can't hear anything.

695
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,280
I have to hang up.
