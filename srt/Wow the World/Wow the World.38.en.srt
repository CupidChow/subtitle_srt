1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Let's give a big hand to our two mentors.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,450
Take a seat.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,400
There's still one contestant who hasn't arrived.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,800
If he's not here, just tell him not to come.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,550
He'll be here soon.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,050
The contestant is getting makeup done.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,940
You're quite special.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,540
Why do you need special treatment?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,990
You're really something.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,490
Chen He from Fuzhou, Fujian.

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,140
I'm honestly nervous right now.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,890
So nervous.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,640
Avoiding eye contact with the mentors.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,290
Really nervous.

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,040
Then it's you.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,440
Sure.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:37,890
No problem.

18
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,090
If you're nervous, let the most nervous one go first.

19
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,490
Let the most nervous one start.

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,715
Oh my gosh.

21
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:43,590
I'm so nervous.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,140
You want to perform for both mentors?

23
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,765
We'll perform first.

24
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:49,215
Perform first.

25
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,190
After the performance,

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,190
Do you have a lot of power in the end?

27
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,240
Hey.

28
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,140
What's going on?

29
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,140
Questioning the mentor.

30
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,300
I need to introduce the two stars first.

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,700
Hello, producers.

32
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,100
I'm Salad Salad King from Wuhan, Hubei.

33
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,950
Love you.

34
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,450
Yu Wen.

35
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,000
No music.

36
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,250
Mentor.

37
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,100
Wake up.

38
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,260
I can't watch anymore.

39
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,460
Now's the time you can't watch anymore.

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,560
I want to die.

41
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,510
You.

42
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,260
Any other stories?

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,580
Or any other talents?

44
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,030
I didn't prepare anything.

45
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,780
Your song just now had no rhythm.

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,480
No R.

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
No punch line?

48
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,780
No English.

49
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,680
OK.

50
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,905
That's all "no" type.

51
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:55,530
How about you...

52
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,140
Let's put you on hold for now.

53
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,090
I'll be on hold first.

54
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,290
You have no story.

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,315
I have no story.

56
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:02,940
That's not an advantage in our show.

57
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,640
Is this storytime for you guys?

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,690
Questioning the mentor.

59
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,265
Are you openly challenging the mentor?

60
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,065
Who picked you?

61
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,190
Getting mad at the mentor.

62
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,690
Getting mad at the mentor.

63
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,715
You two are so pretentious.

64
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:16,690
Let me tell you,

65
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,210
From the very beginning,

66
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,660
You two wearing sunglasses, what are you looking at?

67
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,610
I really love your personality.

68
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,310
I want you.

69
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,110
Join my team.

70
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,385
I have 88 concerts this year.

71
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,210
Wait a second.

72
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,910
Mentor.

73
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,210
I just now...

74
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,530
Alright.

75
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,580
You like someone with personality.

76
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,980
I just like your kind of personality.

77
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,680
I have 88 concerts this year.

78
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,680
Mentor Gong.

79
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,430
I'm your fan.

80
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,955
Join me.

81
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:45,430
Join me.

82
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,880
Pick me.

83
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,730
Actually, I like this kind too.

84
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,630
Why didn't I pick just now?

85
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,180
Sis.

86
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,880
Don't interrupt your husband.

87
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,455
Oh my god.

88
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:57,530
So much personality.

89
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,230
Love it.

90
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,830
This is exactly the kind of contestant we need.

91
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,055
Performance is over.

92
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:03,680
Next one.

93
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,580
I'm next.

94
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,105
I want to pick someone next.

95
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,730
You've already picked someone for looks.

96
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,330
Mentor.

97
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,255
You've already picked one.

98
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:10,530
It's fine.

99
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,555
I'll pick together at the end.

100
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:12,730
Let's go again.

101
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,080
Let's split up again.

102
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,305
OK.

103
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:14,555
Alright.

104
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:15,280
Sure, sure.

105
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,530
Who's next?

106
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,130
We need one of these.

107
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,310
I think we need someone to set the tone.

108
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,760
Someone online already set the tone.

109
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,560
Then it's settled.

110
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,810
Come on.

111
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,560
I saw a really talented contestant online before.

112
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,710
Their singing is really beautiful.

113
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,160
Is it Liu Yuning?

114
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,610
Come on.

115
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,460
Let the one who sets the tone come.

116
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,610
I've known about you for a long time.

117
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,860
I want to see what kind of tone this setter brings.

118
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,870
I've followed you on my alt Weibo for ages.

119
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,770
Don't let me down.

120
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,620
In this musical dream,

121
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,070
Two singers have deeply influenced me.

122
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,770
The first is Jay Chou.

123
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,070
The second is Mentor Gong Jun.

124
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,220
So,

125
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,870
Next, I'll sing a song that our mentor Gong Jun has performed.

126
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,220
Start your performance.

127
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,520
If it's not sad enough,

128
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,370
then you can't soar.

129
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,370
Without a dream,

130
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,870
why go far?

131
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,810
I've always been wandering.

132
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,160
But I've never seen the ocean.

133
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,710
I thought I could forget.

134
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,185
Thank you.

135
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:26,385
Alright.

136
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,235
I'll stay on hold for now.

137
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,310
Can we decide which team to join later?

138
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,235
So I passed, right?

139
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:30,660
Right?

140
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,760
With me,

141
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,110
you'll always have a pass card.

142
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,180
Next.

143
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,180
Next one.

144
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,380
The one who was sucking up just now.

145
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,430
Let him, the awkward one, come up.

146
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,130
Uncle Wan.

147
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,980
Me?

148
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,180
I can do anything.

149
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,443
Anything.

150
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:50,530
Can you wash socks?

151
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,130
Our team needs someone to wash socks.

152
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,005
I can't wash socks.

153
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:54,980
But I can learn.

154
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,900
I can learn.

155
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,250
I also have stories.

156
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,600
Stories.

157
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,350
We love hearing your stories.

158
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,250
That's your advantage.

159
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,350
This is an international show.

160
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,600
I...

161
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,000
I need you to tell your story mixing English and Chinese.

162
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,735
I've done 18 concerts.

163
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:27,335
And then?

164
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,460
I need a guest like you who can tell stories.

165
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,535
Thank you.

166
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:30,785
Thanks.

167
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:31,335
There's substance.

168
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,010
There's a story.

169
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,785
We're missing a script like yours.

170
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:34,210
Right?

171
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Yes.

172
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,950
Let me think about it.

173
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,975
I'll think about it.

174
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,750
I think I should make an album for him.

175
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,900
Who's next?

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,825
The next ones aren't very enthusiastic.

177
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:49,050
You can really see the difference between the two teams today.

178
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Choosing me has its advantages.

179
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,650
The remaining contestants should think carefully.

180
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,600
Is there anything with a highlight?

181
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,500
We need a highlight—pick me, join my team, join my team!

182
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,300
It's so good the mentor can't even handle it.

183
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm afraid you'll overshadow me if you join my team.

184
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm the grand finale, the grand finale!

185
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,475
How about this—

186
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:14,375
Today,

187
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,250
it's also a music show.

188
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,370
We have to show something, right?

189
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,670
Give me something earth-shattering.

190
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,270
A deep bass.

191
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,320
Not deep enough.

192
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,970
Still not deep enough.

193
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,670
I see the contestant in the back is eager to try.

194
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
Why don't you give it a try?

195
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,620
The competitive spirit just kicked in.

196
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,170
Come on.

197
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,770
We have to win this.

198
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,120
Friends walk together for life.

199
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,670
Those days are gone, you reckless guy, so tall.

200
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,670
I remember ten years ago.

201
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,970
I didn't know you.

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,373
You didn't belong to me.

203
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,860
We're still the same.

204
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,910
Suddenly, the sky turned dark.

205
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,010
The world can suddenly have nothing at all.

206
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,060
I ask why.

207
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,860
That girl sent me a message.

208
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,170
It just feels like someone is missing.

209
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,320
And I gradually understand.

210
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,420
You are still my constant care.

211
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,570
Knowing you

212
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,020
makes my happiness sound so sweet.

213
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,260
At twenty-one, I have no big wishes.

214
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,860
Nothing much to do.

215
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,460
There are so many people in this world.

216
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,960
So tall.

217
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,060
Swimming in the water.

218
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,560
See for yourself.

219
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,735
There are so many people in this world.

220
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:07,760
There's an open door in the crowd.
