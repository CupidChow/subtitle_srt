1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,425
Let's start with a song.

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:05,900
Let our new friend enjoy some singing.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,200
Today is a good day.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,725
All the auspicious things are behind us.

5
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:13,550
Turn your back to the past.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,500
Don't let the guest see your face.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,350
Okay.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,800
I don't know why

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,445
there's this sadness.

10
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:25,033
It surrounds me.

11
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:28,970
The most romantic thing I can think of

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,070
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,120
Who brought

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,020
the ancient call?

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,350
Who

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,150
left behind a thousand years of emotion?

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,550
Could it be that there is still

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,700
Hmm.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,900
someone who can write

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,580
the most biting words

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,930
and embrace the dust with a smile?

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,930
The one beside you has taken my seat.

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,380
He holds roses in his hands.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,705
He promises to stay with you for the rest of his life.

25
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,030
He'll never understand.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,980
My sorrow is like the day not understanding the night.

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,730
When did you come?

28
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,230
Teachers.

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,255
If my singing gets dull, I won't move at all.

30
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:30,955
Not moving at all.

31
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:31,780
Completely still.

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,680
Not moving.

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,580
A very handsome back view.

34
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,760
Boys, stand up.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,160
Hey.

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,910
You know how to play this game now, right?

37
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,460
Yeah, I know how to play.

38
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,660
Can we play for real now?

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,685
Director.

40
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:57,660
We... we think Liu Yuning is affecting our work here.

41
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,035
Yeah.

42
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,335
Bro.

43
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,560
You're right, you're absolutely right.

44
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,530
Liu Yuning is affecting our looks here.

45
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,730
Bro.

46
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,280
Let me tell you something.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,580
I'm terrible at rock-paper-scissors.

48
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,630
Stop bragging, get ready.

49
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,105
No, I won't.

50
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,080
I have to beat you.

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,555
Think about it, yesterday, who was the only one I beat? That's right.

52
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:17,380
Yesterday, yesterday.

53
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,280
So today I'll show you what real

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,860
rock-paper-scissors is.

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,335
I've never lost at scissors-paper.

56
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:29,535
Bro.

57
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:30,010
Let me tell you something.

58
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,310
I've never lost at rock-paper-scissors in my life.

59
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,740
Did we just team up successfully again?

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,240
Or am I still your good little brother?

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,690
Tell him why you have to stand on tiptoe.

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,840
Just now, I...

63
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,715
What's up?

64
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,190
We're fine here.

65
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,790
You'll send someone else over.

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,440
Our sixth sense is really strong.

67
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,840
You lost to a sock.

68
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,340
I'm the foot.

69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,030
So who's the unlucky one now?

70
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,255
He's the unlucky one now, right?

71
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:02,930
I'm not unlucky.

72
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,630
Me.

73
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,380
You three unlucky ones are already decided, so what does Liu Yuning have to do with you?

74
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,780
Seriously.

75
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,730
Let's just use strategy.

76
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,380
When I act exaggerated, I make it really obvious.

77
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,170
So they don't know.

78
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,620
But now you know everything.

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,370
I still don't get it.

80
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,070
I still don't get it.

81
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,620
I didn't hear it.

82
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,770
It's fine now.

83
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,570
After everyone is ready,

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,245
just secretly show it to the camera.

85
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:34,545
Alright.

86
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:36,070
No need to do it so openly.

87
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,770
Just do it here.

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,595
Watch here.

89
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,120
Just joking, take a quick look here.

90
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,045
Yeah.

91
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:40,195
Okay.

92
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:40,645
Then I'll go first.

93
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,370
I'll go first, come on.

94
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,955
No, what I saw was

95
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:44,655
Honglei.

96
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:45,455
So many Hongleis.

97
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:46,180
I'm not going.

98
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,730
When sleeping, only you did that action.

99
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,880
We all just lay down.

100
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,230
But you threw the phone.

101
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,480
Listen to me, I'll explain in a bit, okay?

102
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,305
You, you were out.

103
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:54,755
Then wait a moment.

104
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:55,805
Let me think for a second too.

105
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:58,230
Wait, wait, wait.

106
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,105
Everyone's already out.

107
00:03:59,105 --> 00:03:59,830
I'm not guessing anymore.

108
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Then let's just give up.

109
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,325
Right?

110
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,275
Is that what you mean?

111
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:02,475
Hey.

112
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,450
Your team gave up.

113
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,750
Can't give up

114
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,250
Can't give up

115
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:05,675
Just guess

116
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:06,000
Right?

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,650
Let's just guess

118
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,125
He Ge

119
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,200
Did I give you a signal?

120
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,500
Yeah, yeah, but I didn't guess who you were

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,750
I said it three times

122
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,650
Yeah, I guessed wrong, my bad, my bad

123
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,400
I think there was a problem with my acting

124
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,850
Yeah

125
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,200
Me too

126
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Four

127
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,500
That should be the logic, right?

128
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,440
Guessed me right

129
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,490
He guessed I was three, so I must have acted well

130
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,190
Right?

131
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,690
Yeah

132
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,340
Just so happy

133
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,665
Feels like I could die without regrets

134
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:30,940
Really, what does that have to do with pulling my neck?

135
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,490
Bro

136
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,890
I've never lost at this game.

137
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,780
Don't jinx it yet.

138
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,930
Don't play rock-paper-scissors yet.

139
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,280
No way.

140
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,355
I think Yuning is representing all of us.

141
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,680
He's the only one who went up.

142
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,818
But I...

143
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,130
I-I can represent our team.

144
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,480
But you three are a team.

145
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,180
You forgot that you're already strong enough.

146
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,080
In the face of strength,

147
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,855
all skills are useless.

148
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,280
Got it?

149
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,680
As long as you have this confidence,

150
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,980
let's brainstorm together.

151
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,535
Let's discuss it together.

152
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:01,060
Sun Bing

153
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,060
You're still on the previous topic.

154
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,360
Great Sage Equal to Heaven

155
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,110
Great Sage

156
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,460
That has nothing to do with this.

157
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,760
Bro

158
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,610
Great Sage Equal to Heaven, the Handsome Monkey King

159
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,860
What's his name?

160
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,810
The Heavenly Road is wide.

161
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,610
Oh.

162
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,535
Heavenly Road

163
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,285
I got it right.

164
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,860
Heavenly Road has had matches.

165
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,660
Skill

166
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm here.

167
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,660
I'm here.

168
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,118
There are too many rights and wrongs in love.

169
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:46,230
Coming to such a lively occasion,

170
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
it still has to be you.

171
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,230
Trust me.

172
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,680
Strike a pose.

173
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,740
The first day

174
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,490
I felt my first breath was so refreshing

175
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,740
Sure

176
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,040
I know what this song is

177
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,190
I heard it, I heard it

178
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,090
Everyone can recognize this song

179
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,115
Sing it out

180
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:31,840
Then you'll know

181
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,215
Come on

182
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:33,140
Three, two, one

183
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,460
You and I

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,170
One heart

185
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,170
Living in the same small village facing hardships

186
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,120
For our dreams

187
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,120
We travel a thousand miles

188
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,250
To meet in Beijing

189
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,200
Come

190
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,300
Let's

191
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,300
Friends

192
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,250
