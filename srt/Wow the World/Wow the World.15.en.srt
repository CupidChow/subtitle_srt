1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,575
Let me give an example.

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:05,550
Let's turn it into a flowing, streamlined story.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,900
For instance,

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,363
one day, this woman suddenly discovers her lover is missing.

5
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:09,225
At this moment,

6
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,050
the woman is searching for her lover.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,000
Then, the next second, her lover is practicing some incredible martial arts.

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,550
And then,

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,875
Hey,

10
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,150
I think improvising like this is definitely fun.

11
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,300
Let's come up with a story first.

12
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:20,370
I get it, I just thought of something.

13
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,220
Let's make it into a story.

14
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,795
Like this, bro.

15
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:25,370
You mean, a girl and a boy fall in love.

16
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,895
And then,

17
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,220
suddenly, two bandits appear.

18
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,270
They kidnap the girl.

19
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,295
That's what you call a missing lover.

20
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:30,945
Then, the guy wants to save his girl.

21
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:32,695
So he trains hard through all four seasons.

22
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:34,495
After that, he goes to rescue her.

23
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:35,995
He saves the girl.

24
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,395
He defeats three more villains for her.

25
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:38,345
And in the end, he becomes a—

26
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,080
a legendary hero.

27
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,655
Let's start with that.

28
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:41,955
So, the two of us are fighting over this woman.

29
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:42,530
And then,

30
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,080
in the end, I lose to him.

31
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,630
I call my buddies to kidnap you.

32
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,205
Then you train hard in martial arts.

33
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:47,955
Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

34
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:49,455
Finally, you come back and defeat us.

35
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:50,480
And you become a legendary hero.

36
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,495
Me

37
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:08,120
Which one do you want?

38
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,620
I think this one is more intense.

39
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,770
This one definitely feels like it can do it.

40
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,770
I definitely can do it.

41
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,095
Look.

42
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:14,295
Bro

43
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,420
Look how scary this is.

44
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,180
Mine

45
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,000
It's like a mix-and-match.

46
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,825
It's just Chen Tian.

47
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:45,250
Chen Tianba is a twisted killer.

48
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,900
Spring, summer, autumn, winter

49
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,150
Why spring, summer, autumn, and winter?

50
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,255
I got it.

51
00:01:58,255 --> 00:01:59,305
Aren't there props for that?

52
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:00,780
Spring is, you know, that thing...

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
Spring has wind.

54
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,155
And summer is when it rains.

55
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,180
Add a bit of rain.

56
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,880
Autumn is about scattering fallen leaves.

57
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,130
Winter is snow.

58
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,930
The accumulation of years.

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:29,740
This will pollute the environment.

60
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,140
You can do winter like this.

61
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,940
Forget about the environment.

62
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,540
What is this?

63
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,990
These are our autumn leaves.

64
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,800
What was that thing you just had?

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,150
This one.

66
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,950
In the pond.

67
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,450
Fish

68
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,050
I gave Acha a tea set.

69
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,425
He didn't write anything.

70
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,750
He just gave me four words.

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,100
Consider it a grand master beginner.

72
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,800
Turn things around with great ambition.

73
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,400
Hip movements.

74
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,100
How do a bunch of elderly people practice this?

75
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,635
Hurry.

76
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:34,660
Almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost done.

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,310
Here, have a piece of this pancake.

78
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,310
Try this pancake.

79
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,660
Have some fruit.

80
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,760
Here, have a peach.

81
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,160
Height.

82
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,460
I'll pick first.

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,720
My brother.

84
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,120
He’s a farmer.

85
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,195
Let me tell you.

86
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:13,420
Bro.

87
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,920
You’re ruining your image like this.

88
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,770
You can’t do that.

89
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,820
The kind with manners.

90
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,270
Stop hitting.

91
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,470
I won’t hit anymore.

92
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:26,995
Young master.

93
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:27,270
Next round.

94
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,820
Next round.

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,245
Oh no.

96
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,170
What kind of pose is that?

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,795
You can’t do it like this, right?

98
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,570
Is Uncle Nai about to lose?

99
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,220
Uncle Nai, you need to pout your upper lip a bit.

100
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,720
He’s about to laugh.

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,620
Once you laugh, it’s easy.

102
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,470
You can’t hold it in anymore.

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,830
I can't hold it, can you?

104
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,980
Why didn't I know?

105
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:51,980
Look.

106
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,530
I can't hold it.

107
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,180
It's your turn.

108
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,980
Of course I choose him, who else?

109
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,530
I think Didi should do it.

110
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:58,910
Oh.

111
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,535
You said the younger brother is me.

112
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:00,410
He said the younger brother is me.

113
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,260
Yuning, little brother.

114
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,610
Let Ning, the little brother, do it too.

115
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,110
I'll go first.

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,885
Oh no.

117
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:04,860
You're taller than me.

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,960
Get ready.

119
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,510
Come on.

120
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,660
Come on.

121
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,210
Stop fighting.

122
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,260
You guys, stop fighting.

123
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,250
Nostril.

124
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,025
Can't hold it.

125
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:29,850
I don't know why this is.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,225
If you can put it in your nostril.

127
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:32,100
We allow two.

128
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,500
Double swords.

129
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,100
Double swords combined.

130
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,375
Come.

131
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:37,650
Come.

132
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,150
Get ready.

133
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,480
I really can't hold it.

134
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,405
Why aren't you moving?

135
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,805
Seriously, you really can't hold me.

136
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:53,330
I'm not very good at it.

137
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,280
I helped wear out his muscle endurance for you.

138
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,555
Already did.

139
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:57,805
Bro,

140
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:58,480
beat him.

141
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,930
Bro,

142
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,880
Did he lose?

143
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,230
No.

144
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,810
I just don't like you.

145
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,660
Just fight, that's it.

146
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,735
There are no rules.

147
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:06,360
I just don't like you.

148
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,735
You're that legendary boss.

149
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,760
Just take them out.

150
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,760
This kind of thing has a rage meter.

151
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,790
Wow

152
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,290
Wait, wait

153
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,190
Honglei's is just like a drawer

154
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,890
What does "drawer" mean?

155
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,590
This is just like a floating board

156
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,765
Naiwen, do you see anything here you want to challenge?

157
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,640
Naiwen, challenge him

158
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,380
No, hands behind your back

159
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,055
This is intense

160
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,180
This is the most intense round ever

161
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,580
Okay

162
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,080
How about all five of us join in?

163
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,630
Let's play with him

164
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,580
Come on

165
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,605
Let's just go around this

166
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:57,180
Go around this

167
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,055
We can't go too far

168
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:58,480
Alright?

169
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,480
Seriously

170
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,350
How can you bite down so tightly?

171
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,500
So who's fighting whom?

172
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,175
Let's just have a free-for-all

173
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,200
We can form alliances first

174
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,625
Why do I feel like

175
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,250
this is just like a coliseum?

176
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,825
Can you guys watch from the side?

177
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:12,950
Are they going to release a lion later?

178
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,190
Let's guess who will win.

179
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,890
I'm not important.

180
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,840
I'll put up a straw.

181
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,790
I support that mosquito.

182
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,140
Okay.

183
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,340
Then I'll support my little brother.

184
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
I'll go with a plum.

185
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,790
I support my little brother.

186
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,063
Do we have a coin?

187
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:43,813
Should we flip a coin to make it more official?

188
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:44,038
Do we have one?

189
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,913
Coins are great.

190
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:46,788
Very cool.

191
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:47,713
Is this coin a euro?

192
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:48,988
Do you pick tails or heads?

193
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:50,063
Let's do it again for a bit.

194
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:50,738
Alright, alright.

195
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,788
Then you flip it.

196
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:52,663
Then you flip it.

197
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:56,913
Okay.

198
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:57,863
Which side do you choose?

199
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,945
If you win, come on.

200
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:00,920
For the serve, which side do you pick?

201
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,670
How am I cheating just by choosing a side?

202
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,470
Choosing a side means picking a side.

203
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,820
The other is choosing the ball.

204
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,745
You picked both the side and the ball.

205
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,095
That means we win on both sides.

206
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:14,220
I don't think any international competition uses this rule.

207
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,770
All four of you, wait a minute.

208
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,320
The four of you winning like this isn't fair.

209
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,470
Give me my money back.

210
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,935
Alright.

211
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,010
Bro will definitely win.

212
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,210
Bro will definitely win.

213
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:24,760
Why?

214
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,460
Why is it a sure win? Is it really guaranteed?

215
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,660
Let's practice first.

216
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,785
Why are you doing that sudden stop?

217
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:35,510
Let's practice a bit first.

218
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:35,910
Okay.

219
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,860
What does this mean?

220
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,910
Just loosen up your ankles a bit.

221
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,245
Hey.

222
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,645
This place is really, really small.

223
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:45,720
Let's move this spot back a bit.

224
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,670
We're too cramped.

225
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,020
This.

226
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:50,945
Right.

227
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:51,520
This is about right.

228
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:51,920
This is about right.

229
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,445
We're not cheating.

230
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,120
This is about right.

231
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,970
This should be fine, let's go with this.

232
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,520
OK.

233
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,330
This.

234
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,490
Got it.

235
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,965
Got it.

236
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:21,140
Bro.

237
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,840
This is too strong.

238
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh.

239
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,845
Come on, bro.

240
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:44,370
You go.

241
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,870
You can't just not serve for 5 seconds.

242
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,920
Who takes 5 seconds to serve?

243
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,970
Even the NBA gives over 20 seconds.

244
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,570
Okay.

245
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,720
You go, it's your turn.
