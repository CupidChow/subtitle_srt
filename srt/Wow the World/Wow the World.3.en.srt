00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Yesterday

2
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Our first gathering at 40 degrees north latitude

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,920
helped our mutual understanding

4
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
grow from barely there to almost perfect

5
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,240
Today, the journey continues

6
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,000
as we move from almost perfect

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,200
to a true test of complete teamwork

8
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,560
Once our teamwork reaches its peak

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,720
we can continue along 40 degrees north latitude

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,120
and keep exploring

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,160
to prepare for the upcoming

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,520
overseas adventure

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,200
The weather is amazing today

14
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,760
Morning

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,480
Are you learning English?

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,280
I've been learning for two years.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Ever since I joined the team,

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,320
every day while I do my makeup,

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,160
I study for over an hour.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,760
Now,

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,440
I still study for over an hour every day in Beijing.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
I think it's really important because

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,200
seriously, you should learn it.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,080
It's very important.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,640
Yes, that's right.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,840
There you go again with the bossy act.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
There you go again with the bossy act.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,200
That "Jinjiang" vibe.

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
All the typical bossy quirks.

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,320
I already told you.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,040
You shouldn't have bought it.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
It can't even make good coffee.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
Didn't I tell you last time to return it?

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,080
Did you listen?

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,920
You bought that thing,

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
it's just a toy.

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,840
It's pointless.

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
I just think it looks nice.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,000
It looks nice.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,160
Why can't I buy it if it looks nice?

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
You wouldn't know how to use it anyway.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,600
Just throw the coffee beans in,

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,920
press the button, and it comes out.

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,360
Drink.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,680
Hand-ground coffee

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,400
On set, he brings really good coffee beans.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,160
He brews them for us.

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
I took a sip.

49
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,040
I said it tastes like

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,960
the 9.9 yuan kind.

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Why do you like this?

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
He has some CEO-like quirks.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,080
I think it's a bit niche.

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,440
I think it's fine.

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Because I also bought a hand grinder myself.

56
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,880
If you like it,

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,240
you should get a C40.

58
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,880
I'll tell you how many clicks to turn it.

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,800
And what grind size to use.

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,600
I don't care.

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
I'll just grind it as fine as possible.

62
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
No, absolutely not.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,880
If you get the chance, I'll brew you a cup.

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,520
Okay.

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,320
I'll bring it next time.

66
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,840
Are we bringing the hand grinder to Italy?

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
No, not to Italy.

68
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I have too much stuff already.

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,520
No, just simplify it a bit.

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,600
It can't be simplified.

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm telling you, this can't be simplified.

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
We're already going to Italy.

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,440
And you still want to bring the hand grinder?

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
Can't we just drink Italian coffee?

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Italian coffee is espresso.

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,200
That's fine too.

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,480
Can't I just add water to it?

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,160
You can make it into an Americano.

79
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,720
Right.

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
He'll want to "kill" me for that.

81
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Brother Lei

82
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,320
Big Brother

83
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,760
In the back

84
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
In the back

85
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,360
Big Brother

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
What are you whispering about me?

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,960
Is there some kind of trap?

88
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,240
No

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
No trap

90
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,480
You need to complete a task

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,440
Because you were the last to arrive, brother

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,440
It wasn't me

93
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,160
Xingxu

94
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,640
No

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,960
No

96
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,080
I just got here

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,400
No

98
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,960
How about this, let's do this

99
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
The last one to arrive gets punished

100
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Okay

101
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,600
The first one to arrive also gets punished

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,040
Why

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Why

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,600
Because you put pressure on others

105
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,880
Uncle Nai

106
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,080
You were the first to arrive today

107
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,240
Impossible

108
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
You were the first

109
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
You were the first

110
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
Xingxu arrived even earlier than me

111
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,440
No.

112
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,080
He was the first.

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
He was also the last.

114
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,760
Why am I in trouble again?

115
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,200
How can you be both early

116
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
and late?

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
What does that have to do with me?

118
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
Didn't we agree on this?

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
What did you agree on?

120
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,839
Take a look.

121
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,680
You missed something, right?

122
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,839
Are you setting me up?

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,000
I knew something was up.

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
Bro, this suggestion was

125
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,760
brought up by He.

126
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,400
Exactly.

127
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,680
There's an undercover.

128
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,840
He said whoever arrives last

129
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,120
has to do the performance.

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
The person on guard duty.

131
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
If Honglei is on guard,

132
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
then he's definitely at captain level.

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
What did you just set up?

134
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,440
Let me see.

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,280
Show me a demonstration first.

136
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,960
After we arrive in Italy,

137
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,200
we'll need someone on guard at the door.

138
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,680
BA.

139
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
Can you speak Chinese?

140
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,400
What does BA mean?

141
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,160
Security guard.

142
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
I really give up.

143
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
From now on, call me BA.

144
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
What name does that spell out in pinyin?

145
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
"Dad."

146
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,440
When everyone comes in,

147
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,200
he has to say,

148
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,120
"Welcome home, esteemed resident."

149
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,000
And do this.

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,480
Then I'll be a YZ.

151
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
What's YZ?

152
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
Resident.

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Is there a broom?

154
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,000
Give me one.

155
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,760
Come on.

156
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,800
Okay, quiet, quiet.

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,080
Fix your clothes.

158
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Coming.

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Here, let me fix my clothes.

160
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,760
Teacher.

161
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,440
Come do makeup.

162
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,200
Blot the oil.

163
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,920
Hurry.

164
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Here, bro, blot some oil.

165
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,600
Sound department.

166
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
Recording.

167
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,320
Sorry.

168
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,600
I just finished fixing my clothes.

169
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,360
Okay, coming.

170
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,200
Quiet on set.

171
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,440
Start.

172
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
You kid...

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
You didn't come home all night.

174
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,720
Where did you go?

175
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,960
What's it to you?

176
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
You kid, you...

177
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,280
You...

178
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,800
Are you trying to...

179
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Are you trying to make your dad die of anger?

180
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,880
You said you

181
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,480
didn't come home all night.

182
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,040
You—

183
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,080
Dad, I don't know either.

184
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
You work as a cleaner at the entrance.

185
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,080
Dad, since you love cleaning so much,

186
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
why don't you work at another community?

187
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
Who is that man?

188
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
You saw that too.

189
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Xingxu should come in now, it's his turn.

190
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,160
Xingxu, hurry up and get on.

191
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
The male lead is on.

192
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,400
Dad.

193
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,280
I want to elope with him.

194
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
Dad.

195
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,440
You want to elope with him?

196
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Then what am I?

197
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,920
If not you, then who?

198
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,560
Who am I?

199
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,760
I was about to ask you the same.

200
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,240
What kind of thrill is this?

201
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,480
Speak properly.

202
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Such a complicated relationship.

203
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
I can tell.

204
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
This team

205
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,000
doesn't have a single normal person.

206
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,720
Yesterday

207
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,520
everyone had a suggestion.

208
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,280
We thought it was great.

209
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
Whoever loses has to be punished.

210
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
Make them stand guard at our door

211
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,600
as a punishment.

212
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,480
Cooking is fine too.

213
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Cooking.

214
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
Or wash everyone's socks.

215
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,200
So from now on, the sock business

216
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,560
will be Uncle Nai's responsibility.

217
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,040
No,

218
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,440
it's not whoever says it washes.

219
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,080
It's whoever loses washes.

220
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you get it?

221
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,240
I want to ask,

222
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
why are you so hung up on

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,160
washing socks?

224
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,080
Then what else can we wash?

225
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
Clothes.

226
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,400
Washing hair is fine too.

227
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,720
I can even brush your teeth for you.

228
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,920
No way.

229
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,080
Why is it socks?

230
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,400
Why do you all hate washing socks so much?

231
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Why do you like washing socks so much?

232
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,560
I don't like washing socks.

233
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,680
Why do you like socks?

234
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,560
It's because I don't like washing socks.

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,920
Why do you like socks?

236
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,520
Right.

237
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Okay, everyone, let's do it this way.

238
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,800
For now, let's stick with washing socks.

239
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,560
I'll start saving up dirty socks from now on.

240
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Yesterday, we thought your suggestion

241
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,600
was really good.

242
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,360
Today,

243
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
the goal is

244
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
to find those three people

245
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,800
to do these three tasks.

246
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,240
The standing member gives a command.

247
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,280
Those who meet the condition switch seats.

248
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
When the timer ends,

249
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
the member without a chair loses.

250
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,560
Got it.

251
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,880
So if I say, "People who think they're good-looking, stand up,"

252
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,240
what if everyone stands up?

253
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,600
If they all stand up, what should I do?

254
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Actually, it's safer not to stand, bro.

255
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
Because you have to grab

256
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,880
the chair of the person who stood up.

257
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,280
Do you understand, bro?

258
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,400
Aren't we in a circle?

259
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,159
For example, if I stand up here,

260
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,520
I can sit in this chair.

261
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
Right.

262
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,120
I can also go over there and chase that one.

263
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,280
Right.

264
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
The girl from the director's team,

265
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
don't just look at someone's good looks

266
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
and think that's it.

267
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,280
They might also be smart.

268
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
Right.

269
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Let's start.

270
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
Three, two, one.

271
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Everyone present,

272
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
who thinks they're good-looking,

273
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,680
stand up.

274
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,840
This works too?

275
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,280
That's so harsh.

276
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
No.

277
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
You guys are so shameless.

278
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,760
No.

279
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
Who's the shameless one?

280
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,040
Bro.

281
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Didn't you call yourself the "King of Looks" yesterday?

282
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,280
I still have some self-awareness.

283
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,520
At certain times.

284
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,160
Certain times.

285
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,880
You have to be a bit humble.

286
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,320
Come on, let's go again.

287
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
Three, two, one, go.

288
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Everyone here over forty, stand up.

289
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
You're not standing for this?

290
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,600
Still not standing?

291
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,920
You're just clinging on, huh?

292
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,400
Over forty.

293
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,080
Over fifty counts as over forty too.

294
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
Do you not know about this?

295
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
You even stood up to rub it in.

296
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,400
Come on, it's your turn, bro.

297
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Anyone taller than 1.7 meters, stand up.

298
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,800
You're grabbing a chair too?

299
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Come on, hurry.

300
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,480
Hurry up.

301
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,440
Anyone who's played a male lead, stand up.

302
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,560
Anyone who's never played a female lead, stand up.

303
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,080
Quick.

304
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,400
Xingxu.

305
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,520
Hurry up.

306
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
Anyone born in the '90s, stand up.

307
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Born in the '90s.

308
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,680
Wait a second.

309
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,120
Why aren't you standing?

310
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,800
Why aren't you standing?

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Yes, hurry up.

312
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,560
Anyone with long hair, stand up.

313
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Come on, last twenty seconds.

314
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,960
Last twenty seconds, hurry!

315
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Anyone wearing shoes, stand up.

316
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Hurry!

317
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Anyone over twenty, stand up.

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,440
Bro, you sit down.

319
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,400
You have to sit.

320
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,040
I can only...

321
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Hurry, ask the question.

322
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
Bro, let's switch.

323
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
Get ready.

324
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,480
Five.

325
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,280
Anyone wearing pants, stand up.

326
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,720
Four.

327
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,440
Three.

328
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,760
Let's switch.

329
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,280
No.

330
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,520
Let's congratulate our first lucky winner.

331
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,920
The sock-washing candidate.

332
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Congratulations.

333
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,640
Continue, let's start the second round.

334
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,160
Come on.

335
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,640
Anyone over thirty, stand up.

336
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,200
Come on, switch, bro.

337
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,320
Keep an eye on him.

338
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,080
Anyone wearing a white short-sleeve shirt, stand up.

339
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Referee

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,320
Why are you playing dirty?

341
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Sorry

342
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,960
What?

343
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
If you're wearing a jacket, stand up

344
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,360
What?

345
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,800
What?

346
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,640
What?

347
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,840
What did you say?

348
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,760
Not paying attention

349
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,840
Who knows what I just said?

350
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,280
It's fine

351
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,600
Okay

352
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,640
Get ready

353
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,120
Get ready

354
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,960
We're way too similar

355
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,480
If you have accessories on your hands, stand up

356
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,480
I don't

357
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,120
Watches count

358
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,720
Come on, hurry up

359
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Accessories on your hands

360
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,600
Accessories on your hands

361
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,200
This is for monitoring body functions

362
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,920
An item

363
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,880
Okay

364
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,800
If you were born before 1990, stand up

365
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,480
Born before 1990 counts

366
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,120
Before 1990

367
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,280
Narrowed down to two people

368
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,320
That's actually the key to winning

369
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,640
Right

370
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,600
Right

371
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
If you're wearing long sleeves, stand up

372
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,400
Long sleeves

373
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,920
How many seconds left?

374
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,600
Seven seconds

375
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,120
Seven seconds

376
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,760
One-hit knockout

377
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,880
If you're wearing socks, stand up

378
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
Got into a fight with socks.

379
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,840
Got into a fight with socks.

380
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,880
Washed everyone's socks.

381
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,440
Whoever loses has to wash.

382
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
Socks.

383
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Socks.

384
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
From now on, your nickname is Socks.

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,760
Li Nai Socks.

386
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,200
From now on, call him Uncle Socks.

387
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Okay.

388
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Uncle Socks.

389
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,600
Finally, someone to keep me company.

390
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,280
Boomerang.

391
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,560
Come on.

392
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,440
Now, about the third lucky person.

393
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,520
We have two ways.

394
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,600
One is to draw lots.

395
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,400
And the other one,

396
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
is for the two who already have jobs

397
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
to pick a colleague.

398
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
Do we even need to choose?

399
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,280
Socks.

400
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,200
Cook.

401
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Captain.

402
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,400
Yes.

403
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Yes.

404
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,360
Why are you called the captain?

405
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,880
It's because

406
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,120
Yes.

407
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,920
So we all end up

408
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,200
defeated by ourselves.

409
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,040
Do you know that?

410
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,840
Three from the Central Academy of Drama.

411
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,760
The three musketeers of the Central Academy of Drama.

412
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,600
Alright.

413
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,560
Nice to meet you.

414
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,320
Okay.

415
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,960
Me too.

416
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
We're colleagues now, in a way.

417
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,080
Of course.

418
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,560
In the next part,

419
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,680
is it possible to change positions?

420
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,240
Yes.

421
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,520
That's what I'm about to talk about.

422
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,840
Today, we

423
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,280
will compete in two teams.

424
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,600
The winning team in each round

425
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,440
will get a chance to swap teammates using the spinning wheel.

426
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,040
Now

427
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
The first chance to change your fate has arrived.

428
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,880
Okay

429
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,080
Each team sends one person.

430
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,720
Rock, paper, scissors.

431
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
The team that wins

432
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,080
can choose

433
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,920
whether to spin the wheel this round.

434
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,800
Let's switch.

435
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
Who will do rock, paper, scissors?

436
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,800
I'll do it.

437
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,640
You do it, bro.

438
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,440
I'll do it.

439
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,160
You do it.

440
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
I've never lost at rock, paper, scissors.

441
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,680
Then it's you.

442
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,240
Who's going?

443
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,480
You go.

444
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,720
Me.

445
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,080
Ready

446
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,680
Rock, paper, scissors!

447
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,120
Paper

448
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,040
Paper

449
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,120
I've never lost at rock, paper, scissors.

450
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,960
Ning

451
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,760
I think we should spin.

452
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,560
We have to spin.

453
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:56,760
Let's spin.

454
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,960
Spin.

455
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,960
We're spinning, right?

456
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes.

457
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,240
Whoever spins can switch over.

458
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,320
It didn't land on you.

459
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,040
Even now, it still didn't land on you.

460
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Alright, Xingxu, switch out.

461
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,280
Do we still need to spin for us?

462
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,760
Spin for us.

463
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,480
Who got switched in?

464
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,840
Which one of you is coming over?

465
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,000
You can't go over.

466
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,720
You can't go over.

467
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,920
You can't go over.

468
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
You come.

469
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,320
I don't think it should be me.

470
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,880
Ning, I think it should be you.

471
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
Why me?

472
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,920
Yeah.

473
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,400
This one.

474
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,720
Congratulations.

475
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
Congratulations.

476
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,600
You finally reunited with your dad.

477
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,640
My daughter is back.

478
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,240
Dad, I joined.

479
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,800
Alright, go ahead.

480
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm back.

481
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,960
I think we don't need to switch anymore.

482
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,680
This group is pretty good.

483
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,040
This is a big group.

484
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,080
My daughter finally came home.

485
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,600
After spending these two days together,

486
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
everyone has gone from barely knowing each other

487
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
to being almost completely familiar.

488
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,160
So next,

489
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,400
we'll officially move into

490
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,760
preparations before going abroad.

491
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,280
Because the place we're going next uses

492
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,760
a different language.

493
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,600
So when communicating with foreigners,

494
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,360
we'll likely

495
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
need to use body language as well.

496
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
We've prepared

497
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,880
five cards showing different levels of expression, from low to high.

498
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
Based on your own understanding,

499
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,120
you'll act out the given scenario

500
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
to the corresponding degree.

501
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,720
For example,

502
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,480
if you burn your tongue drinking mung bean juice,

503
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
the numbers one to five

504
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,640
represent how badly you got burned.

505
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,400
One means the lightest burn,

506
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,120
and five means the most severe.

507
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
Each team sends one person

508
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,520
to watch everyone's performance

509
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,280
and rank them by degree.

510
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
If you guess the order correctly,

511
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,200
your team gets a point.

512
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,960
Okay.

513
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
I believe there are some people here

514
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,960
who didn't understand the rules.

515
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,079
This one definitely didn't get it.

516
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,200
This one only heard half of it.

517
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,040
He only heard half of it.

518
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,800
Bro, I didn't.

519
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,160
I didn't understand.

520
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,599
Can you explain it to me?

521
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,079
What did they mean just now?

522
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
I was thinking about douzhi.

523
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,920
There are cold and hot types.

524
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,560
See?

525
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,320
That was just an example, bro.

526
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,960
Can cold ones burn your mouth, bro?

527
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,840
You'll know once you play a round.

528
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,720
Come on.

529
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,400
But now everyone knows the question.

530
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
So what are we supposed to act out?

531
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,440
The degree of acting.

532
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,160
For example, when the bossy CEO says,

533
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,280
"Do as you please."

534
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
How domineering that line sounds.

535
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,760
If it's one, act with a little bit of dominance.

536
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,520
And so on.

537
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,280
This...

538
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,600
What does this mean?

539
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,080
There's a short skit.

540
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,000
And there's a male lead in it.

541
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,440
He has a really cool look.

542
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,080
People online really like his style.

543
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,720
For example, "Do as you please."

544
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
A few of us will act it out.

545
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,640
Right?

546
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah.

547
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,160
As performers, we should try our best

548
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,120
to help our teammates

549
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,400
guess correctly.

550
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,280
Right.

551
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,760
So our topic is

552
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,960
an insect being sprayed with insecticide.

553
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,160
Acting out the intensity of the insecticide.

554
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
We are the insects.

555
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,160
I'll guess.

556
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,040
I'll guess.

557
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,960
I'll act first.

558
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
We're here to win.

559
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Aren't we?

560
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,240
Of course.

561
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,600
Okay.

562
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,400
Of course we have to win.

563
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,520
Let's go.

564
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,760
Am I playing the insect?

565
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,600
Such a pest.

566
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,000
Yours is good.

567
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,960
Why are you copying my moves?

568
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm not.

569
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
No, this is really abstract.

570
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,040
This is really abstract.

571
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,560
I get it now.

572
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,760
Wenzi inspired me.

573
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,720
Mosquito.

574
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,840
Just gave an example, come on.

575
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,440
What kind of pest is this?

576
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,640
Awesome, bro.

577
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,120
Still fine after three sprays.

578
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,680
Four sprays.

579
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,720
Five sprays.

580
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,000
This is good.

581
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
Too subtle, bro.

582
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
This one's too subtle.

583
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,600
Your level just now was good.

584
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,360
Thank you, Uncle Sock.

585
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,680
It's good.

586
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,520
Uncle Sock.

587
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,240
Not a single character is the same as my name.

588
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,760
Right?

589
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,240
Did Brother Honglei "ga"?

590
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
He "ga"-ed.

591
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,160
He "ga"-ed.

592
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
You're the one who "ga"-ed.

593
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,800
Brother Honglei's performance.

594
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Got it.

595
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Continue.

596
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,720
Come on.

597
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,320
Bossy pest.

598
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,760
Boss bug.

599
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,800
Boss bug.

600
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
Caught my attention.

601
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,880
Okay.

602
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,720
Little pesticide.

603
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,840
Immune bug.

604
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,280
Okay.

605
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,840
I felt it.

606
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,760
Come on.

607
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,520
Let's start now.

608
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,240
Let's go, we're off!

609
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,360
Let's get hyped, friends!

610
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,680
Such a happy bug.

611
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,920
Flea.

612
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
Impressive.

613
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,480
What is this?

614
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,080
This one's okay.

615
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
I've never gotten more than three.

616
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,080
No way.

617
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,560
Gong Jun

618
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,640
This round is very important.

619
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,200
This round

620
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,440
This round is very important.

621
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,680
This is a bit difficult.

622
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,280
Is this difficult?

623
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,320
This isn't difficult.

624
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
Mine is easy to guess.

625
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,480
Right.

626
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,280
You need to look at the bigger picture.

627
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,240
Look at the big picture.

628
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,640
I need to be more precise.

629
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,480
Otherwise,

630
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,680
Come on, little brother.

631
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm coming.

632
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,280
What kind of bug are you?

633
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,560
Cockroach.

634
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,960
I can still survive for a while.

635
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,960
I can still survive for a while.

636
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,800
Aren't you already "done for"?

637
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,840
"Done for."

638
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,760
"Done for."

639
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,360
In my understanding,

640
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,040
Five should definitely be "done for" right away.

641
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,400
That's good.

642
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,760
Adding a lot of drama before being "done for."

643
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,400
This

644
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,880
Yeah.

645
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,560
Yeah.

646
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,760
Wait a moment.

647
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,920
Then,

648
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
Honglei is the second one, right?

649
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,080
Don't compare answers with him.

650
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
Think for yourself.

651
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,640
Come on, let's just do it.

652
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,400
First one.

653
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm three.

654
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,520
You're three? I guessed right.

655
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,720
Wang.

656
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,600
Got one point.

657
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
Honglei.

658
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm five.

659
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,440
I got it right again.

660
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
Right again.

661
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,160
Two points.

662
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,720
Actually, four and five are about the same.

663
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,040
They're all about the same.

664
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,200
They're all about the same, right?

665
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,520
Actually, the level of accuracy here is pretty good.

666
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,560
I've finished talking on this side.

667
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,520
This silly kid.

668
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
It's fine if you figured it out yourself.

669
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,960
But you even shouted it out.

670
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,920
Once, twice, three times, four times, five times.

671
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
"Dead."

672
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,920
And then you wrote four.

673
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
Do you know how to count?

674
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,760
Let's just say whether it's correct or not.

675
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
Who was number one again?

676
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,320
Me.

677
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,360
See?

678
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,640
I got it right again, right again.

679
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
Then you must have gotten them all right.

680
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
So he got them all right.

681
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm number four.

682
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,760
Chen Xingxu is number four.

683
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,400
He Ge is number two, right?

684
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,720
Impressive.

685
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,560
We don't need to switch anymore.

686
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,640
No need to switch.

687
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,800
No need to switch.

688
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,240
Wash socks.

689
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,960
Stand guard.

690
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,600
Wash socks, stand guard.

691
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,320
Did you guys not get a single one right, bro?

692
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,960
Did you not get any right?

693
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,960
Getting them all right or all wrong is the same.

694
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,640
No.

695
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,120
This is a vicious cycle.

696
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,360
Then those two "fools" are here.

697
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,040
Then there's no way to win.

698
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Then you'll just keep losing forever.

699
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,000
Right.

700
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,480
You have to wait for the day a miracle happens.

701
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,160
You've made me laugh out of frustration.

702
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,880
Such a failure.

703
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,640
Bro.

704
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
Our director team came up with some simple games.

705
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
It's not easy to get everything wrong.

706
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,320
That really isn't easy.

707
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,040
Right?

708
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,960
The smart minds have taken the lead again.

709
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,160
Awesome, bro.

710
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,800
Impressive.

711
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,400
What’s special about Tianjin dialect?

712
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,440
Just in these last few rounds,

713
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
they call tangyuan something else.

714
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,600
They call it "baiwan."

715
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,840
Now it's up to you to decide

716
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,320
whether to spin the wheel this round.

717
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,880
Don’t spin.

718
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,440
Don’t spin.

719
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,000
Let me tell you,

720
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,760
here’s the thing.

721
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,160
Our production team

722
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,840
and even the props master

723
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,680
worked really hard

724
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,720
to make this wheel.

725
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Including that figure.

726
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
It’s all very well made.

727
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,200
I bought it and took it home.

728
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,280
Mizone, save me.

729
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,720
Do you want to feel better?

730
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,760
Wait for me.

731
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,640
What do you think of this?

732
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
This Mizone came at just the right time.

733
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,280
So refreshing.

734
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
I feel completely recharged.

735
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,360
Right now, I feel

736
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,520
like I'm invincible.

737
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,120
Who else wants to try?

738
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,000
Mizone.

739
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,120
Mizone is back for the challenge.

740
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,640
Energy dropping.

741
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,720
Thirsty and tired, about to collapse.

742
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,400
Join in and stay energized.

743
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,040
Mizone is back for the challenge.

744
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,760
On the road while traveling,

745
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,720
stay in great shape.

746
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,040
Success.

747
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,080
You can get a Mizone comeback supply pack.

748
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,720
Come on.

749
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,200
Let's do it again.

750
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Then I'll take another sip.

751
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,360
I'm recharged again.

752
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,120
Ready to compete again.

753
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,480
Please have Sun Honglei give Chen He

754
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,040
a Maitong comeback supply pack and Maitong lifesaver.

755
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,800
Let's all be full of energy together

756
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,400
and face more challenges on our journey.

757
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,760
Happy.

758
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,120
How strong is the taste of black coffee?

759
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,640
Why are you singing someone else's show theme song?

760
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
We have our own.

761
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,160
Sorry.

762
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,560
We really need to make one ourselves.

763
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,280
Yeah.

764
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,400
It looks great.

765
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,200
Where we are now

766
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,320
is Bohai Town, Huairou, Beijing,

767
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,240
located at

768
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,560
the foot of the Mutianyu Great Wall.

769
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,760
At the end of 2024,

770
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,000
China launched

771
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,800
a 240-hour visa-free transit policy.

772
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,680
This allows more and more foreign friends

773
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,600
to include this place in their in-depth travel plans.

774
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,880
They say music knows no borders.

775
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
Next,

776
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,920
we invite our foreign friends

777
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
to join us in completing

778
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
a music interaction challenge.

779
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,280
Foreign friends will wear headphones and listen to the melody.

780
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,560
Two teams will compete to answer.

781
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,200
Sing two correct lines of the song's lyrics.

782
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,320
Each correct answer earns one point.

783
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,600
Okay.

784
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,160
You know,

785
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
whenever the three of us get together,

786
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,080
our aura just disappears subconsciously.

787
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,280
Our aura drops to 0.3.

788
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,720
Yeah.

789
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,320
Look over there, it's like 2.8 meters.

790
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,040
Welcome, foreign friends.

791
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,600
Hello.

792
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,680
Thank you.

793
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,400
Hello.

794
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
Play a game.

795
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,440
Can the three of us do this?

796
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
Can you sing?

797
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,080
You really can't sing, can you?

798
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,240
I'll sing.

799
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,960
Then sing one.

800
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,440
Let me hear.

801
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,400
Are you off-key or not?

802
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,520
In the garden late at night,

803
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,280
it's quiet all around.

804
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,040
What does this foot pose mean?

805
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,600
I need to ask.

806
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,480
So quiet.

807
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,560
Don't lower your voice so much.

808
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,280
How nice.

809
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,760
Alright.

810
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,880
You can sing, okay?

811
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,400
Alright.

812
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,480
I'm begging you.

813
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,120
Come on.

814
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,920
Careful, wait a second.

815
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,680
Get ready.

816
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,840
This is real talent.

817
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,680
Rap.

818
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
What's this?

819
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Who could guess this?

820
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,560
I've called him big brother my whole life.

821
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
I got it.

822
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,160
I got it.

823
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,000
There have been too many rights and wrongs in love.

824
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,480
Arriving at a lively occasion.

825
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Okay.

826
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
It has to be you.

827
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,520
It has to be you.

828
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,760
Big brother.

829
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
A lifelong big brother.

830
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,360
A good little brother.

831
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,080
Big brother.

832
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,120
Brother.

833
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,560
It's amazing you could guess that.

834
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,960
That's awesome.

835
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
Impressive.

836
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,880
So skilled.

837
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,240
I got it.

838
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,400
Crossed a few more rivers.

839
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,800
Why are there so many demons and monsters?

840
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,160
That's right, this must be correct.

841
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,680
Wrong, you sang it wrong.

842
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,360
You got the lyrics wrong.

843
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,560
I can sing it.

844
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,920
Just crossed a few mountains.

845
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,160
And crossed a few more rivers.

846
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,280
Why are there so many obstacles and hardships?

847
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,840
Gong Jun.

848
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,000
Bailing Gong Jun.

849
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,120
The lark gets extra points.

850
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,880
Relax.

851
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,200
There's also vocal mimicry.

852
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,240
Betrayed me.

853
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,160
Betrayed my love.

854
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
You've gone against your conscience.

855
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,440
In the end, when I learned the truth, I shed tears.

856
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,080
Next.

857
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,240
It's our turn next.

858
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,240
It's our turn.

859
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,800
You come, I'll let you sing. Come on.

860
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,960
Bro, I'll give you a chance to sing.

861
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,400
Betrayed my love, left me behind.

862
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,720
Don't talk.

863
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,840
Bro, you can sing.

864
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,120
Come on, sing one.

865
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,800
Let you sing one.

866
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,840
You're up next.

867
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,480
It's okay.

868
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
Betrayed my love.

869
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,120
You can do it.

870
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,240
Left me behind.

871
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,000
Alright, I really didn't hear it.

872
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,480
Sing quickly.

873
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Wait a moment.

874
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,320
Figure it out.

875
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,040
Betrayed my love.

876
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,280
You owe a debt to your conscience.

877
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
In the end, when I learned the truth, my tears fell.

878
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,000
Tears fell.

879
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,960
Tears streamed down.

880
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,560
Definitely streamed down.

881
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,120
Right.

882
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,080
I think it's "fell down."

883
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,640
Fell.

884
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,360
"Fell" works.

885
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:42,920
Go ahead.

886
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,880
It's fine, just sing.

887
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,400
Xingxu.

888
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,960
You betrayed my love and owe a debt to your conscience.

889
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,880
In the end, when I learned the truth, my tears fell.

890
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,920
Betrayed my love.

891
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,640
Sing first, then talk.

892
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,680
You were the one who wanted to break up back then.

893
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
If we break up, then so be it.

894
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Now you want to win me back with true love.

895
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,320
Right.

896
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,480
Gong Jun, truly a nightingale.

897
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,080
Nightingale Gong Jun.

898
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,280
Nightingale Gong Jun.

899
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,719
I think we're being a bit immature.

900
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,760
Then let's just be immature.

901
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,560
It's fine.

902
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,560
I think

903
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,239
we can't send people like Yuning and Gong Jun.

904
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,840
They're really accomplished singers.

905
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,520
Are you serious, bro?

906
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,600
Gong Jun is my idol.

907
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,080
Thank you so much.

908
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,760
Xingxu and

909
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,280
He

910
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,920
You two

911
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,679
You two are good.

912
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,040
You two step forward.

913
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
You two are actors.

914
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,000
Just like us.

915
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,960
What do you mean, bro?

916
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,120
Aren't we actors?

917
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,040
You're actors and singers.

918
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,800
You're multi-talented.

919
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
You have dual careers.

920
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
We're all single-career.

921
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,600
Thank you, really.

922
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm impressed, really impressed.

923
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,160
Yuning does all three.

924
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,240
Singer

925
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
Actor, chef

926
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,600
Bro

927
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,240
I accept what you said.

928
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,880
Bro, you're praising me so much.

929
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,640
I'm out.

930
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,440
Bro

931
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,920
Step up for me, bro.

932
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,480
I'll give it a try.

933
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,600
Come on.

934
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,960
"Guardian Angel"

935
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,720
I don't know this one.

936
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,040
How is it?

937
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,080
Good.

938
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,720
Okay.

939
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,960
Do you dare to play another song we're familiar with?

940
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
The next song

941
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,680
Na Wen, you have to guess it.

942
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,720
The pressure's on you, man.

943
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,440
You need to think about it.

944
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,480
Come on, sing.

945
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,080
Go ahead.

946
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,960
Singing made me laugh.

947
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,440
It's a very cheerful song.

948
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,520
What's up with this kid?

949
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,200
That's amazing.

950
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,840
What makes you say

951
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,400
I have to know it?

952
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,760
Nightingale.

953
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,240
Held on for ten minutes and gave up.

954
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,960
Finally let go of the microphone.

955
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Na Wen, I'm here.

956
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,120
Do you think Na Wen has heard this song?

957
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,800
Yu Ning.

958
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,080
Go put on the headphones.

959
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,560
Then sing this song.

960
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,480
You haven't heard of it?

961
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,400
I'll eat this microphone

962
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
if you have.

963
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,040
Has everyone heard it?

964
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,680
Everyone.

965
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,040
It has to be you.

966
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,000
Why?

967
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,120
Because you especially want

968
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,480
our guest to do something

969
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,040
on this show.

970
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,720
Wash socks.

971
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,160
That's right.

972
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,680
A song you've heard

973
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,000
Which lyrics mention socks?

974
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,200
I miss your smile,

975
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,160
miss your coat,

976
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,360
miss your white socks,

977
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,160
and the scent on you.

978
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,320
That's the one.

979
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,760
You got it right.

980
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,760
I thought

981
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,960
the theme song from the play you acted in

982
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,760
had become your personal theme song.

983
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,240
Bro,

984
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,720
can I give it a try?

985
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,280
I just found it strange

986
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,400
how this kid could perform like that.

987
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,880
Bro, don’t speak too soon.

988
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,760
And don’t set any goals yet, bro.

989
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,240
For the remaining questions,

990
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,280
each team will send someone to sing.

991
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,200
Okay.

992
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,440
Thank you.

993
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Good job.

994
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,080
You hum it, bro.

995
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,640
What’s the score now?

996
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,480
What’s the score?

997
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,800
It’s 3 to 2, about to be tied.

998
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,160
Start.

999
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,160
Where’s the mic?

1000
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,440
Where’s the mic?

1001
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,360
Where’s the mic?

1002
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,880
It’s not with us.

1003
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,080
Where’s the mic?

1004
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,880
Where’s the mic?

1005
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,040
Come on, listen to the song first, quick!

1006
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Bro,

1007
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,200
Seriously, you guys...

1008
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,600
Hurry up and sing!

1009
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Na Wen, come a little closer.

1010
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,520
Then you'll hear the sound in the headphones.

1011
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,720
Funny, right?

1012
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,520
I know.

1013
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,640
"Drop Tower"

1014
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,560
Baby, our relationship is like a drop tower.

1015
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,720
It suddenly lifts me up.

1016
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,080
Then drops me down fast.

1017
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,320
Okay.

1018
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,640
Okay.

1019
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,160
Little Sis is our "god" now.

1020
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,240
Come on.

1021
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,440
Feels like I've heard it before.

1022
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,560
Look, his eyes are lighting up.

1023
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,920
What's it called?

1024
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,160
"Legend"

1025
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,760
By Faye Wong.

1026
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,440
That's wrong.

1027
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,320
The songwriter is Li Jian.

1028
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,560
Li Jian from Harbin, like us.

1029
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
We even named the songwriter.

1030
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,480
One point each.

1031
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,720
You...

1032
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,680
You...

1033
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
That's respect for the songwriter.

1034
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
That's right.

1035
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,560
What's the name of the pianist in there, bro?

1036
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,800
There's only one question left.

1037
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,280
Just the last question, let's go.

1038
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,720
What are you doing? The buzzer's already been hit, start!

1039
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay, bro.

1040
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,360
Three.

1041
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Two.

1042
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,360
One.

1043
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
Please, don't cry.

1044
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,600
Our win was a bit...

1045
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,000
I hope the reality show

1046
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,720
doesn't cut a single scene.

1047
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,960
Don't cut anything.

1048
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,560
Okay?

1049
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,840
Alright?

1050
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,760
Bro,

1051
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,000
you've played so many

1052
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,880
amazing roles.

1053
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,960
Everything he just did

1054
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,080
put it all in for me.

1055
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,080
Na Wen, get a little closer.

1056
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,360
You'll hear the sound in the earpiece.

1057
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Is that polite, what you're doing?

1058
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,600
Where's the mic?

1059
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,520
We even mentioned the author.

1060
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,240
You're just starting out in variety shows.

1061
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,920
We're all here on this show

1062
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,800
We juniors should learn from our seniors.

1063
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,120
This kind of spirit

1064
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,320
I think I really need to learn from it.

1065
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,680
You really have a broad perspective.

1066
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,920
I've also learned a lot from my seniors.

1067
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,080
I've truly learned a lot.

1068
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,840
This "meet every challenge head-on" spirit

1069
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,320
First of all,

1070
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,600
we need to use the rules wisely.

1071
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,600
You really have no shame, do you?

1072
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,720
Actually, we just want to spin it once.

1073
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Let's spin it once.

1074
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,800
Just spin it once.

1075
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,680
Get on the wheel.

1076
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,760
I'll support you from behind.

1077
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,200
May the god of variety shows bless us.

1078
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,920
God of variety shows,

1079
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,720
trick us.

1080
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,880
No, bless us.

1081
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,640
Trick us.

1082
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,600
Come on, spin it, bro.

1083
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,800
Come on, Captain, your turn.

1084
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,640
Give it a spin.

1085
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,560
Who's going to spin?

1086
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,440
Just spin it and it's done.

1087
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,480
Good news

1088
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,280
Good news

1089
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,360
Bro, come here first

1090
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,040
But my heart is here

1091
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,840
Enjoy it for a bit, bro

1092
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,600
Take a moment to enjoy it quietly

1093
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
I'm so happy

1094
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,280
No

1095
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,920
They have to switch too

1096
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,520
Right?

1097
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm really happy

1098
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,600
It's an honor to join this group

1099
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm very happy

1100
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,960
See?

1101
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,640
Not necessarily, you might get switched back

1102
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,760
You might still be sent back

1103
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,080
I don't want to go back

1104
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm comfortable here

1105
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,040
Let me do it

1106
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,840
Is that okay, friends?

1107
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,400
You do it

1108
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,920
Come on

1109
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,280
Switch him back again

1110
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,520
That's impossible, what are you thinking?

1111
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,440
Why am I the only one with these two?

1112
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,680
One green, one purple

1113
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,160
We all are

1114
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,280
Bro, put it on

1115
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,400
Put it on, bro

1116
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,480
Come on

1117
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,120
Come

1118
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,320
Come

1119
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,680
One

1120
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:34,960
Two

1121
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,040
Three

1122
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,840
No

1123
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,320
No

1124
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,680
That's really true.

1125
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,160
God of Variety Shows.

1126
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,280
Bro, you have a bit more than me.

1127
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,440
It's leaning towards you, bro.

1128
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,200
I don't.

1129
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,760
You just swore so confidently.

1130
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,400
My heart is with you all.

1131
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,640
Brother.

1132
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,200
I don't want to.

1133
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:33,920
Brother.

1134
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,080
Now, your body too.

1135
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,400
Also has to stand together.

1136
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,600
He's so happy he can't even walk.

1137
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,760
Let's help him back, come on.

1138
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,760
Let's send him off with a song.

1139
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,000
Come back, come back.

1140
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,800
Wandering child far from home.

1141
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,720
I want to spin it one more time.

1142
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I just don't believe it.

1143
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,120
That's fate, Honglei.

1144
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,040
Can we spin it two more times on the plane?

1145
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,520
Bro, if you want to play again,

1146
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,480
let's bet one more time.

1147
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,440
Like carrying luggage or something.

1148
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,360
But this is already decided.

1149
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:01,960
Okay?

1150
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,000
Let's not bet on the luggage.

1151
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
There's too much work.

1152
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,840
You two really make a great couple now.

1153
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
You really suit each other now, seriously.

1154
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,280
Let's decide among the three of us who will wash the socks.

1155
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,120
You'd even fight him over socks.

1156
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,520
Sock Uncle.

1157
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,960
I didn't even argue back.

1158
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,000
I wouldn't dare compete with you.

1159
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,800
I'm going to wear a pair of soccer socks.

1160
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,240
Let me tell you about socks.

1161
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,360
We've definitely got it covered this time.

1162
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,040
Don't worry.

1163
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,960
Today's socks—

1164
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,600
I'll keep wearing them until that day.

1165
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,120
I'll try to make these socks stand up on their own.

1166
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,480
Use them as darts.

1167
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,400
Sure, just throw them and they'll stick to the wall.

1168
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,880
Let me tell you, Chen He.

1169
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,880
Then your socks—

1170
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,640
also need a ticket.

1171
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,400
They definitely need a ticket.

1172
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,640
We have standing tickets.

1173
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,360
There are standing tickets, or you can check them in.

1174
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,240
So next,

1175
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,040
before we go abroad,

1176
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,560
we have just one last thing to do.

1177
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,360
Arrive at the Great Wall and take part together in

1178
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,160
a fresh and unforgettable

1179
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,000
departure ceremony.

1180
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,560
We need to do it when the light is at its best

1181
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,400
and complete

1182
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,960
a group performance of "You and Me" at the Great Wall.

1183
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Why are we doing this at the Great Wall?

1184
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,880
Because Beijing is

1185
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,720
one of the brightest pearls

1186
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,480
on the 40th parallel north.

1187
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,800
And the Great Wall is the most significant historical mark

1188
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,840
on this pearl.

1189
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,880
And in China,

1190
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,520
the geographical stretch of the Great Wall

1191
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,120
basically coincides with the 40th parallel north.

1192
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,840
After China connected to the internet in 1987,

1193
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,960
the first email sent to the world

1194
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,200
contained the message:

1195
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,160
"Across the Great Wall,

1196
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,360
we can reach the world."

1197
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,240
All of us standing on the Great Wall

1198
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,440
singing together

1199
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,080
"You and me, heart to heart,"

1200
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,440
"living together in the global village,"

1201
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,600
these lyrics

1202
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,080
also represent

1203
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,800
that our Earth group will take the Great Wall as our starting point

1204
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,480
to connect with the world

1205
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,040
and set out to explore

1206
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,520
a bigger and fresher world.

1207
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,360
But one of us

1208
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,320
has to leave a bit earlier than the rest.

1209
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,480
So during the final group performance,

1210
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,080
he might not be there.

1211
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,400
Alright then.

1212
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,280
No more words.

1213
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,840
I'll go first.

1214
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,200
Brother He

1215
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,320
Head out first

1216
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,680
Okay, sure

1217
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,160
Come on, fly, bro

1218
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,240
Go ahead, bro

1219
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,320
Go, fly

1220
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,240
Friends

1221
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,560
I'll go ahead then

1222
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,640
Take care

1223
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,680
You go first

1224
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,360
Have a safe journey

1225
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,280
Goodbye, bro

1226
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,160
Safe travels

1227
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,560
Great Wall

1228
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,320
See you next time

1229
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,960
Great Wall

1230
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,560
So majestic, so magnificent.

1231
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,440
This way, please.

1232
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,400
No photos, please.

1233
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,440
Okay.

1234
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,200
The Great Wall.

1235
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,800
It's beautiful.

1236
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,520
So beautiful.

1237
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,400
Have you been to the Great Wall before?

1238
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,680
No, I haven't.

1239
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,520
I've never climbed the Great Wall either.

1240
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,520
This is my first time here.

1241
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,240
I'm really happy.

1242
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,280
It's truly beautiful.

1243
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,240
Have you been to this

1244
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,520
part of the Great Wall before?

1245
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,480
It's my first time.

1246
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,360
Me too.

1247
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,000
Look, there's a sunset today.

1248
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,120
Look over there.

1249
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,800
Bro.

1250
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,800
It's so pretty.

1251
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,560
It'll look even better when the colors change later.

1252
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Every Chinese person has a Great Wall in their heart.

1253
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,080
Everyone's perception is different.

1254
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,160
And so is everyone's understanding.

1255
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,720
That's right.

1256
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,440
It's a great place to start from.

1257
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,400
Proud.

1258
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,560
Meaningful.

1259
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,480
Yes.

1260
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,080
The pride of the Chinese people.

1261
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,040
We're quite lucky.

1262
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,680
Alright, thank you.

1263
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,760
Hello.

1264
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,400
Arrived safely.

1265
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,720
Let's go.

1266
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,800
Hello.

1267
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,400
Thanks for your hard work.

1268
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,760
It wasn't hard.

1269
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,680
Aren't you cold?

1270
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,520
No, I'm not cold.

1271
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,640
Ning, how many meters have we climbed?

1272
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah.

1273
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,720
I'm exhausted.

1274
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,360
So tired.

1275
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,280
We've climbed several kilometers.

1276
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,080
We did it on our own.

1277
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,320
We climbed up to the Great Wall.

1278
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,360
It feels like such an achievement.

1279
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,280
Actually, I'm just a little out of breath.

1280
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,280
Xingxu.

1281
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,440
Can you hold on tighter?

1282
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,280
At your pace,

1283
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,160
if we want to reach the top,

1284
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,160
it'll be dark by then.

1285
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,800
Bro, aren't you tired at all?

1286
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,680
Let me tell you,

1287
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,280
my energy savior

1288
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,360
is Maitong.

1289
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,920
When I'm tired or thirsty,

1290
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,240
I count on it to help me out.

1291
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,680
Instantly recharged with Maitong.

1292
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,240
Look over there.

1293
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,480
The view from the beacon tower is so beautiful.

1294
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,360
What do you think?

1295
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,680
Bro, I'm back in form.

1296
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,120
I'm speeding up, keep up with me.

1297
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,240
Give me back my Pulse drink.

1298
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,400
The clouds look just like in an anime today.

1299
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,560
It's so beautiful.

1300
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,040
It really looks amazing.

1301
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,640
It's really great that we came today.

1302
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,840
The weather is so nice.

1303
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,680
It feels awesome.

1304
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,040
Come on, Honglei, hurry up!

1305
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,280
Along the way,

1306
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,000
This is my first time properly visiting the Great Wall.

1307
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,840
Me too, and so are many others.

1308
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
Everyone, here are the lyrics.

1309
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,240
Okay.

1310
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
Let's go.

1311
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,520
Everyone knows this melody, right, bro?

1312
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,200
You start us off.

1313
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:16,520
Alright.

1314
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,240
You start.

1315
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,800
Start it off.

1316
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,320
You and me

1317
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,880
That's so high, bro.

1318
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,960
Bro.

1319
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,320
It's a bit hard, bro.

1320
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,880
You and me

1321
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,880
Heart to heart

1322
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:35,040
Living together in the global village

1323
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,280
Traveling thousands of miles for our dreams

1324
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:49,680
Meeting in Beijing

1325
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,840
Come on, friends

1326
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:03,000
Reach out your hand

1327
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:10,400
You and me, heart to heart

1328
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,600
Forever one family

1329
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,040
Perfect

1330
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,400
Performing at the Spring Festival Gala

1331
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,400
The vocal parts were divided right away

1332
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,000
We got familiar with it immediately

1333
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,720
Yes

1334
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,800
Very familiar

1335
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,480
Is it because Chen He isn't here

1336
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,760
that we're so in sync

1337
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,120
This segment

1338
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,400
went so smoothly

1339
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,760
It did seem smoother

1340
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,920
So in the future, Chen He is probably busy

1341
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,160
Hey, bro

1342
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,000
He's already here

1343
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,560
Yeah

1344
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,080
Goodbye

1345
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,960
Goodbye, He

1346
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,120
I saw He

1347
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,240
Isn't he waving over there

1348
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,280
Your eyesight is amazing

1349
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,360
To help everyone perform the chorus better

1350
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,440
we've invited

1351
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,400
the Communication University of China Student Choir

1352
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,320
to help you complete this chorus together

1353
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,400
to help you complete this chorus together

1354
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,800
They're coming from the back

1355
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,400
From the back

1356
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
So professional

1357
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,280
Adorable

1358
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,200
Singers

1359
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,720
Can we stand behind them?

1360
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:20,960
Yes

1361
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,040
We might be a bit unnecessary here

1362
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:23,960
Hello

1363
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,040
Thank you for your hard work

1364
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,200
Welcome

1365
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,600
Let's go

1366
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,680
Come here

1367
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,360
I'll stand here

1368
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,840
Let's go to the third row

1369
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,880
Let's stand further back

1370
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,200
Move up one spot

1371
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Come on, friends

1372
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:08,920
You and I, heart to heart

1373
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:16,440
Living together in the global village

1374
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:24,520
Traveling thousands of miles for our dreams

1375
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:32,600
Meeting in Beijing

1376
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Come on, friend

1377
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:47,440
Reach out your hand

1378
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:56,520
You and I, heart to heart

1379
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:05,160
Forever one family

1380
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:17,400
You and I, heart to heart

1381
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,880
Living together in the global village

1382
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:31,320
Traveling thousands of miles for our dreams

1383
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:38,480
Meeting in Beijing

1384
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:45,440
Come on, friend

1385
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,040
Reach out your hand

1386
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:59,840
You and I, heart to heart

1387
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,280
Forever one family

1388
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,040
You and I

1389
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,800
live together in the global village

1390
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,360
forever one family

1391
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,640
for our dreams

1392
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,560
we travel a thousand miles

1393
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:35,520
to meet in Beijing

1394
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:44,120
You and I, heart to heart

1395
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:50,600
live together in the global village

1396
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:57,560
for our dreams, we travel a thousand miles

1397
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:05,920
to meet in Beijing

1398
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:20,960
Come, my friend

1399
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:28,680
reach out your hand

1400
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:36,120
You and I, heart to heart

1401
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:45,280
forever one family

1402
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,200
I am truly moved

1403
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,640
I feel like bursting into tears

1404
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,040
First of all, as a Chinese, I feel very proud

1405
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,840
standing on the Great Wall

1406
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,880
singing the song "You and I"

1407
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,560
I truly feel

1408
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,440
connected to the world

1409
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,880
Starting from China

1410
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,880
showing everyone all kinds of beautiful scenery

1411
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,600
We are going to connect along the 40th parallel north

1412
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,120
Great Wall, here we come

1413
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,240
Let's go

1414
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,240
This is our Great Wall

1415
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,600
Here we are.

1416
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,840
The Great Wall.

1417
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,120
It was left to us by our ancestors.

1418
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,200
It's also one of the prides of the Chinese nation.

1419
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,680
Today,

1420
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,200
starting from the Great Wall,

1421
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,360
I think it's very meaningful.

1422
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,840
Four words:

1423
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,560
Still wanting more.

1424
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,800
In a couple of days, I'll make enough time

1425
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,480
to bring my daughter here.

1426
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,640
We'll stay here for a few days

1427
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,000
and slowly experience it.

1428
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,920
Everyone's perception and understanding

1429
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,680
are different.

1430
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,400
In the heart of every Chinese person,

1431
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,480
there is a Great Wall.

1432
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,000
Alright.

1433
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,360
This is really my first time on a variety show.

1434
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,600
To be honest.

1435
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,880
I came here with my guard up.

1436
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,560
But after arriving here,

1437
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,120
I realized

1438
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,480
being guarded was pointless.

1439
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,040
Yeah.

1440
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,360
I let my guard down right away.

1441
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Yeah, I dropped my guard immediately.

1442
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,680
I also hope

1443
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,320
that in the future,

1444
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,360
in different countries,

1445
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,120
and different cities,

1446
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,120
we can experience more

1447
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,640
fun and joyful things

1448
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,320
and share them with everyone, right?

1449
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,520
This is also my first time at the Great Wall.

1450
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,320
This time, I felt

1451
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,680
such a magnificent sight.

1452
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,680
It was truly breathtaking.

1453
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
This is something we

1454
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,400
spent two thousand years building—the Great Wall.

1455
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,440
It really makes me never want to leave.

1456
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,000
If there's another chance,

1457
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,200
I definitely want to come again.

1458
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,840
I've actually been in Beijing for many years.

1459
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,480
But this is my first time at the Great Wall.

1460
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,280
But the moment the chorus started just now,

1461
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,520
I really couldn't hold back my emotions.

1462
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,840
You and I,

1463
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,080
first of all, everything about today

1464
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,320
was just perfect.

1465
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,280
And also,

1466
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,120
I think the connection between people,

1467
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,320
the energy and emotions,

1468
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,720
really moved me.

1469
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,000
I think we should still love this world,

1470
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,920
and love everyone in it.

1471
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,440
Yes.

1472
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,640
Well said.

1473
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,520
And when we were singing just now,

1474
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,840
I felt a kind of

1475
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,720
pride.

1476
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,760
Especially singing this song on the Great Wall,

1477
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,480
the feeling was especially strong.

1478
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,360
A pride in being Chinese.

1479
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:06,800
That's right.

1480
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,480
I think our energies really match.

1481
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,200
That's why I keep mentioning it.

1482
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,840
Today, even when I messaged the staff,

1483
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,080
I said it was super fun.

1484
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,920
See the world, see other countries,

1485
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,520
and bring everyone a fresh experience.

1486
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,360
It can help everyone relax.

1487
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:17,920
I think

1488
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,240
this is the meaning of making this show.

1489
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,840
Let's go.

1490
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,240
No.

1491
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,600
He didn't understand what I meant.

1492
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,720
You didn't step back.

1493
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,760
You didn't lean back.

1494
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,360
You need to get us in the shot.

1495
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,480
I didn't mean for you to go up.

1496
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,320
Let's go.

1497
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,400
So beautiful.

1498
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,480
This is just like in an oil painting.

1499
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,720
Beautiful.

1500
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,360
Really nice, this is great.

1501
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,280
So beautiful.

1502
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,800
Wen, can you take a picture of me here?

1503
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,200
Sure, this spot is great, it looks really nice.

1504
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,440
Come on.

1505
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,920
Let me adjust the zoom for you.

1506
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,640
Looks good.

1507
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,280
Absolutely stunning.

1508
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,240
Side view.

1509
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,160
Done.

1510
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,040
Let me tell you, this can edit photos with one click.

1511
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,680
I'll pick one for you—this one.

1512
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,360
Okay.

1513
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,240
Then...

1514
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,080
Style.

1515
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,080
This style looks good, right?

1516
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,760
Looks good.

1517
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,440
Alright.

1518
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,200
Let me adjust it.

1519
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,240
Done, finished.

1520
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:25,680
Looks good, right?

1521
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,560
It looks good.

1522
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,320
So pretty.

1523
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,360
So beautiful.

1524
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,080
Welcome, everyone.

1525
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,240
This is my home in Italy.

1526
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,720
Let me show you around.

1527
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,760
Sock washing area.

1528
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,840
You guys are so considerate.

1529
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Let's get to work.

1530
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,600
Smile.

1531
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,000
Wave your hands.

1532
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,560
This water...

1533
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,640
splashed on my face.

1534
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,520
It even got in my mouth.

1535
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,480
Bro, you're out.

1536
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,040
The Colosseum, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

1537
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,600
It's been 1,940 years.

1538
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,200
Nearly thirty generations.

1539
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,520
It's so beautiful.

1540
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,400
You feel like you've gone back thousands of years.

1541
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:08,760
That's right.

1542
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,640
Exactly that feeling.

1543
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,760
This is so much fun.

1544
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,960
This strawberry is delicious.

1545
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,760
It's really tasty.

1546
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,200
Alright, Chen He is full.

1547
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,320
It really wasn't me.

1548
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,080
That move you made...

1549
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,280
What?

1550
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,200
I saw everything.

1551
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,680
Gong Jun.

1552
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,080
Put it down.

1553
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,640
I'm full.

1554
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:29,640
Come on.

1555
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,000
Stop fighting, you two.

1556
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,280
From the Central Academy of Drama.

1557
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,360
"Mutual destruction."

1558
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:37,880
This is

1559
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,120
the most intense one ever.

1560
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,960
The key words for the plot are

1561
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,840
martial arts manual,

1562
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,760
spring, summer, autumn, and winter,

1563
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,720
and a missing lover.

1564
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,640
You're wearing white, right?

1565
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,360
Then I'll wear black.

1566
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:46,960
Get ready.

1567
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,640
I'm calling action.

1568
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,280
Get into character.

1569
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,400
Three, two, one.

1570
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:49,880
Action.

1571
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,240
Class is starting.

1572
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,000
Hello, teacher.

1573
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,680
You're the class monitor, right?

1574
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Class monitor.

1575
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:55,920
Now you're the class monitor.

1576
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,080
This is a student's parent.

1577
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,320
Students who answer correctly will get a reward.

1578
01:02:59,320 --> 01:02:59,920
What reward?

1579
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,120
These three old hands.

1580
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,160
Now the energy is up.

1581
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:05,880
Put on a performance

1582
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,320
with different numbers of Brother Honglei

1583
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,240
the feeling of going on a trip

1584
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,960
This is slander against me

1585
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,720
There isn't even one that's half "dead"

1586
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,600
One Sun Honglei goes

1587
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,560
Two Sun Hongleis go

1588
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,160
Three

1589
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,800
lying down and playing

1590
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,280
I think Yuning's performance was great

1591
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,000
My brother approves of me

1592
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,480
You guys

1593
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,800
explain yourselves properly

1594
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,200
You need to invite foreign friends

1595
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:27,920
to join us

1596
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,400
Hello

1597
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,160
My name is Honglei

1598
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,000
Where are you from?

1599
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,600
Romania

1600
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,360
Romania

1601
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,800
Let's use a performance

1602
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,840
to get them to come, okay?

1603
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,000
Sure, that's fine

1604
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,120
I can leave anything else behind,

1605
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,240
but I must bring this bag.

1606
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:40,280
But I must bring this bag.

1607
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:40,880
If I don't bring it,

1608
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,840
I get really anxious.

1609
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,560
I feel insecure.

1610
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,400
My headphones.

1611
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,240
Because without them,

1612
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,080
I really feel a bit

1613
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,000
off.

1614
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,120
Ready-made seasonings.

1615
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,480
Flavor packets that I'm satisfied with.

1616
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,080
These are the chips I loved as a kid.

1617
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:53,960
I brought a few bags.

1618
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,280
Why bring chips?

1619
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,760
It's because

1620
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,120
I couldn't fill this side.

1621
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,480
So I used chips to fill the space.

1622
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,200
This is Jasmine.

1623
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,280
This is Nezha.

1624
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,280
Humanity

1625
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,720
progress

1626
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,600
is marked by

1627
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,760
learning to use tools.

1628
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,880
Being an older brother

1629
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,840
isn't easy, is it?

1630
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,120
I think this suits Wang Yuwen better.

1631
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,520
And also these two kids, Gong Jun.

1632
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,800
Anyway, I've organized everything for them.

1633
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,760
In my heart,

1634
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:19,840
40 degrees north latitude

1635
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,680
This is a fascinating latitude.

1636
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,480
Around this line of latitude,

1637
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,920
you can find a series of historic cities.

1638
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,320
Why are so many historic cities, both ancient and modern,

1639
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,560
located along the 40th parallel north?

1640
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,920
When you see the Great Wall beneath our feet,

1641
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,160
you can probably understand why.

1642
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,720
For China, the Great Wall

1643
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,640
was the most important boundary for ancient agricultural and nomadic interactions.

1644
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,520
In fact, in other parts of the world,

1645
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,720
the 40th parallel north

1646
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,520
is also a place where various cultures

1647
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,120
interact with each other.

1648
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,360
So, places where different civilizations

1649
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,400
meet and collide with each other

1650
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,920
become engines driving the evolution

1651
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,120
of human history.

1652
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,320
That’s why the area around the 40th parallel north

1653
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,240
has given rise to

1654
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,960
a series of historic and culturally significant cities throughout history.
