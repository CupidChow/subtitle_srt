1
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,080
Olive oil

2
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,600
Why am I the one serving?

3
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,000
Because you're a good guy, bro

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Beautiful inside and out

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Sure

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,920
That actually makes sense

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,760
Beautiful inside and out

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,640
Beautiful inside and out, He Ge

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,280
Come on, say something

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,920
Beautiful inside and out

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,320
He Ge

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,680
Let He Ge, make him stop talking

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Don't let him eat anymore

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm starting to worry about him

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,200
Fry it a bit longer

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,520
Why are you cutting mine?

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,400
Mine's gone

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,840
The goose meat is pretty good

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,640
If I don't eat, I'll get skinny

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
So skinny even wolves would cry, right?

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
Skin and bones, huh?

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,440
Mom would cry, seriously

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,480
Alright, I'll add some more

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,960
Easy

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,640
This is cinnamon

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,720
Here, have a spoonful

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,840
Okay, this is clove, right?

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
Clove is fine

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,440
Chef Liu cooks a bit salty

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
Yeah, it's strong-flavored

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Dear

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,920
That's a lethal dose

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,800
Are we making some kind of magic?

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
It's all burnt

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
It's turned into sesame paste

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
This is the legendary Old Roman Sesame Paste

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,640
Authentic Old Roman Sesame Paste

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,400
It's become porridge

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm totally shocked

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
I get it now

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,040
This is called Espresso

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,480
Let me tell you, actually

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,640
I think it can't taste that bad

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
Try a sip

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Just taste it, it's fine

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Why are you shivering?

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
Why are you shivering?

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,480
Don't let your hand shake

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
I want to drink the soup

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
I don't want to eat the meat

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Excuse me, why are you shivering?

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,360
I'll try it

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
How does it taste?

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,560
It's really good

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
It's actually tasty

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,840
Really?

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Let me try a sip

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,840
Let me try a sip

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Seriously

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,160
It's delicious, bro, don't worry

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
No need to feel pressured

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,960
I want to stir it up

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,480
This cup is a bit chewy

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,560
Don't be afraid

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Sis, it's not as bad as you think

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,360
Do you have to chew it?

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,920
This one

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,360
You don't have to chew

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
But it's a bit chewy

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,280
My tongue is numb

71
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,960
Let me do it then

72
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Yu Ning's got this

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,760
I can tell you've really learned this

74
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm thinking

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920
You cut both sides and toss them out

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
That move shows you've practiced

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,200
Yeah

78
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,040
Almost done, just a bit more

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,840
Yu Ning, you're really handsome

80
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Almost done, just about

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,200
What are you doing?

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,200
You're about to split the table

83
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,840
That axe

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
Use this knife

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
No knife left

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
I didn't buy this

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,280
He's something else

88
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm really impressed

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,480
I'm really impressed

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Come out, hurry

91
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,400
Everyone's gathered here late at night

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,520
It's so spicy

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,240
It's making me tear up

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
So touching

95
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,160
So touching

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
This show we're filming

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Jun Jun's cooking made us cry

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,600
One caramel, one yogurt

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Look, you order

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to eat this too

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,200
Order one more

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,120
This Italian ice cream is amazing

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,080
How much in total? Keep track

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,640
Let's sit and rest a bit

105
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
Thanks, bro

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,080
So tasty

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,640
You sit down

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,360
Sit down

109
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm not tired

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,280
This one's edible

111
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Try a fry

112
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,920
Here

113
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,280
Italian fried dough

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,040
This one's on me

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,800
All expenses are covered by Ning Shao

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Thank you, Ning Shao

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,840
Thank you, Ning Ge

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
Why did you jump up?

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,680
This is it

120
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,880
A reward for eating

121
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
Just spent money

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Then started dancing

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,120
Audience eats first

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,800
Thank you

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,440
Thank you

126
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,560
Thank you

127
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Goodbye

128
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
Hello

129
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
Thank you

130
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,040
Thank you

131
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,760
Thank you

132
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
I just want that lemon ice cream

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's find a lemon ice cream

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
He said that place is the best

135
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
There's an old shop there

136
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,640
So big

137
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,720
Want to eat, Didi?

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,920
I just had one

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,320
Let me do it, you don't have to

140
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,920
It's so big

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Let's take a photo together

142
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,360
Sure

143
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Today's bill is covered by Gong Shaoye

144
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,720
Jun Shao

145
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,960
Smells great

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,520
Smells great

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,120
Really fragrant

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,840
So sour

149
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,320
This one's really sour

150
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,760
Perfect.

151
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
What?

152
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,240
Perfect.

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,200
He said it's sour.

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,880
You said it's perfect.

155
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,520
So which one of you is telling the truth?

156
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,400
Xingxu only ever says that word.

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,680
Okay.

158
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,640
How do you say "sour"?

159
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,600
In Italian.

160
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Let me be the fair judge for you.

161
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
It is sour, but—

162
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,400
So now you're trying to make up for it?

163
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
It's really tasty.

164
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Isn't it really good?

165
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Raise your glass.

166
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I think it's good.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
It's really delicious.

168
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,120
Really tasty.

169
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,560
Delicious.

170
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,080
Especially tasty.

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
This bread.

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Do you want to try one?

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Yes.

174
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,800
This one.

175
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,080
This bread is really—

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,200
This bread is really—

177
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,800
Delicious.

178
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,560
This bread is so good.

179
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,680
Pretty tasty.

180
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I think it's good too.

181
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,000
So delicious.

182
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,400
Super tasty.

183
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,880
There's also fried garlic.

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
That's so professional.

185
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
This is a variety platter.

186
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,000
Variety platter.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Every flavor is different.

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,560
Everyone's different.

189
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,680
I'll have some garlic.

190
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
You guys don't mind, right?

191
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,600
No, I like garlic too.

192
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,360
I mind.

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,720
Doesn't matter if you mind.

194
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
That's not important.

195
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
You're definitely the closest.

196
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
That's how close friends act.

197
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Say whatever, even if it stings.

198
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
That's why you need garlic.

199
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,040
Then I'll have some too.

200
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,320
Go for it.

201
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,680
Real Sicilians have to eat garlic.

202
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
Is this Ouyang Didi's song?

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,640
It's already started.

204
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,200
This red shrimp.

205
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,840
This is sashimi.

206
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Red shrimp is eaten raw.

207
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,280
It's sashimi.

208
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,200
He Ge.

209
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Can you eat this raw?

210
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,360
Lobster can only be eaten raw.

211
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,080
I've never had this before.

212
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
Is this shrimp good?

213
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,720
So fragrant.

214
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
Seriously, I'm telling you—

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,800
Bro, I had one, it's so fragrant.

216
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,080
I tried it, it's delicious.

217
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,560
I just think—

218
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,240
It's so fragrant.

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
Can you eat mussels raw?

220
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,920
No, mussels can't.

221
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll have another.

222
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,120
The rest are all yours.

223
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,480
No.

224
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Let's go to their table.

225
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,320
They probably won't eat much.

226
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,360
They probably won't eat much.

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Go to their table.

228
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,240
Trust me.

229
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,200
How could you say that?

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
This looks tasty.

231
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,960
I don't think so.

232
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,640
Take a sip.

233
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
I'll try one.

234
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,000
I think it should be fine.

235
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,120
This is just—

236
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,040
Some salad dressing mixed in.

237
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,600
You know what I mean?

238
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,360
With water added.

239
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
All mixed together.

240
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,840
That's too much, I'm warning you.

241
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,880
He He.

242
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,960
Way too much.

243
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,680
Can you do it?

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,280
I can do it.

245
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,440
Go for it.

246
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,680
Describe it.

247
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
It's just that salad dressing.

248
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
It got watery in the fridge.

249
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,480
And it smells like the fridge.

250
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,600
It's weird.

251
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,320
Right?

252
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,480
Let me tell you what it tastes like.

253
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
It tastes like the fridge, right?

254
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,120
No.

255
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,960
Have you ever had smashed cucumber at home?

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,160
The kind mixed with garlic.

257
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,720
Yes.

258
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,040
That flavor.

259
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,680
They're here.

260
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
Offer them this to drink.

261
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,400
Hello.

262
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,000
What a coincidence.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,840
Hi, everyone.

264
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,200
Please have some soup.

265
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,960
Please have some soup.

266
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
What is this?

267
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,560
Cold tomato soup.

268
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,920
It's very refreshing.

269
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,720
Perfect for hot weather.

270
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
It's cooling, this one.

271
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,360
Yes, you have to drink big sips.

272
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,840
Big sips.

273
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
Small sips don't get the flavor.

274
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
Is it good?

275
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,200
Isn't it refreshing?

276
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,200
It's a bit sour.

277
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

278
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,120
It's really good.

279
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,120
Let me try a sip.

280
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
You just hold the bowl like that, bro.

281
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,680
Just drink straight from the bowl.

282
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,240
Drink from the bowl.

283
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,760
Take a sip.

284
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Yeah, have a sip.

285
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:02,840
Take a sip.

286
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,480
Did you finish it?

287
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,120
No need to finish.

288
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,840
No need to finish, go ahead.

289
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,080
Tasty.

290
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,080
Do you want to try a sip?

291
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,920
Does that mean it's bad?

292
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,840
Are people's tastes really that different?

293
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Those two aren't picky at all.

294
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,320
Everything they eat is "delicious."

295
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
It's really tasty.

296
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,720
This is way too fishy.

297
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,200
Give it a try.

298
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,840
Lamprey

299
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,840
This one

300
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,240
It's this one

301
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,520
Is it tasty?

302
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,760
It's a bit fishy

303
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Tasty

304
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,320
It's good

305
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,120
It's really not bad

306
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,120
It's okay

307
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,760
It's okay

308
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,680
This one is really good

309
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,560
That's enough

310
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,160
Yeah, it's got that bloody taste

311
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,520
Still that old blood flavor

312
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,120
Like in those pork slaughter dishes

313
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,840
Old blood that's been boiling for ages

314
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,960
This is so delicious

315
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
This is really fragrant

316
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,360
Want to try it?

317
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,760
Seriously, bro

318
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,080
I ate it

319
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,520
What?

320
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,120
Just that lamprey

321
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,360
Lamprey, you gotta eat it

322
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,120
Give it a try

323
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
This is really...

324
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,400
Really tasty

325
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm not joking

326
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,040
It's good

327
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,680
Isn't it tasty?

328
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,360
This is tasty

329
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,840
I give it nine out of ten

330
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Eight

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
Is this good, Yu Ning?

332
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
At most, six

333
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,800
Edible

334
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,080
But no need to eat that kind of stuff

335
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,560
Look

336
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,080
Anything else you want to try?

337
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
Lamb intestines

338
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,280
Wait a second

339
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,000
What is this?

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,760
These lumps inside

341
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,840
It's exactly what you're thinking

342
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,720
I'll have one

343
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,640
Let's share

344
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,320
We ate it

345
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,640
What does it taste like?

346
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,560
The taste really lingers in your mouth

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,360
Can you stop talking?

348
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,720
Look, Yu Ning is already heading over

349
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,280
It's not gamey anymore

350
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,320
That's spot on

351
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,400
What category is this?

352
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,680
I took a bite right out of the lamb's butt

353
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,080
And the lamb kicked me

354
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
But I didn't let go

355
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,800
Zero

356
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,760
Zero

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,640
Zero

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
Zero

359
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,280
This could get eight points

360
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,680
This really deserves eight points

361
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,520
Nine

362
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,040
You

363
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Don't you think it sticks to your mouth?

364
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,080
It doesn't

365
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,120
These two are real weird food brothers

366
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Alright, lamb brain

367
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
Lamb brain should be fine

368
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,320
Have you guys had pig brain?

369
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,480
I've had pig brain

370
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,360
Pretty much the same

371
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,720
I think it's eight

372
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,440
Zero

373
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,320
It's all just starch

374
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,160
No brain in here

375
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,520
There is

376
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,280
There is

377
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,600
Nope

378
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,000
My piece has no brain at all

379
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,720
You're just eating your own kind

380
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,640
That's just...

381
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,360
How is it, Yu Ning?

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
After eating lamb intestines

383
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
I can't taste anything anymore

384
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,760
Maybe four

385
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,360
Feels like you're eating brain

386
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,200
But it actually tastes like tofu

387
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,240
This oyster is delicious

388
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,680
Oysters are still the best

389
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,680
How is this so good?

390
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
This shellfish is so tender and fresh

391
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,400
How many oysters have we eaten?

392
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,920
All of us here

393
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,360
I must've had ten oysters

394
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,920
The staff were all stunned

395
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,480
How do these people eat so many oysters?

396
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,080
We should explain to them

397
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,840
We're a food show all about oysters

398
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,360
Our show's name is

399
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,600
"Super Fresh Oysters"

400
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
"Super Fresh Oysters"

401
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,280
Before making lamb soup, take this

402
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
This meat, just a little

403
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Stir-fry it with this fat

404
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,160
After you render out the lamb fat

405
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
The soup will turn out whiter later

406
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,280
Why does it smell so good?

407
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,560
So handsome.

408
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,680
Here you go again.

409
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,160
Yu Ning

410
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,560
How are you like a "god" sometimes,

411
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
and so down-to-earth at other times?

412
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,400
How can a man be this perfect?

413
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,160
Thank you.

414
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,680
How do you make it smell so good?

415
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,360
Yu Ning, is there anything you can't do?

416
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,240
Tell me.

417
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,520
This is all I know.

418
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,320
How do you look so good even in an apron?

419
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
The stove is so low.

420
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,960
Does your back hurt, bro?

421
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,240
Smells amazing.

422
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Did you start stewing the lamb head?

423
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,360
This lamb soup smells incredible.

424
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Do you hate eggplant?

425
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,080
Peel it.

426
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,080
Okay.

427
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,920
Lamb soup, and the eggplant business.

428
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Lamb soup, and the eggplant business.

429
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,480
Right.

430
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,360
We add eggplant to every dish.

431
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't eat eggplant.

432
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
But you must've tried a bite to know.

433
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,240
You don't eat it, right?

434
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,000
No.

435
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,480
Just born with a dislike.

436
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,000
Just born with it.

437
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
My sister thought I was faking as a kid.

438
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,000
She wanted to see what would happen if I ate eggplant.

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,520
And then?

440
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
She made dumplings with eggplant filling.

441
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
Told me it wasn't.

442
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,760
I tasted it right away.

443
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,600
Didn't taste it.

444
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,360
Because there was meat inside.

445
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,240
She didn't put much in.

446
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,240
But I still ate some.

447
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,600
She wanted to know if I

448
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,840
would react after eating it.

449
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,880
Alright.

450
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
Eggplant really soaks up oil.

451
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,360
What are you doing?

452
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,360
You have to film the mushy part, huh?

453
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,680
Destroy the evidence.

454
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
He Ge, I never knew you were

455
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
so good at cooking.

456
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,800
No.

457
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,040
Turns out you're a homebody.

458
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm the knife guy.

459
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,360
You chopped this?

460
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,520
Da Ning bro

461
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,040
I really don't want to repeat that line.

462
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,320
The man to marry is Liu Yuning.

463
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
This is sliced perfectly, Chef Liu.

464
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,080
Really.

465
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,600
Thanks.

466
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,200
Let me tell you.

467
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
If you keep praising me, I'll cut my hand.

468
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,040
Seriously.

469
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,000
That's just how people are.

470
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,600
The more you praise, the more...

471
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
The knife starts moving faster.

472
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,480
Bro, do you still cook at home now?

473
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,160
No.

474
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,000
Only cook on the show.

475
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,120
Because no one praises me at home.

476
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,320
Old Liu, Old Liu, you're awesome.

477
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,680
Nai Wen, Nai Wen

478
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,360
is a good guy.

479
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,760
Xing Xu, Xing Xu

480
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,200
Stop.

481
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I am.

482
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm interested.

483
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,640
Lin Yi, Lin Yi

484
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,960
Unbelievably handsome.

485
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,240
Alright.

486
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,000
Authentic Dandong Lamb Soup

487
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,360
This looks

488
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,400
This looks beautiful.

489
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,280
Bro, come have a bite.

490
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,680
Come have a bite.

491
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,000
Come on.

492
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Just waiting for you to taste it.

493
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,120
Amazing, Yu Ning.

494
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,080
Really?

495
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,240
It's fantastic.

496
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,840
This is the best I've ever had

497
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,040
lamb soup in my life.

498
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,800
Bro!

499
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,520
Thank you.

500
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,000
Eagerly waiting.

501
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,080
If you think it's bland,

502
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,760
just add some salt.

503
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,920
So good.

504
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,960
Thanks, bro.

505
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,760
It's delicious.

506
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,880
Yu Ning

507
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
It's a total success.

508
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,480
Smells amazing.

509
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,120
Smells amazing.

510
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,920
How is it so fresh?

511
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,360
I really want to soak bread in it.

512
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah.

513
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,200
Missing some carbs.

514
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Light soy for color or

515
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,920
dark soy for color?

516
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,480
Not bad at all.

517
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
That's a great question.

518
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,480
I love questions like this.

519
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
Light soy for color?

520
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,040
Or dark soy for color?

521
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
Honestly, it doesn't matter.

522
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,200
The "duke" says whatever colors it,

523
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,240
just use that.

524
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,840
Okay.

525
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,160
My emotional intelligence is still lacking.

526
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,080
I need to cook this for you, right?

527
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,720
Just cook it through.

528
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,040
Just add salt and MSG.

529
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
When you eat eggplant,

530
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,800
it still looks like this?

531
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,480
Chopped up.

532
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,240
Chopped.

533
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,040
Why not just now

534
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,560
pour it straight in?

535
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,080
What do you think?

536
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,800
Sure.

537
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,320
Is that good?

538
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,920
Beautiful.

539
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Then I'll do it, okay?

540
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,440
Alright.

541
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,080
Go ahead.

542
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,360
Mashed up, right?

543
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,080
Yeah.

544
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
Alright, got it.

545
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,200
You did a great job.

546
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,320
Come on, camera, get this.

547
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,400
No, move aside.

548
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,760
Give it to me.

549
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,920
Last, last two shakes.

550
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,760
Come on, shake it up.

551
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,560
Shake it up, shake me.

552
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,000
Shake it to me.

553
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,920
Alright, it's done.

554
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,280
What's wrong?

555
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,160
Beautiful.

556
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,400
Character

557
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
Good

558
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,320
Amazing

559
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,120
Thanks, bro

560
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,440
Bless me with a bowl of lamb soup

561
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,080
You know what

562
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,000
In this shot of mine

563
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,960
You really look like our cafeteria chef

564
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,680
Auntie's hand shakes

565
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,560
Auntie's hand shakes

566
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,160
Is it enough, kid? Is it enough?

567
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,120
Look, this chef is handsome

568
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,880
I don't think so

569
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Today's table

570
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,440
This meal is all thanks to you

571
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
So sit inside, be good

572
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,600
Okay

573
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,840
Super tasty

574
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,200
How does it taste?

575
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,640
I think it's better

576
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,320
Even tastier than yesterday's

577
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Really good

578
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Overall review

579
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,760
Really good

580
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
Want meat? Scoop it up

581
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,120
Scoop it into your plate

582
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,040
It's all meat inside

583
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,920
Bro, hurry

584
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,560
Eat up, bro

585
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,680
I've already

586
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,800
I'm going for a second bowl

587
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,880
It's really delicious

588
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,480
Really

589
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,440
Unbeatable

590
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,800
Unbeatable

591
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,360
Try the quail eggs I peeled with my mouth

592
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,960
Sucked out

593
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
This braised pork has no water at all

594
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,480
Especially tasty

595
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,480
Tasty

596
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,840
Add some rice and it's unbeatable

597
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,600
Yeah

598
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,240
So fragrant, I'm dizzy

599
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,440
Is the braised pork good?

600
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,480
Yes

601
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,080
It's great

602
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,560
Each of us finishes a bowl of rice

603
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,440
Awesome

604
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,440
Look, there's more

605
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,880
Awesome

606
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,360
Awesome

607
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,400
We all ate so much we're in a food coma

608
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Two chefs

609
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,280
No

610
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,080
Yu Ning and He

611
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
You guys say it

612
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,560
After we finish cooking

613
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,760
We just watch everyone eat

614
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,120
Happy

615
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,800
Eat well, drink well

616
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,560
Welcome, Yu Wen

617
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,280
Sure

618
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,040
Welcome back

619
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,440
Love you all

620
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
Love you all

621
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,920
Eat well, drink well

622
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,160
Chen He

623
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,280
Can't do anything about you

624
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,680
Chen He, Chen He

625
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,440
Can't do anything about you

626
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,440
Betting?

627
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,200
Bet

628
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,960
It's all "e"

629
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,880
Yu Ning, Yu Ning

630
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,440
Can't do without you

631
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,280
"Duke", "Duke", right?

632
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,360
"Duke", "Duke"

633
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,840
You're truly amazing

634
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,720
Now, really

635
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
It's feeling more and more like home

636
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,320
Yeah

637
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
Bro, should I help you cut this?

638
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,040
I'll cut it for you here

639
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,680
I'm worried about you cutting

640
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,520
It's fine, I'm just afraid you'll cut your hand

641
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,040
I won't

642
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Okay, then cut slowly

643
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,520
Cut less like this

644
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,680
Hold your hand like this, see?

645
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,120
Like this

646
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Yeah, lift the top part up

647
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Then press it down

648
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,280
The knife can't go past this lid

649
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,520
If it goes past, you'll cut your hand

650
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:08,960
Okay

651
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,520
So you can go slower like this

652
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,160
Cut slowly like this

653
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,440
Slower

654
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,000
No rush

655
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,240
Like this

656
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,560
Yeah

657
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,680
Like this

658
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,400
A bit slower

659
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,480
One cut at a time is fine

660
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,400
Great

661
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,480
This plate was sliced really well just now

662
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,840
Thanks

663
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,800
It's just

664
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,440
Restaurant level

665
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
Yu Ning is so good at complimenting

666
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,480
I think you'd make a great teacher

667
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Very patient

668
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,480
Yeah

669
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,840
Bro, eel

670
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,840
Whether it works depends on everyone's luck

671
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,040
He Ge, make a Jiuzhuan

672
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,920
Jiuzhuan

673
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,800
Jiuzhuan Dachang—a spiralized pork intestine dish from Shandong cuisine

674
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,360
Jiuzhuan Dachang—a spiralized pork intestine dish from Shandong cuisine

675
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,600
Jiuzhuan Dachang—a spiralized pork intestine dish from Shandong cuisine

676
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
Jiuzhuan eel

677
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,760
Been looking forward to this for a long time

678
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,800
Yeah, it's already stewing

679
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,520
How do you think it compares to Spain's today?

680
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,560
I think it'll be better

681
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
Because we have all the ingredients today

682
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,360
Sure

683
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,560
Smells so good

684
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Jun Jun's knife skills are good

685
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,280
They're good

686
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,960
Slice it thinner, it's tastier

687
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,560
How about I make some homemade potato slices for you?

688
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,040
One for each person

689
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,920
I'll make a pancake

690
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
Feels like honey would make it delicious

691
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,840
These stir-fried potatoes are amazing too

692
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,520
Cooking wine

693
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,800
Not cooking wine, it's Huadiao

694
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,440
Huadiao, okay

695
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,840
Can't use cooking wine

696
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,000
What did I just see?

697
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,400
What are you doing?

698
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
It's a bit excited today

699
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,360
That aroma.

700
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
Should we fry the eggs first?

701
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,760
Yes, fry the eggs.

702
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,960
Missed egg in the batch.

703
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,440
That's an expert move.

704
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
This person really knows food.

705
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,160
Fried egg.

706
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Move aside a bit.

707
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,600
No, it's my first try.

708
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,040
I learned a new trick online.

709
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,680
I've had it, it's super tasty.

710
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,440
The smell is intoxicating.

711
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,000
Looks good.

712
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,920
You look like you're not wearing clothes.

713
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,080
Wearing an apron, cooking steak.

714
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,480
Sleeveless.

715
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,840
You wore sleeveless on purpose today, right?

716
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,960
No.

717
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,480
You knew we'd be cooking steak today.

718
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,480
No.

719
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
Did you do it before coming?

720
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,800
Just to get the blood flowing.

721
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,960
Did you get the blood flowing?

722
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Do you know about that lamb head?

723
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,680
How it was brought over?

724
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,680
It was carried the whole way.

725
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,520
Okay.

726
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,960
Awesome.

727
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,440
Looks good.

728
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,920
Looking forward to it.

729
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Smells amazing.

730
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,520
Hot, blow on it.

731
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,000
Okay.

732
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,160
Beautiful.

733
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,120
Awesome.

734
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm done here.

735
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,360
Just right.

736
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,920
Watch your step.

737
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,320
It's fine.

738
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,520
Such a big pot.

739
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,960
In no time, it's a feast.

740
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,400
That aroma.

741
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
The potatoes are incredible.

742
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,240
So good.

743
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,400
That's an expert move.

744
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,440
Smells amazing.

745
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,480
I want to try, Master Liu.

746
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,000
So delicious.

747
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,440
How is it?

748
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,000
Tastes great.

749
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,600
Reviving.

750
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,800
Master Liu.

751
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,920
Your soup is amazing, really.

752
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,360
Master Liu.

753
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,440
So good, this soup is fantastic.

754
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
The lamb soup is delicious.

755
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
This way of cooking eel—

756
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,080
It's my first time trying it.

757
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,000
It's my first time too.

758
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,080
Maybe it's a Fujian recipe.

759
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,920
This stir-fried pork is tasty.

760
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,760
It goes great with rice.

761
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,640
Perfect with rice.

762
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,200
Delicious.
