1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,000
Bro, are you working on set lately?

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,320
Or are you busy with something else?

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, we're working on the script at the set.

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
Count me in.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,600
Can you take me with you?

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Can you take me with you?

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,120
I don't dare bring you along.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,560
Come on, just take me.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,040
I can help you relax on set.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,400
I can sing for you.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,840
I can even give you a massage.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,280
I can be there—

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
I can join your crew and help you unwind.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,480
No need.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,880
No, absolutely not.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,760
I can give you a massage.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
I'm a professional ear cleaner.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,320
I can do it for you—

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
I'll go give Brother Honglei a leg massage now.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,960
Massage his legs.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,720
Wait a second.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,200
For you.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,120
What are you doing?

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,440
Thanks for your hard work.

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:08,920
What are you up to?

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,720
I'll massage your legs.

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,280
Because—

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,920
No need.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,160
Try out this job, see how it feels.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,760
No need.

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,400
Check out this technique.

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Don't bother.

33
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Give me a moment.

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,440
Okay, sure, bro.

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,840
He's my Shidi.

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Hello.

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello, uncle.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,680
Hello, uncle.

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,080
He's my Shidi.

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,600
Hello, uncle.

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,040
Greet first.

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,520
Then say "Hello, uncle."

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,600
Are you asking me to say it,

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,920
or are you saying it?

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,200
Brother Naiwen

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,640
You're the most

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,720
adorable person I've met.

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,600
Hold it in.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,480
Gloves.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,680
These gloves should be mine.

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
They're for washing vegetables.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,080
Do you think it's right to wash socks with these?

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,720
Socks.

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Can you be a bit sincere?

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,800
I'll keep arguing about today's socks until that day.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,480
I'll try to make these socks stand up on their own.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
These socks are all black now.

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Darn it, I'll go find my socks.

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
I quit.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
I quit.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
Still acting like this?

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Is that really necessary?

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,000
My feet smell great!

64
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Your socks are all black.

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,320
The soles are turning black.

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
That's disgusting.

67
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,480
Whose is this?

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,920
Mine.

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,440
Captain.

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,000
Captain.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Aren't you all from the same company?

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Bring yours out.

73
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,760
I will, in a bit.

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,480
Okay, put them all here.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,400
They're put away.

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,520
Whose socks are these?

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Mine.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Don't mix them up.

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,440
Yeah, don't mix them up.

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,360
Remember.

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
You have to check.

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
After washing, return them to the room.

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,840
I'll sort them by smell.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
And match them to your scent.

85
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,160
Smile.

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,920
One, two, three, go.

87
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,960
Double row of teeth.

88
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Wave your hands like flowers.

89
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
The water from these socks

90
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,560
splashed onto my face.

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,600
That's a point deduction.

92
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,840
You splashed water on our faces.

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Deduct points.

94
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
It even got in my mouth.

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Seriously.

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't dislike your own socks.

97
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,160
Ours aren't here.

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,160
I think this part

99
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,640
Little Wang and our Sun Bao(an)

100
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
did really well.

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,000
Come on, Shidi.

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,440
You dance.

103
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,040
It's fine, Shidi, go ahead.

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
I get you, Shidi.

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,920
Go for it.

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,640
Okay.

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,080
Come on.

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,200
I guessed this one.

109
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,880
It's four characters—

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,200
Shouting at Chen He.

111
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I can only call you Shidi.

112
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,120
Shidi.

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,040
Quit marriage... marriage.

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,840
Get married.

115
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Cowherd and Weaver Girl.

116
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,320
I don't care anymore.

117
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
None of them are right.

118
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,200
Is this even related to the question, bro?

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Bro.

120
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,040
What?

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,200
He's gone crazy.

122
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
Don't listen.

123
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,760
Here's your final hint.

124
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
Eager to return home.

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
You're close, take a guess.

126
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Very close.

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Not close.

128
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
He's messing with you.

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,400
Stop guessing.

130
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
He's just fooling around.

131
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,160
Don't look at his.

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,200
Like this.

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,880
Friends,

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,040
Let me just say one thing.

135
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,560
If Brother Naiwen isn't the one,

136
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
I'll eat this TV.

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
If I'm not the one,

138
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,920
can you just go to Room 6?

139
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
Okay, sure.

140
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
Sure, bro.

141
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Let's play.

142
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,480
Play.

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,480
That's awesome.

144
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,400
If you are,

145
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
then go to Room 6.

146
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
If I'm the one, I'll go to Room 6.

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,640
If I'm not,

148
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,600
Yuning goes to Room 6.

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Six.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,640
Are we playing or not?

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,280
Are we playing or not?

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,640
Play.

153
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,240
Then play with him, bro.

154
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,480
Wait a second.

155
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's keep it undecided for now.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Undecided.

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
I'll stay undecided.

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
Why?

159
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
You don't have a story.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
I don't have a story.

161
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,680
No advantage in our show.

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,240
Is this a storytelling club?

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
Questioning the mentor.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
You called me out openly.

165
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,640
Who called you out?

166
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Getting mad at the mentor.

167
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Exactly.

168
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,520
Getting mad at the mentor.

169
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
You two are so fake.

170
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Let me tell you,

171
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,240
You two have been wearing sunglasses since the start.

172
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,360
What are you doing?

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I really like your personality.

174
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Really?

175
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
I want it.

176
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,760
Join my team.

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
I have eighty-eight concerts this year.

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,120
Wait a moment.

179
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
I just like people with your personality.

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,600
Teacher Gong, I'm your fan.

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,560
Just teasing you.

182
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,960
If it's not sad enough,

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,160
If it's not sad enough,

184
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,720
then you can't fly.

185
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Breathe.

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
But without dreams,

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Breathe.

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,240
Why bother with faraway places?

189
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,160
I've always been wandering, but I

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,640
have never seen the ocean.

191
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,600
I thought I could forget.

192
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
Very good.

193
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,360
Thank you.

194
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
You're my "god."

195
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,000
You're my "god."

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Please stand. Okay.

197
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,600
Please stand, teacher.

198
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Am I qualified to join your team?

199
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
Yes.

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
Be my mentor.

201
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Friends walk together for life.

202
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
Friends walk together for life.

203
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,320
Those days.

204
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
And there's a tenor.

205
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm a baritone, can't do it.

206
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
No more.

207
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,160
Friends are never lonely.

208
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,480
One word, "friend," and you'll understand.

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,240
There are still wounds, still pain.

210
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,520
Still moving on, and I'm here.

211
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
Like this.

212
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,360
Make it sexier. What are you doing?

213
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Then like this.

214
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,680
Just a bit like this, then I'll go lower.

215
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Like this.

216
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Right.

217
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,160
Come on.

218
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,400
You go first, then me.

219
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
You go first, then me.

220
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
You go first, then me.

221
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,560
What word is this?

222
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
Come on, again.

223
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,320
Come on.

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,480
You two, switch hands.

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
No problem.

226
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,880
Come here.

227
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,200
This side, over here.

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
On my left.

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,960
Block it.

230
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,920
Grab this.

231
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
Block it.

232
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,360
I'll grab you.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,760
Wait a second.

234
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
Grab it yourself.

235
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,960
Wait a second.

236
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,400
Let me try.

237
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,120
Let me try, bro.

238
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,560
No.

239
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
Because I just got used to his style.

240
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
When your style comes in, I just...

241
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Let me try.

242
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,880
Too complicated.

243
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Let me try.

244
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,800
Here we go again.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,040
Don't do it like this.

246
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,160
Stand properly.

247
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
You make me uncomfortable like this.

248
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,800
Look.

249
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,720
You make me uncomfortable like this.

250
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,600
Look.

251
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,560
Where should I look?

252
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,080
I know.

253
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
I can't see.

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,640
Can't see.

255
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,760
People: up, down, left, right.

256
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,400
Me.

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:05,520
I've seen rain pour in the desert.

258
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
My praise for you was wasted.

259
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,160
I've seen rain pour down in the desert

260
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
I've seen the ocean

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,080
Wait a second

262
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Put it back on

263
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,120
Put it back on

264
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
This is really a bit tough

265
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,600
Come on

266
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,040
Okay

267
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,040
Okay

268
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,360
Come on

269
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,080
Come, hurry up

270
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,040
I've seen rain pour down in the desert

271
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,440
I've seen the ocean

272
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,000
No

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,040
Put it back on

274
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't do it

275
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,800
Put it back on

276
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,640
How many people just went by?

277
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,480
If you're wrong

278
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,720
You all have to take a punishment

279
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,720
Okay

280
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Speak in Jiazi voice (high-pitched voice)

281
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
Keep it up for three minutes

282
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Alright, that's fine

283
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,960
That's fine

284
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,240
Worst case, we'll just keep doing it

285
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,040
One person

286
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,600
One person

287
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,720
Okay

288
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Let's start now

290
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,080
It's starting

291
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,320
Time to witness a miracle

292
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,080
The moment to witness a miracle is here

293
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,560
What happened?

294
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,800
It seemed like three people just went by

295
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
No idea

296
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Don't feel embarrassed

297
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,800
If it doesn't work, stretch your philtrum

298
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
Pretend to be Brother Naiwen

299
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,160
Pretend to be Brother Naiwen

300
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm Brother Naiwen

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm Brother Naiwen

302
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm Brother Naiwen

303
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
A real man needs dignity

304
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm Brother He

305
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,800
You're Chen He

306
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,040
Brilliant

307
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
You're even more brilliant than "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"

308
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
One, two, three, sing

309
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,800
Sorry

310
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,520
This girl, I really can't handle her

311
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,160
Listen to me carefully

312
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,400
You're a girl now

313
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
I kissed you downstairs

314
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,400
But that's a compliment for you

315
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,240
For that slap you just gave me

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,840
I'll make you pay for it

317
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,400
I want to finish my compliment to you

318
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,280
Anything else?

319
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,200
I've already finished complimenting you

320
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
Let me politely say

321
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,080
Good night

322
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
You kissed me downstairs just now

323
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,760
But that's my compliment to you

324
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,200
You have to pay for slapping me just now

325
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
Pay the price

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,080
This is your price

327
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,680
This is my last compliment to you

328
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,600
One last thing: good night

329
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,240
Rock, paper, scissors

330
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
Paper, scissors

331
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,560
Paper, scissors

332
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,200
Lin Yi, it's all your own fault

333
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,840
You know?

334
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
It's all your fault

335
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,240
Quick, come here

336
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,280
Rock, paper, scissors

337
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,600
Squat down

338
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,160
Squat down

339
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,520
Right

340
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Walk

341
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,440
Walk

342
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,880
Right

343
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,040
Guess, three words

344
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,920
Three words

345
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,600
Try again

346
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Which three words are these?

347
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,520
Three words

348
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,320
Three words

349
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,680
Right

350
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,040
Three

351
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Squat and walk

352
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,400
Right, what is it?

353
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,440
Dog

354
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,120
Tall

355
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,080
Really tall

356
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,160
Back of the hand

357
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,000
Palm

358
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,080
Turn it over

359
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Back of the hand

360
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,040
Cover it

361
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,040
Cover

362
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,480
Cover who?

363
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,520
Cover who?

364
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,160
Lin Yi

365
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,080
When it's your turn, it's all "killer" moves

366
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,680
Right

367
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,400
Leg

368
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,160
Right leg

369
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,600
Right

370
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,280
Straight

371
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,200
Stand straight

372
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,560
No, that's not right

373
00:16:59,560 --> 00:16:59,800
Stand

374
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,240
Stop

375
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,359
Hand

376
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,440
Hand back

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,480
Hand back

378
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
Hand in

379
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Pull it toward your body

380
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,440
Toward

381
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
Stand straight

382
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,480
Stand straight

383
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,200
Stand straight

384
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,640
Louder

385
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,160
Make your mouth shape bigger

386
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,079
Hand

387
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,599
Hand

388
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
Inward

389
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,079
Hand inward

390
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,880
Even more inward

391
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,400
Inward

392
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,600
Stop.

393
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Stop.

394
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,280
Okay.

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,520
Stop.

396
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,000
That's it.

397
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,760
That's it.

398
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,960
Stick out.

399
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,000
Leg.

400
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,720
Butt.

401
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,240
Butt.

402
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,560
Butt.

403
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,280
Fasting.

404
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,000
Butt.

405
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,480
Stick out.

406
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,080
Butt.

407
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,520
Stick out.

408
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,680
Right.

409
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,240
Stick out.

410
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,800
Right.

411
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,360
Don't move.

412
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,600
Stick out. Hold it.

413
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
Are you messing with me?

414
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,840
You're messing with me.

415
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,240
Go, Shidi.

416
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,720
Shidi.

417
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,040
Go.

418
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,600
Shidi, go.

419
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Be careful in the back, I'm telling you.

420
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,240
That...

421
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,880
Wait a second.

422
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,280
My chest.

423
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,840
My chest.

424
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,000
What's wrong with your chest?

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Someone needs to cover my chest.

426
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Right. Okay, go.

427
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,560
Look at Lin Yi.

428
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
Poor Brother Yi.

429
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,040
Put your hands together, shake your head.

430
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,520
Clap and shake your head.

431
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
From top to bottom.

432
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,920
Alright.

433
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,960
Okay.

434
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,960
That was close.

435
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
That's enough.

436
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,880
Almost slapped me hard.

437
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Alright.

438
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,640
Lin Yi's chest is so bouncy.

439
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,120
You're not covering me anymore.

440
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,720
What is he doing?

441
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,200
He went to chat.

442
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay.

443
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,400
No need to cover the chest now.

444
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,240
Ruled out.

445
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,120
You covered the wrong spot.

446
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,040
You got left and right wrong.

447
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,080
It's fine.

448
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
No chest covering, we're freer.

449
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,400
This hand is dismissed.

450
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,880
Definitely on the face.

451
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,400
Right.

452
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,120
The second move is this.

453
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay, just like that. Go.

454
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,840
Okay.

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Brother Naiwen.

456
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
His left cheek was never covered.

457
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Why are you covering him?

458
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,320
No.

459
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,240
Confuse.

460
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Confuse everyone.

461
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,480
Who can you even confuse?

462
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,280
This sense of participation.

463
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,600
Participate.

464
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,800
Exposed.

465
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,960
Exposed.

466
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,320
Lin Yi, your face.

467
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,080
Your face.

468
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Your own face.

469
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,160
The whole part collapsed.

470
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,880
Now there are only two options.

471
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,680
It's obvious.

472
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,920
Us.

473
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,160
Our group is so "dumb."

474
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
I give up.

475
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Two "idiots."

476
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
I will defeat the Magic Fairy Queen.

477
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,440
Become the strongest magic fairy.

478
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Dark Magic Fairy.

479
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,920
I am the Magic Fairy Castle.

480
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
The Dark God's world now.

481
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
The whole world is mine too.

482
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,400
The Dark God's world now.

483
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,120
I am the goddess of the Dark Magic Fairy Castle.

484
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,120
I will defeat...

485
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,040
Is this Balala Little Magic Fairy (Chinese children's fantasy series, 2008)?

486
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,240
I will defeat all the dark magic in the world.

487
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,200
And then become dark...

488
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,440
How did this turn into rap?

489
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
This really sounds like "Kylin."

490
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,200
I want to stand on my...

491
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,680
Strike a pose.

492
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,880
I will defeat all the dark magic in the world.

493
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,080
And then become dark...

494
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,400
I will defeat all the dark magic in the world.

495
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,360
Become the god of the Magic Fairy Castle.

496
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,160
Four "ha ha"s.

497
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,200
Can you speak slower?

498
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
It's just that fast.

499
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Aren't you best at...

500
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,440
...anime stuff?

501
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,920
Right?

502
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
You've definitely seen this.

503
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,520
Brother He is good, he gets it.

504
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
I want to overlook this place.

505
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,560
This...

506
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
I want to overlook the little magic fairies below.

507
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,400
It's a god's-eye view now.

508
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,320
I want to be the Magic Fairy Castle's most...

509
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,000
Awesome little woman.

510
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,760
It has to be you, Brother Liu.

511
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,480
Balala Little Magic Fairy, transform! (Chinese children's fantasy series, 2008)

512
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,880
Balala Little Magic Fairy, transform! (Chinese children's fantasy series, 2008)

513
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,600
Together.

514
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,440
You trade your true heart for this life.

515
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Sit down.

516
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
Why not live freely for once?

517
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
Okay.

518
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,040
Why not live freely for once?

519
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,560
Alright, I know who it is.

520
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,640
I know who it is. Okay.

521
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,600
I know who it is. Okay.

522
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,000
We won, bro.

523
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Who tortures the judges like this?

524
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
The attack method is...

525
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,320
Cover their mouth and say "bye-bye."

526
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,400
Bye-bye.

527
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,080
What?

528
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,680
It's done.

529
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm an "old killer."

530
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
Bye-bye.

531
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,800
I'm out.

532
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,000
So fast.

533
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,760
Hide.

534
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,080
What's there to hide?

535
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,120
Where to hide?

536
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,600
Hide here.

537
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,120
I "died" as soon as I arrived.

538
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,000
Good night.

539
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,440
Bye-bye.

540
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,720
Come here, hurry up.

541
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,160
Go in.

542
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,160
Go in.

543
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
Get in there, now.

544
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,560
Squat down properly.

545
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,720
Get in there, now.

546
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,400
Bye-bye.

547
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,520
Bye-bye.

548
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,720
Come here.

549
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,400
I actually saw it myself.

550
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,000
Mission accomplished.

551
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,760
No.

552
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

553
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Gong Jun took care of that...

554
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,760
Gong Jun took out Yu Ning.

555
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,800
But he didn't see me.

556
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,680
So it's almost time to hit the gong.

557
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,680
Pretend you don't know.

558
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Act like you don't know.

559
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,720
I saw it myself.

560
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
Gong Jun took out Yu Ning, from far away.

561
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,400
After taking him out, he did this.

562
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,480
Then Gong Jun did this.

563
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,240
Grabbed and ran off quickly.

564
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,080
Pretend you don't know.

565
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,000
Let's just pretend we don't know.

566
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,760
Don't know.

567
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,800
Come on, let's split up.

568
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Split up.

569
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
So everyone knows now.

570
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,040
It's been figured out.

571
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Figured it out right away.

572
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,560
Yu Ning was the bait and has already been sacrificed.

573
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,760
That move was brilliant.

574
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,280
So clever.

575
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,800
Saw the bait and took it.

576
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,960
Got hooked instantly.

577
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,480
Should be in that direction.

578
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,040
Come over and see.

579
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,720
I'll just pretend to go around.

580
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Are you a good guy?

581
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,480
I'm one hundred percent a good guy.

582
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,440
Three, two, one.

583
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,480
Not only lost,

584
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,200
Lost with no dignity.

585
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,160
Got spotted.

586
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,280
I'm here, and they're all acting with me.
