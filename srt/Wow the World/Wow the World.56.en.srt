1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,550
He's really tall, bro.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,075
It could be two people.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,025
Or maybe five people.

4
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:09,950
I have no idea.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,850
Alright.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,850
Countdown starts now.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,100
Why are you staring at me?

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,110
What was that word again?

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,810
Don't think you suddenly went from a pheasant to a phoenix.

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,885
Why are you looking at me?

11
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:36,035
Out of four, there are two.

12
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,060
I don't even know what those four words mean.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,410
I forgot the line.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,490
You forgot? Then you're just winging it.

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,073
Or maybe that's not what it means.

16
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:43,615
That's what it means.

17
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:45,265
Anyway, both roles are you.

18
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,265
Why are you looking at me?

19
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:47,940
Why are you staring at me like that?

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,990
And then this, uh...

21
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,290
And here, don't think you've become a phoenix from a pheasant.

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,390
That you can just do whatever.

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,965
And over here, it's still, uh...

24
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,240
What comes next again?

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,180
And then after that...

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,255
Anyway, I can, it's just a scene.

27
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:16,980
And then, saying something, I totally forgot.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,180
The one staring must be a girl.

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,880
Because later it says...

30
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,880
It says later that this is a guy.

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,705
Like, "I like you," and "Why are you staring at me?"

32
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:30,180
Why are you staring at me?

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,180
And then this guy...

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,880
Uh, me...

35
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,270
Then the girl says...

36
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,870
Don't think you've turned from a pheasant into a phoenix.

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,070
You're just a waiter.

38
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,870
How did you become a waiter again?

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,220
Don't think you've become a phoenix from a pheasant.

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,220
You're just a waiter.

41
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,270
What are you trying to do?

42
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,620
Why is there Cantonese again?

43
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,895
How would I know there's a foreign language too?

44
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,470
Not handsome.

45
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,920
And my name too.

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,870
Lei hou a. (Cantonese for "hello")

47
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,060
Me.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:08,060
Baobao.

49
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,480
Let me tell you.

50
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm a hamburger.

51
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,980
Let me tell you.

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,480
Defeat every hamburger in the world.

53
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,470
Seven words, seven words, 123123.

54
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,770
Right.

55
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,370
What are the first three words?

56
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,870
One, two, three, three words.

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,370
The first three words.

58
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:52,220
Squat, squat, right, walk, walk, right, those three.

59
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,280
Three words.

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,230
One more time.

61
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,030
Which three words are these?

62
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,230
Three words.

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,155
Three words.

64
00:02:59,155 --> 00:02:59,530
Right.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
Three: squat, walk.

66
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,330
Right.

67
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,380
What kind of dog is it?

68
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,730
What dog?

69
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,830
Yes.

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,693
Person.

71
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,243
It's you.

72
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:12,980
Me.

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,480
Right.

74
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,590
Squat.

75
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,490
I squat and walk.

76
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:15,840
Right.

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,590
What is it?

78
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,040
What does "I squat and walk" mean?

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,440
Right.

80
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,490
I squat and walk.

81
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,415
It's me.

82
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:23,978
Me.

83
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:25,090
I squat.

84
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,565
What does "I squat and walk" mean?

85
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:26,815
OK.

86
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:27,090
OK.

87
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,940
Stand up.

88
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,040
Stand up.

89
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,915
Stand up.

90
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:31,690
Stand up.

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,940
Tall.

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,620
Big, big, big—yeah, dwarf, big

106
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,795
The fifth character

107
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,620
The fifth character is "fly"

108
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,545

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,395
What style?

117
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:53,945
This is yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

118
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:54,445
Seven characters

119
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah

120
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,920
Big bird

121
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,950
This isn't seven characters either

122
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,500
Seven characters

123
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,450
This, this, me, me, big bird

124
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,175

Yeah, yeah, yeah

129
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,500
There's one more character

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,675
I think that's enough

131
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:16,275
I think that's enough

132
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,150
We can definitely score points

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,480
Li Naiwen

134
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,805
That's fine

136
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:20,305
Li Naiwen

137
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:20,655
What's wrong?

138
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:20,980
It's fine

139
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,305
It's fine

140
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:21,680
Right?

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,155
Okay

142
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:22,755
I think it's okay

143
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,305
We're good

144
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:23,930
That's enough

145
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,080
Dwarf

146
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,605
Big bird

147
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:26,130
It's OK

148
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,530
How many pounds do you gain before it's noticeable?

149
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,075
Me? Next round

150
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:39,525
I'm fat

151
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,300
I gain weight just by drinking water

152
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm not lying to you at all

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,950
Is it because you work out?

154
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,275
I retain water a lot

155
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,375
Yeah, as long as I work out my upper body

156
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,100
Just regular exercise

157
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Once I start training, it's really easy

158
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,850
Me too, it's all about boiling water

159
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,300
My whole body is full of water

160
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,750
The Manchu-Han Imperial Feast has steamed, steamed, steamed bear paw

161
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,100
Steamed bear paw

162
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,780
Steamed deer eyes

163
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,430
Roast duck

164
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,355
Roast chicken

165
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:02,780
Roast pine flower

166
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,805
Braised pork belly

167
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:04,230
Cured meat

168
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,680
Sausage

169
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,830
I forgot the rest—yeah, braised duck in marinade

170
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,930
I've even memorized The Hundred Family Surnames

171
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,030
Yang, Shen, Han, Yang—lines I've memorized

172
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,830
Lü, Zhang—I can't remember anymore

173
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,310
Start with the first character, end with the last

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,460
Master the tones and rhymes

175
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,635
Yeah

176
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,960
Mastering tones and rhymes, that's what it was about

177
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
Distinguish the four tones, yin and yang, make it clear

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,610
You need to find the right method

179
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,560
Open it up

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,310
He won't stop until he finishes reciting

181
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,760
There's mustard in here

182
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,820
Is it honey mustard?

183
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,120
Probably yellow mustard

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
Is there any meat in it?

185
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,370
No

186
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,270
This one's pretty tasty

187
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,820
There's some chicken

188
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,820
Ge Qing needs to eat soup dumplings

189
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,670
When did we mention soup dumplings?

190
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,700
Take a look.

191
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,400
Green pepper, scallion, scallion.

192
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,250
Scallion.

193
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,400
That scallion.

194
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,700
This one.

195
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,050
This is red pepper.

196
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,640
It doesn't have the green kind.

197
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,790
This is

198
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,740
sweet.

199
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,640
You can eat it

200
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,790
just like this.

201
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,440
Okay.

202
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,315
Okay.

203
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:39,690
Got it from northern China.

204
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:50,590
We're back.

205
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Thanks for your hard work.

206
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,115
Let me close the door.

207
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:58,040
Close the door.

208
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,740
I'll do it.

209
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,600
From this side.

210
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,550
We're going home.

211
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,775
Because I've finished my task.

212
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:09,900
Next, it's up to Bang.

213
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,100
I have no idea how to cook.

214
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,650
What should I do now?

215
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,450
Maybe I should learn from Bang next time.

216
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,050
Bro, why is he called Bang?

217
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,850
I carried and brought everything for him.

218
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,150
But I really can't cook.

219
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,145
Should I add some water? I guess I have to.

220
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:27,070
You need to stew it a bit longer.

221
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,270
I think stew it a bit more, then add water.

222
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,170
You can add some now.

223
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,295
Now add water, but what kind of water?

224
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:35,770
Just use regular water.

225
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,670
Mineral water, get a bottle of mineral water.

226
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,445
I'll go get the mineral water.

227
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,195
You can't add that.

228
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:41,370
How much do you need, one bottle?
