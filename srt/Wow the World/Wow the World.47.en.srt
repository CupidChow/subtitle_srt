1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,240
Let's play a super simple game.

2
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,680
Everyone will sing from the show's playlist.

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,360
Start singing.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
While singing,

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,320
we'll give you certain forbidden words.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,400
You can't sing the forbidden words.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,160
But you must do the assigned dance moves.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,600
If anyone does the wrong move or sings a forbidden word,

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,400
they lose a point.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,280
Split into four or five groups.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,560
One group is colors, one group is numbers.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,320
I want to be in the color group.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,240
I want colors too.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,640
I think colors are easier.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,080
Colors.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,360
I want colors as well.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,960
Colors.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,600
Colors.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,960
You have to be in the numbers group.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,280
Otherwise,

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,360
Otherwise, you can't even say your name.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,480
Sun (Hong) Lei.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Makes sense.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,160
Alright.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
That's a solid reason.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,280
Then Lin Yi can't join either.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,000
Lin (Yi).

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,600
Lin (Yi).

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,480
So he's in the color group.

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,640
That's right.

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,520
Color group, get ready.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,200
Let's go.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
What's our dance move?

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,360
The other team will assign it.

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,840
Actually, this one's good.

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,880
This works.

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,440
Okay.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,840
No, when you bring your hand back,

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,880
it's easy to hit your teeth.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,760
I'm telling you, seriously.

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,200
If you do it like this, bam.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,600
Then let's just use one hand.

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,080
One hand.

44
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,760
No.

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,280
It's like, for example,

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,640
Look.

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,800
Sister, cute little sister.

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,520
If you do that in your group,

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
We've set it to spinning around.

50
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,720
They have to follow our instructions, right?

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,080
Yes.

52
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Your group spins next.

53
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,880
Just a little.

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Xingxu, just do it like this.

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
Just move your upper body a bit, that's fine.

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,320
Just move a little.

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,680
Got it.

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:05,960
Okay.

59
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,520
Start.

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Huangli.

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
Brother Naiwen.

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
This is just too...

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,600
How do you sing this?

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,920
With you, the sunshine is brighter.

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Amazing.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
Total defeat.

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,680
Honestly, this is too hard.

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,400
Aerobic.

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,640
Aerobic.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,560
I think the hard part is...

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,800
Not knowing where to take a breath.

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,080
We can't hear when to come in on this word.

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,200
Because there's no cue for it.

74
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,120
That really is tough.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
Okay, let's do the count again.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,280
It's like a warm-up.

77
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Because we don't know where the cue is.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,120
Right.

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,160
Wait, is anyone down there...

80
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Like, wave your hand when we start singing?

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are actually just four in the middle.

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,480
After four beats, we come in.

83
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,880
No.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
No.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,440
Director, Yunings cues are spot on.

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,800
Just let him signal, that's enough.

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,360
Sure.

88
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
Alright, I'll call out the count.

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll go one, two, three, sing.

90
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Okay.

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay.

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
Let's go.

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,160
Three, two, one, start.

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,400
Start grooving.

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,120
Groove, Brother Naiwen Li.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,520
One, two, three, sing.

97
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Little Huang (Oriole).

98
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,720
One, two, three, sing.

99
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,720
One, two, three, sing.

100
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,320
Three, sing.

101
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,280
Chen He.

102
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
How was it? Was that okay?

103
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,600
I messed up.

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
Alright, scores for the second round.

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,160
I didn't get any wrong the second time.

106
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,120
Lin Yi got them all wrong.

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,760
All wrong.

108
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,640
He definitely didn't get them all wrong.

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,240
I want to see the replay. How could it all be wrong?

110
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
He just told me...

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,360
He didn't get any wrong.

112
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,400
I didn't get any wrong the second time.

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,320
Lin Yi's moves were wrong.

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
The moves were wrong.

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,600
No, isn't it just like this?

116
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,720
This side.

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,680
It's that hand.

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,240
Like this.

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,280
I didn't get the rules.

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
My arm got tired doing this side the first time.

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
So I switched sides.

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,400
He did it smoothly, like this.

123
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,640
How did you do it?

124
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,160
You do yours first.

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
How did you do it?

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,880
Bro, it's right hand, left foot.

127
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,240
Like this.

128
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,400
Right hand, left foot, that's right.

129
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,960
Then it really was all wrong.

130
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,600
I admit it, I admit it.

131
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,320
Brother He loses six points.

132
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,600
Only six points?

133
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
That's good, six points is impressive.

134
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
Yuwen gets five points.

135
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,880
What?

136
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
Xingxu gets four points.

137
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,280
Why does he only lose four points?

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Because I didn't switch sides with my moves.

139
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,200
And my feet weren't in sync.

140
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,800
So finally, Brother Naiwen's score is...

141
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
I'm looking forward to it.

142
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,680
Brother Naiwen didn't lose any points.

143
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,280
Did I sing too loudly?

144
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,480
Did I drown out his singing?

145
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
I didn't lose any points.

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,480
Did you not make any sound?

147
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,760
I did sing.

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
There are red flowers here.

149
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,120
There is green grass here.

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,000
Dian Wei with a yellow face.

151
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,000
Cao Cao with a white face.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
...

153
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,760
You are the white clouds, I am the blue sky.

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
Come on, friends.

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Come, our numbers team.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Let's go.

157
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Come.

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,400
Lin Yi.

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
Go design a difficult move for them.

160
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,560
Can you do it?

161
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,360
Like this.

162
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,040
Like this.

163
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,320
Are you going to tear up someone else's umbrella?

164
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,520
Tear it up, all torn after the rain.

165
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,680
Let's all touch our knees, okay?

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,160
We just need to get the moves right.

167
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,680
Yeah.

168
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,920
Let's do it this way.

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,919
Okay, let's go.

170
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,640
Start.

171
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,120
Two, three, four.

172
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,000
One, two, three, sing!

173
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,200
They sang it out.

174
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
Brother Honglei isn't singing anymore.

175
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
Brother Honglei turned off his mic.

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
I don't know how to sing this song.

177
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm so tired.

178
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Come on.

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,320
This group.

180
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Brother Honglei.

181
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,440
Three times.

182
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Three times.

183
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
That's impressive.

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Not bad.

185
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Jin Jing and Didi, two points.

186
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
So impressive.

187
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,960
Yuning loses one point.

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Game King.

189
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
Let's play something simple.

190
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,720
I'll give a topic, and everyone takes turns answering.

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,080
If everyone succeeds, we get a snack reward.

Mickey Mouse.

208
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,880
Mickey Mouse is more popular than anyone.

209
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,000

221
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,560
You don't know Minnie and Mickey?

222
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,360

235
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,560

245
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080
I forgot his name.

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,640
No, it's just a topic.

255
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,360
Transformers.

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,240
Come on, name the characters in Transformers.

257
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,680

I still...

267
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,080
This really is...

268
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,760
I wanted to say Astro Boy.

269
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,960
But I couldn't remember.

270
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,160
Just mentioning it makes me feel old.

271
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,920
I didn't dare say it.

272
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440

273
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,000

Eggplant.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,240
No, I was talking to him.

277
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,640
I was talking to him.

278
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
No, Lin Yi.

279
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,840
He definitely thought of eggplant first.

280
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
But couldn't say it.

281
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,080
And that's how it went.

282
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
You didn't say "three, two, one, go."

283
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
Give him another chance, okay?

284
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,440
Go ahead.

Yes, this exists.

300
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,640
This one exists.

301
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,360
"For Him"

302
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
For him.

We'll always be together.

304
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
Original, purely original.

306
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,280
I'll write this song next.

Go search.

309
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,560
Is there such a song?

310
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,920
Definitely.

311
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,280
There are lots of song titles like this.

312
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,600
Teacher Tao Hong sang it.

313
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
My sister, Sister Tao Hong.

314
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,040

315
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,600
Everyone for me, I for everyone.

316
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,480
How about that?

317
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
I just made up "Doraemon" too.

318
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,400
Who mentioned "Doraemon" just now?

319
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
"Doraemon" exists, check it.

320
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,280
This song is called "Xiao Ding Dang," sis.

321
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,600
But there's "Doraemon" too.

322
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,760
No, I didn't mean "Xiao Ding Dang."

323
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,120
No.

324
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,520
If you translate it, it's Doraemon.

325
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,040
Right.

326
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800

I wanted to say "Love You."

334
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,400
Love him, you said love him.

335
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,040
Love who?

336
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,040
Love who?

Love him, love you, love me, love everyone.

339
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,000
You, me, him—there must be songs.

340
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,600
Love? Just love.

341
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960

348
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,200
Add any word to "love" and it's a song.

349
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,920

366
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,760
Let's go.

Has that been said?

379
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,080
He didn't hear it.

380
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520
We just passed through a tunnel.

381
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
It was too loud.

382
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,480
I could barely hear what anyone was saying.

383
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah, what did you say just now?

384
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,760
What?

385
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,280
What are you saying?

386
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,120
I'm deaf now.

387
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,080
"Lovers Missed"

388
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
There must be two versions.

389
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,720
Right.

390
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
You're talking about the cover version.

391
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
He's talking about the band's version.

392
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,360
I sang this song on a show.

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,920
It's the one I sang.

394
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,320
He means the version he sang.

395
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,160
That happens a lot in the music scene.

396
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,360
Different people sing the same song.

397
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,120
Ask Accusefive.

398
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,920
He definitely won't admit it.

399
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,200
The one I sang is his song.

400
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
There are both Cantonese and Mandarin versions.

401
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
Sing your version first, let me hear it.

402
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,560
Lovers just missed each other.

403
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Lovers just missed each other.

404
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Heard it, passed by, never said it.

405
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
So if we follow this logic,

406
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,400
each of us can say

407
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,960
"Lovers Missed"

408
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,200
because different people sang it.

409
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
The one I sang, the one he sang, and more.

410
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,880
There were issues earlier too.

411
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,640
What did Brother Honglei say?

412
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
"Stormy Rain"

413
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Who sings it?

414
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,320
Don't ask yet, go look it up.

415
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,640
Should there be such a song? I don't think so.

416
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,080
There is.

417
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,760
Yeah, there is.

418
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,800
What's Xingxu?

419
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies"

420
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,440
"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies" is fine.

421
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,000
"Must Be Done"

422
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
"Must Be Done" sounds suspicious.

423
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,040
"Must Be Done" is suspicious.

424
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,360
Who sings "Must Be Done"?

425
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,240
Who sings "Must Be Done"?

426
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,920
Li Naiwen sings it.

427
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
I filmed a TV series with Guo Jingfei.

428
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
It's called "Must Be Done".

429
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
And then?

430
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,120
The theme song.

431
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,440
It's definitely called "Must Be Done".

432
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,200
Not necessarily.

433
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,520
Not necessarily, bro.

434
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,320
It's called "Must Be Done" Original Soundtrack.

435
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,960
"Princess Pearl"

436
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
See if that's a song.

437
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,240
"Princess Pearl"

438
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,920
There is a song called "Princess Pearl".

439
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,000
Wenzi.

440
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,520
"When"

441
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,760
That's called "When".

442
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
That one's called "When".

443
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Let us be companions in this world.

444
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,080
That's called "When".

445
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,720
It's still called "When".

446
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
That's the same song.

447
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,720
Shut up.

448
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,600
Just one song.

449
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,079
There's actually no song called "Princess Pearl"?

450
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,720
There is.

451
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,480
Impossible.

452
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,000
Not even one song?

453
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,720
You just can't find it.

454
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,200
Because right now,

455
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,400
you're on Spanish internet.

456
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,359
You can't search for ours.

457
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,280
No copyright for that.

458
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,440
Really.

459
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,440
There's no song called "Princess Pearl".

460
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,400
Really, there isn't.

461
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,240
What should we do?

462
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,200
Help me make one up quickly.

463
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,040
That's hard to make up.

464
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,720
That's really hard to make up.

465
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,359
Then we lost.

466
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,119
Give me a sunflower seed.

467
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,200
Just give one seed.

468
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,560
Give two.

469
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,360

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,280
Movies, right?

473
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,240
Yes

474
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,280
Movie: Lost in Beijing

475
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,080

484
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,240
Yes

485
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,040
We really made it to Barcelona

486
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,200
Are you guys going, bro?

487
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Buy some souvenirs or something

488
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,800
You guys go ahead

489
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I'll look around a bit more

490
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,120
This one's glass, Lin Yi

491
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,160
This isn't glass

492
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,840
It's resin

493
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,840
What's this for?

494
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,640
Resin

495
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,520
Is it a fridge magnet?

496
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,920
Fridge magnet

497
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,320
This is a bag

498
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,560
This one's ugly

499
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,040
That one's ugly, this one's nice

500
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
This one's pretty interesting too

501
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
This little box is okay too

502
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,560
These are all good for gifts

503
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,400
What's inside?

504
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,040
Candy

505
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,640
Three times seven is twenty-one

506
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,120
This one's on sale, it's cheap

507
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440
What's on sale?

508
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Group price for four

509
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,360
Cheaper than this one

510
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,120
Four times seven is twenty-eight

511
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,840
What does that mean?

512
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
He just picked four

513
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,720
Saw different colors

514
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,800
Found this one too

515
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
It's like buy three get one free at this price

516
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,640
Let's check out something else

517
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,080
Let's look ahead

518
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,240
That's about it

519
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
See what's up ahead

520
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
This one's nice, right?

521
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,960
I want to buy this one, is that okay?

522
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,320
Sure

523
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Take eight

524
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,000
I just want to buy one of these

525
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,840
That's fine

526
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,600
Right?

527
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah, this cup is nice too

528
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,840
What's it like inside?

529
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,680
Unscrew it and take a look

530
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
It's just a regular drinking cup

531
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
This one's beautiful

532
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,280
This fan

533
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,560
This fan is really pretty

534
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,480
But what's its connection to Sagrada Familia?

535
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,440
The mural style on it

536
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,960
Definitely

537
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,640
Is there?

538
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,120
Yes

539
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,360
This is actually really pretty

540
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,160
This is beautiful, right?

541
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,680
Yes

542
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,440
This one's more delicate

543
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,520
Tree of Life

544
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,440
This one's quite unique

545
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,120
So artistic

546
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,520
So artistic

547
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,680
Is this a chameleon?

548
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,680
Can't really tell what it is

549
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,960
There's one here

550
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,280
There's a waterfall over here

551
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,760
Looks like this

552
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,320
Chameleon

553
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,160
Or is it a fountain?

554
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,520
It's in Crayon Shin-chan

555
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,680
Are you a Crayon Shin-chan fan?

556
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,080
Yes

557
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm the ambassador for the Crayon Shin-chan movie

558
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,240
Really?

559
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,480
Really
