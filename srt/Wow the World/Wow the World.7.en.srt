1
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:04,387
Remember the past

2
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:07,487
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:09,137
Loud and clear

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,637
That's great

5
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:12,587
The effect is pretty good, right?

6
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:14,412
Pay attention to my cues

7
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,887
In a moment,

8
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:18,537
you must follow my instructions unconditionally

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,880
No problem

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:22,955
Here we go

11
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,680
Sing louder, come on, loud

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,730
Go, go, go

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,930
Totally immersed

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,380
OK

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,680
Alright

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,780
My heart

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,630
Discover

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,930
Discover

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,825
Oh

20
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, Honglei

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,150
Honglei, speak English well

22
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,350
Speak English, speak English

23
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,750
Nice to meet you

24
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,700
Nice to meet you

25
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
Nice to meet you, Honglei

26
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:58,400
Get ready, 3, 2, 1, go, A B C D E F G U V W X Y Z

27
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,390
Gong Jun

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,540
Come out

29
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,740
Come out

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,140
We can brainstorm together now

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,590
Come on, come on

32
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,665
Don't, don't talk

33
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,365
Bro, you messed up

34
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:18,240
Speak English

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,020
Just hold this pose

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,020
Don't say a word

37
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,170
Just keep smiling like this

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,970
Bro, speak English

39
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,320
Sit down

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,620
Please

41
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,370
Bro

42
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,895
I was wrong

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:35,170
Bro

44
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,520
We don't know who he's dealing with

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,550
What's wrong with you

46
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,250
Xing Xu

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,300
His partner

48
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,850
His partner is very introverted

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,800
Really reserved emotionally

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,550
I don't know, you guys aren't close either

51
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,775
I heard from them that you're not close

52
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:56,450
I haven't met them either

53
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,025
This is my first time meeting

54
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:57,875
I know him

55
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:58,850
We know each other

56
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,000
It's normal that you two know each other

57
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,100
You two

58
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,425
You two are so funny

59
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,450
I think it's interesting

60
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,225
Greet first

61
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:09,775
Then say

62
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:10,450
Hello, uncle

63
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,550
Hello, uncle

64
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,900
Hello, uncle

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,765
Hey

66
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,265
Little brother

67
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,740
When your guest arrives later

68
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,565
as soon as you see him

69
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:24,915
start doing it on the floor

70
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:26,040
start doing push-ups

71
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,865
do 15 of them

72
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,090
then get up and shake his hand

73
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,315
No, not fifteen, do ten

74
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,390
Ten, ten, ten

75
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,165
After you finish ten

76
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:32,665
After you finish ten

77
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:33,490
shake his hand

78
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,090
Laixuan, hello, hello, hello

79
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,590
Look how nervous you are

80
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,540
Oh my, you're sweating, this is so hard for me

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,490
Why are both your faces so red? Did you know that at the start?

82
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,653
I did it

83
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:50,390
The two of us did it together for Brother Honglei

84
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,140
I was the first to perform

85
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
He was the first to do it

86
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,865
He showed it to Brother Honglei

87
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:54,940
Then Brother Honglei showed it to you

88
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,765
Just keep watching him, just watch him

89
00:02:58,765 --> 00:02:59,940
Smile, smile and look at him

90
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,970
Smile and look at the girl

91
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,670
Is this some kind of test?

92
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,895
Naiwen said

93
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:05,795
Just sit like this

94
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:06,720
Just sit like this

95
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,295
You two.

96
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:11,895
You two.

97
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,495
Now open a bottle of Mizone.

98
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:14,345
Open a bottle of Mizone.

99
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:15,095
Drink it all in one go.

100
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:15,520
Then,

101
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,558
Drink it together.

102
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:18,070
Drink half.

103
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,720
Just drink half.

104
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,520
Cheers, cheers.

105
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,720
Cheers.

106
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,370
Then give a bottle to the girl.

107
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,370
Give it to Yuyu.

108
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,820
Give a bottle to the girl.

109
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,695
Give a bottle to the girl.

110
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:35,070
I really give up.

111
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,070
Here.

112
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,770
Drink a bottle.

113
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,995
Do we have to link arms too?

114
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:39,295
Cheers.

115
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:39,620
Cheers.

116
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,220
No need to link arms.

117
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,595
Cheers.

118
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,070
Cheers.

119
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,060
Linking arms isn't appropriate, right?

120
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,410
The two of you said,

121
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,660
I'll finish mine, you do as you like.

122
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,460
I'll finish mine.

123
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,410
I'll finish mine, you do as you like.

124
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,710
Okay.

125
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,660
Bro.

126
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,110
Your eyes are so big.

127
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Are you acting in a romance drama?

128
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,710
Seeing you makes my heart race.

129
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,260
Can this even be aired?

130
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,650
What are you doing, bro?

131
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,050
Oh my god.

132
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,805
From now on, you should arrive earlier than the last and second-to-last person.

133
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:46,705
Show him how it's done.

134
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:47,805
Show big brother how it's done.

135
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:48,930
Let big brother try it too.

136
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,630
Hey.

137
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,880
You're still the mischievous one.

138
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,930
Do you have a broom?

139
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,480
Give me one.

140
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,480
Recording a show.

141
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,780
Why is any broom okay?

142
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,980
A walkie-talkie.

143
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,055
A walkie-talkie can be used to talk.

144
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,205
You can remember it.

145
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:01,780
I'm B.

146
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,430
You are...

147
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,590
Yes.

148
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,510
You child...

149
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,960
You didn't come home all night.

150
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,910
Where did you go?

151
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,910
What does it have to do with you?

152
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,760
You child...

153
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,735
Are you trying to make your dad angry?

154
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:29,360
Aren't you?

155
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,560
Your mom passed away so early.

156
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,260
Look at you...

157
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,430
You didn't come home all night.

158
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,380
Even I, your dad, didn't know you were working as a cleaner at the entrance.

159
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,130
Y.

160
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,055
What does Z mean?

161
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:41,630
Owner.

162
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,380
You insist on saying BA.

163
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,880
You, you're called J.

164
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,080
Do you get it now?

165
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,550
Hey

166
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,050
What

167
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,800
Okay, okay, okay

168
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,510
Still can hang on for a bit

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,260
Still can hang on for a bit

170
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,860
Aren't you out already?

171
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,410
Oh

172
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:04,960
Out

173
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,060
I'm three

174
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,510
Oh

175
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,385
You're three

176
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,110
I guessed right

177
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,960
Brother Wang Honglei

178
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm five

179
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,540
I got it right again

180
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,690
Right again

181
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,365
Who was one again?

182
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:17,640
Me

183
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,190
I got it right again

184
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,290
Right again

185
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,290
I'm four

186
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,840
Chen Xingxu is four

187
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,515
Brother He is two

188
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:25,940
Right?

189
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,190
Brother He is two

190
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,585
Get ready

191
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,560
I pulled you back first

192
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,510
Sing first, then talk

193
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,160
No points deducted anyway

194
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,785
Where are you going?

195
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:37,285
Well done

196
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:37,435
Bro

197
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:38,023
Well done

198
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:38,810
Brother

199
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,335
What are you doing?

200
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,160
Didn't I fix the microphone for you?

201
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,010
Hold it

202
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,170
Kung Fu

203
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,020
Is it Huo Yuanjia?

204
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,320
Love leads to right and wrong

205
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,620
So much of it

206
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,020
Comes to lively, animated occasions

207
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Alright, alright

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It still has to be you

209
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,450
Is it an Indian song?

210
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,500
It always goes "dong"

211
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,600
There's also a special skill

212
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,150
Bro, can you sing it?

213
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,500
Which part should I sing? I'll sing first, then we'll talk

214
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,100
You were the one who wanted to break up

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,750
If we break up, then so be it

216
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,200
Now you want to use true love to call me back

217
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Trying to coax me back by mistake

218
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,600
You were the one who wanted to break up, break up for good

219
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,050
Now you want to use true love to coax me back

220
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,450
Gong Jun really is a nightingale

221
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,510
Nightingale

222
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,660
You and I are heart to heart

223
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,810
Forever a family

224
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,350
With

225
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,950
Faith in Jesus

226
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,400
Together for a long, long time

227
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,590
Beautiful dreams

228
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,890
With one heart

229
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,490
Together in Beijing
