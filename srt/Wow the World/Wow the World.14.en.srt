1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,100
Yes.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,900
Wang Yuwen.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,950
Egg and bacon.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,500
American style.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,125
Egg.

6
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:10,650
Bacon.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,125
American style.

8
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:11,650
Hurry up.

9
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,650
Egg and bacon.

10
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,250
American style egg.

11
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,800
Egg.

12
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,500
Coffee.

13
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,600
Coffee.

14
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,720
Can you do it?

15
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,720
Can you get it done?

16
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,870
Can you get it done?

17
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,670
I'm hungry.

18
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,820
Egg.

19
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,295
American style bacon.

20
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:26,920
Can you do it?

21
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,308
Wang Yuwen.

22
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:35,220
Wang Yuwen.

23
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,820
Wang Yuwen.

24
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,420
Egg.

25
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,070
Bacon and coffee.

26
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,090
Wang Yuwen.

27
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,490
Wang Yuwen.

28
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,290
I want to drink something delicious.

29
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:44,840
Hurry up.

30
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:48,740
Guobaorou.

31
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,340
Guobaorou.

32
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,440
Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,490
One order of Guobaorou, Guobaorou.

34
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,665
That Guobaorou.

35
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:54,465
One order of Guobaorou.

36
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:54,990
Guobaorou.

37
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,940
Chicken stew with mushrooms.

38
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,890
Can't get through here.

39
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,240
Blood sausage.

40
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,080
Ate it yesterday.

41
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,090
Singing karaoke in the villa

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,840
Arowana fish in the pool

43
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,390
I gave him a tea set

44
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,840
He didn't give me any mooncakes either

45
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,090
He just gave me four words

46
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,790
Written personally by the great master of grand ambitions

47
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,715
And then this hand

48
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:38,890
Should be placed here

49
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,190
This hand

50
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,330
Put it on the hip

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,480
And then like this, like this

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,630
Wow, you really know how to have fun

53
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,930
I have another move

54
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,930
It's the hand

55
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,830
Along the side of the face

56
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,830
Comfort me like this

57
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,980
Hey

58
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,480
Oh my god

59
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,740
Ouch

60
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,240
Oh my god

61
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,590
Wow, you’re really something

62
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,415
You come up with a routine

63
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:17,090
Then I’ll just do this

64
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,945
Like this, right?

65
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:22,220
Bro

66
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,545
Jun Jun

67
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,120
Come on, come on

68
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,445
Look

69
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,370
You from 50 years ago and you from 50 years later

70
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,120
You’re together

71
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,245
I didn’t dance well 50 years ago

72
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:35,020
50 years later, I became you

73
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,670
Get ready

74
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,010
Hey

75
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,460
Oh my god

76
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,510
I’m really elegant

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,660
Hip movement

78
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,685
I think the best part of the dance here is the confidence

79
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,860
Why are seniors so good at disco?

80
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:01,745
Follow my lead

81
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:05,620
First it’s one, two, three, four, right?

82
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,595
Here it’s two times, five, six, seven, eight, after two sets of eight counts, start shaking

83
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:15,345
Smile

84
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,000
Flower hands

85
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,300
Hey

86
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,350
It’s over

87
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,050
Too slow

88
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,300
Bro

89
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,100
OK

90
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:31,850
Sure

91
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,870
Ready

92
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:59,270
Start: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:09,280
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

94
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,880
So

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,430
charming

96
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,630
I really want to take selfies today

97
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,270
Let's do it again

98
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,170
Let's do it again

99
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,545
One more time

100
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:27,470
Everyone, look at your phones

101
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,220
Looking at your phone made your heart race, right?

102
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,370
You're talking a bit much this time

103
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,270
If it's not you

104
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,120
Then maybe you're the undercover

105
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,150
Wow

106
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,275
That sentence makes no sense

107
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:43,850
What do you mean?

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,850
If you didn't protect the first one

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,650
Then it's probably me

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,675
Hey

111
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:51,450
I see

112
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,250
Let's give the killer

113
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,400
a mission

114
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,850
First

115
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,550
Kill Chen He

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,870
If he isn't killed

117
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,220
Okay

118
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,820
Then it's basically Chen He

119
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,920
It's really not me

120
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,420
It wasn't me.

121
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,895
It wasn't me.

122
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,870
It really wasn't me.

123
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Let me tell you,

124
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,620
for this performance,

125
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,020
you have to learn to observe.

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,435
Keep your eyes on everything.

127
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,460
Listen to everything around you.

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
Wouldn't you know it,

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,960
when I was looking around,

130
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,160
I saw Yuníng looking at his little brother,

131
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,660
and then right after, little brother, you were full,

132
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,760
and you gestured with your mouth.

133
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,800
Really.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't have made such a strange move.

135
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,825
If you let Yuníng wear a mask,

136
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:50,250
isn't that like taking away the killer's gun?

137
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,750
Are you still there?

138
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,350
I...

139
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,025
If you write it like this, it really fits.

140
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:00,750
That's it.

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,020
Like this.

142
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,245
Eat like this, with your wrist above.

143
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:05,970
But not too much.

144
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,245
Your forearm can't be here like this.

145
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,670
But this can be here.

146
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,720
It's not that you have to strike this pose.

147
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,370
And then...

148
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,470
There doesn't have to be a specific move.

149
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,470
Logically, from this table, only you can reach both sides.

150
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,620
I can't do it.

151
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,140
Not that side, just my side.

152
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,990
Don't look at me.

153
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,290
I'm not staring at you.

154
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,340
Don't look at me.

155
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,565
What's wrong with you?

156
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:36,940
There's something wrong with the way you're looking.

157
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,540
Ning, you're feeling guilty, right?

158
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,065
I also think your look is good.

159
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,490
But you're a bit weird.

160
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,690
I'm feeling dizzy.

161
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,900
That really is a pouting motion.

162
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:46,850
Okay.

163
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,550
I won't move.

164
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,950
From now on, I won't say anything.

165
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,725
Let's see if staying silent is any use.

166
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:52,650
Just don't move your mouth.

167
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,250
Get a mask.

168
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,250
How about I do this?

169
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,850
Let Yun Ning wear a mask.

170
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,300
Isn't that like taking away the killer's gun?

171
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,950
Yun Ning.

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,850
Through today's game,

173
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,700
I realized that Yun Ning

174
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,700
I wasn't wrong about you.

175
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,650
You're actually a really good person.

176
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,330
Really.

177
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,405
You can't lie.

178
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,730
Yeah, I just can't lie.

179
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,805
I think you're a really good person.

180
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,705
From today on,

181
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:11,905
I consider you my friend.

182
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:12,230
Alright.

183
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,480
Bro.

184
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,400
Here they come.

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,150
Look, quick!

186
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,700
Hey.

187
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,075
Oh my god.

188
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:40,575
Not bad.

189
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:41,150
That's good.

190
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,600
Wow.

191
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,600
This, this...

192
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
We really shouldn't have learned the later part.

193
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:56,075
You go ahead.

194
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:56,700
Get ready.

195
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,400
Here we go.

196
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,850
Now you do a freestyle.

197
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,200
Five, six, and go.

198
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,890
Alright, go.

199
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,690
Sister Ren walks on three, four.

200
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,190
Very good.

201
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,840
That's good.

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,915
Then come out on three and catch your breath.

203
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:11,490
The next part.

204
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,190
Impressive.

205
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:38,020
Then like this, like this, like this.

206
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,670
If you want the beat, do it like me.

207
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,170
I'll go forward.

208
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,670
Then you go back, okay?

209
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:56,420
You need to stay on the beat, 5-6-7-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

210
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,670
Isn't the jawline just about stretching your neck out?

211
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
There's one, look.

212
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
It's when you push your tongue up.

213
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,250
Look, mine is like this.

214
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,200
But I'm the same.

215
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,450
OK.

216
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:17,950
Yes.

217
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,250
Oh no.

218
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,950
It's hot.

219
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Oh no.

220
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,270
It's on fire.

221
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,020
This is duck.

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,120
Chicken.

223
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,020
Duck.

224
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,170
This is man.

225
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:44,900
Here.

226
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,450
Let's wake the landlord up like this tomorrow.

227
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,310
Me.

228
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,410
You are you.

229
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,535
This isn't practicing anymore.

230
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,610
You're making a fortune.

231
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,885
No.

232
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:33,960
I've gone into business.
