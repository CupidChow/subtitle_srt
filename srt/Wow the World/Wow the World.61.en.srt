1
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,680
Today is the Earth Squad's

2
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,640
last day in Spain.

3
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,400
But there are still many

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,520
amazing experiences not to be missed.

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,880
For example, the

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Park Güell, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
The soul of Barcelona's old city,

8
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
the Gothic Quarter.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,320
Today, everyone can wander freely as they like

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,360
and explore Barcelona on their own.

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,520
Morning.

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
Morning.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,720
Last night,

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,280
I ate a big piece of lamb from Ning.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,960
And had a big bowl of lamb soup.

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,600
He’s braised pork,

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
then I had two bowls of rice.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,000
And then Lin Yi

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,200
gave me a prank candy.

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,680
My whole tongue turned blue.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,320
I was so “crazy” yesterday.

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
It was like having a globe in my mouth.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,000
Like I took a bite out of Avatar.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,520
Ning was so scary in the middle of the night.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,000
He reheated the lamb soup at midnight

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800
and made himself

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,880
a ton of noodles.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,760
The plate was huge.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,920
He first brought a bowl of noodles,

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,840
ate by himself,

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,160
and it smelled so good.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
Then he started adding chili.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
He said it wasn’t spicy enough,

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,759
so he added more chili.

35
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,880
Then it got too spicy.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,919
So he added more noodles.

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,520
I asked, why add more noodles?

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
He said it would make it less spicy.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,400
Then Brother Ning told me

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,880
by the last bite,

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,400
he started to regret it.

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Regret.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
Our first task today

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
is to test everyone’s Cantonese.

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Because our city, Shenzhen,

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
has established a sister city relationship with Barcelona.

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
The exchange between the two cities is growing closer.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Now, Cantonese restaurants can be found

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
all over the streets of Barcelona.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
Our next task is called

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,680
the Cantonese Singing Challenge.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Members will be split into two teams.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
One team has four people,

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
the other has five.

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,880
One person describes in Cantonese,

56
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
the others guess.

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,560
The describer can only use descriptions

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
to convey the lyrics to the guessers.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,040
During the process,

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,160
they can’t say any words from the lyrics.

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,640
If the guesser gets it right

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
and sings the line in Cantonese,

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
it counts as a success.

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
There are five rounds in total.

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,880
The team with the shortest total time wins.

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
The winning team can set off first

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,560
for free activities.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,240
I think Lin Yi should pick his own team.

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,080
That way,

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
we’ll have two captains.

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
One captain is Lin Yi.

72
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
Then I’ll be a captain.

73
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,120
Is that okay?

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,040
I’m applying to be captain.

75
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
Bro, I hope you

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,720
pick me.

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Lin Yi, let me tell you,

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,520
if I were you,

79
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,760
I couldn’t let this slide today.

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
I’d have to prove myself, right?

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
You got rejected.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,400
Why?

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,120
Why not team up with Lin Yi?

84
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,560
Because he’s a master in this field.

85
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,960
Like Tang Bohu, both kind and handsome.

86
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,000
Lin Yi.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,640
And Sister Wang, I don’t know why everyone

88
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,320
I think you should pick Sister Wang first.

89
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,960
My suggestion.

90
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
I suggest letting her try.

91
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,080
Lin Yi, I want to be on your team.

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,480
Come on.

93
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,240
A strong alliance.

95
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,440
Today, it’s a strong alliance.

96
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,480
I wanted to make eye contact with him.

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
He didn’t even look at me.

98
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,600
Brother Naiwen.

99
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,800
Aren't you happy?

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
Do you trust me?

101
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:20,720
Trust him.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Trust me.

103
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,959
Trust him.

104
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,960
I've been practicing a lot these past two days.

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
I listen to Cantonese songs every night before bed.

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
I'm just worried you've been training hard.

107
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,600
Come on, let's go again.

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,960
Next.

109
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,640
Sister Wang.

110
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
A strong team needs her.

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
Trust me.

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
Of course I trust you.

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,640
Let's balance our side a bit.

114
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,520
Let's pick a guy too.

115
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's choose Didi for the last spot.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,360
Okay.

117
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,720
Come on, let's compete for Didi.

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
Didi has to be on our team.

119
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,200
Then you two go ahead.

120
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Us two?

121
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,960
You two go.

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,400
Come on.

123
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Let's go.

124
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,160
Rock-paper-scissors.

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,800
Rock-paper-scissors.

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
What's that?

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Let me ask.

128
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,920
Is this a little pair of scissors?

129
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,120
Little scissors.

130
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
I picked scissors.

131
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,240
Did you change the way to play rock-paper-scissors?

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
This is the way to show your hand, right?

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
Let's go over the rules again.

134
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
How do you say "rock"? Rock.

135
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,200
Rock is...

136
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
Rock.

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Scissors.

138
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Paper.

139
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,160
Alright.

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,280
Let's do it.

141
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

142
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,640
Scissors, paper.

143
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,800
Scissors, paper.

144
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,440
Lin Yi, it's all your fault.

145
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,080
You know that?

146
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
It's all your fault.

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,480
Hurry, come on.

148
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,520
Rock, paper, scissors.

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,400
Help!

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
Hurry up.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,240
Come on, rock, paper, scissors.

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,880
I won.

153
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,640
Let's go.

154
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,760
Okay.

155
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Didi.

156
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,040
They have more people.

157
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,640
Let them go first.

158
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Alright, let's go.

159
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,480
This game is way too easy.

160
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,760
You're so confident, seriously.

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
If it's Cantonese, we can't lose.

162
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,800
We're definitely going to win.

163
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
So tough, so long.

164
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,640
How many characters?

165
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Two lines.

166
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,960
Two lines of text?

167
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,680
Two lines.

168
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,960
Go for it!

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,240
The first character is "dang".

170
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,480
Me and...

171
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,160
A four-character idiom.

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Idiom.

173
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,160
When you...

174
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,360
Similar to "traveling across the sea to see you".

175
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,880
That four-character phrase.

176
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
Ride the wind and waves

177
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,360
He said—let me translate

178
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
Similar

179
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,720
Brave the thorns and obstacles

180
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
Watch me

181
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,040
This is a needle

183
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,280
Needle

184
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
This is thread

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
When you pass through

186
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,440
Pass through

187
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
Similar

188
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,400
You can understand this too

189
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
They’re slowly connecting

190
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,320
Yes

191
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,080
What?

192
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Say another sentence

193
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,320
When you cross mountains and seas

194

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Cross mountains

197
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
And then with

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,080
Turn over

199
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,680

I understand you

207
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
These two are clearly saying

208
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
Different languages

209
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,200
I’m really

00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,680
Pretty?

211
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,160
Pretty

00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,480
Good-looking

Beautiful

214
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,320
Another word is beautiful

215
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Beautiful what?

216
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Beautiful girls, look over here

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Look over here

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,240

Beautiful bubbles

226
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Just a fleeting spark

227
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,520
Just a fleeting spark

228
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,280
Go for it

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
Brother He, we believe in you

230
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,800

239
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,120

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,640

The second word

246
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,960
Is alcohol

247
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,640

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,040
Just loving you

00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,600
What?

252
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,200
The second word is alcohol

253
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,840
The first word

254
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,080
Big

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,760
The opposite of big

256
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Small

257
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,600
Small

258
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,280

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
Small alcohol what?

260
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,200
That's fine.

261
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
This song list is impressive.

262
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
None of us know this song.

263
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,040
What should we do?

264
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
The song's fine, no problem.

265
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,560
He's not bad either.

266
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,280
I can't sing any of these songs.

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
The first word.

268
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,680
The first word.

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,200
Last night.

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,600
Liu Yuning.

272
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,360
Noodles.

273
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
When eating noodles.

274
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,400
When eating noodles.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
So spicy.

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,600
Spicy.

277
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Spicy Girl is spicy.

278
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,040
Spicy Girl is spicy.

279
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,760
Spicy Girl's never been afraid of spice.

280
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,160
No.

281
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,000
The first three words are right.

282
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,200
Spicy Girl.

283
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,960
The fourth and fifth words.

284
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,760
Four and five.

285
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Okay.

286
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,080
A girl and a boy get married.

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
How do you say it?

288
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,480
That's...

289
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,480
What?

290
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
Matri-local marriage.

291
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Matri-local marriage.

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Matri-local marriage.

293
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,840
Only for boys is it called matri-local marriage.

294
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Spicy Girl returns.

295
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,160
Returns to her parents' home.

296
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
What's it called for girls?

297
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,520
Getting married off.

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
Afraid it's not spicy.

299
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
Is it that simple?

300
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,800
All the heartless people in the world.

301
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
Tang Bohu.

302
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
Ready.

303
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,680
Okay.

304
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,280
Okay.

305
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Window.

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
Window.

307
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,400
Window sill.

308
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,640
Window sill, don't you get it?

309
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Don't you get it? Window sill.

310
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Speak.

311
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,520
The second word.

312
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,400
What's the second word?

313
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
The second word.

314
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,280
What?

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,840
What is this?

316
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,320
Wait a second.

317
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,160
I get it.

318
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,920
I get it.

319
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,680
What kind of Mandarin are you speaking?

320
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,640
What are you eating?

321
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Sister Wang, don't you understand him?

322
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,080
This game is way too easy.

323
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,040
Where are you?

324
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
What does "where are you" mean?

325
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,400
Where are you?

326
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Said it wrong.

327
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,520
What are you doing?

328
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,240
You.

329
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
Make a call.

330
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,120
Make a call.

331
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,800
Make a call.

332
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,120
Right.

333
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
The first word of "make a call".

334
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,520
Say what?

335
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,160
Make a call.

336
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,840
Hello?

337
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,080
Right.

338
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,800
Window.

339
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,520
Window hello.

340
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,560
Window hello.

341
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,040
Right.

342
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,160
The third word.

343
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,960
If you can guess this sentence...

344
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,400
Come on, Sister Wang.

345
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,840
Cousin.

346
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,440
Heaven and earth.

347
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,160
Right.

348
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,320
The fourth word.

349
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,720
You.

350
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,440
I'm so cold.

351
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
I'm so cold.

352
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,520
On my hands.

353
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,040
Getting a lot of...

354
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,840
I give up.

355
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,960
Let me say something off-topic.

356
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,760
We really tried hard.

357
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm about to cry.

358
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm going to cry.

359
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,040
What are we even doing?

360
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,400
Try a different way.

361
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Change the approach.

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,960
Switch it up.

363
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,560
Dad.

364
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,040
Dad.

365
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
Dad.

366
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
Dad's...

367
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Dad's partner.

368
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,520
Mom.

369
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:04,760
Right.

370
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
Mom.

371
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,200
Mom outside the window.

372
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
Outside the window.

373
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
The sparrow outside the window.

374
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay.

375
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,240
Got it.

376
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,080
What song is this?

377
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,240
It's by Jay Chou.

378
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,400
"Common Jasmine Orange."

379
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,600
How many minutes?

380
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,880
Check the time.

381
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,120
Twenty-one minutes.

382
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
This game should've taken five minutes.

383
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,240
But we've played for twenty-one minutes.

384
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,600
Don't be so sure.

385
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,920
When it's your turn,

386
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,880
it might not be easy.

387
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,600
Come on, let's try, bro.

388
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,600
If we take more than fifteen minutes, we lose.

389
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,160
Bro.

390
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
Don't do that.

391
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,360
No, just kidding.

392
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,440
Don't be like that.

393
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
Just joking.

394
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,800
Only Jin Jing is still clear-headed.

395
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
It's a popular song.

396
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,640
Second character.

397
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
Second character.

398
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,240
Me and...

399
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,560
You.

400
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,000
You.

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,400
You.

402
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,600
Yes.

403
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,280
Third character.

404
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,240
There are lots of people on the street.

405
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,560
You need to tell them...

406
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,240
Move aside.

407
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,840
You let...

408
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
Fourth character.

409
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,920
Let me...

410
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,920
Correct.

411
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,640
Fifth and sixth characters.

412
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,280
Look around.

413
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,800
What's another word for "look around"?

414
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,920
You let me...

415
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,520
Take a look.

416
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Not one...

417
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:47,920
No.

418
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,800
You let me see.

419
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,680
No, two characters repeat.

420
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,400
Pack up.

421
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,240
Why are we packing up?

422
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,480
What's this?

423
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,720
Stab.

424
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,240
A noun.

425
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,080
Noun.

426
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,880
Sword.

427
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
Yes.

428
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
My heart wants you to see.

429
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,720
Love wants you to hear.

430
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,680
No.

431
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
The previous words are correct.

432
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,320
The last word is important.

433
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,600
If you say it, it's revealed.

434
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,120
A flower.

435
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,720
Flower.

436
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800
A flower.

437
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,040
When it dies, it's...

438
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,240
Withered.

439
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,080
Withered.

440
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Change again.

441
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,320
No water.

442
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,880
Dry.

443
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,560
Yes.

444
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,720
Dried up.

445
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,840
Correct.

446
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,120
I've never heard this one.

447
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,560
This one is totally...

448
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,680
They probably haven't heard it either.

449
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,520
Xingxu definitely has heard it.

450
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
That's hard to say.

451
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,560
This is tough.

452
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,480
Alright.

453
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
The first character

454
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,360
The first character

455
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,680
The first character

456
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,960
In the sky

457
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,000
Flow

458
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,880
Rain falls

459
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,640
Correct

460
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,440
Rain

461
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,880
Rain

462
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,320
Rain

463
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,920
Rain

464
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,080
The second character

465
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,720
People from Liaoning speaking Cantonese sounds the same

466
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,120
The second character

467
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The second character

468
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,440
The second character

469
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,600
Bite

470
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,200
No

471
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,720
Eat

472
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
Mushroom

473
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,480
Mushroom

474
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,960
Mushroom

475
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
So fragrant and sweet

476
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,680
Fruit

477
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,200
If

478
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,720
If

479
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
If there's time

480
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,840
Correct

481
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,160
Next

482
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
My antonym

483
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,600
You

484
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,320
If you have time

485
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,080
You

486
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,640
Will you

487
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,360
Yes, yes, yes

488
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
Will you

489
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,960
You will

490
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,280
Yes

491
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,800
If you have time, will you

492
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Love me?

493
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,240
No

494
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
This isn't something you do in your spare time

495
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,640
Okay

496
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,880
The antonym of "go"

497
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,400
Come

498
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,920
If

499
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,160
Will you come?

500
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,920
If you have time

501
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,400
Will you come to my place?

502
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,160
No

503
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,240
Confessing here, huh

504
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,040
Come

505
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,440
You will come

506
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,200
You will come

507
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
You will come

508
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,440
See me?

509
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,920
No

510
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,600
See

511
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,640
"See" is correct

512
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,280
Impressive

513
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,160
I just said Xingxu would do it

514
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,560
Dog

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,440
Dog

516
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,160
Dog

517
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,640
He also keeps other pets

518
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,040
Cat

519
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,360
Cat

520
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,080
Correct

521
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,920
It's one that barks

522
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,200
Correct

523
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Impressive

524
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,000
No, this is from Xingxu's playlist, right?

525
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,560
Next

526
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,360
Come

527
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,480
Come

528
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
One

529
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,000
One, two, three, four, five

530
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Four or five characters

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,160
Four or five characters

532
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
What do sheep eat?

533
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,360
Grass

534
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,480
Such a big area

535
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,080
Grassland

536
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,800
Correct

537
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,520
Four or five

538
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,360
Seven

539
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,000
Seven or eight

540
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,760
Grassland

541
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
So big

542
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,240
Correct

543
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,520
That song

544
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,440
Singer

545
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,960
Singer

546
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,440
Fei Yuqing

547
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,800
Correct

548
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,440
I'm so desperate, why?

549
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,800
Calm down

550
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,880
The second character

551
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,720
The second character

552
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,480
The second character

553
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,320
The second character

554
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,120
The fourth character

555
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,720
Doing it like this

556
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,240
The third character

557
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,160
Another way to say "afternoon"

558
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,080
Night

559
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,400
Impressive

560
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,600
It didn't go over fifteen minutes, right?

561
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,200
Twelve minutes and eleven seconds

562
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,920
That's strong

563
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,840
Awesome

564
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,280
But honestly

565
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
The accents of us three from Northeast China

566
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,080
are exactly the same

567
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,480
That's got real flavor

568
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,640
Everything you just heard

569
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,840
Their Cantonese

570
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,000
is exactly the same as yours

571
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,480
No way

572
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,600
Am I also Tang Bohu?

573
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Tang Bohu

574
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
The second character

575
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,160
Let me say something

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,720
They don't have Lin Yi over there

577
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,000
I think it's a bit unfair

578
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,400
I have an idea

579
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
Lin Yi speaks

580
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,680
Our two teams guess each other

581
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
Whichever team takes less time

582
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,680
wins

583
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,320
Bro

584
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,720
You can't "humiliate" me like this

585
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,600
No

586
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,760
It's not to "humiliate" you

587
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,880
I want those four to experience it

588
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm the captain

589
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,720
I have dignity too

590
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,320
Boss

591
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,040
Please, start your performance

592
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
It's showtime

593
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,040
It's not about the team

594
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,240
Exactly

595
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,040
Confuse them

596
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,520
Drag them to thirty minutes

597
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,320
Then we win

598
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,520
Now I'm the director

599
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,400
You're not

600
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
You're the king

601
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,960
You're the king

602
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
You're the light

603
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,840
You're the only legend

604
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,200
I only love you

605
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
You're my superstar

606
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,800
What do you want me to do?

607
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,880
Go and drag them to thirty minutes

608
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
Thirty minutes

609
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,440
How do I drag it to thirty minutes?

610
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Just do your usual

611
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,920
Lin Yi

612
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,720
It's not about you

613
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,320
It's their problem

614
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,760
Watch how we guess you

615
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,480
Alright?

616
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,520
It's definitely not your fault

617
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,280
So touching

618
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,800
Three people from Liaoning

619
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,840
Guessing together

620
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,720
It's easy to guess

621
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,360
Let's go, everyone

622
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,240
Let me prove myself

623
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,680
Come on, bro, let's do this

624
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,480
Let's prove it's them who can't do it

625
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
It's not Lin Yi's fault

626
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes

627
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,800
We need to prove Lin Yi is fine

628
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,240
No problem

629
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,800
What's the first character?

630
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,080
You're not here as an undercover, are you?

631
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,800
Let me think for a moment

632
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,720
I suggest you think less

633
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,360
So hot

634
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,120
So hot

635
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,080
The opposite of hot

636
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,280
Cold

637
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,000
Cold

638
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,520
Cold wind blows

639
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Cold together

640
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,080
Cold together

641
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,120
Cold together

642
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,800
Cold frost

643
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,960
The first two characters

644
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,080
The first two characters

645
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,000
The first two characters

646
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,520
A bit stunned

647
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,520
Together

648
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Cold icy rain

649
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,720
Yes

650
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,600
Randomly slapping

651
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,480
Wait a moment

652
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,840
Is it over?

653
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,040
Take a break.

654
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,160
You have one more chance to speak.

655
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,000
Leizi.

656
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,880
You’ve come all the way here?

657
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,720
Now you can see it, right?

658
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,000
He can't talk anymore.

659
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
He’s already seen it.

660
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,440
No more talking.

661
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,800
What's the second character?

662
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,320
The second sentence.

663
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,360
The second sentence.

664
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
Now it’s

665
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,640
Now it’s

666
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,720
Now it’s winter.

667
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,560
Now it’s winter.

668
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
Winter.

669
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Inside the room.

670
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
I walk into the room.

671
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,160
Inside, it suddenly feels so

672
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,040
warm.

673
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,440
Warm.

674
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,880
Warm.

675
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,280
Mixed with the cold rain.

676
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,840
No, that's not right.

677
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,720
Blended together.

678
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,440
No, that's not it.

679
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,960
The last one.

680
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,000
Now.

681
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,280
Now.

682
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,880
Now.

683
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,920
I want to

684
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,040
bus.

685
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,640
bus.

686
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,720
insert coins.

687
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,040
insert.

688
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,480
money.

689
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,920
Right.

690
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,760
Once.

691
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,200
Once.

692
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,440
How much each time?

693
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
One yuan per ride.

694
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,040
Once.

695
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
Once.

696
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,200
One what?

697
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,640
One yuan.

698
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,240
One wen.

699
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
One kuai.

700
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,280
One kuai.

701
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,200
One kuai.

702
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,760
Okay.

703
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,200
We can.

704
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,760
That’s fine, right?

705
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,840
Awesome.

706
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,560
How much time do we have?

707
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,600
Five minutes.

708
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,000
Lin Yi.

709
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,680
Lin Yi.

710
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,320
You’re the best.

711
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,280
Come on.

712
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
It’s really not your fault.

713
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,640
It’s their problem.

714
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,080
Bro, if you say that again,

715
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,320
I won’t be able to go home.

716
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,640
I support you.

717
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,840
Support you.

718
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,480
I support you.

719
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,160
No problem.

720
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,480
Why do I feel both like laughing and crying?

721
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
Someone.

722
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,680
I want to laugh but can’t.

723
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,160
I want to cry but can’t.

724
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,720
What is this?

725
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,080
He said

726
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Keyword.

727
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,400
Keyword.

728
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,520
Don’t translate for him.

729
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
He’s on the other team.

730
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,880
Their own people can’t understand.

731
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,040
See, we’re even helping him.

732
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,360
Me.

733
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,920
Me.

734
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
My synonym.

735
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,440
My what?

736
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,280
Give or not?

737
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,240
I’ll give it to him.

738
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,040
What do I do for you?

739
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:03,840
Lin Yi

740
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,280
Lin Yi

741
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,040

742
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,080
Yi

743
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,560
Yi

744
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,320
I, Yi

745
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
I, Yi

746
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,480
Always in your heart

747
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
Never far away

748
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,840
Wait a moment

749
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Five minutes have passed

750
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,040
I, Yi

751
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,840
Third character

752
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,080

753
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,800

754
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
I always

755
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,400
I always

756
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,880
Fourth character

757
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm a rapper

758
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,480
Say something, Brother He

759
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
Why are you stuck?

760
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,080
I'm stuck

761
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,480
You go

762
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,800
I really can't understand

763
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm a rapper

764
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm a rapper

765
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,560
In my songs

766
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,040
Loan shark

767
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,360
Can't borrow from loan sharks

768
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
Can understand

769
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,840
Listen slowly

770
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
Mouth

771
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,080

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,000
Catchphrase

773
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
My catchphrase

774
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,520
I've always had

775
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,520
I've always had

00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,120
Right

777
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,000
Fifth character

778
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,960
Double

779
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,240

00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,760
I, Yi

806
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,880
I've always had double "yin"

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,639
Rainy and cloudy

808
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,440
Yes

809
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,960
I'll say one more word and you'll get it

810
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,239
Got it

811
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Chicken, chicken

812
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,760

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,520

814
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,600

817
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,520
Chicken leg

818
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,560
Chicken leg is tasty

Chicken wings

00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,600
That's right, isn't it?

826
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,240
Yes.

827
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,760
Nine minutes and forty-nine seconds.

828
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,880
Congratulations.

829
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,000
That's too abstract.

830
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,520
No.

831
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,040
Double.

832
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,920
Why doesn't he just say the opposite of single?

833
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,480
He wants to say he's a rapper.

834
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Two "again"s combined.

835
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,800
Who can understand this?

836
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Where's the "again"?

837
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Where's the "again" here?

838
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,120
Again, again, double.

839
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,040
Two "again"s, again and again.

840
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,040
But honestly,

841
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,600
The scariest part is,

842
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
As Brother keeps going,

843
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Brother, as you talk more and more,

844
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,040
I gradually

845
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,720
started to understand.

846
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
We already know

847
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,800
how Lin Yi pronounces "two".

848
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Let's say it together: one, two, three.

849
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,040
Two.

850
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
And me.

851
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Me.

852
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,000
Isn't it me?

853
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,200
Me.

854
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,760
Me.

855
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,240
Me.

856
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,640
Me.

857
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,360
No "n".

858
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,280
Me.

859
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,280
Is your Cantonese good?

860
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,680
Very good.

861
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,680
Everyone,

862
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,840
Let's congratulate this team.

863
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,160
They get to head out first for free time.

864
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,520
I have to say thank you.

865
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,280
Let's go together.

866
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,800
Let's go.

867
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,760
I want to be in this swimming pool.

868
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,680
What do you want to buy, Jing?

869
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,800
Just going to stroll around the Gothic Quarter.

870
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,080
Just browsing, walking around.

871
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,440
Let's head out now.

872
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,880
Ning.

873
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,400
We've pretty much finished exploring here.

874
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
Let's find somewhere else to check out.

875
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,840
Alright, let's find where to catch a ride first.

876
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,800
Look.

877
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,600
Found a car, choose.

878
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,400
So we can get a car now, right?

879
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,480
Yeah, let's go this way.

880
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,840
Let's go.

881
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,880
Alright, let's move.

882
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
Look, it's so beautiful.

883
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,640
There's even a diving platform.

884
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,720
Yeah, it's gorgeous, guys.

885
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,640
Kids might like to go shopping.

886
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,600
Or just take a walk.

887
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,720
To the Gothic Quarter.

888
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
Stroll around the old city.

889
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,160
Everyone has different interests.

890
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,560
Their own preferences.

891
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,880
Now I really just enjoy some peace and quiet.

892
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,720
Staying in one place.

893
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,120
Slowing down the pace.

894
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,280
Experiencing things calmly.

895
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,680
This sun-filled afternoon.

896
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
It's amazing.

897
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,640
This is the best kind of trip.

898
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,440
Hello.

899
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,080
Is my connection lagging?

900
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,520
No, it's fine.

901
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,080
He is livestreaming.

902
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,360
Is he at the guesthouse?

903
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,200
For himself.

904
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,640
He set up such a nice segment.

905
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,880
He's streaming now.

906
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,400
Why don't we all join his livestream?

907
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,200
How do we connect?

908
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,760
Top left corner.

909
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,800
You request to join.

910
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,720
He ignored you.

911
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,000
Naiwen.

912
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,480
Wants to connect with you.

913
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,520
Livestream hotline.

914
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,080
No.

915
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,760
Because his connection lags a lot.

916
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,720
It'll affect my data.

917
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
What did I just hear?

918
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,720
What did I just hear?

919
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,680
Jump, go diving.

920
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,080
If Naiwen gives me a gift,

921
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
I'll jump.

922
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,320
Send one.

923
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,960
So you mean,

924
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,000
He sent it.

925
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,040
Naiwen sent a sports car.

926
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,800
Are you willing to jump?

927
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
Alright, I'll jump for you.

928
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,440
Come on.

929
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,320
That was an ugly jump.

930
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,560
Chen He, give me my gift back.

931
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,400
When I leave this board,

932
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
You can turn me into a special effect.

933
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,240
Spin in place for three seconds.

934
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,000
Speed up ten times for three seconds.

935
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,120
Then suddenly stop.

936
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,200
Turn into a straight line.

937
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,280
Like a needle dropping into water.

938
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,840
Then we cut to the Olympic stadium.

939
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,160
The shot where everyone cheers, okay?

940
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,280
Speed up ten times in place.

941
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,120
Spin.

942
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,360
Then suddenly stop.

943
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,800
Like a needle dropping into water.

944
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,920
It's so beautiful here.

945
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,600
Every step in the Gothic Quarter is a view.

946
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,200
Really.

947
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,160
We're here.

948
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,720
The Gothic Quarter is the oldest part of Barcelona.

949
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,680
It's also the most popular area for tourists.

950
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,640
It's the heart of Barcelona.

951
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,080
The Gothic Quarter is the core of the old city.

952
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,360
It was originally a Roman fortress village.

953
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,720
It's named for its many Gothic buildings.

954
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,600
That's how it got its name.

955
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,200
Ice cream.

956
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,080
Which flavor are you having?

957
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,200
Let me check.

958
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,560
Hello.

959
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,000
Do you have caramel here?

960
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,560
No vanilla, I want lemon.

961
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,000
Thank you.

962
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,760
Thanks a lot.

963
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,800
This is delicious.

964
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,320
How is it?

965
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,080
How does it taste?

966
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,680
Tasty.

967
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,240
Cool.

968
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,080
Try the lemon one.

969
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,320
The lemon is really good.

970
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,200
You have great taste.

971
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,680
Yeah.

972
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Want some ice cream?

973
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,400
Sure, I want some.

974
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,160
I'll do it.

975
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,920
Can you buy it for me?

976
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,440
Here's the money.

977
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,240
Which flavor do you want?

978
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,880
Chocolate.

979
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,760
I'm joining in, right guys?

980
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,800
She's using that speaker.

981
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,080
That's the same speaker I used back then.

982
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Exactly the same.

983
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,080
Thank you.

984
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,440
Thanks, Brother Naiwen.

985
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,120
Thanks.

986
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,080
It's so big.

987
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Why did you give me this one?

988
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,600
Because I care about you.

989
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,120
Thanks, bro.

990
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,480
This is awesome.

991
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,560
I can't finish this, just take a bite.

992
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,360
Everyone, tune in for the live stream.

993
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,720
Lei Lei's top picks.

994
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,560
Carefully selected products.

995
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,640
Cheesecake.

996
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,840
If it's out of five points,

997
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,880
with full stars,

998
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,520
I'd give it 3.35 stars.

999
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,440
Second place.

1000
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,480
Try it.

1001
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,360
This one is unbeatable.

1002
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,400
Current ranking.

1003
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,880
This gets 4.2 points.

1004
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,000
Lei Lei's top picks.

1005
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,360
See you next time.

1006
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,200
Pack them all up.

1007
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,640
Caramel melts into colorful ice cream.

1008
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,320
He sings a line, we sing along.

1009
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:43,720
Sure.

1010
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,600
Okay.

1011
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,040
Caramel melts into colorful ice cream.

1012
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,520
Roman Avenue is closed today.

1013
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,520
Caramel melts into colorful ice cream.

1014
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,840
Off key.

1015
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,760
That's your tune?

1016
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,400
That's how you sing it?

1017
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,400
Okay.

1018
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,040
Alright.

1019
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:10,200
Clouds fall into the coffee cup.

1020
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,360
Ripples swirl in the wine glass.

1021
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,240
Clouds fall into the coffee cup.

1022
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,520
Ripples swirl in the wine bottle.

1023
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,440
It's all my genuine happiness.

1024
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,280
And my feelings are real.

1025
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,280
Sing it normally.

1026
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,080
The world is super interesting.

1027
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,040
Life's wrinkles hide sweetness.

1028
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,120
The world is so fascinating.

1029
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,840
Time's scars hide secrets.

1030
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,640
The world is super interesting.

1031
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,680
I want to bungee jump at the edge of the universe.

1032
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,920
The world is so fascinating.

1033
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,640
I want to see prehistoric civilizations under the sea.

1034
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,520
Let's end this farce.

1035
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,200
Are you guys doing performance art or what?

1036
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,080
What are you doing?

1037
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,200
You're not live streaming, are you?

1038
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,280
I am streaming.

1039
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:28,760
Really?

1040
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,480
Yes.

1041
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,080
Watch what you say and do.

1042
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,200
I'm live streaming, guys.

1043
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,640
Sorry.

1044
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,000
Let's go, hurry.

1045
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,840
Brother Ning is really streaming.

1046
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,360
So our performance art just now

1047
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,080
probably wasn't recorded, right?

1048
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,560
When he arrived,

1049
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,960
we were already singing properly.

1050
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,760
But singing properly is also kind of performance art.

1051
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,520
When we were singing seriously,

1052
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,280
they asked if we were doing performance art.

1053
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,320
I almost got attacked by a pigeon just now.

1054
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,960
I saw it.

1055
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,440
I think I can do it.

1056
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,800
Can you take a photo for me later?

1057
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,440
I'll stand in front of the Kiss Wall,

1058
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
and send it to Chen He.

1059
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,320
Sure.

1060
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,000
One, two, three.

1061
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,080
Looks great.

1062
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,360
This one.

1063
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,920
This bull terrier.

1064
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,240
Is this a bull terrier?

1065
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,880
It's so fierce.

1066
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,360
There's a performance here.

1067
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,800
Let me show you the performance.

1068
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,640
Let's head back.

1069
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,440
Let's go, let's get in the car.

1070
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,600
Have you had dinner?

1071
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,080
Good night.

1072
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,800
Love you too.

1073
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,760
Xingxu.

1074
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,440
Look at these foreign guys.

1075
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,600
They're soaked all over.

1076
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,120
Probably out of energy.

1077
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,720
Didn't we bring some Pulse?

1078
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,880
Let's help him.

1079
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,800
It's your turn.

1080
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,440
Give him this Pulse.

1081
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,360
I have to go alone?

1082
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,960
Yeah.

1083
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,680
Along the way,

1084
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,280
your introvert training should be almost done, right?

1085
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,680
Go ahead, this guy is your final test.

1086
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,520
Hi, bro.

1087
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,320
You look tired.

1088
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,040
Are you okay?

1089
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,320
Barcelona is so hot.

1090
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,960
I can barely walk.

1091
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,280
I'm exhausted and really thirsty.

1092
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,160
You can try Pulse.

1093
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,880
It can help you.

1094
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,560
Pulse.

1095
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:02,800
Yeah.

1096
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,840
Yes, Pulse will

1097
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,880
help you recover.

1098
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,960
Just like

1099
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,160
this broken English.

1100
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,240
How do you feel?

1101
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,440
Wow, amazing!

1102
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,960
Really?

1103
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,440
Refreshing and thirst-quenching.

1104
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,880
I really feel "recharged by Pulse."

1105
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,080
Let's take a photo together.

1106
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,800
Look at me, let's do this.

1107
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,680
One, two.

1108
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,440
This pose screams "recharged by Pulse."

1109
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,320
Recharged by Pulse.

1110
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,800
This is the observatory.

1111
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,920
This looks amazing.

1112
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,840
The Fabra Observatory is located

1113
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,600
on the slopes of Tibidabo Mountain in Barcelona.

1114
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,200
It's one of the oldest

1115
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,600
and still operating observatories in the world.

1116
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,240
It overlooks the whole city and the Mediterranean.

1117
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,320
The view is absolutely stunning.

1118
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,720
Let's go.

1119
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,320
Let's go inside and have a look.

1120
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,480
Okay.

1121
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,080
So beautiful.

1122
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,480
Barcelona really is

1123
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,640
a beautiful city.

1124
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,120
Wen, take a photo with this background.

1125
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,400
Sister Jin.

1126
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,200
Come on.

1127
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,960
Let's shoot a video.

1128
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,880
Get ready.

1129
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,680
Go, action.

1130
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,080
Okay

1131
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,840
Karaoke

1132
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,800
Give me the microphone

1133
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,640
Life always has its ups and downs

1134
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,320
But we have to stay strong

1135
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,280
We've cried and laughed

1136
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,760
At least you still have me

1137
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,280
Come on

1138
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,560
Wider than the earth

1139
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:13,440
We’ll definitely remember those years

1140
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,720
No reverb here

1141
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,960
So happy

1142
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,800
Singing karaoke in Barcelona

1143
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,400
That's something

1144
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,880
Today is our

1145
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,120
last dinner in Spain

1146
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,560
We prepared some Chinese food for everyone

1147
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,840
Guobaorou

1148
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,360
Guobaorou

1149
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Feels like home

1150
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,800
Dumplings

1151
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,640
Boiled dumplings

1152
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,080
Feels like I’m in Harbin

1153
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,160
Last time in Italy we cried so much

1154
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,480
How much will we cry in Spain this time?

1155
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,640
The most emotional person isn’t here

1156
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,080
Shark

1157
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,200
Kissing a shark

1158
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,880
So, this afternoon

1159
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,040
How’s everyone doing, folks?

1160
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,280
We were at Park Güell

1161
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,360
We specially visited Gaudí’s house

1162
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,720
Yes, inside that park

1163
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,880
As soon as we entered

1164
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,560
He gave all his inspiration

1165
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,440
to Spain

1166
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,880
His house was nothing special

1167
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,840
There was nothing there

1168
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,040
Just a small single bed

1169
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,560
Amazing

1170
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,960
We’re in Barcelona

1171
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,200
The whole trip

1172
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,080
was wonderful, I think

1173
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,960
No matter how we split up or where we go

1174
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,080
It’s always super fun

1175
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,160
And definitely super fresh

1176
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,720
Are you here to advertise or what?

1177
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,400
Of course

1178
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,720
You’re the slogan guy, bro

1179
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,400
I didn’t shout

1180
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,760
Our show really brought out Brother Naiwen’s

1181
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,280
What do you call this

1182
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,240
Like letting loose back in school

1183
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,600
He’s getting crazier now

1184
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,720
That’s true

1185
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,760
At the start of this year

1186
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,600
I had just met Brother Naiwen

1187
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
At the beginning of the year

1188
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,240
Back then

1189
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,920
Talking to him about variety shows

1190
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,400
He said

1191
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,280
Chen He

1192
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
I really love watching your variety shows

1193
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:54,760
I like them

1194
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,440
I said, you join, I won’t

1195
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,240
I’m an actor

1196
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,200
Maybe I can’t do it

1197
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,280
Bro, trust me, just come

1198
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,720
He, stop persuading me

1199
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,680
Now

1200
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,360
"Duke"

1201
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,360
I’m the "Duke"

1202
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,360
He just mentioned Brother Naiwen

1203
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,560
He’s let loose

1204
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,680
So next, we can

1205
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,760
get even more hyped

1206
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,840
Our previous music video

1207
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,440
didn’t have a group dance scene

1208
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,760
Let’s use our theme song

1209
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,560
and choreograph a group dance

1210
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,000
as the closing ceremony for our Spain stop

1211
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,080
the finale

1212
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,640
We can even record it right now, let’s go

1213
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,680
I think

1214
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,840
I think we want this short video

1215
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,520
as a short video

1216
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,240
to go viral in a fun way

1217
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,880
So let’s make it a catchy dance

1218
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,720
Like this

1219
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,800
Just like this

1220
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,680
Dancing is what I’m worst at

1221
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,320
They're both here.

1222
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,000
Alright.

1223
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,120
Think of one more, you're almost done.

1224
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
Let's split into groups first, okay?

1225
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,120
Sure.

1226
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,480
Come on.

1227
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,360
I'll team up with He.

1228
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,000
I'll team up with He.

1229
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,400
Alright, then I'll team up with Jin Jing and Brother Naiwen.

1230
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,920
Okay.

1231
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,680
I'll be with Sister Wang.

1232
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,360
Four groups, that's fine.

1233
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,920
Each person gets eight beats.

1234
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,440
Alright.

1235
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,360
So we just come up with our own moves.

1236
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,440
Just think of one.

1237
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,640
The world is super fun.

1238
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Hands go like this.

1239
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,720
Up.

1240
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,280
Shy.

1241
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,240
Alright, that's good.

1242
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,520
Or we could just go wild.

1243
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,600
No, bro.

1244
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,680
Are you worried about your idol image?

1245
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:46,960
He.

1246
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,240
He.

1247
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,920
I'm not.

1248
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,880
That day, He showed me the old photo with

1249
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,640
Deng Chao and the others.

1250
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,520
He showed me a photo from Running Man.

1251
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,880
Bro, I'm an idol type.

1252
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,920
Gotta keep up the idol image.

1253
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,120
Even at times like this.

1254
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,880
Are we ready, guys?

1255
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,600
We're good.

1256
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,160
Alright, that's it then.

1257
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,680
Let's try it once.

1258
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,400
Come on, add some drama.

1259
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,400
Enter with some flair.

1260
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,800
So, for those waiting backstage,

1261
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,920
Just sway like this in the back.

1262
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:12,880
Add some rhythm.

1263
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,640
Don't just stand there.

1264
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,400
Otherwise, you'll just look like an extra standing around.

1265
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,000
Alright.

1266
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,200
Okay, fine.

1267
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,360
Come on, guys.

1268
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,000
Get ready.

1269
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,320
Three, two, one.

1270
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,520
Go!

1271
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,160
Brother Honglei.

1272
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,320
Retreat.

1273
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,280
Get ready to go in.

1274
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,880
Go, up.

1275
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,240
Facial expression.

1276
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,600
Get ready to go in.

1277
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,440
Finish the move.

1278
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,640
Go.

1279
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
Come on, one last time.

1280
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,000
Perfect.

1281
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,520
Definitely great.

1282
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,040
The world is super fun.

1283
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,280
So beautiful.

1284
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,200
So pretty.

1285
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:25,960
So beautiful.

1286
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,680
All from "Duke."

1287
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,880
With the night of Barcelona.

1288
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,240
Under the observatory's gaze.

1289
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,160
Let's have a drink together.

1290
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,480
Come on.

1291
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
Cheers!

1292
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,640
For us.

1293
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,560
Our newest and strongest friendship.

1294
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:47,840
Of course.

1295
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,040
Come on.

1296
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,920
Come on.

1297
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,560
Cheers!

1298
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,200
Cheers!

1299
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,880
Cheers!

1300
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,720
Cheers!

1301
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,080
Today

1302
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,320
is the final overseas stop of "Earth Super Fresh."

1303
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,960
It's the last stop.

1304
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,000
There's a saying in Spain

1305
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
that's well known.

1306
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,120
I want to share it with everyone.

1307
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,960
It's also a song by Coldplay.

1308
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,920
"Viva La Vida."

1309
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,040
Long live life.

1310
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,440
Long live life.

1311
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,040
So our crew

1312
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,200
also has a little gift

1313
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,800
for everyone.

1314
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,160
There's even a gift!

1315
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
This is awesome.

1316
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,800
This is great.

1317
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,600
It's a booklet of Gaudí's architectural designs.

1318
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,960
To help everyone keep

1319
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,080
some wonderful memories from Spain.

1320
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,840
This is all of Barcelona.

1321
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,760
It's so breathtaking.

1322
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,480
During our travels,

1323
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,040
we meet all kinds of people.

1324
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,160
Here in Barcelona,

1325
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,800
they are part of the scenery.

1326
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,600
Hello, friend.

1327
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,760
You have fans overseas.

1328
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,000
I hope everyone always keeps

1329
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
a childlike heart.

1330
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,320
I hope you find someone to be with you,

1331
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,280
someone quirky and adorable.

1332
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,360
In this small world,

1333
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,440
there are small dreams.

1334
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,160
Thank you, everyone.

1335
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,800
Wishing you happiness and joy.

1336
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,680
Mom, you're back.

1337
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,920
Mom, you're back.

1338
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,400
And there's one more here.

1339
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,040
We'll give it to Junjun.

1340
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
Thank you.

1341
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,480
Love it.

1342
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,920
Let's take a group photo at the end.

1343
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,720
To keep as a memory.

1344
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,360
Okay.

1345
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,160
Right now,

1346
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,160
viewers watching our show on Tencent Video

1347
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,680
are also joining in the live chat

1348
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,880
to take this big group photo together.

1349
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,800
Let's keep these wonderful memories of Barcelona.

1350
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,160
We can greet our online viewers.

1351
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,080
Let's interact a bit.

1352
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,360
Hello.

1353
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,880
Hello, online friends.

1354
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,960
Hello.

1355
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,240
Hello.

1356
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,520
Hi, everyone.

1357
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,400
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

1358
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,000
This journey comes to an end.

1359
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,120
See you in Xi'an.

1360
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,920
Earth Super Fresh.

1361
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,080
The world is right before our eyes.

1362
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,120
Long live life.

1363
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,560
Bet you didn't expect this.

1364
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,160
I'm back again.

1365
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,200
I'm home.

1366
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,200
I'm seriously dying of laughter.

1367
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,080
Everyone needs to perform this with a look back, one by one.

1368
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,960
Act out this line in dialect.

1369
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,840
I think Lin Yi is the best at this.

1370
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,400
He's the only language master I admit defeat to.

1371
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:01,960
Hey.

1372
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,920
I'll take care of you.

1373
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,960
Take care of yourself first.

1374
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,560
Dummy.

1375
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,000
Dummy.

1376
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,880
That was heartfelt.

1377
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,160
But I just want to laugh.

1378
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,360
Shaanxi dialect line relay.

1379
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,000
I've been with you for three months now.

1380
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,800
I like fresh romance.

1381
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,920
Are you hungry today?

1382
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,080
Are you hungry?

1383
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,400
I want to defeat the Magic Fairy Queen.

1384
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,440
Become the strongest magic fairy.

1385
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,840
I want to defeat the Dark God.

1386
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,920
Become the queen goddess of Magic Castle.

1387
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,680
I want to be in this Magic Castle.

1388
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,160
The most powerful little woman.

1389
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,240
Balala Little Magic Fairy, transform!

1390
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,960
Don't add more dishes.

1391
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,440
It's good as long as Junjun is here.

1392
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,040
Take photos anytime, anywhere.

1393
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,880
Let's line up.

1394
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,560
One line per person.

1395
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,760
Then we'll sing together for the chorus.

1396
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,480
In the hearts of Xi'an people,

1397
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,720
this is a song for Xi'an people.

1398
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,440
There are two undercover agents among you nine.

1399
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,320
What are you doing? What do you want?

1400
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,520
Ning.

1401
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,280
What are you doing?

1402
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,240
Sorry, I made a move.

1403
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,680
What?

1404
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,760
I actually saw it with my own eyes.

1405
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,560
Bang the gong.

1406
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,720
Don't bang it.

1407
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,160
Bang the gong.

1408
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,800
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

1409
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,000
It's already stewing.

1410
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,520
Junjun's knife skills are impressive.

1411
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,400
The aroma is overwhelming.

1412
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,840
You look like you're not wearing clothes.

1413
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,240
Wearing an apron to fry steak.

1414
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,200
You wore sleeveless on purpose today, right?

1415
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
No.

1416
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,440
You knew we'd be frying steak today.

1417
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,560
No.

1418
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
It's all about emotional value.

1419
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,560
The first glass is for myself.

1420
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,840
First time crying on the show.

1421
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,120
No problem, I'll drink.

1422
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,480
I feel like I'm home anyway.

1423
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,880
I'm truly happy from the bottom of my heart.

1424
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,840
I did it.

1425
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,200
Neither respecting the old nor loving the young.

1426
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,040
I think the biggest gain from this show is

1427
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,200
Actually, He told me this.

1428
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,320
It's being able to bring happiness to others.

1429
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,120
That's truly a great thing.

1430
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,880
Brother.

1431
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,160
Why are you crying?

1432
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,200
Earth Super Fresh.

1433
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,160
The world is right in front of us.

1434
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:58,800
Next up,

1435
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,880
we'll do a Cantonese-related challenge.

1436
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,440
Your Cantonese is blowing up now.

1437
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,200
Are we still playing?

1438
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,720
We're basically overpowered here.

1439
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,960
What's this?

1440
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,000
It's not moving mountains.

1441
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,680
You're not on this channel anymore.

1442
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,440
This is impressive.

1443
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,240
Look at how they grilled it.

1444
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,480
Everyone, get ready to head out.

1445
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,720
Let's try to recreate this.

1446
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,080
Then call me once, let me hear.

1447
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,760
Yeah, I'll take a photo of you two.

1448
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:37,880
Okay.

1449
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,360
Corridor through time.
