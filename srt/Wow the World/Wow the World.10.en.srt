1
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Beyond the Great Wall

2
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,600
Connecting the world

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,560
The first stop of the members' overseas journey

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,240
is also located

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,160
on the golden necklace of 40 degrees north latitude

6
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,520
the Eternal City

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,200
Rome

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,080
This is the birthplace of the ancient Roman Empire

9
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,240
with a history spanning over two thousand years

10
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
It is called

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
the Eternal City

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
Rome

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
One city

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
half the history of European civilization

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,680
Goethe said

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,640
To see Rome is to see everything

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Rome is also known as

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
the world's largest

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
open-air historical museum

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,880
Hello, Rome

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,920
I remember before my father passed away

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,600
he said

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:51,960
Honglei

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,560
Take me to see Europe

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,560
I haven't been there yet

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,680
My dad was an old Marxist-Leninist

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
His nickname was Sun Marxist-Leninist

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,240
He was a philosophy teacher

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,120
I brought him here, in

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
in Rome, I remember

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,800
we stayed for about ten days

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,600
Dad cooked a meal

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,639
That was before he left

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
the last meal he made for us

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,560
We're here.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
This place is nice.

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
I like it.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
I need to add some music.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,480
We've arrived in Europe.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,080
Let's play some European classical music.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,960
We need some cultural enrichment.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,720
I was the first to arrive today.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Welcome, everyone.

44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,160
To my home in Italy.

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
Let me show you around.

46
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
Okay.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,840
Young master is home. Young master!

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,240
This is your bathhouse.

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,000
Is this where we cook?

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,600
Yes.

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,320
You're on their team too.

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
You're in charge of cooking.

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,000
I totally forgot about that.

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,920
When the first rays of morning sun

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,200
shine on this place,

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,840
I'll be here flipping pans, right?

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,680
The young masters will be swimming over there.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
And we'll be serving them tea and water.

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,760
The young masters...

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
It's been a long time since I've seen the young master smile like this.

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,040
Boss Liu.

62
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Go ahead and place the order.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
I'll just muddle along for a few more years.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Let's go.

65
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:15,960
Who?

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
Didi.

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm Didi.

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Still a little

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
socially anxious.

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,320
Hello.

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,840
Welcome.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
Hello, everyone.

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,160
Hello, Didi.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,960
You carry the bag for someone.

75
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,720
I'll hold this for you.

76
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,440
Great job.

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Thank you.

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,640
Let me introduce.

79
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,720
This is the young master's estate.

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Your estate.

81
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,320
Why is it assumed he's the young master?

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Not this one.

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
I thought you meant the young...

84
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,520
Which young master?

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,640
He looks like a young master.

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
But I look like the old master.

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,120
Is there a young person who can help?

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
Here, thanks for your hard work, bro.

89
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,200
Hello.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
Hello.

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,160
Good evening, Uncle Nai.

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm Didi.

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,680
Didi.

94
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,920
That's right.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,520
Hello.

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Where's Brother Honglei?

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,120
Brother Honglei went out.

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
He said he'll be back soon.

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
This is the backyard.

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,240
The sock washing area.

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,079
Are your little hands ready?

102
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,840
No.

103
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
I think that's a bit much.

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
But your work environment is pretty nice.

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
This is too much?

106
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
It's beautiful here, with mountains and rivers.

107
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,960
Let's check out the room.

108
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,320
Let's go.

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
Kitchen.

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Delicious food at home.

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,120
Just sit and enjoy.

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,040
Xiao Wang delivers instantly.

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,480
I even have to deliver it.

114
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,800
So you're doing food delivery?

115
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Really.

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,120
I don't just cook.

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,240
I also have to deliver.

118
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,840
Taking orders 24/7.

119
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,040
Twenty-four hours.

120
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,680
If you want noodles at night, I'll come down and cook for you.

121
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,840
Do you think they'd really let you do that?

122
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,200
Of course they would.

123
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Just wait and see.

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
They'll order every hour.

125
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
I won't even sleep tonight.

126
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,440
Go on.

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,040
Wait a minute.

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,520
Didi.

129
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Is it this Didi or that one?

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,720
You.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,560
It's you.

132
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:13,960
Me.

133
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
I want to say...

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,400
I think...

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
Old people just love to play tricks.

136
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,640
Myself

137
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,280
I've already made up for it myself.

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,200
You didn't join our game last round either.

139
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,120
Then you...

140
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,640
Me.

141
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,920
Me, washing socks...

142
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,080
Should I wash them for you?

143
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,160
You're too ruthless.

144
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
You really have no shame.

145
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
You only come up with bad ideas.

146
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,120
So bad.

147
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
Let's go check out the rooms.

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,800
This should be Naiwen's.

149
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,200
This one's mine.

150
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
Is it because of the socks?

151
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
I get it now.

152
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,280
I know why he...

153
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
...put me here.

154
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Why?

155
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,360
Because it's close to where you wash socks.

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
Because it's right there, isn't it?

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,120
Really.

158
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,800
Just go down and you're there.

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
Climb down and you can wash socks.

160
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
The young masters are bathing upstairs.

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,640
He's down below.

162
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Washing downstream.

163
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,040
You guys are so considerate.

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,360
That sly expression really looks like...

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,520
He Ge.

166
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,200
Whose is this?

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
It even made the teeth look white.

168
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Who is this?

169
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,320
There's more here.

170
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
This is my younger sister's.

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,320
There's another one inside.

172
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,800
This must belong to you two girls.

173
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
This is Didi's.

174
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
This one with beads, it's yours, right?

175
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,880
How is this even a string?

176
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
Why is it so small?

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
Sure, that's fine too.

178
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,000
So actually,

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
there's no room arranged for Xingxu, right?

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
Roma isn't here.

181
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,480
Roma's not here.

182
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,440
It's just the few of us.

183
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,320
What about my siblings?

184
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
They're already in

185
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Roma.

186
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,920
And in the group chat, I saw them

187
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,960
posting photos and stuff.

188
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm really so envious.

189
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,760
Already

190
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,920
I can hardly hide

191
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,960
how much I want to go out and have fun with them.

192
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,880
Even though I'm filming with the crew,

193
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
there's only one or two days left.

194
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,040
Right now, I am

195
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,760
at

196
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,800
Qiandao Lake

197
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm about to meet up with them

198
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Let's go

199
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
Whose is this?

200
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,160
This must be Honglei's

201
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,840
It's the sun

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
By the way, where's the security guy?

203
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,000
No one's taking care of our luggage

204
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,400
Yeah

205
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,080
to help move it

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,760
This security guy

207
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,640
Is he even safe himself, that's the question

208
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,640
Who is this?

209
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,720
What are you doing?

210
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,040
Showing off all morning

211
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm waiting for them

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,040
There's not a single room service staff

213
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
Let's deduct points for them, okay?

214
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,160
Where are the three of them?

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,040
Who?

216
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,880
Here is your work gift package.

217
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Please check and accept it.

218
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,760
Work gift package.

219
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,160
Captain.

220
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,040
What's this for?

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,440
Back when we were in Beijing,

222
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,240
Yeah.

223
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,840
You, me, and Yuwen.

224
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
We forgot all about these things.

225
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
They can't remember either.

226
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
Where are they?

227
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Where are the three of them?

228
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,760
They serve themselves.

229
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,200
Then what's this?

230
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,680
Can't remember this either?

231
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,760
What's this?

232
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,680
Security uniform.

233
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,880
He'll forget.

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,480
Keep dreaming.

235
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,200
These are pants.

236
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,280
They're pretty cool.

237
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,880
What's this one?

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,280
Underwear.

239
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,000
What kind of underwear?

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,679
This is...

241
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,000
Isn't this a chef's hat?

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
This is Yuwen's.

243
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,360
This is also Yuwen's.

244
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,360
Apron.

245
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
Why does she have so many?

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,960
This...

247
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
This is mine.

248
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,480
Socks.

249
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,440
Washing socks.

250
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Your special clothes for washing socks.

251
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Are you sure the socks here

252
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,400
have all been washed?

253
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
Good, that's great.

254
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
Let me see how you look wearing it.

255
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
This actually looks pretty cool.

256
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,520
This outfit is really trendy.

257
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
No, after putting this on,

258
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
it really looks like Chen He's style.

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah.

260
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
It's all jingly.

261
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,160
I think you should just go like this today.

262
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,000
Wear this and stroll down Roman Street.

263
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,920
You'll be famous in no time.

264
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,280
Isn't that a bit much?

265
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,840
You'll go viral.

266
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
This should be worn to Cannes or somewhere like that.

267
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,480
Yeah.

268
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,240
Yuning.

269
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Hello, boss.

270
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,840
What's going on?

271
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,800
Do you need anything?

272
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,520
No, I don't need anything.

273
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,080
What's this?

274
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,680
This is...

275
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,520
These are your socks.

276
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,200
Size 43 or 46, right?

277
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,440
We'll just pick these to wear.

278
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,560
Yeah.

279
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,280
Waiter.

280
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,720
Waiter.

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Why are you calling me a waiter?

282
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
Waiter, really?

283
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,560
You guys have no manners.

284
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
We've been awake for a long time.

285
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,080
A long time.

286
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,400
It's not time to start work yet.

287
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,280
It's not time yet.

288
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,560
There's still ten minutes, we'll be there soon.

289
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
No, you guys first...

290
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
Give us this (walkie-talkie) first.

291
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,600
Start working.

292
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,240
I need to find you guys, I have to...

293
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,280
Proud

294
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,560
Proud

295
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,280
Something to eat

296
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,280
I've been up in my room for a long time

297
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,880
There's nothing to eat at all

298
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,440
Wang Yuwen

299
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Eggs, bacon, Americano

300
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,920
Hurry up

301
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,520
Bacon, Americano

302
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,920
Captain

303
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
He just orders us around like this

304
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,760
What do you have there?

305
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,160
Morning

306
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,640
Hello, Didi

307
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Your clothes

308
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,040
Which one is my uniform?

309
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
The cook's kind, like this

310
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,040
There's a hat

311
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay

312
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,960
Americano, bacon

313
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,360
Who's talking?

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
Someone's just talking to themselves here

315
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,040
Wang Yuwen

316
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,880
No one is paying attention to him

317
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
Wang Yuwen

318
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
Eggs, bacon

319
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,040
He's so noisy

320
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,960
He's on the wrong channel

321
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,400
Turn off his channel

322
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
Wang Yuwen, I want an Americano

323
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,360
Gloves

324
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,560
These gloves should be mine

325
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,400
They're for washing vegetables

326
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,960
Do you think it's right to use these to wash socks?

327
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,600
Socks

328
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Can you be a bit more sincere?

329
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm going to keep wearing these socks until that day.

330
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,360
I'll try to make these socks stand up on their own.

331
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,680
These socks are already black.

332
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm going to look for my socks.

333
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,440
I quit.

334
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
I quit.

335
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,640
Still acting like this.

336
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Is that really necessary?

337
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,880
My feet actually smell nice.

338
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
Your socks are all black.

339
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
The bottoms have turned black.

340
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
That's so gross.

341
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,360
Whose is this?

342
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,800
Mine.

343
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,320
Captain.

344
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,880
Captain.

345
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,280
Aren't you all from the same company?

346
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,240
Take yours out.

347
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,640
I'll do it in a bit.

348
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,360
Okay, put them all here.

349
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,280
They're put away.

350
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,400
Whose socks are these?

351
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,240
Mine.

352
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Don't mix them up.

353
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,320
Yeah, don't mix them up.

354
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,240
Remember.

355
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,960
You have to check.

356
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,840
After washing, return them to the rooms.

357
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,720
I sort them by smell.

358
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,800
And your body odor.

359
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,280
I sort them by smell.

360
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,760
You're impressive.

361
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,520
You even have to sniff them.

362
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,000
Some are stinky, some are sour.

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,320
Don't mix them up when washing.

364
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,480
I'm telling you.

365
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,960
Seriously.

366
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
Look at the clients.

367
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,960
Now look at our own company.

368
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,160
I think we should just leave them here.

369
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,560
Bro, let's go to work.

370
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,200
Work.

371
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,960
Let's go.

372
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Come on, bro.

373
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,720
Our company's morning exercise is starting.

374
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,840
I don't think we can just let this go on.

375
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,920
Bullying the three of us.

376
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,360
You guys are the ones bullying me, okay?

377
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,880
What is all this stuff?

378
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,000
It's all from our own company.

379
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,640
Bro, I wore sandals yesterday.

380
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,360
Just so I could wear socks.

381
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,680
I specifically matched socks with sandals.

382
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
Where's the captain?

383
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
This is way too cool.

384
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,520
Just go up there.

385
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
Just impress them, that's it.

386
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,680
Hurry up.

387
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,760
Coming.

388
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,120
Why does it feel like a Doberman just showed up?

389
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,000
Bro looks a bit like a doorman today.

390
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,040
Is this envy, jealousy, and hate?

391
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,680
Yes.

392
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
Really envious.

393
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,280
Let them wear it later.

394
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,800
This outfit is hilarious.

395
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,560
Very cool.

396
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,120
Doesn't it look cool?

397
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,200
Is this how you give him a backhanded compliment?

398
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,160
What else can I do?

399
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,280
He's already dressed like this.

400
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,560
You should at least hype him up.

401
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,560
I think we need a competition system today.

402
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,480
We can also earn points.

403
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
If there’s no competition,

404
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,720
I’ll just lie down right now.

405
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,560
On your side,

406
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,360
except for the person with the lowest score,

407
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,040
the others have a chance

408
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,960
to move from the service post to become an owner.

409
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,520
Yes.

410
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,360
I don’t trust their scoring system at all.

411
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,040
No matter how well I do,

412
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
my score is still the lowest.

413
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,000
No way.

414
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,400
No, bro.

415
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,480
Don’t underestimate yourself like that.

416
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,400
As long as you wash it clean,

417
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,960
we definitely will

418
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
Bro, I wanted to vote for you.

419
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,680
Yeah.

420
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,120
So you can get promoted.

421
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,680
We’ll definitely help you get promoted.

422
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,760
Come on, do your best.

423
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Really?

424
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,960
You can do it.

425
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
Believe in yourself.

426
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,800
Yes.

427
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Then I’ll go wash now.

428
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,840
I’ll go wash the socks.

429
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,200
No need.

430
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,920
Not now.

431
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
Bro, the first thing

432
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,880
is we need to do exercises.

433
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,800
Because today we’re showing

434
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,920
the spirit of our sanitation department.

435
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,480
Alright?

436
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,360
Sanitation department.

437
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,240
We have to sweep the streets again, right?

438
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,120
Whatever you say, owner, you’re always right.

439
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,080
You're really something, bro.

440
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,360
Whatever you say is right.

441
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,280
Bro, you'll have a chance to get promoted.

442
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,160
No need.

443
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,720
No need.

444
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,920
No need to be so friendly.

445
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,240
Okay.

446
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
Okay.

447
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,360
Okay.

448
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,440
This is good.

449
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,040
Well done.

450
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,360
Whatever this owner says is right.

451
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,320
You were way ahead in that last part.

452
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:57,960
Yes.

453
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,600
Way ahead.

454
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:58,840
Good person.

455
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Thank you to this owner.

456
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,880
Why does it smell like socks?

457
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,400
Way ahead.

458
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,080
This isn't fair.

459
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Quick, search for that Northeast Shake for them.

460
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
This is good.

461
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,520
What?

462
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,640
Take a look.

463
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,160
What's wrong?

464
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,040
I want to watch this.

465
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,800
I want to watch this.

466
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm really impressed.

467
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,840
You take the gloves, I'll take the socks.

468
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,240
Come on, get ready.

469
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,480
Smile.

470
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,240
One, two, three, go.

471
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Double row of teeth.

472
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,720
Wave your hands like flowers.

473
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,960
The water from this sock

474
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,880
splashed onto my face.

475
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,920
Points should be deducted for this.

476
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,160
You splashed water onto our faces.

477
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,840
Deduct points.

478
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
It even got into my mouth.

479
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,640
Seriously.

480
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,520
Don't be disgusted by your own socks.

481
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
This isn't ours.

482
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,480
I think this part

483
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,960
Xiao Wang and our Sun Bao (An)

484
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,000
both did very well.

485
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,800
Bro, you're eliminated.

486
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,160
You're eliminated.

487
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,080
You splashed it on the client.

488
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,600
You splashed us with that yellow water.

489
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,120
I think in this case

490
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,840
deduct three points.

491
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,000
Second place loses two points.

492
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,560
Okay.

493
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,760
See, I said no matter how seriously I try,

494
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
they'll definitely deduct my points.

495
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Throwing the client's socks.

496
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,240
No.

497
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
These are our company's own socks.

498
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,560
They're all from our own company.

499
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,280
Give Nai-ge a chance.

500
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,360
Okay, thank you.

501
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,080
How about this?

502
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,400
Didi, you dance a bit.

503
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,680
We'll dance with you.

504
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,920
Sure.

505
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Didi, sing and dance.

506
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,440
We need a finishing pose.

507
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,960
Then all of us should do this.

508
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
If you say,

509
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,960
"Are you done dancing?"

510
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,680
Just like this.

511
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,800
The audience will think you didn't dance seriously.

512
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,960
You're just going through the motions.

513
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,720
Don't worry.

514
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,080
I'll do it really well.

515
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,560
Okay.

516
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
Bro, you also need to wink.

517
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
You have to wink.

518
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
You need to take it off like this.

519
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,960
And then like this.

520
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,119
Okay, that's great.

521
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,720
Really awesome.

522
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,920
What does "wink" mean?

523
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,720
It's when you blink one eye.

524
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,319
Right.

525
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,359
Come on.

526
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,000
Here we go.

527
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Look quickly.

528
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,280
Okay.

529
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
Like this, understand?

530
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
Come on, give me your phone.

531
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,320
I'll call Yixing.

532
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,720
I want to cook.

533
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,240
Naiwen.

534
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,800
The confidence we learned in the Central Academy of Drama's acting department.

535
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,840
Keep it up.

536
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,280
Yes.

537
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,240
Keep it up.

538
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,600
Come on.

539
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
No problem.

540
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,920
Get ready.

541
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,760
Line up.

542
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,000
For the honor of the Central Academy of Drama.

543
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,800
Five, six, seven, go!

544
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,440
Sister Wen.

545
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Okay.

546
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,600
Brother Honglei is out.

547
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,320
Breathe, blink.

548
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,760
Okay.

549
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,680
This is getting a bit scary from them.

550
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,760
Alright.

551
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,360
It's a little scary.

552
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,800
Okay.

553
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,520
After this show, I could debut.

554
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,800
Alright, let's get to work.

555
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'll go help you out.

556
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Okay.

557
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,880
The few of us,

558
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,440
Naiwen,

559
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,200
went to wash socks.

560
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,040
Went to the wishing pool to wash socks.

561
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,160
Give a higher score.

562
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,960
Give a higher score.

563
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,680
Alright.

564
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,920
This wish probably won't come true.

565
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,800
Wishing the residents good health.

566
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
This one can come true.

567
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,520
Alright.

568
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,080
Have fun and enjoy every day.

569
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,720
Okay.

570
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,480
And then we

571
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,120
Eat and drink well.

572
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,160
Okay.

573
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,600
Property management company.

574
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,320
Getting better and better.

575
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
Getting better and better.

576
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,000
Alright, let's go.

577
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,360
Okay.

578
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,520
Let's get a massage first.

579
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
Sure, let's soak for a bit.

580
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,400
Eggs.

581
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,320
I'll fry them for you.

582
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,880
Go ahead and fry them.

583
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,840
Olive oil.

584
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,520
Why am I the one serving?

585
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
Because you're a good person, bro.

586
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,640
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

587
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,520
Okay.

588
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,840
That actually makes sense when you put it that way.

589
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,680
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

590
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,560
Beautiful and kind-hearted, Chen He.

591
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,200
Come on, say something.

592
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,840
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

593
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,240
Chen He.

594
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,280
Make a vegetable salad for everyone.

595
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,200
Bro, let me do it.

596
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
It's fine.

597
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,960
Make an egg roll.

598
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,920
Okay.

599
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
Stir the bacon and fry it a bit.

600
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
Fry some sausage too, bro.

601
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Yuwen.

602
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,680
Let me tell you.

603
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,600
You might just

604
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,920
be done with this service today.

605
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,600
You're way ahead right now.

606
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Okay.

607
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
You're way ahead right now.

608
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
That's right.

609
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,640
The owner's socks.

610
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
are soaking.

611
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
How do I get them out?

612
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,320
Is there a stick?

613
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
I still have to fish out the socks.

614
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,800
I wonder why I'm even doing this.

615
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,600
Got it.

616
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
I just learned another move from Didi.

617
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,560
A finishing move.

618
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,680
Let me borrow it.

619
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,640
No, I won't.

620
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
Look at my eyes.

621
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,040
Bro, next time we can do some moves.

622
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,960
Like making a heart with our cheeks.

623
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,600
Or a bow-tie heart.

624
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,840
A bow-tie heart.

625
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,400
Where did he take my stick?

626
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,480
He used it to hang socks.

627
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,600
He took my stick.

628
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,440
It's really standing upright.

629
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,360
These are our captain's socks.

630
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Li Naiwen.

631
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Why are you using my stick for socks?

632
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
Give it back.

633
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,240
Hurry up and wash them.

634
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm telling you, only your socks are standing up.

635
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,920
Everyone else's socks are lying down.

636
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Alright, you get on with it.

637
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,000
Wenzi.

638
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm hungry.

639
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,400
Bro, how about having a bowl of salad first?

640
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,160
Let's have a bowl of salad first.

641
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,120
Throw it here?

642
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,240
Yeah, you can throw it.

643
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,200
Throw it again.

644
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
Let me use it again.

645
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,400
Bring it back to me.

646
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,720
I'll just use it for a bit.

647
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,960
Just for a bit.

648
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,680
Just for a bit.

649
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,000
Li Naiwen

650
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,680
Give it back to me

651
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,360
It's much better if you use your hands like this

652
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,400
Hands aren't afraid of water

653
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,520
Use your hands, like this

654
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,200
Right

655
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,520
Yes

656
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,080
That's really praiseworthy

657
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Are you okay?

658
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
How's the pressure?

659
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,200
Come and see

660
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Li Naiwen has "gone crazy"

661
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
Come and see

662
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,600
Here, let me get you some essential oil

663
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,680
Startled and lost what?

664
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,560
Guess the idiom

665
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,520
For example, what?

666
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,160
Right?

667
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,160
This is called

668
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,920
Passed what, didn't what?

669
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,960
Isn't that right?

670
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,680
This is called

671
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,320
The massage is over

672
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,080
Go take a shower

673
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,640
Okay

674
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,520
Is the water temperature okay?

675
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,320
Yes, it's fine.

676
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,760
Okay.

677
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm also in charge of scrubbing it.

678
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,920
Let me know when it's ready.

679
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,400
It's ready.

680
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,160
Okay.

681
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Let's have a

682
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
sunbath at our hotel.

683
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,360
Let it bask for a while.

684
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,600
Tell me when it's done basking.

685
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
Owner.

686
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,240
Owner Liu Yuning.

687
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,880
How is it?

688
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
It's good, serve the dish.

689
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,600
Is it okay?

690
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,320
So professional.

691
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
Bro, can you really do it?

692
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,040
Yes.

693
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,680
Owner, is it okay?

694
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
So professional, bro.

695
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:49,960
It's good.

696
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,640
Add two more.

697
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,520
Look at the plating.

698
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,520
Everyone has to aim for

699
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,280
Who plated this?

700
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,760
Who is this?

701
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
The owner plated it.

702
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
The owner is good at everything.

703
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
The plating is correct.

704
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,600
The plating is really nice.

705
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,520
Especially good.

706
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,640
Alright.

707
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,760
Really good.

708
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,520
Thank you.

709
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,920
Time to eat, everyone. Come on.

710
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,360
A few of us owners just discussed it.

711
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,240
Yuwen did really well today.

712
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,800
She diligently

713
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,120
made breakfast for us.

714
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
Can she leave the team today?

715
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,920
I think she can leave.

716
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,160
Yes.

717
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,400
And then,

718
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,080
But He Ge made a suggestion,

719
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,280
saying Didi would be a good fit for this position.

720
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,720
Because Didi works really hard.

721
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,960
She was just at this position.

722
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,760
What did I just hear?

723
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm full.

724
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,520
So stuffed.

725
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,120
Let's go.

726
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Hello

727
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,120
Hello

728
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,080
Hello, teachers

729
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,880
How should I address you?

730
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
Just call me Xiao Lü

731
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
The Lü with two mouths

732
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,320
That's right

733
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,840
Hello, Teacher Xiao Lü

734
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,400
Yes

735
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,080
Hello

736
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,040
We are the tour guides accompanying the bus

737
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,480
Okay

738
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,760
We're setting off

739
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
Let's go

740
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,920
Welcome to Rome

741
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,680
Let me introduce some things to you while we're on the way

742
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
The place where we are now

743
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,400
Rome

744
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Okay

745
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,280
Rome has a nickname

746
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,720
The Open-Air Museum

747
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,520
The entire city of Rome

748
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,800
is a World Cultural Heritage site

749
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,160
The entire central historic district

750
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,920
is all included

751
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,440
Italy is the center of the Renaissance

752
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,040
So in Italy

753
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,320
there are actually many remaining

754
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,560
frescoes from the Renaissance period

755
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,160
and sculptures

756
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,360
Look at this.

757
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,000
Look at this.

758
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,280
On our left now is a

759
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,960
opera house.

760
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
Marcello Opera House.

761
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,520
Its exterior looks a lot like the Colosseum.

762
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,000
In Roman times, there were two types of theaters.

763
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,320
One was called the Flavian Amphitheater.

764
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:47,880
It was circular.

765
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,280
It was used for combat events.

766
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,960
Like the Colosseum.

767
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,520
The other type was semicircular.

768
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,200
It was a theater.

769
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
Used for singing performances.

770
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,360
There's a phrase Italians often say,

771
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,920
which means "take it slow."

772
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Take it slow.

773
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
Take it slow.

774
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,240
What church is this?

775
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,800
This is the political center of Italy.

776
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,280
It's called Piazza Venezia.

777
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,920
It's so beautiful.

778
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,640
This staircase is so beautiful.

779
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,400
That lion over there.

780
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,320
Looks like Naiwen when he's at work.

781
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,040
With a worried look on his face.

782
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,800
Do you know why we

783
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,360
can come to Rome?

784
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,080
Because in Rome,

785
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,960
we're working like mules.

786
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,120
What do you mean?

787
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,560
Working, of course.

788
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
You mean working like cattle and horses?

789
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,560
Cattle and horses aren't enough.

790
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,040
It has to be mules.

791
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,440
With a specific job.

792
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,920
Tianjin Restaurant.

793
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,800
Do they have steamed buns?

794
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,440
Goubuli buns.

795
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,280
But when you look inside,

796
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,920
it's Fujian-style stir-fry.

797
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,120
These are buns.

798
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
Bro, this is a Chinese restaurant.

799
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Dumplings.

800
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,960
I just love stuffed foods.

801
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,760
When we get back, let Wen cook one for you.

802
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,920
A pork and scallion burger.

803
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Got it, bro.

804
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,320
Guys.

805
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,920
Guys.

806
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,840
We're here.

807
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,120
Nemi, a small town southeast of Rome,

808
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,280
is famous for its strawberries.

809
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,040
Every year, on the first Sunday of June,

810
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,360
people hold a strawberry festival.

811
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,600
Everyone is warmly welcomed.

812
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
to join this sweet celebration.

813
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,640
Hello.

814
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,320
Come here quickly.

815
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,680
Strawberry

816
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,280
Thank you

817
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
Thank you

818
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,720
Strawberry, showing off strawberries

819
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,520
Come here

820
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's go

821
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,640
So beautiful

822
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,440
What? I don't understand

823
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,440
So exciting

824
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,520
So much fun

825
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,480
You spin too

826
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
Thank you

827
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,760
Thank you

828
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Thank you

829
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,280
Okay, thank you

830
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,720
Thank you

831
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,680
This strawberry is delicious

832
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,360
So tasty

833
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,600
So small, so wild

834
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
Are Dandong strawberries tastier or are these better?

835
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:31,840
I...

836
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,680
Of course, Dandong ones are tastier

837
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,880
But these little strawberries are quite delicate

838
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Each has its own strengths

839
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,400
No, the ones from my hometown are still the best

840
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,080
Hometown ones

841
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,760
But I think

842
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Dandong strawberries are much bigger than these

843
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,400
Much bigger

844
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,160
In Dandong, we have ones as big as a fist

845
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,880
They're really awesome

846
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Strawberry baby

847
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,520
What is this place?

848
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,600
So beautiful

849
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,000
The lake you're seeing now is called Lake Nemi.

850
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,840
This town is also named after Lake Nemi.

851
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,440
So it's called Nemi Town.

852
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,200
Nemi Town.

853
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,000
That's right.

854
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,600
Okay.

855
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
So beautiful.

856
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,960
It's gorgeous.

857
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,560
That's great.

858
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,760
Back view.

859
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Let me take a picture of your back.

860
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,960
Come on.

861
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,600
It's fine, even if it's backlit, the person doesn't matter.

862
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,840
The scenery is the main thing.

863
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,520
Mainly the scenery.

864
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,640
Okay.

865
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,560
Alright, that's it.

866
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
So beautiful.

867
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,400
So comfortable.

868
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,520
Brother.

869
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,960
It's so pretty.

870
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,320
So beautiful.

871
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,080
What's up? Are we just staying here?

872
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Let's go up.

873
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,200
Alright.

874
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,160
Brothers.

875
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,080
Come on.

876
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,760
I want to go feel the breeze with you again.

877
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,480
Let's go feel the breeze.

878
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,280
Tell us.

879
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,040
How can we get something to eat?

880
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,480
Right.

881
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,560
Come on.

882
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,480
This restaurant

883
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,840
has specialties from Nemi Town.

884
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,240
A lot of local delicacies.

885
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,680
Today, while we eat,

886
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,800
we'll also do a "You're Full" challenge.

887
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,200
"You're Full."

888
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,600
and put the lollipop in your mouth

889
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,160
after hitting four people

890
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
start the voting

891
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,040
Bro, did you understand?

892
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,760
No

893
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,400
Wait a moment

894
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
I didn't hear this part just now

895
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,440
One didn't hear

896
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,680
One is definitely half confused

897
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,480
Right?

898
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,040
The three of us have been together from the start

899
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,960
Bro, I'm the smart one

900
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,760
I understood it in the very first second

901
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,240
Then explain it to the two of us

902
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,680
For example

903
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,040
Bro, you got the undercover role

904
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,880
And the required action is

905
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,680
making a heart gesture

906
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,280
When we're all eating

907
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,960
For example

908
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
Jun Jun makes eye contact with me

909
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,080
I quickly make a heart gesture

910
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,920
then keep eating

911
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,480
He is then

912
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,120
He is "out"

913
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,840
Right

914
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,800
I "eliminated" him

915
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,840
Okay

916
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,960
Now, about the punishment

917
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,920
If you vote correctly for the "lunch killer"

918
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,440
you have to say, in your cutest way

919
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,760
"I'm the cutest little dummy on Earth"

920
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,520
If you guys don't guess correctly

921
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,880
everyone has to shout this sentence together

922
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,000
Wow

923
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,760
It should be like this

924
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,280
That's how we played the game before

925
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,120
The loser shouts out the window

926
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,480
Attention, everyone

927
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,280
You might not know me

928
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm so-and-so

929
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,080
I am

930
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,160
You know?

931
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,760
It's like that

932
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,680
Let's do it this way

933
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,120
Okay

934
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,880
"Lunch Killer"

935
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,360
will receive a text notification

936
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
Then turn off your phone's vibration

937
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,280
Put it on silent

938
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,000
Wouldn't turning on airplane mode solve it?

939
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,760
If it's on airplane mode, it can't send messages

940
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,400
Bro

941
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,440
That's true

942
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,560
The intelligence level at our company

943
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,120
is just like this

944
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,880
So nervous.

945
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,680
Okay.

946
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,080
I already feel like I am the one.

947
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,800
My phone is already vibrating in my pocket.

948
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,720
Maybe I've played the villain too many times.

949
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,440
"Lunch Killer" designated action.

950
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,280
Sent.

951
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,360
What are you doing?

952
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,280
Nothing.

953
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,320
You can't send it to the group.

954
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
Actually, you can send it to the group.

955
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,440
You even have a privacy screen.

956
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,760
That's pretty impressive.

957
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,840
No, Naiwen.

958
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,440
It's not me.

959
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
I get it if the kids have one.

960
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,160
But you have a whole privacy screen.

961
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,040
Who would peek at your screen?

962
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,560
Yeah.

963
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,480
To protect myself.

964
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,600
So nothing has happened so far.

965
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,360
To make sure the "Lunch Killer" knows their identity,

966
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,880
everyone first...

967
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,720
Close your eyes when it gets dark.

968
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,480
Okay.

969
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,520
"Lunch Killer," please open your eyes.

970
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,960
If you want to confirm the action,

971
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,920
you can nod your head.

972
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,760
Take a look.

973
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,400
Everyone, open your eyes.

974
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,120
I feel

975
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,280
it's restless over here

976
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm telling you, it's really restless here

977
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,639
I don't know who

978
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,840
it's really restless here

979
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
someone's already started framing others

980
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,719
Come on, let's serve the first dish

981
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,040
I'm so hungry

982
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,560
This is well done

983
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,199
I like it

984
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,880
This is a bit like chicken breast

985
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,000
It's so tough

986
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,880
So tough

987
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,639
Is it tough?

988
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,480
I like it

989
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm telling you, it's not like that now

990
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,360
Chen He

991
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,639
I'm full

992
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,600
Put the lollipop in your mouth

993
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
I have a mouth ulcer

994
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,560
I think it's Brother Honglei

995
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,120
What?

996
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,440
It's you, bro

997
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,880
What happened?

998
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,600
The two of us haven't eaten yet

999
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,360
This person is impressive

1000
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,000
Let's stop talking and eat first.

1001
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,200
No, nothing's happened yet.

1002
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,640
He's already "dead."

1003
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
"Dead."

1004
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,040
Already full.

1005
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
He ate himself "to death."

1006
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,840
If he's full, then he's just full.

1007
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,160
I'm not full yet.

1008
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I mean, I feel like Yuwen is acting a bit strange.

1009
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,840
It's over, Yuwen.

1010
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,880
You're completely—

1011
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,560
It's over, Yuwen.

1012
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,360
You're completely—

1013
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,440
Yuwen.

1014
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,560
I'm full.

1015
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,480
I know who it is.

1016
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,160
I know who it is.

1017
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,760
I know who it is too.

1018
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,200
Me.

1019
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,000
It's you.

1020
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
I saw you.

1021
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,320
I saw it too.

1022
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,960
I saw it.

1023
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,800
It's you.

1024
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
It's not me.

1025
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Your timing is off.

1026
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,680
I'm still eating.

1027
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,960
Bro, your timing is off, bro.

1028
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,240
It's too obvious.

1029
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
Really?

1030
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,280
Just kept staring at you.

1031
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,320
Whatever you want.

1032
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,400
You're already full.

1033
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,040
I'm full.

1034
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,640
What about you?

1035
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,320
I don't dare answer.

1036
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
I'm afraid I might have a problem.

1037
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
No, Wen.

1038
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,760
You're not.

1039
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,040
Why did you step on me?

1040
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,480
I didn't even touch you.

1041
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,440
I saw it, bro.

1042
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,720
You were watching the director team's reaction.

1043
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,880
No, I wasn't.

1044
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,080
Who are you going to pick?

1045
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,240
That move you did.

1046
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,480
That's the move that went viral.

1047
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,800
What is it?

1048
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,560
I saw everything.

1049
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,320
Look at the production team.

1050
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,000
It was like this just now.

1051
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,240
You were like this just now.

1052
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,280
No, you can't.

1053
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,360
No, you can't.

1054
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,040
I saw it.

1055
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,760
No.

1056
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,480
Bro, you're blushing.

1057
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,000
Come on, Gong Jun.

1058
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
Put it down, I'm full.

1059
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,240
Look.

1060
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,120
It's not me, right?

1061
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,920
I got it.

1062
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,080
I know.

1063
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,640
Look.

1064
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,560
I'm still talking.

1065
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,040
Yes.

1066
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,680
You can't move your hands around anymore.

1067
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,720
Actually, it's pretty obvious.

1068
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,920
Okay, I won't move.

1069
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
Look at me.

1070
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,640
No, this angle is a bit difficult, isn't it?

1071
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,440
"Kill" me.

1072
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,960
Don't look at me.

1073
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,120
Why are you looking at me?

1074
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,320
Bro, don't...

1075
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,240
...mess with your tongue anymore.

1076
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,160
I think it is.

1077
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,720
Naiwen is one hundred percent.

1078
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Why?

1079
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,480
What?

1080
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
Me.

1081
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,360
Actually, I think acting is a physiological reaction.

1082
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,760
I was observing the whole time just now.

1083
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,880
His pulse here...

1084
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,000
...was beating really fast.

1085
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,440
Him

1086
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,000
I think it's Sun Honglei.

1087
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,760
Why him?

1088
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,480
Yeah, why Sun Honglei?

1089
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,240
When we were eating just now,

1090
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,360
You don't need to use your hands to explain.

1091
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,200
Put your hands down first.

1092
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,440
When we were eating just now,

1093
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,960
Use your tongue to point.

1094
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,480
Then,

1095
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,160
Wasn't he playing with his phone just now?

1096
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,280
So he's safe.

1097
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,080
He's fine.

1098
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,000
But you stepped on a good person.

1099
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,840
What does that mean?

1100
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,720
I'm not accusing an innocent person.

1101
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,840
I think it's him.

1102
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,800
Don't point.

1103
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,000
I pointed out the problem, but he didn't get "eliminated."

1104
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
If I were that person,

1105
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,280
I would have been "full" already.

1106
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,960
See?

1107
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,520
No need to do anything.

1108
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,080
Point.

1109
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,240
It's fine.

1110
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,160
It's okay.

1111
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,280
Otherwise,

1112
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,640
the judge would have announced it already.

1113
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,360
Yes.

1114
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,800
It's fine.

1115
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:53,920
That's too scary.

1116
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,000
It's not me.

1117
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
It's really not me.

1118
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,360
Even if it's not you,

1119
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
we'll frame you this round.

1120
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,880
Okay, bro?

1121
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,000
Really.

1122
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,840
It's not me.

1123
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,720
You're talking too much.

1124
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,800
For example, if it were me,

1125
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,400
what action did I use to "eliminate" you?

1126
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,120
Stretching my philtrum.

1127
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,080
Imitating Yu Hewei to "eliminate" someone.

1128
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
Hurry, someone is about to be "full."

1129
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
I think so.

1130
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,520
Mouth movement.

1131
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,160
No.

1132
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,960
You're just being gross.

1133
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,560
You can make me full

1134
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,320
but you can't

1135
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,840
disgust me.

1136
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,480
Blink.

1137
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,160
It doesn't matter.

1138
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,920
The logic is

1139
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,200
See, when you keep explaining

1140
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,480
none of us went down.

1141
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,680
Then it's settled.

1142
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,760
Then you really are

1143
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,560
It's really not me.

1144
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,400
I think

1145
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,840
it's him.

1146
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,680
I think it's him.

1147
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,920
It's Sun Honglei.

1148
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,480
You really are

1149
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Honglei.

1150
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,160
You're full.

1151
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,600
Look.

1152
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,360
Wait a second.

1153
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,240
Look.

1154
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,880
I kept pointing like this just now.

1155
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,680
And nothing happened to you.

1156
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
But when I pointed again just now,

1157
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,360
Look.

1158
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,000
Shut up.

1159
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
No, I'm a good person.

1160
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,880
Shut up.

1161
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,480
Let me say something.

1162
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,840
Let me say something.

1163
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,160
The moment he was fed and full,

1164
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,800
I saw

1165
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,960
he did this to him,

1166
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,160
made a gesture like this or something.

1167
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,080
He was instantly full.

1168
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,560
Super full.

1169
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,400
Yeah.

1170
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,000
Super full.

1171
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,280
So full he was stuffed.

1172
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:24,920
And then?

1173
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,120
He was full in an instant.

1174
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,200
Impossible.

1175
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,800
Did I do this to you?

1176
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,080
Did I do this to Yuwen?

1177
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,280
No.

1178
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,920
They didn't see it.

1179
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,800
I was the first one to be full.

1180
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,400
I'm super full.

1181
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,240
So,

1182
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,400
I pointed like this just now,

1183
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,920
and no one saw it.

1184
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,880
Just now, when you used one finger,

1185
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,600
I blocked it for you.

1186
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,880
But I forgot to block when it was two fingers.

1187
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,640
It's impossible to guard against everything.

1188
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,080
When I pointed at Honglei,

1189
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,240
Honglei was fine.

1190
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,960
Then how do you explain this?

1191
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,280
There's a delay.

1192
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,160
Now there's a delay.

1193
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,680
So he pointed at Brother Honglei many times.

1194
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,400
That's not right.

1195
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,120
Are you done arguing?

1196
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,000
Who do you think it is, Gong Jun?

1197
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,680
I think...

1198
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
It's just the three people left.

1199
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,560
One is Didi and "Yuwen".

1200
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,800
No, it's Yuning.

1201
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,840
Yuning has always...

1202
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,320
...taken a penalty drink for me.

1203
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,000
They just paired the two of us together.

1204
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,520
No.

1205
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,280
"Ziwen", is your name still...

1206
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,000
"Ziwen".

1207
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,160
Brother He.

1208
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,480
Brother He.

1209
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,040
We've known each other for years.

1210
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,040
Ziwen.

1211
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,320
I miss you, Ziwen.

1212
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,760
Ziwen.

1213
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,960
Come on our show, Ziwen.

1214
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,840
Alright.

1215
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,400
I'll send her a WeChat message later.

1216
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,800
Ziwen.

1217
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Or how about Xiao Wang?

1218
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
"Nai Lei".

1219
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,120
"Ziwen".

1220
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,360
Then "Zining".

1221
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,800
Yu.

1222
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,360
"Yuwen".

1223
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,160
"Yuwen".

1224
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,480
Still talking about math.

1225
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,280
Still talking about math.

1226
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,160
If you're not the one,

1227
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
If it's not you,

1228
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,840
I'm definitely not.

1229
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,760
Alright, it's not you.

1230
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,280
Then who do you think it is between the two of us?

1231
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,360
At first, I really thought

1232
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
No, between the two of us,

1233
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,400
Now it's just the two of us left.

1234
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,280
Because among the three of us,

1235
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
one of us is the "culprit."

1236
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,360
If I think it's you,

1237
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,080
for example,

1238
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,640
You're still talking about him.

1239
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,680
That's enough.

1240
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,640
Why are you still accusing me?

1241
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,240
I'm already full.

1242
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,320
He's been ruled out.

1243
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,040
Because now those two

1244
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,720
It's him.

1245
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,560
Now it's those two.

1246
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,920
No, I'm just analyzing.

1247
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,640
You've said more than enough.

1248
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,960
We can vote now.

1249
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,760
Vote.

1250
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,040
Come on.

1251
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,880
Three, two, one.

1252
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,560
Well deserved.

1253
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,240
Unanimous.

1254
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Go ahead, man.

1255
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,440
Hello, everyone.

1256
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,040
I'm Li Naiwen.

1257
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,400
I'm the whole world's

1258
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,880
No,

1259
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm the cutest in the whole world,

1260
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,080
big dummy.

1261
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,080
Na Wen, you go.

1262
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,160
Come on, hurry up.

1263
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,440
What's the big deal?

1264
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,200
Are we supposed to watch?

1265
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,960
What's the last line?

1266
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,840
I am the cutest little dummy on Earth.

1267
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,920
Say it in the cutest voice.

1268
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,520
There are so many people outside.

1269
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,840
Why are they all Chinese?

1270
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,520
They posted it online right away.

1271
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,600
Hurry, take a picture.

1272
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,200
Attention, everyone.

1273
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,840
Attention, everyone.

1274
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,480
Louder.

1275
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,560
Maybe you don't know me.

1276
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,080
We do.

1277
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,080
There's even a response.

1278
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,040
I'm Sun Honglei's classmate.

1279
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,920
I am the whole Earth's...

1280
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,800
...cutest.

1281
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,360
The cutest.

1282
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,440
Go on, say it.

1283
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:32,960
The cutest.

1284
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
The cutest big dummy.

1285
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,640
I am the whole Earth's...

1286
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,160
Earth's...

1287
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,880
The cutest big dummy.

1288
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,640
The cutest big dummy.

1289
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,960
Let's play another round.

1290
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,160
Let me be honest.

1291
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
This feels a bit like a punishment for us.

1292
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,280
Yeah.

1293
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,240
It kind of hurt me.

1294
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,360
I think he already had his fun.

1295
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,520
Let's go again.

1296
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:10,960
See?

1297
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,080
He just loves playing this.

1298
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,960
You guys really

1299
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,600
will never guess how I do it.

1300
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,440
What is it?

1301
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,480
Can't tell.

1302
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,200
Jun Jun, there's something up with you.

1303
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,760
It's you.

1304
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,440
You have a problem.

1305
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,360
Your phone vibrated.

1306
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,680
Do you want to check? I turned on Do Not Disturb.

1307
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,200
Di Di, it's you.

1308
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,680
It's me.

1309
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,080
You're just guessing, right?

1310
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,080
Naiwen, your heart is racing, isn't it?

1311
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,680
You're talking a bit much this time.

1312
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,600
She's kind of leading the rhythm.

1313
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,360
It's fine.

1314
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,840
Yuwen, you're starting, right?

1315
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,400
I'm just setting the pace.

1316
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,800
Come on, serve a dish.

1317
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,520
I want to eat.

1318
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,880
Why are you even shaking now?

1319
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,240
No, I just wanted to reach for the plate.

1320
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,000
I think I'm going to get "sacrificed."

1321
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,640
If I show up, I'll be out instantly.

1322
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,160
Yeah.

1323
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,720
It's fine, just watch and eat.

1324
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,440
Don't look at me.

1325
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,600
Don't look at me.

1326
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,240
I'm not staring at you.

1327
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,800
Don't look at me.

1328
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,360
There's something wrong with you.

1329
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,000
There's something off about the way you're looking.

1330
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,040
Ning seems really guilty this round.

1331
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,960
I think so too.

1332
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,600
That look in your eyes...

1333
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,080
Alright.

1334
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,800
Yuning is acting a bit strange.

1335
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,280
There's something wrong with your look.

1336
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,760
I turned my head and you startled me.

1337
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
Like an assassin.

1338
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,000
Come on.

1339
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,840
Don't do it both rounds.

1340
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,560
Don't take me out first both times.

1341
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,280
Is that okay?

1342
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,960
The first person to take you out

1343
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,080
is right next to you.

1344
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,320
Here, let's do this.

1345
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,320
Let's give the "assassin"

1346
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,240
a mission.

1347
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,160
First,

1348
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,560
"kill" Chen He.

1349
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,200
Aren't you just exposing him, bro?

1350
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,320
If he doesn't get "killed,"

1351
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:29,600
Alright.

1352
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,560
Chen He, He-ge.

1353
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,120
I'm full.

1354
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,600
Bro

1355
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,800
What am I supposed to say?

1356
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,480
It really wasn't me.

1357
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,000
It wasn't me.

1358
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,200
It really wasn't me.

1359
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,680
Is it possible, Naiwen bro,

1360
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,560
that he just mentioned someone's name,

1361
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:57,920
Wait a second.

1362
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,360
and now it's already me, right?

1363
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,880
It wasn't me.

1364
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,560
Otherwise, why

1365
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,360
did he only mention this one person's name?

1366
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,560
Here, serve the food.

1367
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
This one looks delicious.

1368
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,800
You're full, bro.

1369
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,560
He bro can't eat this.

1370
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,280
Can't eat it.

1371
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,080
Smells so good.

1372
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,520
It's cheese.

1373
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,760
But you're full.

1374
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,400
Didi

1375
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,080
I'm full.

1376
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,720
Put it down.

1377
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,480
Outlaw

1378
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,280
What's going on?

1379
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,200
This round, it's Yuning.

1380
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,520
It's Yuning this round.

1381
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,840
Because usually, Yuning

1382
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,880
I really admire him.

1383
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
Just now,

1384
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,720
Let me act it out just now.

1385
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,440
There was still some unfinished food in his mouth.

1386
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,280
There were still noodles.

1387
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,320
Looking at her like this,

1388
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,720
In the end, the director said, "You're full."

1389
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,080
This isn't Yuning.

1390
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,520
Yuning wouldn't be like this.

1391
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,200
Right.

1392
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,040
Not calm.

1393
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,280
Okay.

1394
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
Honglei

1395
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,440
Put down the fork.

1396
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,160
You're full.

1397
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,040
I'm innocent.

1398
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,440
I saw it.

1399
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,600
It was a pouting motion.

1400
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,080
When Honglei lowered his head, Ning

1401
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,720
He was gone.

1402
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,800
Let me act it out just now.

1403
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,280
There was still some unfinished food in his mouth.

1404
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,240
Honglei, you're full.

1405
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,560
Smells so good.

1406
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,560
But you're full.

1407
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,240
The first "kill" is Chen He.

1408
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,640
Yuning

1409
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,680
Yuning, just go ahead with me.

1410
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,240
I won't move anymore.

1411
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,720
From now on, I won't talk.

1412
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,760
Let's see if anyone is full.

1413
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,480
Not talking doesn't help.

1414
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,520
Just don't move your mouth.

1415
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,120
Okay, bro.

1416
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,480
Or you could just put on a mask.

1417
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,960
Let Yuning wear a mask.

1418
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,160
Wouldn't that be confiscated then?

1419
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,400
Like the "killer's" gun?

1420
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,040
I think Yuning just tried to take out Jun.

1421
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,600
I saw it.

1422
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,720
I made eye contact with him.

1423
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,800
When Jun turned around,

1424
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,800
Surprise.

1425
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
You can think it was me.

1426
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
It's not just thinking.

1427
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,640
It is you.

1428
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,200
Report.

1429
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,000
Someone here has been eliminated.

1430
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,200
Report.

1431
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,440
I won't eat.

1432
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,200
Report.

1433
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,960
I won't eat.

1434
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,480
I won't eat.

1435
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,120
Don't pout at me.

1436
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,040
I can't take it.

1437
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,120
Can't take it at all.

1438
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,840
Don't pout at me.

1439
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,480
No, I won't.

1440
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,440
I won't.

1441
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,480
He Ge can't eat.

1442
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,600
What are you doing?

1443
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,800
How did these noodles get in my mouth?

1444
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,160
Are you a vacuum cleaner?

1445
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,760
It went in by itself.

1446
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,880
The noodles climbed up by themselves.

1447
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,600
He Ge

1448
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,800
What are you doing?

1449
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,920
Water can be given to people to drink, right?

1450
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,560
People are full.

1451
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,120
But water still needs to go down.

1452
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,720
Here.

1453
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,640
It really isn't me.

1454
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,680
It really isn't me.

1455
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,320
Don't stare at me.

1456
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,600
I'm telling you, staring at me will make you lose.

1457
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,160
It really isn't me.

1458
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,480
Don't shrink back.

1459
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,360
Don't you shrink back.

1460
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,520
Getting nervous.

1461
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,200
Yeah, getting nervous.

1462
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,480
Just like last round with him.

1463
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,840
I totally understand you.

1464
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,960
It's really nerve-wracking.

1465
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,320
And willing to step back a bit.

1466
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,360
Okay, I won't move.

1467
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
You know what?

1468
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,560
The people still in the game are all fine so far.

1469
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,800
Do you know why?

1470
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,640
Because you can't bring yourself to do it.

1471
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,920
I'm telling you, it's really not me.

1472
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,000
That's what I said too.

1473
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,440
Last round.

1474
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,120
You can assume it's me for now.

1475
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,480
But take a look at the others too.

1476
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,560
That's how I see it.

1477
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,160
So should we keep eating for a bit or what?

1478
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,880
Found Yuníng.

1479
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,520
I wasn't wrong about you.

1480
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,840
You're a really good person.

1481
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,280
Really.

1482
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,160
You can't lie.

1483
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,720
Yeah, I just can't lie.

1484
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,240
Look at you right now.

1485
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,920
You drink by yourself.

1486
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,000
You've already had two bottles.

1487
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,800
And you're still drinking.

1488
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,800
Come on.

1489
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,960
Come on, vote.

1490
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,640
Go ahead.

1491
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,480
Three, two, one.

1492
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,280
Vote.

1493
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,560
So should one person go to the window,

1494
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,920
or should everyone go to the window?

1495
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,360
Yuning, go ahead.

1496
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,720
Get ready.

1497
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,160
You guys doing this, seriously...

1498
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,360
I'm worried they won't see me.

1499
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,520
So I have to do it like this.

1500
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,400
That's strange.

1501
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,520
Pouting.

1502
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,960
This is way too obvious.

1503
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,760
This is something I could never do.

1504
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,640
Yeah.

1505
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,840
It's really weird.

1506
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,360
So just now, when Honglei lowered his head,

1507
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,520
Ning quickly kissed him.

1508
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,720
I said, that's so strange.

1509
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,720
It's hard to hide this.

1510
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,480
Come on.

1511
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,880
It's done filming.

1512
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,760
The format needs to be the same.

1513
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,560
Hello, everyone.

1514
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,200
I'm singer and actor Liu Yuning.

1515
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,520
I'm the cutest in the whole world,

1516
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,240
the biggest dummy.

1517
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,160
Alright.

1518
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,880
This is hard.

1519
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,440
This one's really hard.

1520
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,160
See, even he says it's pretty gross.

1521
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah.

1522
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,640
No one else can act normal anymore.

1523
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,280
Let's go again.

1524
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,480
Go again, Liu Yuning.

1525
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,120
Everyone who loses wants another round.

1526
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,240
It's about having a chance to turn things around.

1527
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,680
Let's do a two-player one.

1528
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,720
Come on, two players.

1529
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,840
I think the two-player one

1530
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,840
is harder.

1531
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,960
Explain the rules for the two-player one.

1532
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,360
There are two "lunch killers".

1533
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,680
The assigned action is the same.

1534
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,720
They don't know who their teammate is.

1535
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,640
Check your phone.

1536
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:14,920
What?

1537
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,120
Barbecue platter.

1538
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,240
Smells so good.

1539
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,960
So hot.

1540
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,240
That was totally unexpected.

1541
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,760
So hot.

1542
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,000
Is this your signature move?

1543
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,920
Still don't dare to make a move.

1544
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,200
Getting a bit timid.

1545
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,920
Still don't dare to make a move.

1546
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,040
I'll challenge this "killer."

1547
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,600
A bit timid.

1548
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
You two are a bit timid.

1549
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,320
Way too timid.

1550
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,200
The "killer" is too timid.

1551
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,200
And there are two.

1552
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,240
Two timid ones.

1553
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,960
Yuning.

1554
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,520
You're full.

1555
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,080
Naiwen, you can't do that.

1556
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,760
It's too obvious, man.

1557
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,080
What did I do?

1558
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,960
It's He.

1559
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,360
Why?

1560
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,880
I think it's him.

1561
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,160
Because everyone here

1562
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,560
would

1563
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,240
vote him out.

1564
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:13,800
Should be.

1565
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
Let's hug.

1566
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,080
Brother.

1567
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,120
Younger brother.

1568
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,080
Now I have an idea of your intelligence.

1569
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,520
I've made some judgments.

1570
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Gong Jun,

1571
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,160
I'll be your friend.

1572
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,440
You're so smart.

1573
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,160
Bro,

1574
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,960
let's have a toast.

1575
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,080
Come on, include me, come on.

1576
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,800
Not including you.

1577
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,760
Don't leave me out, let me join.

1578
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,760
Heh.

1579
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,880
This is too obvious.

1580
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,400
Let's just vote now.

1581
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,480
This is way too obvious.

1582
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,200
Didi's look is suspicious.

1583
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,240
I also think Didi is suspicious.

1584
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,320
That look from Didi...

1585
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,880
It felt like she didn't understand just now.

1586
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,920
She was looking at Yuning.

1587
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,600
Didi is definitely acting strange.

1588
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,000
If we said she was suspicious before,

1589
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,320
she definitely is.

1590
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,920
It's not me.

1591
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,640
Right.

1592
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,480
It's quiet this round.

1593
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,240
There's really something off.

1594
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,360
I know who it is.

1595
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,760
Who do you think the other one is?

1596
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,040
You two can accuse each other.

1597
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,440
Bro, you're a bit suspicious.

1598
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,640
The mutual accusations start now.

1599
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,680
They're starting to accuse each other.

1600
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,600
The whole team is accusing each other.

1601
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,400
Didi is full.

1602
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,120
Remember what I just said.

1603
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,800
If you know how to play,

1604
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,200
you wouldn't have let Didi

1605
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,520
Yeah.

1606
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,240
Because just now, everyone

1607
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,400
was targeting Didi,

1608
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,520
he took Didi away.

1609
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,240
Right.

1610
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,760
Because she was the most suspicious.

1611
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
I think it's two people who don't know how to play.

1612
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,520
Yeah.

1613
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,120
One is Honglei.

1614
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,680
The other is Naiwen.

1615
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,600
I...

1616
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,400
Why am I the one who doesn't know how to play?

1617
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,680
I'm done playing.

1618
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,480
Wait a second.

1619
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,120
I'm a veteran "killer," you know.

1620
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,400
I'm an experienced "killer."

1621
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,000
Jun Jun is full.

1622
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,680
Alright, that's good.

1623
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,560
This side is a mess.

1624
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,880
It's chaotic, he's already confused.

1625
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,560
Honestly, I can't really tell if he is or not.

1626
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,080
Let me tell you,

1627
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,040
it's obvious.

1628
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,840
This is obvious.

1629
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:27,920
He.

1630
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,080
You're obvious.

1631
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,480
You used to be so impressive in my eyes.

1632
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,920
I had to look up to see you.

1633
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,480
But now,

1634
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,840
He.

1635
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,360
He used to really admire you.

1636
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,760
Not anymore.

1637
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,120
He, you're full now.

1638
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,200
Eliminate one.

1639
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,240
Nice.

1640
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,360
That was amazing.

1641
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,200
Nice? What's wrong with that?

1642
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,720
You're about to win.

1643
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,920
You're the "wolf."

1644
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,400
How are you so good at this?

1645
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,680
What?

1646
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,840
You're so good at playing.

1647
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,880
What?

1648
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,960
It's you.

1649
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,840
It's him.

1650
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,400
What does it have to do with me?

1651
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,000
Too timid.

1652
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,240
You're the wolf.

1653
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,000
How are you so good at this?

1654
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,040
You guys are about to win.

1655
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,920
What does that have to do with me?

1656
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,080
He, this is for sure.

1657
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,400
But this one could be...

1658
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,840
As soon as you said that,

1659
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,960
I actually think you're really suspicious.

1660
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,320
You've been targeting Didi the whole time.

1661
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,960
She's already out and you're still targeting her.

1662
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,760
It's just weird.

1663
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,560
Yeah.

1664
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,240
Her face turned red.

1665
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,080
Her ears turned red.

1666
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,480
Yuwen and Honglei,

1667
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,360
let's vote.

1668
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,560
Vote, come on.

1669
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,880
Raise your hand if you think it's Didi.

1670
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,360
Go ahead.

1671
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,840
Who thinks I'm the "culprit"? Raise your hand.

1672
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,800
No one.

1673
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,960
Raise your hand if you think it's Gong Jun.

1674
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,560
No one.

1675
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,760
Then raise your hand if you think it's He.

1676
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,560
Alright, no one.

1677
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,440
Raise your hand if you think Naiwen is the "culprit".

1678
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,560
Three.

1679
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:05,840
Three votes.

1680
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,440
Raise your hand if you think it's Honglei.

1681
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,520
I'm not playing villains anymore.

1682
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,880
I'm never playing a villain again.

1683
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,120
I think you're being a bit biased.

1684
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,600
Did you all forget

1685
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,160
that I played Yu Zecheng?

1686
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,720
Wait a second.

1687
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,280
At that time, what was Yu Zecheng

1688
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,640
doing?

1689
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,840
He was undercover.

1690
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,560
Raise your hand if you think it's Yuwen.

1691
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,400
You can still raise your hand.

1692
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,720
There's a bit of internal strife in our company.

1693
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,280
There's nothing we can do about that.

1694
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,280
The two people who were voted for just now

1695
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,200
neither of them is correct.

1696
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,800
It's just the two of us.

1697
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,440
You all got the most votes completely wrong.

1698
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,840
Bro, we've cleared our names.

1699
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,000
We're the good guys.

1700
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,880
What?

1701
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,640
Na Wen, you definitely have one.

1702
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:05,960
Right.

1703
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,120
I've already revealed myself.

1704
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,600
Right.

1705
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,600
Because there are only three people left alive.

1706
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,160
Two of them aren't it.

1707
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,960
Then it must be me.

1708
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,560
Right.

1709
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,760
The other person.

1710
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,600
"Killer," please stand up.

1711
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,880
Sorry

1712
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,600
Let me say something

1713
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,720
It wasn't until the voting

1714
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,640
that I checked my phone

1715
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,720
When I looked at my phone

1716
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,040
it was me

1717
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,960
So it was all

1718
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,520
It was all done by me alone

1719
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,640
I'm an experienced "killer"

1720
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,240
A veteran "killer"

1721
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,360
Does this count as a free win for him?

1722
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,840
That's what you call a free win

1723
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,560
It wore me out

1724
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,120
It really exhausted me

1725
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,080
Taking out each one

1726
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,160
He was still doubting me

1727
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,240
So you

1728
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,400
What move did you make?

1729
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,320
Speak in English

1730
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,480
It's so hard

1731
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,760
I blended right in when I spoke

1732
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,520
The whole team was sabotaging each other

1733
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,480
And there were two

1734
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,360
Two cowards

1735
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,720
I'm a veteran "killer"

1736
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,520
He used to really admire you

1737
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,000
Who did you originally think your teammate was?

1738
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,800
I thought it was Didi.

1739
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,080
After I "stabbed," I regretted it.

1740
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,720
I thought, "Oh no."

1741
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,080
Did I take out my own partner?

1742
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,920
Remember what I just said.

1743
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,240
So I thought, "It's over."

1744
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,320
Let's go.

1745
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:48,800
Let's set off.

1746
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,800
Bro, hurry up and say it.

1747
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,000
Um...

1748
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,360
Hege has something to say to you.

1749
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,640
The audience says,

1750
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,480
All the strawberries here

1751
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,280
aren't as sweet as you.

1752
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,480
The sweetest little strawberry

1753
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,720
still isn't as sweet as you from Dandong.

1754
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,000
still isn't as sweet as the little strawberries from Dandong.

1755
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,880
A little specialty from Dandong.

1756
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,160
Let's go out for a walk.

1757
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,200
It's very pretty.

1758
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,640
So cute.

1759
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,000
So cute.

1760
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,120
This one is so cute.

1761
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,760
I like it.

1762
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,760
This one is pretty cute too.

1763
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,400
This one is good.

1764
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,640
This one is eight yuan.

1765
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,320
Are these three okay?

1766
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:43,800
Yes.

1767
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,360
So cute.

1768
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:44,680
Here.

1769
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,240
Okay.

1770
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,080
Alright.

1771
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:47,640
Wenzi.

1772
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,080
I'm buying this for my daughter.

1773
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,280
Do you think she'll be happy?

1774
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,880
Will she like it?

1775
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,480
She'll be really happy, bro.

1776
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,000
Okay, let me take a look.

1777
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,480
Actually, this little hat is pretty cute too.

1778
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,640
Then let's buy it together.

1779
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,320
Sure.

1780
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,800
Let's bargain together.

1781
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,440
Alright.

1782
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,760
Because I have a little black cat at home.

1783
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,040
I'll take a little cat.

1784
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,360
Black cat, white dog.

1785
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,120
Okay.

1786
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,640
Four.

1787
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,520
There are bracelets here, surprisingly.

1788
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,760
I just noticed.

1789
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:11,800
What kind of wood is this?

1790
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,680
I've never seen it before.

1791
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,960
I'm the most frugal.

1792
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,520
Just browsing.

1793
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,280
Not buying.

1794
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,040
Okay.

1795
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,960
Thank you very much.

1796
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,280
See you next time.

1797
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,480
Friend, my friend.

1798
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,560
Okay, thank you.

1799
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,640
Thank you.

1800
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,760
Thank you.

1801
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,960
You can't let this group go shopping.

1802
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,000
Once they dive in,

1803
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,760
it's just buy, buy, buy.

1804
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
So beautiful.

1805
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:41,880
Like a movie.

1806
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,800
Alright, we're here.

1807
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,560
This big square is really famous.

1808
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,080
This is from the Roman Baroque period.

1809
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,000
It's the most important square.

1810
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,320
Because here we can see

1811
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,120
the works of the two greatest architects of that time.

1812
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,160
The masterpieces they left behind.

1813
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,200
On the left is Sant'Agnese in Agone.

1814
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,880
It's Borromini's greatest masterpiece.

1815
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,400
In front is a very tall obelisk.

1816
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,840
The part below it

1817
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,680
is Bernini's greatest masterpiece.

1818
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,840
What's the name of this sculpture?

1819
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,760
The Fountain of the Four Rivers.

1820
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,520
Because on all four sides

1821
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,880
we see four river gods.

1822
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,120
This is so beautiful.

1823
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,200
I come here every time.

1824
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,040
But the sculptures here

1825
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,040
every time you look at them

1826
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,920
they're always so stunning.

1827
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,560
Amazing, just wonderful.

1828
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,360
Bye-bye.

1829
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,680
Piazza Navona, I finally remembered.

1830
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,880
You can't forget this square once you've been here.

1831
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,160
Piazza Navona.

1832
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,040
Isn't this just like a big food court?

1833
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,600
Yeah.

1834
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,760
It's so relaxing here.

1835
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,560
So beautiful.

1836
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,640
Aren't these the Spanish Steps?

1837
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,840
These are the Spanish Steps.

1838
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,600
Yes, the Spanish Steps.

1839
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,680
It's you.

1840
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
Yes, Mr. Bradley.

1841
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,920
Let's take a photo.

1842
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,400
Wait a moment.

1843
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:39,800
Someone's missing.

1844
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,240
We're missing someone.

1845
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,360
We're missing someone.

1846
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,440
Okay.

1847
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,040
It's very comfortable.

1848
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,040
Actually, sitting like this

1849
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:46,520
is really comfortable.

1850
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,880
We need to throw coins in here.

1851
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,160
Right.

1852
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,760
Na Wen, do you have any money?

1853
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,680
Let's go to the biggest one.

1854
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,600
We want to go to the biggest one.

1855
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,560
The wishing fountain.

1856
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,160
Great, that's awesome!

1857
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,760
Let's do it together as the Earth group.

1858
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,400
Alright.

1859
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:12,960
Let's throw them together.

1860
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,200
Three, two, one.

1861
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,480
We did it!

1862
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,400
It definitely worked.

1863
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,560
It's a wish for the kids.

1864
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:33,960
Yeah.

1865
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,880
Can we ride this car later? Sure.

1866
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,880
This horse looks cool.

1867
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:46,880
Cool.

1868
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,880
Let's get on and go.

1869
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,320
Where is everyone?

1870
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,080
Oh no.

1871
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,880
The two old gentlemen are missing.

1872
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,160
Where are they?

1873
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,440
They're so slow.

1874
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,480
How did we lose two people?

1875
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,920
Is there ice cream for sale here?

1876
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,080
Creamy caramel flavor.

1877
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:06,880
I really want to eat some.

1878
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,680
Naiwen, are you going to eat?

1879
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,440
It's way too fattening.

1880
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,920
Someone who claims to be on a diet

1881
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,560
has no self-control at all.

1882
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,800
Is it tasty?

1883
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,440
Three small ones.

1884
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,560
Is it good?

1885
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,120
Does it taste good?

1886
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:33,920
It's really delicious.

1887
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,240
What's wrong with you?

1888
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,480
If you want to eat, just eat.

1889
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,400
Why bother?

1890
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,320
Buy four.

1891
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:41,840
Four.

1892
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,720
Aren't they buying ice cream? Aren't they?

1893
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,520
They said you two got lost.

1894
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,760
They said you two got lost.

1895
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,120
Now we bought extra.

1896
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:51,960
Who wants to eat?

1897
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,880
I'll eat.

1898
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,320
Thank you.

1899
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,000
What about Yuning?

1900
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,200
Up ahead.

1901
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:54,920
Let them have some, bro.

1902
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:55,960
Yuning.

1903
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,760
Thanks, bro.

1904
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,720
You're so nice, bro.

1905
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,000
Give He'er a spoon.

1906
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,560
Let's share one.

1907
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,520
Thanks, bro.

1908
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,240
Yeah, that's fine.

1909
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:06,400
Cool.

1910
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,800
No, we misunderstood them.

1911
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,760
They went to buy us ice cream.

1912
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,560
Delete it.

1913
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,680
Delete it.

1914
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,880
We were just complaining about them.

1915
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,320
About them being slow.

1916
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,480
Honglei is a "god."

1917
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,160
Yeah.

1918
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,520
My "god."

1919
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,760
"Thunder god."

1920
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,040
He really is the "thunder god."

1921
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,440
It's so delicious.

1922
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,040
Don't eat it.

1923
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,720
Just now you were still...

1924
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,000
I don't want to eat, I'll gain weight.

1925
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,680
I think, since we're already here...

1926
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,560
Since we're already here.

1927
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,360
Seagull.

1928
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,280
Is that a seagull?

1929
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,120
So cool.

1930
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,280
It's so big.

1931
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,560
This is a church, right?

1932
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,040
Look at that ceiling.

1933
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,000
It's all so beautiful.

1934
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,480
It's quite stunning.

1935
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,560
Amazing, this is great.

1936
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,280
I think this is so meaningful.

1937
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,560
This is the birthplace of Western civilization.

1938
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,280
Ancient Rome.

1939
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,560
We need to be elegant.

1940
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,200
Elegant.

1941
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,320
Three, two...

1942
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:11,800
How is it?

1943
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,000
It's good.

1944
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,320
It's really good, bro.

1945
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,840
Happy.

1946
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,359
Happy.

1947
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,439
We're inspired by macaroni.

1948
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:34,000
We've prepared a game for everyone.

1949
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,520
It's called...

1950
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,800
The Dragon and Phoenix International Challenge.

1951
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,760
Bro, this round today...

1952
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,399
We're going to turn things around completely.

1953
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:40,640
Yeah.

1954
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,760
Let's just beat them all.

1955
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,439
Alright.

1956
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:43,040
Let's go.

1957
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,000
Is it really that impressive?

1958
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,359
How about I teach everyone a dance?

1959
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,000
This doesn't really match my vibe.

1960
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,600
This is very elegant.

1961
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,920
What are you doing?

1962
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,439
Ao Bing

1963
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,960
Okay.

1964
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,920
Then you be the male lead.

1965
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,080
How about the three of us be bandits?

1966
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,520
No.

1967
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:07,960
I don't want to.

1968
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,160
Then it's just you two.

1969
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,600
You just held hands successfully.

1970
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,040
That's "crazy."

1971
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,439
This is a masterpiece.

1972
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,640
This is the best restaurant in Rome.

1973
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,800
Serve the food.

1974
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,560
What does this mean?

1975
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,040
Thick round noodles with sea bass and caviar.

1976
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,080
Thick round noodles with sea bass and caviar.

1977
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,680
That's right.

1978
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,439
Having a talent for languages really makes a difference.

1979
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,800
How do you say "mussels"?

1980
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,279
You want a gesture? You do "mussels."

1981
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,319
Let's work together.

1982
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,479
Which one is it?

1983
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:40,680
This one.

1984
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,080
This.

1985
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,840
Roasted potatoes.

1986
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,279
Okay, got it.

1987
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:47,319
You just "baa."

1988
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,040
From now on, the three of us...
