1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,200
You're so close to the worst one.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,175
No, he's not the worst.

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:07,050
Gong Jun is the worst.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,000
No, I'm talking about you, bro.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,450
I'm the worst.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,750
I'm not bad.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,125
I'm a very kind woman.

8
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:14,975
Get to know me slowly.

9
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:15,700
You'll find out.

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,900
Who is the worst?

11
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,950
These two.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,100
About Naiwen's matter,

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,050
You don't need to get involved.

14
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,275
I know what you mean.

15
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:24,800
This is a matter between men.

16
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,600
Wait a minute.

17
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,900
You didn't understand.

18
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,150
I didn't understand.

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,275
It's fine.

20
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,200
Just watch the show.

21
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,200
What does that mean?

22
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,075
I once heard Jiaojiao tell me,

23
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,450
My wife said,

24
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,180
She said,

25
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,230
I'm a guy who's obsessed with looks.

26
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,830
Why are you looking at me like that?

27
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,780
I'm listening.

28
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,255
And then?

29
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,580
She said, why did we find you?

30
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,130
You mean she said,

31
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,330
She said bro is a guy who's obsessed with looks.

32
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,830
Do you want me to translate for you?

33
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,080
So, who is the guy obsessed with looks?

34
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,430
I think I'm in danger too.

35
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,330
It's too dangerous to sit next to him.

36
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,580
What happened between them?

37
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,280
He thinks that if he weren't here, I couldn't manage.

38
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
I can't keep translating for you all the time.

39
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,895
He'll seriously ask me

40
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:26,020
why I'm so tired.

41
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,720
I have to listen to what's being said here,

42
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,120
and I also have to translate for you.

43
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,750
Mosquito.

44
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,700
I'm a mosquito.

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Sprayed three times and it's still fine.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,450
Four times, five times.

47
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,350
Still not enough.

48
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,750
It's too thin.

49
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,150
Bro.

50
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,220
He keeps spraying this insecticide over and over.

51
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,770
Pest.

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,470
Tiny insecticide.

53
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,270
I left a little tipsy.

54
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,120
I could feel it.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,010
Why is no one acting in this area?

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,960
Here.

57
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,460
Get up.

58
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,135
A good bug, like a flea.

59
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,635
Fleas aren't very accurate.

60
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,510
If it's accurate, then yes.

61
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,995
Just a little try.

62
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:43,820
Escape unscathed.

63
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,470
That one is given to you to drink directly.

64
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,470
I only half retreated.

65
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,470
His one...

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,720
This one is basically done for, like your bug, cockroach, cockroach.

67
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,820
Barely hanging on.

68
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,920
Can still survive for a while.

69
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,670
Yours even recovered a bit.

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,390
Is it dead?

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:03,940
Oh.

72
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,290
In the end, it still died.

73
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,290
Which pest died?

74
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:08,690
In the end.

75
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,090
I'll just act as this one.

76
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,290
Is it that serious?

77
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,590
This is Seventh Brother.

78
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,940
Me.

79
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,470
Two Sun Honglei.

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,570
Mine is...

81
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,470
Ah.

82
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,970
Yours isn't quite right either.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,850
Big brother.

84
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,100
How could it not be right when I'm with you?

85
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,700
We've already performed three.

86
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,225
Why do all of yours end in death?

87
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,050
I protest.

88
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,400
This is slander against me.

89
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,400
I think they're targeting me.

90
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,300
Ah.

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:21,220
I'm not playing anymore.

92
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,360
My understanding of myself

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,910
I need to readjust it

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,785
Why is it, in other people's minds,

95
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,260
that I am always like this?

96
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,535
Why is it always like this?

97
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,235
Everyone's gone and I'm still guessing here

98
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:36,960
There's nothing I can do about it

99
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,935
They're all gone already

100
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:38,660
I'm done guessing

101
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,960
Then let's just give up

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,160
Right?

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,060
That's right, senior

104
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,560
That can't be

105
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,060
That's not possible

106
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,635
That's not possible

107
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:43,085
That's not possible

108
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:43,610
That's not possible

109
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,710
Big brother, big brother, big brother

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Big brother for life

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,460
This is definitely the limit

112
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,550
Dong dong dong

113
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
This guy is definitely a bass player

114
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,700
No matter what song he listens to, it's always the bass

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,700
He heard you talking

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,050
You betrayed my love and now you owe a debt to your conscience

117
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,400
In the end

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:23,940
I

119
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,540
tears fall down

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,840
I also thought I understood

121
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,470
I understand now

122
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,520
Sigh

123
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,570
Seems like I don't know again

124
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,520
Is there something wrong with my ears?

125
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,720
Wait a thousand years

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,930
Wait for a moment

127
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,030
Wait for a moment

128
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,280
I told you so.

129
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,030
Wait until it cools down.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,580
You were the one who wanted to break up.

131
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,280
Fine, let's break up.

132
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,430
Now you want to use it again.

133
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,730
True love calls me back.

134
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,530
Tricked me back by mistake.

135
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,080
That's right.

136
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,205
You were the one who insisted on breaking up.

137
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,080
Break up for good.

138
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,580
Now you want to use true love to coax me back.

139
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,480
Gong Jun.

140
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,980
He really is a nightingale.

141
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,480
Nightingale Jun.

142
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Not bad.

143
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,480
I thought it was Huluwa.

144
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,400
Did he sing it right?

145
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,150
You really know nothing about music.

146
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,500
You...

147
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,450
Be a bit more abstract.

148
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,500
Why not let him sing?

149
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,800
You can't hear anything at all.

150
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,225
Let me tell you.

151
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,150
You'll understand once he sings.

152
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,475
Play a song for me.

153
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,600
He can sing it.

154
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,800
You can even do it like this?

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,100
Bro

156
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,000
You can still sing nonsense, huh.

157
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,565
Come on.

158
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:06,990
Play it.

159
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,390
Three, two, one.

160
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,890
Just because I glanced at you one more time in the crowd.

161
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:13,990
Really?

162
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,740
Then it's the same.

163
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,940
The lyrics are all the same.

164
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,590
But we sang it out.

165
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:20,940
Jun

166
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,390
I did my best.

167
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,590
I did my best.

168
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,370
Across ten thousand timelines

169
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,770
Meeting in a sea of people

170
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,370
Want to see you

171
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,770
Just want to see you

172
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,470
Future and past

173
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,533
I just want to see you

174
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,195
We guessed it right.

175
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,020
Add two points.

176
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,745
Hey

177
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:43,870
You can even play like this?

178
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,285
Let's make this the last question.

179
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:46,810
Come on.

180
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,810
If you say you're competing with the elderly,

181
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,010
you'll never win, just admit that's how it is for us from now on.

182
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,310
Let's change the rules.

183
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,360
The last one to arrive has to be punished.

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,010
Alright.

185
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,260
The first one to arrive should be punished too.

186
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,960
Why?

187
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,800
Because you'll put pressure on others.

188
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,650
What if the first one is just on time?

189
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,850
That's too competitive.

190
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,500
Uncle Nai has a record showing you were the first to arrive today.

191
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:18,750
Hey.

192
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,825
It really is you, bro.

193
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,425
You really are the owner.

194
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:23,475
A distinguished owner.

195
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:24,125
A distinguished owner.

196
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:24,700
You're C.

197
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,475
You're C, huh.

198
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:25,750
Yes.

199
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,120
Everyone has a suggestion.

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,970
We think it's a great idea.

201
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,470
One person will wash socks, one will cook for everyone, and one will stand guard.

202
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,670
Who suggested the sock-washing thing?

203
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,270
Domestic ones don't count.

204
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,970
What does that mean?

205
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,945
Cooking is okay, right?

206
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:39,320
Yes.

207
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,930
Hey.

208
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,130
Tongtian Da

209
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,955
I got it right.

210
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,230
The grand road is wide.

211
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
Love isn't right.

212
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,830
So it's too much.

213
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,230
Coming to such a lively occasion,

214
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:24,480
it still has to be you.

215
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,430
You can eat, you can eat, you can eat, you can eat.

216
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,150
Third time

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,625
One more

218
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,150
Let me see

219
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,075
No

220
00:09:59,075 --> 00:09:59,700
I won't

221
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,650
Really?

222
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you want dumplings?

223
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm not coming

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,550
I don't dare eat wheat-based food

225
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,770
Get up

226
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,520
Mm-hmm

227
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,520
It's fine

228
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,895
Several brands don't have it

229
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:14,445
No beef

230
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:14,920
Beef

231
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,795
Is this beef?

232
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,070
Is there more beef coming?

233
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,270
You can have the rest

234
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,020
Don't think I'm beef, okay?

235
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,730
Are we searching for delicious food all over the world?

236
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,555
You keep doing it

237
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,530
I broke it
