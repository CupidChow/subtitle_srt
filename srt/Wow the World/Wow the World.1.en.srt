1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
The year 2025 AD

2
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,540
A brand new family was born on Earth

3
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,940
Earth is super fresh

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,620
The world is right before our eyes

5
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,220
Don't be fooled by how in sync they are now

6
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,420
Their first meeting was really something

7
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,620
Totally exposed

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,820
Here we go, sing louder

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,380
Come on, louder

10
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,300
Baby, our relationship is like a drop tower ride

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,660
Stop

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,619
Sit down

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,220
Hello, Brother Honglei

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,820
Brother Honglei

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,140
Put on my jacket

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,220
Here, bro

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,220
Here

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,580
I'm a bit cold, bro

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,260
I'm a bit cold today

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,620
Bro

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,140
Bro, have you been on set lately?

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,380
Or are you busy with other work?

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,380
Yeah, we're working on the script on set

24
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,740
That's the one

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,820
Take me with you

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,940
Can you take me with you?

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,660
Can you take me with you?

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,860
I can be on set

29
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,940
Help you relax, sing for you

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,500
I can also give massages

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,780
I can be there

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,580
I can join your crew and help you relax

33
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,620
I can give you massages

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm a professional ear cleaner

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,740
Isn't it hot wearing that hat, bro?

36
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,540
Some people are broken, some are bold.

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,380
Hello.

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,260
Greet first.

39
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,740
Then say hello to uncle.

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,260
Hello, uncle.

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,620
Hello, uncle.

42
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,620
Hello, uncle.

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,060
Push-ups.

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,980
Start doing push-ups, quickly.

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,620
Hurry, push-ups.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,180
Wait, warm up a bit.

47
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,980
Wait, warm up a bit.

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,340
Is this how people greet each other now?

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
Tell them I just started training.

50
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,860
Touch it.

51
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,980
I just... you...

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,060
Go ahead.

53
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,580
Take a look at that.

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,740
It's just that recently I...

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,620
I've been working out lately.

56
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,740
What do you mean?

57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,420
Uncle, you...

58
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,100
Speak properly to me.

59
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,140
Shout out loud.

60
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,419
Can I vent my frustration?

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,860
You're very knowledgeable.

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,020
You've met all kinds of people in this industry.

63
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,100
Can we change the cast for the show?

64
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,300
Anyway, there are a few who are even worse.

65
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,380
Just having Chen He here is enough.

66
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,740
As

67
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,140
one of the

68
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,860
older brothers in this team,

69
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,340
I think

70
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,660
we all have this

71
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,740
ability to bridge the gap between generations.

72
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,820
Is there more above?

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,140
Is there more above?

74
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,220
The three of us are all a bit clueless.

75
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,980
Does that count?

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,460
You're really clueless.

77
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,660
That's obvious.

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,900
You're too harsh.

79
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,020
Come up with some simple games.

80
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,740
It's not easy to get everything wrong.

81
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,340
A smart mind

82
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,940
has taken the high ground again.

83
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,060
This is

84
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,780
really smelly.

85
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,940
That stinky tofu.

86
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,420
I can eat it. I'll eat it, bro.

87
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,780
It smells so bad.

88
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,580
Can you stop covering your mouth?

89
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,940
This face is right in front of me.

90
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,060
It keeps appearing before my eyes.

91
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,340
What is this supposed to be?

92
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,780
I think, except for the three of us,

93
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,220
everyone else looks good.

94
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
You two,

95
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
that's between you two.

96
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,420
Alright.

97
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,660
When Chen He was thin,

98
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,740
he was actually quite handsome.

99
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,500
I don't think so.

100
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,260
He is

101
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,380
ugly-handsome, ugly-handsome.

102
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,340
Well said.

103
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,380
Sis, you're really bold, sis.

104
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,300
The two are complimenting each other.

105
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,340
until they can't keep it up anymore.

106
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,540
Naiwen,

107
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,460
you're the most

108
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,300
adorable person I've ever met.

109
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,980
This game,

110
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,260
if you had even a little

111
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,140
self-awareness,

112
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,060
you really couldn't say that.

113
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,660
You really are beautiful.

114
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,100
Of course.

115
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,540
Gong Jun, are you

116
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,140
the best singer in the world?

117
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,540
He really believes that about you.

118
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,020
That really hits home.

119
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Of course.

120
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,580
Didn't you call yourself the "King of Looks" yesterday?

121
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,100
I still have some self-awareness.

122
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,660
We all love watching "Zhe Yao."

123
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,020
Everyone loves watching "Zhe Yao."

124
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,500
What's the story of "Zhe Yao"?

125
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,940
What happened to them before?

126
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,339
There's also one that's always

127
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,540
offline, did you see? This one.

128
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:51,620
It's super fun.

129
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,579
What does that mean?

130
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,660
It's nothing, just watch the show.

131
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,620
Rough and bumpy

132
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,380
Why are there so many of them?

133
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,540
Gong Jun

134
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,860
Songbird Gong Jun

135
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,340
He's really skilled at singing.

136
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,820
Gong Jun is my idol.

137
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,460
Thank you so much.

138
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,820
Wrong.

139
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,580
Wrong.

140
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,420
You do it.

141
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,580
I told you to sing, so come on.

142
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,540
I'll give you a chance to sing.

143
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,180
Betray My Love

144
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,220
I'm letting you do it.

145
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,460
Don't talk.

146
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Bro, you can sing now.

147
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,420
Bro, sing a song.

148
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,020
I'll let you go first.

149
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,060
You guys haven't heard it.

150
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,460
I'll eat this microphone.

151
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,020
I won't.

152
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,540
He's so happy he can't even walk.

153
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,660
Let's help him back. Come on.

154
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,540
That's just fate.

155
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,100
Honglei.

156
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,580
This is a setup for me, isn't it?

157
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,940
From now on, call me BA.

158
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,780
What name does it spell out in pinyin?

159
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,980
Dad.

160
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,100
Dad.

161
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,900
I want to elope with him.

162
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,460
You want to elope with him?

163
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,380
Then what am I?

164
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,220
I really give up.

165
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,020
You guys...

166
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,860
It's their first time on a variety show.

167
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,220
This is so hard for me.

168
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm in the back.

169
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,980
Let me give you some support.

170
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,540
May the god of variety shows bless us.

171
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,140
God of variety shows.

172
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,460
No more talking, I'm heading out.

173
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,220
I'm so happy to be traveling.

174
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,420
So happy!

175
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
So beautiful.

176
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,740
It's stunning.

177
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,220
Malèna.

178
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,060
The first spot.

179
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,020
We'll unlock

180
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,900
many more spots.

181
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,380
So happy.

182
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,380
It's really comfortable.

183
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,980
This is just like a postcard.

184
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,380
It's my first time working away from home.

185
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,020
I've taken so many photos with my phone.

186
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,900
It's such a shame not to record a video here.

187
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,420
We love this place.

188
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,820
I don't want to leave either.

189
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,060
Nobody talk to me.

190
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,860
Gentleman's game

191
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,180
You say this is a gentleman's game

192
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,580
That's the least convincing

193
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,900
Yeah

194
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,060
He used an ironic approach

195
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,860
Father and son outfits

196
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,700
My dad

197
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,140
This is called

198
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,460
Splitting up

199
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,780
We choose to let you go first

200
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,620
We don't acknowledge that

201
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,460
Then we'll go first

202
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,300
We respect the elderly

203
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
We care for the young

204
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,260
We came to Italy

205
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,140
We really ran into bad people

206
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,300
Jun Jun yesterday

207
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,860
acted as a "troublemaker" all day

208
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,260
None of us said things like that

209
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,660
Like this

210
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,700
Meeting and parting

211
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,380
Both happen sometimes

212
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,180
Nothing lasts forever

213
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,940
But it excites you

214
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,540
Okay

215
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,420
I've always looked forward to

216
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,900
working with you

217
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
You ask me if I love you

218
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,940
I've seen the desert

219
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,420
What

220
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,980
I've seen dusk chase after dawn

221
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,740
Look at my expression

222
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,300
Yes

223
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,740
I know, I know that song

224
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,860
I've seen rain pour down in the desert

225
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,260
Check out fitness swimming.

226
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,860
Check out fitness swimming.

227
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,860
Check out fitness swimming.

228
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,060
Fitness swimming.

229
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,700
Stop fighting, you guys.

230
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
What kind of pose is that?

231
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,340
Control his movements.

232
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,860
Guess the word.

233
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,460
How did you guess that?

234
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,540
Master Liu

235
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,300
Could you make some scrambled eggs tonight?

236
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,980
And also fry some noodles.

237
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,820
Of course, no problem.

238
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,260
Handsome.

239
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,100
Yuning isn't just good-looking.

240
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,260
He's got some real skills.

241
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,020
His looks are

242
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,780
the least of his strengths.

243
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,460
Beautiful inside and out.

244
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,020
Brother Chen He

245
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,420
A toast to the most handsome in our group,

246
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,420
the best singer,

247
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,140
and the best at games.

248
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,299
Let's carry him, friends.

249
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,539
This is our team package.

250
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,220
I really don't want this show to end.

251
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,660
I'm so happy.

252
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,780
I can get energy from you all.

253
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,660
It makes me feel

254
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,100
like I'm together with you.

255
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,500
I really, really understand.

256
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,420
I truly understand.

257
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,260
We really are destined to meet.

258
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,580
Being able to gather here together

259
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Each of us is different.

260
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:34,980
But

261
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,740
the chemistry between us is amazing.

262
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,060
It's only been twelve days.

263
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,180
It feels like we've been together

264
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,220
for half a year.

265
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,420
I'm really happy.

266
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,020
Thank you for bringing these eight people together.

267
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,420
I've learned so much from my younger brothers and sisters.

268
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,020
Thank you all.

269
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,980
What did I learn?

270
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
I'm not telling you.

271
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,180
I've absorbed a lot of your energy.

272
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,020
Forgive me for being wild and loving freedom all my life.

273
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,020
But I'm also afraid of falling one day.

274
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,100
Is the world big?

275
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,220
It's huge.

276
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,780
But when people from all over the world come together,

277
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,660
you realize the world is actually small.

278
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,580
I love China.

279
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,300
The Earth feels so fresh.

280
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
The world is right in front of us.
