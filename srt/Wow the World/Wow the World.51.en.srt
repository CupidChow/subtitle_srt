1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,350
Darn it.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,350
My heart aches.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:05,900
My heart aches.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,675
Where did you go?

5
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:07,350
Come back quickly.

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,900
It's so hot.

7
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,950
Turn on the fan.

8
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,650
Let’s have a mini burger.

9
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,800
Does it look tasty to you?

10
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,675
Are you buying or not?

11
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:16,050
Seriously.

12
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,000
Open your heart.

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:19,900
OK.

14
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,490
Once we start the deal,

15
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,290
One, two, three, sing.

16
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,140
Where is Spring?

17
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,540
Where is Spring?

18
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,890
Spring is in the lush green forests.

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,290
There are flowers here.

20
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,490
There is grass here.

21
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,790
And Little Li who can sing.

22
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:41,955
Not a single mistake.

23
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:42,430
I feel like

24
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,380
Not a single mistake.

25
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,480
Lin Yi kept jumping the beat.

26
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,705
Jumping the beat isn’t wrong, right?

27
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,030
Did we say jumping the beat counts as wrong?

28
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,280
Lin Yi got it all wrong.

29
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,380
All wrong.

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,230
Saying “all wrong” means he sang everything.

31
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,960
Impossible.

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,735
He was right next to me.

33
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,310
He definitely didn’t sing it all.

34
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,123
No.

35
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:03,735
Definitely not all wrong.

36
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:04,485
I want to see the replay.

37
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,135
How could it be all wrong?

38
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,310
He just told me he didn’t make any mistakes.

39
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,185
Lin Yi’s moves.

40
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:08,710
Moves.

41
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,610
The moves were wrong.

42
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,910
Is that it?

43
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,885
I got tired sitting on this side the first round.

44
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:22,760
Let me switch sides.

45
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,410
Come on.

46
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:24,810
Lin Yi.

47
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,810
Tell everyone.

48
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,960
How did you do it?

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:37,830
Oh.

50
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,930
Then it really was all wrong.

51
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:42,830
I admit it.

52
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,330
Admit it.

53
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,480
We’re doing it together, right?

54
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,580
Let’s do his first.

55
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,880
The love you want is too perfect.

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,760
I’ll never learn it.

57
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,210
Let’s switch sides.

58
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,135
My right side is numb.

59
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,710
I have another animal.

60
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,560
My animal just now was also for two people.

61
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,360
One, two, three, sing—my love has already flown away.

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,710
Already flown away.

63
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,460
Love Bird.

64
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,010
I can’t find it.

65
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,760
Where’s your butt?

66
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,660
Neither of us can find where our butts are.

67
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,410
Zero one, minus six points.

68
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,260
Okay.

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,560
As long as there are points.

70
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,520
Yu Wen.

71
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,620
Minus two points.

72
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,120
You’re a genius.

73
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,970
Sorry, I’ve already revealed my real name.

74
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,170
Genius, you’ve found your track.

75
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,420
I’ll give this chance to Lin Yi.

76
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,020
Makes sense.

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,320
Because he got it all wrong once.

78
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,595
Do I still have hope?

79
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,470
I’ve got it here.

80
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,580
I am—

81
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,380
Leave your phone number

82
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,580
Never willing to let the boss go home

83
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,480
You’ve fallen in love before too

84
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,160
You were once unable to let go as well

85
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
I need in-ear monitors for this

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,910
I can’t hear what I’m singing

87
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,623
Me

88
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,260
I went in together with Ning Ge

89
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,710
I went in with Ning Ge

90
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,410
Your soul went in with me

91
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,510
But your voice didn’t go in

92
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,710
The voice didn’t go in

93
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,410
How did I do? Not bad, right?

94
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,210
I think this round was okay

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Lin Yi loses five points

96
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:42,970
Sigh

97
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,320
Not bad

98
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,320
We had to separate back then

99
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,720
If we split, then so be it

100
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,370
Now we need true love to win them back

101
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,670
Love isn’t something you can buy just because you want it

102
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Let Zheng Kai and Bai Fangshou love

103
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I’m not wrong

104
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,510
I’m not wrong

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,460
But I really can’t find the key next to you

106
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,960
Really can’t find it

107
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,710
Why did you start reciting later?

108
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,410
I don’t know

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,360
Let’s just not recite, that’s it

110
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,010
What cheese?

111
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,360
This kid tastes good

112
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,360
What’s up?

113
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,685
Didn’t taste anything special

114
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,010
It’s a bit salty

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,760
Don’t look at me

116
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,310
See, I love to eat

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,495
Do you really think it’s not tasty?

118
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:06,370
Not quite there

119
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,345
Not quite there

120
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:08,370
Not at that level

121
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,670
So in your eyes, what would make your food special?

122
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,470
This fitness meal is spot on

123
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,470
Did you eat that meat?

124
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,470
Pretty tasty

125
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,520
That one’s really tough

126
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,400
Tough is tough, but not...

127
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,300
Mushy

128
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,000
Mushy

129
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,350
Yeah

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,010
Can you spread this on?

131
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,710
Zhuan Yu, take a bite of half first

132
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,010
Get to the juicy part inside

133
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,810
How is it different from just eating it directly?

134
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,960
I’ve already eaten half

135
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,810
Why do I need it?

136
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,910
How long did you grind it?

137
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,010
I just basically evened it out, that’s all

138
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,010
Hey

139
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,060
I think it's Lin Yi

140
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,410
Because opening and closing your eyes is your weakness

141
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,560
How about we redraw?

142
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,860
Opening and closing your eyes are both your weaknesses

143
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,735
Lin Yi

144
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,110
You were just waiting for your teammate to open their eyes, right?

145
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,460
There's no mutual recognition round in this

146
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,260
Don't worry

147
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,960
So there's really no mutual recognition round?

148
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:42,480
Come on

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,680
Let's go

150
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,030
Go ahead

151
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,680
Alright then

152
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,830
Let's vote him out in the first round

153
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,580
Who are you?

154
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,168
I think it's you

155
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:56,230
That's what I did just now

156
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,280
He was still watching people over there

157
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,880
So accurate

158
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,230
Why are you acting so strange today?

159
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:02,770
You

160
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,920
Hong Lei has a problem

161
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,070
That's suspicious

162
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,420
Both of the old couple have issues

163
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,095
We played well together

164
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,120
There's a reason for that

165
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,870
Did you see anyone add me?

166
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,195
Just Wen Ge

167
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:21,020
There's one more

168
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,970
Hard to object

169
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,045
I only saw Nai Wen Ge

170
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,620
But it really doesn't feel intentional

171
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,920
He didn't do it on purpose

172
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,995
Is it only possible if both sides pull?

173
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:30,620
The back didn't move

174
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,870
But the front was still moving

175
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
Then my leg was left behind

176
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:34,870
But

177
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,095
Hong Lei's butt was sticking out, there's definitely something wrong

178
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:38,520
Sticking out

179
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,520
You have to look at the feet

180
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,530
The water is pretty deep here

181
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,030
If He Ge is steady this round

182
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,530
It must be Nai Wen Ge or Lei Ge who stepped on his heel

183
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,905
That's a problem too

184
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:54,905
This is the Dingzi Step

185
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:55,580
There's something wrong here

186
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,630
Very straight, very straight

187
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,580
Makes sense

188
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,780
You can't touch logic

189
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,060
Is Nai Wen Ge's problem with his shoes or his feet?

190
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,785
I just asked Nai Wen Ge

191
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,060
He said it's the shoes
