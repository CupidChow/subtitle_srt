1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,150
Let's use our imagination, okay?

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,150
Be as abstract as you can.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,650
Let's go fully abstract to get the first word.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,275
Turn and smile, three, two, one.

5
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,050
Do the move.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,550
I can't do it.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Make a heart, three, two, one.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,680
None of you understand me.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,480
You're not being sincere.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
This is a pen.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,330
That's a heart gesture.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,330
Act cute, three, two, one.

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,180
Thank you.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,180
I'm on the subway.

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,930
That's how it is.

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,830
Because it's a freeze-frame.

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,080
So you can't really see it.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,380
Then show us.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,390
That's called acting cute.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,090
Isn't that a star?

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,490
No.

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,790
That's just... oh.

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,415
Do it again.

24
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:56,540
Try again, make it more natural.

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,440
Here it comes.

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,290
I'll go first.

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,710
No.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,360
If you don't want to lose points on this one,

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,810
unless you really agree.

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,110
Like, if you see fans in the future,

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,560
No.

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,310
It has to be like this.

33
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,610
That's how the boss wants to play.

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,360
Then those two won't lose points either.

35
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,180
You.

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,580
Get ready.

37
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,405
Oh no.

38
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:35,230
Hello, handsome guys.

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,700
Nice.

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Check out my plate.

41
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,250
Got it.

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,250
Just say a few words.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,950
I'm really happy to be on this show.

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,150
This show is so much fun.

45
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm happy every day.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,050
That's really rare.

47
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,825
Even Honglei said to us privately,

48
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:01,900
that getting all of us together

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,960
with such good chemistry is not easy.

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,185
I'll have a drink.

51
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:07,610
I'll drink.

52
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,260
Thank you, everyone.

53
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,960
Come on.

54
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,710
Isn't this pretty nice?

55
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,910
You can write his name later.

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,360
I can usually write one name.

57
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,860
That's how I do it.

58
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,585
I put Simon in the middle.

59
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,810
Then I write all our surnames around.

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,220
1234567

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,470
Yes.

62
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,770
And eight, then give me a crown.

63
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,720
Here.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,420
Okay.

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,370
What color? Blue?

66
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,745
Okay.

67
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:50,770
Earth's color.

68
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,270
Yes.

69
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,270
I want this one to be in.

70
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,820
Or that green.

71
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,270
With the other name.

72
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,420
The other small name.

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,020
Yes.

74
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,420
Oh my god.

75
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,520
You're doing it like this?

76
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,045
Oh my god.

77
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,220
It's done like this.

78
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,770
He did it by hand.

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
This is so good.

80
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,220
Oh.

81
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,270
He's amazing.

82
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,770
Simon.

83
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,920
And his seven

84
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,570
brothers and sisters.

85
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,340
Sorry.

86
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,440
We're being a bit strict.

87
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,565
That last kiss.

88
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:25,990
No.

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,890
Did I cause trouble with that kiss?

90
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,690
Stand up.

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,240
Dad.

92
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,690
Like this.

93
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,490
Lin Yi, come over here.

94
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,240
Stand here.

95
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,190
Try one by one.

96
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,515
It's your turn to taste.

97
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:33,815
Here we go.

98
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:34,490
Taste it, taste it.

99
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:57,980
Thirty-nine point six yuan.

100
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,630
You can't leave.

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,540
You have to stay and pay the bill.

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,290
No.

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,690
I'm so annoyed.

104
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,990
He really ran off.

105
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,090
He really left.

106
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,190
That's life.

107
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,690
That's the cycle.

108
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,090
I won't run.

109
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,490
But others will.

110
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,790
Who started it?

111
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,640
Who caused this mess?

112
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,915
Honestly,

113
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,240
I think our meal is richer than theirs.

114
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,540
We can't fit everything on the plate.

115
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,065
Did everyone order?

116
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:30,690
Didn't we order?

117
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,540
The three of us, this, this, this is this...

118
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,840
It's disgusting.

119
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,975
Is it good?

120
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:42,700
It's a bit fishy.

121
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,850
It's okay.

122
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,800
This is really tasty.

123
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,350
Yeah.

124
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,600
Right.

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
It just tastes bloody.

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,050
And it's old blood.

127
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,238
I'm losing it emotionally.

128
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:51,775
Bro,

129
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,150
After spending a day with them,

130
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,750
I think those two can't taste anything.

131
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,475
No matter what bad food I eat these days,

132
00:04:58,475 --> 00:04:59,500
they never taste anything.

133
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,025
It's good!

134
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:00,350
This one.

135
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,250
This is really delicious.

136
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
This is actually pretty good.

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,260
I'd give this an eight.

138
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,410
I think this really deserves an eight.

139
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,110
I think noodles...

140
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,185
I always say nothing tastes good.

141
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,560
He always says it's tasty.

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,610
I'm starting to doubt my life.

143
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,775
This dish looks really healthy.

144
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:25,600
This is a healthy meal, a light dish.

145
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,575
Should I try this?

146
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:35,525
I'm afraid I can't handle this.

147
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,300
It's super salty.

148
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,900
Is it tasty?

149
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,850
Stew.

150
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,350
You kept asking others to recommend dishes.

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,000
You should order.

152
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:00,830
You.

153
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,680
It's all you, right?

154
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,480
Fine, you do it.

155
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,380
It never ends.

156
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,765
What is this?

157
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,740
The outside is potato.

158
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,240
Inside is ham.

159
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,540
And cheese.

160
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,990
It's made into a filling.

161
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,790
The inside is soft.

162
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,540
Are these small green peppers fried?

163
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,940
Why does it taste like this?

164
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,440
What is it?

165
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,540
Guys, there's basically no seasoning.

166
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,890
Just a bit of salt and oil, the shrimp is simply pan-fried, nothing weird.

167
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,640
No other flavor.

168
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,140
Just salty.

169
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,640
It's kind of like the dried shrimp we eat at home.

170
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,490
I'm really curious.

171
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,940
When the barnacle comes over, there's a strong smell.

172
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,340
Let me try one.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,550
Tasty.

174
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,700
I'll give it a try.

175
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,950
You.

176
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,200
I think at best it's a six out of ten.

177
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,520
But there's no need to eat that kind of thing.

178
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,820
This is eel.

179
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,370
That one.

180
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,020
That doesn't taste like eel.

181
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,695
But it has the flavor of steamed eel.

182
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,745
The steamed part is a bit like the bāyú we eat.

183
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:31,345
Have you tried it?

184
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:31,920
It's that kind.

185
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
Like deep-sea fish.

186
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,955
Hello, everyone.

187
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:38,780
I'm Lin Yi.

188
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,180
Height: 1.87 meters.

189
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,930
Weight: 68 kilograms.

190
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,230
Graduated from Beijing Sport University, majoring in ballroom dance.

191
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
You said you prepared a song?

192
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,330
What do you want to hear?

193
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,880
I can sing anything.

194
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,280
Sing your best song.

195
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,550
Let's dance together.

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Waltz.

197
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,625
Waltz.

198
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,775
Why is it fine?

199
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,450
I'll lead you.

200
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,800
Turn.

201
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,940
They're already in front of you.

202
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,090
No.

203
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,590
Did you lose?

204
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,230
No, no, no.

205
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,955
Okay, hands.

206
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:44,930
Put your hand here.

207
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,380
Right.

208
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,480
Hello, everyone.

209
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,880
My name is Jin Jing.

210
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,480
I'm a famous beauty in China.

211
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,320
That's my introduction.

212
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,120
So you prepared a song?

213
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,720
Let's do it.

214
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,170
You're really good.

215
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,710
If you want to show off, just do it.

216
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,810
Why drag me up here?

217
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,210
I need to make it a bit complicated too.

218
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,060
Start crying.

219
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,610
Fifty-fifty.

220
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,835
Na Wen, give us one.

221
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:26,210
Next year, fifty-five.

222
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,550
Hurry, it's getting cold.

223
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,130
Na Wen.

224
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,155
When it comes to being charming,

225
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,118
I'm not as charming as you.

226
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,230
I think you're better at being charming.

227
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,230
Let me tell you.

228
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,280
Only one person can do it, I don't want to join this round.

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,855
OK.

230
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:01,880
Come on, come on.

231
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,380
I'll take off my glasses.

232
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,255
How do I do it? It's fine.

233
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:06,930
Darn it, bro.

234
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,480
Stretch your philtrum and act cute.

235
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,820
Person.

236
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,320
That's scary.

237
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,970
Couldn't find anyone.

238
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,070
This is a basic spinning technique.

239
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,520
I won't.

240
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,645
I ask Mr. Li Naiwen to stay away from me.

241
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,083
I'm afraid he'll hurt me.

242
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,320
I'll stand in the middle.

243
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I'm in the middle.

244
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,845
Can you spin like you just did?

245
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,070
I spun really well just now.

246
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,200
I spun half a turn more.

247
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Let me do it.

248
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,400
How do I do it?

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,425
How do I do it?

250
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,000
One dares to teach.

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,700
One dares to learn.
