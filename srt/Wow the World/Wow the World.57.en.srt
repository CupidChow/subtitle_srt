1
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,030
How do you make the soup so white?

2
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,330
You just stir-fry the meat first, and it turns white.

3
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,530
Yes, just lightly fry the meat first.

4
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,330
After you get the oil out,

5
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,680
rinse it with hot water.

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,330
Then it becomes white.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,680
About 30% of your soup,

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,545
Add chopped scallion and cilantro, and the soup tastes great.

9
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,870
The lamb offal is sliced perfectly.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,220
Chef Liu, thank you so much.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,845
Let me tell you,

12
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,145
If you keep praising me, I might cut my hand.

13
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:52,720
That's just how people are.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,320
The more you praise, the faster the knife goes.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,670
The knife is about to speed up.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,420
All right.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,970
Everyone,

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,770
Oh wow,

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,320
This...

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,955
This looks really good.

21
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:06,580
Just look at it, come on.

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,230
That's great.

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,480
So good.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,830
Really?

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,930
It's especially good.

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,830
Really, it's excellent.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,730
How is it so fresh?

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,730
Chef Liu,

29
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,405
Why doesn't this taste gamey at all?

30
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:19,505
Actually, the lamb itself is very good.

31
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:21,380
I noticed it was great while cooking today.

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:21,795
And then,

33
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,145
You need to do a lot of prep work first.

34
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:23,670
Soak it for a while.

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,470
Soak out the blood.

36
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,820
Then rinse off the blood.

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,495
Then stew it again.

38
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:28,270
Then it's fine.

39
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,070
Let's dig in.

40
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,470
Go ahead.

41
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,720
When two armies meet, the brave wins.

42
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,920
Listen to me,

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,570
Listen,

44
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,530
The four of us are one team.

45
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,530
They're another team of four.

46
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,655
Among our four,

47
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:46,405
There are four, but not really four.

48
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:47,130
You've all seen it, right?

49
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,280
Only one of us has the word.

50
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,355
But,

51
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:51,205
The one with the word

52
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:52,305
has to pretend not to have it.

53
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:53,255
Because the other three don't have it.

54
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,530
I mean, mainly to fool them.

55
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,230
Mainly to trick them.

56
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,630
And then,

57
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,630
We ask them questions.

58
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,255
They answer yes or no.

59
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,080
After we guess it,

60
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,540
they guess which of us has the word.

61
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,790
See?

62
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,115
Ever since I got my task for tomorrow,

63
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:10,790
I instantly relaxed, you know?

64
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,240
Excuse me,

65
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,640
Is it a person's name?

66
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Our game is called "Guess the Name."

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,510
That's a wasted question.

68
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,110
Spin it yourself.

69
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,285
Hey,

70
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:23,885
I'll spin it myself.

71
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:25,523
If it doesn't land on me, you can't look.

72
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:26,360
Don't look.

73
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,135
It's not me.

74
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:28,110
I'll spin it like this.

75
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,910
Okay, okay.

76
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,660
This one, right?

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,270
I...

78
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,495
I don't even know now

79
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:51,670
if I'm happy or not.

80
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,270
How's your Cantonese?

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Yes.

82
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,840
Separate.

83
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Not separate.

84
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,590
I killed yours.

85
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,665
I killed yours.

86
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:33,040
Child.

87
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,590
Yours.

88
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,990
Let's start.

89
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,890
That's right.

90
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,240
I am.

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,320
And.

92
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,870
Invincible in the world

93
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,820
Tang Bohu, one of a kind, in perfect harmony with nature

94
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,970
Tang Bohu

95
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,210
Every day in the court

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,160
Just

97
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,110
Tang Bohu, Tang Bohu, Tang Bohu

98
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,560
I am Tang Bohu

99
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,460
Today, you and I are happy

100
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:36,105
One by one, seven characters, 123123, correct

101
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:42,930
What are the first three characters? One, two, three. First three characters, correct

102
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,020
Squat down

103
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,745
Squat down

104
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:46,270
Correct

105
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,170
Walk

106
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,020
Walk

107
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,420
Correct

108
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,620
Hey

109
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,795
Three characters

110
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:52,570
Three characters

111
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,520
Try again

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,320
Which three characters are these?

113
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,520
Three characters

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,470
Three characters

115
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,870
Correct

116
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,745
Three squats

117
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:01,170
Walk

118
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,670
Correct

119
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,570
What is it?

120
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,730
Dog?

121
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,130
No

122
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,280
Person?

123
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,480
Not you

124
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,780
Me, correct

125
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,155
Squat and walk

126
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:14,830
Squat and walk

127
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,155
Correct

128
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:15,930
What is it?

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,355
What does it mean when I squat and walk?

130
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:19,743
Correct

131
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,805
I squat and walk

132
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,680
It's me

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,030
Me

134
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,405
I squat down

135
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:24,930
I squat down

136
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,880
What does walking mean?

137
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,130
OK

138
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,405
OK

139
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,230
Stand up

140
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,330
Stand up

141
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,230
Stand up

142
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,980
Stand up

143
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,630
Higher

144
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,080
Higher, higher, higher

145
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,580
Correct

146
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,430
Squat down, squat down

147
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,730
Eat low

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,650
First three characters

149
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,125
One, two, three

150
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,550
Wearing a hairpin on the head

151
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,650
Big flying bird

152
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,550
Bird, bird

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,050
Big jump

154
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,550
Correct

155
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,350
Little dwarf, big jump

156
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,375
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

157
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,175
I think that's enough

158
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:03,800
I think that's enough

159
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,700
We can definitely score points

160
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,810
Li Naiwen

161
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,610
Yes, yes, yes

162
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,260
Okay, okay, okay

163
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,135
What's up with Li Naiwen?

164
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,060
Is it okay now?

165
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,685
Our team will definitely win

166
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:11,210
I think

167
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,830
Ten characters

168
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,780
Ten pools

169
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
How does he talk without moving his lips?

170
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,180
Nine characters

171
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,630
Move your right hand

172
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,100
Right hand

173
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,050
No, his mouth is always like this

174
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,850
Maybe the musical is handled more safely

175
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,650
Then let's go with safety

176
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,050
Are you sure?

177
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,300
Bro

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,300
I'm not

179
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,350
Maybe after I sing, you won't understand anything

180
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,900
Later, it's going to be a rap

181
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,075
All the good things

182
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:19,750
Were just yesterday's intoxication

183
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,675
A hint of bitterness

184
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,750
Is the taste of today

185
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,120
Name the song in 10 seconds.

186
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,595
Wait a moment.

187
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:33,870
Hold on.

188
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,195
Wait.

189
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:35,020
Just a second.

190
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,370
Too fast.

191
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:36,870
That's too quick.

192
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,370
Sadly, it's not you.

193
00:07:43,930 --> 00:08:00,880
Did you recognize it?

194
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,450
I recognized it.

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Chase!

196
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,875
Go after it!

197
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,550
My dream.

198
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,875
I chase with the wind.

199
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,400
Chase!

200
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,450
The light at the end of the lock.

201
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,975
Chase!

202
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:10,375
Go after it!

203
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,450
My little landlord.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,850
Is it okay?

205
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
Can I?

206
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,000
Does this get extra points?

207
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,140
How's your Cantonese?

208
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,940
Uncle.

209
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,540
Heartless.

210
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,340
Action.

211
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,240
Tang Bao, both kind and beautiful.

212
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,140
Tang Bao.

213
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,670
Can he speak Mandarin?

214
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,520
I killed this one.

215
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,130
I'm Tang Bao from Bing Village, without a mom and with a smart marriage.

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,580
Tang Bao, Tang Bao, Tang Bao.

217
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,280
Xiao Yi.

218
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,930
Wait a bit.

219
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,930
Are you trying to make things hard for me?

220
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,815
It's really fine now.

221
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,440
That's a bit sad.

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,190
I can't watch anymore.

223
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,740
That's enough.

224
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,565
But I think Lin Yi can really promote Cantonese.

225
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:33,040
I can treat this as a double team.

226
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,540
I need this at every meal.

227
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,870
I want to eat Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

228
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,870
I'll make you Pigeon Jumps Off Cliff.

229
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,495
Do you want to order more?

230
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:49,320
I won't make it hard for you.

231
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,620
I just want that sandwich with chocolate spread.

232
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,670
Sandwiches are easy to get.

233
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,720
That's why I said I won't make it hard for her.

234
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,870
What about the chocolate spread?

235
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,240
Little brother.

236
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,940
Let me have some too.

237
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:03,765
Brother.

238
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:04,190
You go ahead.

239
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,090
But I haven't found anything to go with it yet.

240
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,090
I want to eat one.

241
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,540
But it's salty inside.

242
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,740
Honestly, it's pretty tasty.

243
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,690
You've already had six or seven hundred calories.

244
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Food.

245
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Eating is about six or seven hundred calories.

246
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,280
The first three characters.

247
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,130
Pickled vegetables.

248
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,030
Is dessert better?

249
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,380
Let's have two desserts.

250
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,430
Just the two of us.
