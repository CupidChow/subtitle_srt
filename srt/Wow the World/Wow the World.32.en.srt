1
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,640
Today

2
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
The Earth team members

3
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,640
have arrived in southern Italy,

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,120
on the eastern coast of Sicily,

5
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,040
in a historic city

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,280
called Catania.

7
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Catania

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,120
not only boasts stunning volcanic scenery,

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
but is also the hometown of the opera master

10
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,680
Bellini.

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,760
Within the city,

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,360
there are well-preserved

13
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,120
Baroque architectural complexes.

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
Scorching volcanic ash

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,280
has buried this place many times,

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,640
but every time,

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,640
the people of Catania have bent down to clear the dust,

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,880
rebuilding their home

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,480
brick by brick.

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
They are optimistic and positive,

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
with passion and resilience,

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,400
creating on Sicily

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
many touching legends.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,480
Morning.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
Morning.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,360
I like these old houses.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They're beautiful.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,720
So pretty.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
They have so much character.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,600
Really full of character.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,080
I just turned around,

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
so handsome!

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,240
Of course.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
Our Junjun

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,320
What can you do?

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,440
Every day when I see him,

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
his good looks

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
just hit me like a wave.

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,920
Such deep eyes.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
How is his nose so high?

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,680
Thank you so much.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
That's enough.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are his eyelashes so long?

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,720
Those lashes...

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
So cool.

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,880
On my right side...

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Enough.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
I'm speechless now.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,960
Really.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm telling you,

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,960
it's not puffy at all.

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,400
It looks so smooth today.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,320
Thank you.

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,720
Go compliment Xingxu next, wait a bit.

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Just wait.

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,160
I'll compliment you too.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll praise everyone, okay?

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
When will it be my turn?

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Today.

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,080
Will it be my turn before tonight?

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,880
Yes.

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,800
I'll wait until my swelling goes down to compliment you.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,880
How about when I'm cooking?

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,400
Then I can praise you from the heart.

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
What do you mean?

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Now we're heading to

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,960
a very local

68
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
market.

69
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,360
It's just as lively as the morning markets in northern China.

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,800
The atmosphere is just as bustling.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
It's only open in the morning.

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,720
It closes at noon.

73
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,160
We can go experience

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,840
the authentic European street vibe.

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
Alright.

76
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
We're here.

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,960
This looks delicious.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,760
A northern-style market.

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,920
This is the market, right?

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,560
Hello.

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:46,960
Hello.

82
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,800
Hello.

83
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
This is cute—a little pink elephant.

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Thank you.

85
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,000
Are you actors?

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,040
No.

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,760
My brother.

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,280
Are you saying he's my dad?

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,680
Yes.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,320
Is he very famous?

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Her brother.

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
I'll be in charge of buying fruit.

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
What does Didi want to eat?

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
I want to eat peaches.

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,760
Buy one of these.

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
Okay.

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,280
This one.

98
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Thank you.

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,000
Very good.

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,320
Excuse me, I'd like this one.

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,600
No.

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,960
Yes.

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Alright.

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,520
Sign language duo.

105
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,160
Okay.

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,720
Very good.

107
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,760
He also has a lucky cat.

108
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,720
Can you believe it?

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
It looks just like you.

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,040
Thanks a lot.

111
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
You even praised me this morning.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
These eyelashes are long.

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
Doesn't this look like you?

114
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,640
Goodbye.

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,600
Bye.

116
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
Is this beef?

117
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,840
Beef.

118
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Okay.

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
Look, this sausage is just like ours in China.

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,120
Same shape.

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,560
And it looks pretty similar too.

122
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,080
Like the one we had in Lemon Town last time.

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,040
It's a bit like Sichuan sausage.

124
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
Yeah, that's how it is in Sichuan.

125
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
But the color is different.

126
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
Alright, thank you.

127
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,000
Thanks.

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
Goodbye.

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Let's go.

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,440
Liu Yuning.

131
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll buy you a pair of pants.

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
What is this?

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Put it on your arm.

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
Cut it in the middle and use it as a sun sleeve.

135
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Smells great.

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,400
Really fragrant.

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Super fragrant.

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,720
Very sour.

139
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
This is really sour.

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
Perfect.

141
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,960
What?

142
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,120
Perfect.

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
He said it's sour.

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,760
You said it's perfect.

145
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,400
So which one is telling the truth?

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,280
Xingxu only knows this word.

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Okay.

148
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
How do you say "sour"?

149
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,480
In Italian.

150
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,960
Let me give you a fair judgment.

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
It's sour, but...

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
So now you're trying to make up for it, huh?

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,120
Tastes great.

154
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
Isn't it good?

155
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
Cheers.

156
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,360
I think it's good.

157
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,280
Hey, good-looking people, who are you?

158
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,600
We're from China.

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,360
You're from China?

160
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,200
We're all from China.

161
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
Hello.

162
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
You look great.

163
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,440
Thank you.

164
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
They're really enthusiastic.

165
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,960
All very outgoing.

166
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,560
Feels like everyone in this country is extroverted.

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Really.

168
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,800
Three.

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
Four.

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,840
Okay.

171
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
This loofah is amazing.

172
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,880
Here we are.

173
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,960
Bro.

174
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
You ended up buying this after all.

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,400
Yeah.

176
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,240
Is this a scallion?

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
What is this thing?

178
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,960
What kind of gourd is this?

179
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Loofah.

180
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Something happened.

181
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,120
Let me tell you.

182
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,400
Something went wrong.

183
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,120
You broke what Sun Honglei likes.

184
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,040
It's broken.

185
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,040
Watch your wording.

186
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,160
This is Sun Honglei's favorite thing.

187
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,040
Now we don't need to cut it.

188
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,000
Right?

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,760
No need to cut it.

190
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,320
Something happened.

191
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,520
Sun Honglei, what you bought

192
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,360
matches your clothes well.

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,320
Is there another fan?

194
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,440
You use it first.

195
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
No need.

196
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
Stop talking about it, hurry up.

197
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,760
No need to be polite.

198
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840
He's really a good guy.

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm being polite with you.

200
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
Sicily,

201
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,440
and all of Italy,

202
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,480
has a unique culture.

203
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,520
It's the tradition of street performances.

204
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,680
Before you all arrived,

205
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,480
we already got permission for street performances.

206
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
Tonight,

207
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,800
we're going to have a big event.

208
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,000
A big event.

209
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,280
Everyone will go out onto the street

210
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,440
and join the street performers

211
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
to perform together.

212
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,400
Liu Yuning is the main act today.

213
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
We're all your assistants today.

214
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,680
No.

215
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,360
Today,

216
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
my voice is hoarse, bro.

217
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,560
My voice is a bit hoarse today.

218
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,600
Then let Wen take the lead today.

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Wen, stage play.

220
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,000
No.

221
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
Today we still need to rely on Gong Jun.

222
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
The songbird.

223
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,120
He has to perform.

224
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,760
Let's add Chen Xingxu too.

225
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,920
Chen Xingxu.

226
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,480
Don't forget,

227
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
we grew up together.

228
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
I don't want to

229
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,200
be like this with you.

230
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,880
This is the songbird.

231
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,840
This is the canary.

232
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,600
I really want to hear Chen Xingxu sing.

233
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,280
I really don't need to, bro.

234
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,600
I want to hear a song.

235
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,160
"Buffalo Record"

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,480
No,

237
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
"The Mercury Song"

238
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
What's "Buffalo Record"?

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,240
I said it wrong.

240
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Sorry.

241
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,160
Chen Xingxu.

242
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,080
If you don't want to be the "spicy guy,"

243
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,000
just sing a song.

244
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
Go ahead.

245
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,760
We never kill the vibe here.

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,720
I'm embarrassing myself abroad.

247
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,240
You...

248
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,960
No,

249
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,080
This is our own gathering.

250
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,960
We're all friends.

251
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,440
It's not embarrassing.

252
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
I remember learning a song in school.

253
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,600
From Les Misérables,

254
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,240
"Stars."

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
"Stars."

256
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,360
Go ahead, little bro.

257
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,360
So much hidden talent here.

258
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,400
"Stars" is the hardest song

259
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,920
in Les Misérables.

260
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,720
My teacher would kill me.

261
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
Apologize to your teacher first.

262
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Sorry, teacher.

263
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
I've embarrassed you.

264
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,680
It's okay.

265
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,920
Your senior is here.

266
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
Both seniors are cheering for you.

267
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,320
We have to listen carefully.

268
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm going all out.

269
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,400
No shame now.

270
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,160
Doesn't matter anymore.

271
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,760
Should've done this earlier.

272
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,840
In the darkness,

273
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,800
until we meet again.

274
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,240
He knows how to walk in the dark.

275
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,480
I will follow the guidance.

276
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
And those who walk with integrity

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,440
should be rewarded.

278
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,200
Nice, well done.

279
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,520
Good.

280
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,720
Xingxu

281
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,240
Tonight, you prep the ingredients here.

282
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,200
We'll cook together.

283
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
To welcome them back.

284
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Sure.

285
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,560
That was an amazing performance.

286
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
The restaurant we're in now

287
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,640
This restaurant

288
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,200
Their specialty is eggplant.

289
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,080
Sicily's fertile volcanic soil

290
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
and abundant sunshine

291
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
produce a rich, tender texture

292
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,960
and intensely flavorful eggplants.

293
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
Let's eat, I'm hungry.

294
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
Please have a seat.

295
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,200
Hello.

296
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
Hello.

297
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Eggplant is

298
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,440
an essential ingredient in Sicilian cuisine.

299
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,480
Locals have created

300
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
dozens of classic recipes with it.

301
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,080
Hello everyone, welcome.

302
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,720
Hello.

303
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,240
Thank you.

304
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,520
This is a traditional Sicilian restaurant.

305
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,000
There's a famous writer from Sicily

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,920
Matolio.

307
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,280
He visited the home of stage actor Angelo.

308
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,600
Angelo's wife made them a plate of pasta.

309
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,880
It's the eggplant pasta you see here.

310
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Matolio was deeply impressed.

311
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,840
He called it "Norma."

312
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,120
Norma is an Italian

313
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,360
opera by the famous composer Bellini.

314
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,920
He used the name to praise the dish highly.

315
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,000
Please enjoy your meal.

316
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
Thank you.

317
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,440
Great, it's hot and ready.

318
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,960
So delicious.

319
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,240
This fried dish is amazing.

320
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
Really tasty.

321
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
Absolutely delicious.

322
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,560
Very good.

323
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
This dish is delicious.

324
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,120
This is radish.

325
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,840
But it's a bit milder than white radish.

326
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,760
It's kind of like a water radish.

327
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
It tastes like the small water radishes from Northeast China.

328
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,520
Feels like eating this back home.

329
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,600
Tasty.

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,040
Delicious.

331
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
Everyone's almost done eating.

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,280
Let me introduce something.

333
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,480
Why we

334
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,360
are performing here.

335
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,680
Because the people of Catania

336
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,840
really love music.

337
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,880
There's an Elephant Fountain Square here.

338
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,200
Every night when darkness falls,

339
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,080
many artists perform on the streets.

340
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,960
Most of them have regular jobs during the day.

341
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
They sing after work.

342
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,560
So this city is a very relaxed city of music.

343
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,920
Since it's a city of music,

344
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,340
we should join in the music too.

345
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,160
This time, everyone needs to form two

346
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,240
street performance teams.

347
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
Through two rounds of challenges,

348
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,840
you'll compete for tonight's guest performer.

349
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,520
And finish with a final street performance battle.

350
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,760
The two team captains

351
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,200
are both unique in the music world.

352
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,160
One is known as the "human songbird,"

353
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,640
Gong Jun.

354
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
Songbird Gong Jun.

355
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,840
The other captain

356
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
is the "human canary,"

357
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,400
Chen Xingxu.

358
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Brother Que.

359
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,440
Debut work:

360
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,240
the song "Stars."

361
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,640
It won us all over.

362
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,520
Very impressive.

363
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
This is the only one I know.

364
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,200
The two team captains are set.

365
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,880
So,

366
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,960
we're about to start an event called

367
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,040
"Earth 808" team selection.

368
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,600
To help both captains

369
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,080
find their ideal teammates.

370
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
Earth 808.

371
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,280
I suggest calling it 404 Not Found.

372
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,040
We need to pick team members.

373
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
This will be pretty tough.

374
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,080
Seriously, they're picking people.

375
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,720
But the two of them look

376
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,040
so distracting.

377
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,680
I can't even

378
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,920
My team has to have you.

379
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,840
I need your emotional support.

380
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,240
Xingxu.

381
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
Last night while you were sleeping,

382
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,960
who checked on you the most?

383
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,920
I don't know.

384
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,960
Who did you

385
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,880
share a bathroom with?

386
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,880
My bro He.

387
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
And me.

388
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,200
Taking a shower.

389
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,160
Not last night.

390
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,040
Yesterday.

391
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,600
How did this story become the day before yesterday?

392
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,320
Really.

393
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,520
You’re from the day before yesterday.

394
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
We’re from yesterday.

395
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,760
Xingxu.

396
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,520
Please stop randomly

397
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,800
showing off your charm.

398
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
Everyone, say something nice about Junjun.

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,840
Why did you come up with this idea?

400
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,360
Because I saw him out of the corner of my eye.

401
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,520
It was a beam of light.

402
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,480
A beam of light.

403
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,200
Yes.

404
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,880
Alright, that's enough.

405
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,520
No need for anyone else to speak.

406
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,680
Is it just because of the white T-shirt?

407
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,040
No, it's because

408
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
he was wearing a white T-shirt

409
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
and sitting next to our kind and beautiful

410
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,240
Jun while eating.

411
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,520
Coming to Sicily

412
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
was the happiest thing for me.

413
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Alright.

414
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,640
Look at me.

415
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,840
I'm a bit

416
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,160
hot now.

417
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm even hotter.

418
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,680
It's hard to think.

419
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,760
You’ve all said what needs to be said.

420
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,200
Sing a line.

421
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,120
Go ahead.

422
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,320
You have eyes that speak.

423
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,160
Eyes.

424
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,520
You have a caring heart.

425
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
Junjun.

426
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,040
I never dared to hope for this.

427
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Your beauty always captivates me.

428
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,040
Thank you, everyone.

429
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,640
I'll drink to that.

430
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,440
Has it already started?

431
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,760
Earth 808 team selection contest

432
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
is about to begin.

433
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,400
Why are there still late contestants?

434
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,680
We can't let that slide, right?

435
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
Let's handle it.

436
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,960
Don't touch me.

437
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,080
Mentor, please behave yourself.

438
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
What do you mean?

439
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720
I want you.

440
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,440
It's you.

441
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,640
You're special.

442
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,200
Why act special?

443
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,160
Chen He from Fuzhou, Fujian.

444
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,000
Sorry.

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Welcome everyone to Earth 808

446
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,400
Catania special.

447
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,360
Let's give a round of applause for our two mentors.

448
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,480
We should stand up. Hello, teachers.

449
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Hello.

450
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,400
Sit down.

451
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,560
I'm really nervous right now.

452
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
So nervous.

453
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,760
Really nervous.

454
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,480
Let the most nervous one go first.

455
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm so nervous.

456
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm really nervous.

457
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,320
Go, sis! You got this!

458
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,400
Do you have any

459
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,880
stories?

460
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,960
My story...

461
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,760
I...

462
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,640
I didn't prepare a story.

463
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,359
No story prepared.

464
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,720
No story ready.

465
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,119
I'm really passionate about

466
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,560
dance and performing.

467
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,000
But ever since I was little,

468
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,200
I've always sung off-key.

469
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,280
And I'm uncoordinated.

470
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,319
Who are you picking?

471
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,680
I got into Beijing Dance Academy

472
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
by singing "Stars."

473
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,440
Let's put it on hold for now.

474
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Put it on hold.

475
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,520
I'll wait for now.

476
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,480
Why?

477
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,440
You don't have a story.

478
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,400
I don't have a story.

479
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,120
That's not an advantage on our show.

480
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,680
Is this a storytelling contest?

481
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
Questioning the mentor.

482
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,960
You're calling me out?

483
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,080
Who called you out?

484
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,160
Getting mad at the mentor.

485
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,560
Exactly.

486
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,960
Getting mad at the mentor.

487
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
You two are so fake.

488
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Let me tell you,

489
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,680
you two have been wearing sunglasses since the start,

490
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
what's up with that?

491
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I really love your personality.

492
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Really?

493
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,520
I want you on my team.

494
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,200
Join my team.

495
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,400
I have 88 concerts this year.

496
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,560
Hold on.

497
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,200
I just love your unique style.

498
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,040
Mr. Gong, I'm your fan.

499
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
Just teasing you.

500
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Why are you giving me that look?

501
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,840
It's okay, sis.

502
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Don't worry, sis.

503
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,760
I've been annoyed with you for a while.

504
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,160
It's fine, sis.

505
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
Sis.

506
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
Let's not stoop to their level.

507
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,560
Don't interrupt the mentor.

508
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,960
So much personality.

509
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,640
I love it.

510
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,200
This is exactly the kind of contestant we need.

511
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,760
Honestly, I like this type too.

512
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,600
Why didn't I pick just now?

513
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Bro, have you figured out what to do?

514
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I don't know.

515
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,160
I think someone needs to set the tone.

516
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,080
We need to set the tone.

517
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
Then let the one who sets the tone go first.

518
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,240
I've followed you on my alt Weibo for ages.

519
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,200
Don't let me down.

520
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,760
Alt Weibo account.

521
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,280
Hello, mentors.

522
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,840
I'm a boy from Dandong, Liaoning.

523
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,480
Just a little boy.

524
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,160
I've had a music dream since I was young.

525
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,480
I just want to be a singer.

526
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,680
But in this dream,

527
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,640
two singers have deeply influenced me.

528
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,480
The first is

529
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,440
Jay Chou.

530
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,680
And the second

531
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,880
is

532
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,080
Mr. Gong Jun.

533
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,800
So next, I'll perform

534
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,840
a song that Mr. Gong Jun has sung.

535
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
Begin your performance.

536
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,440
If there's not enough sadness,

537
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,640
if there's not enough sorrow,

538
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,200
then you can't fly.

539
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,840
Breathe.

540
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,480
But without dreams,

541
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,280
Breathe.

542
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,720
why go far away?

543
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,640
I've always been wandering, but I

544
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
have never seen the ocean.

545
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,080
I thought I could forget.

546
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,480
Very good.

547
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,840
Thank you.

548
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,800
You're my "idol."

549
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,480
You are my idol.

550
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
Please stand. Okay.

551
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,080
Please stand, teacher.

552
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,840
Am I qualified to join your team?

553
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,640
Yes.

554
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,080
Be my mentor.

555
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
No need for that.

556
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
But think about it.

557
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,320
You've learned so much from him.

558
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,840
Don't you want to learn from me too?

559
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,480
Since I'm such a popular contestant,

560
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,160
I think the two mentors should compete.

561
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
I choose my team.

562
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,840
Why did I say that?

563
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,280
Come on.

564
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,000
Can the two mentors show some talent?

565
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,000
You stumped them both.

566
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,840
If we had talent, would we be sitting here?

567
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,440
No.

568
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
I think you can.

569
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,880
How about this: listen to our singing.

570
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,080
And if you think

571
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,680
it's not good,

572
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,800
If it's not good, just count me out.

573
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,920
How about you two sing a song together?

574
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,360
Okay.

575
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,760
The mentors are panicking.

576
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,160
The mentors are nervous. It's fine, come on.

577
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,720
Teacher Gong, you go first.

578
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,120
Okay.

579
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,760
It's fine, come on.

580
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,760
Teacher.

581
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,200
Why are you pulling up your pants?

582
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,360
My pants are falling down.

583
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,480
Introduce yourself.

584
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,400
First, tell us where you're from.

585
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,600
Hello, students.

586
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm from

587
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,280
Chengdu.

588
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,400
And you?

589
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,360
And you?

590
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,440
Introduce yourself.

591
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,960
Why does the vibe feel off right now?

592
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,640
You can tell who looks more like a mentor now.

593
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,960
What's going on?

594
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,800
Give me back my glasses.

595
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,160
Sorry, teacher.

596
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm from Shenyang, Liaoning.

597
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,520
And then?

598
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,480
Where are you from?

599
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
Shenyang.

600
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Can't even speak clearly.

601
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,680
Sit down.

602
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,840
Come on.

603
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,440
What's happening?

604
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,080
We are the mentors.

605
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,120
Give a demonstration.

606
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,200
Let us students learn from you.

607
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,840
Show us an example.

608
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,800
Set an example.

609
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,680
Yeah, that's what happens when there are more people.

610
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,240
Right.

611
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,640
If we have more people and sing badly, will you hit us?

612
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,480
Come on.

613
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,280
Sing.

614
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,760
What are you afraid of?

615
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,560
It's not the first time we've embarrassed ourselves.

616
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,360
Come on.

617
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,040
The brightest in the night sky

618
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,800
Went too high

619
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,240
Night in the sky

620
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,720
The brightest star in the night sky

621
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,960
The brightest star in the night sky

622
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,880
Can you hear clearly

623
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,400
Those who look up

624
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,080
The loneliness and sighs deep in their hearts

625
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,480
The brightest star in the night sky

626
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,000
Teacher Gong is so confident

627
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,760
Can you remember

628
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Who once walked with me

629
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,200
And disappeared in the wind

630
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,680
Why are you looking at me

631
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,760
Look at them

632
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,920
I can't find the tune anymore

633
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,880
I feel so unsure

634
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,280
Crossing lies to embrace you

635
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,680
That was really well sung

636
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,760
The brightest star in the night sky

637
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,840
Please guide me closer to you

638
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,440
Okay

639
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,520
Amazing

640
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,440
Okay

641
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,600
Didn't mess up

642
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
Too high

643
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
Great

644
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,400
I will firmly choose Teacher Gong

645
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,360
I swear to follow him no matter what

646
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,040
Alright

647
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
You two, please sit down

648
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,160
You

649
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,720
Stand up

650
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,440
Alright

651
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
Wait a moment, glasses

652
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,520
Okay

653
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,320
I'll stay undecided for now

654
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,960
We'll see how to pick teams later

655
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,560
Is that okay

656
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,920
So I passed, right

657
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,040
With me, you'll always have a pass

658
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,440
Alright

659
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,840
Next

660
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,040
Next one

661
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,000
The one who was a bit flattering just now

662
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,400
Come on, Uncle Wen

663
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,960
Darn it

664
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,760
Uncle, tell your story

665
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,120
I am

666
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm really nervous

667
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,440
Very nervous indeed

668
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm from Tianjin

669
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,640
Little Karaoke

670
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,800
My name is Li Naiwen

671
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,520
As for me

672
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,320
I can do anything

673
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,960
I can do anything

674
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,800
I can sing

675
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,120
I can do tongue twisters

676
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Tell stories

677
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,560
I can

678
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,320
You choose

679
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,880
Can you wash socks

680
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,880
I can't wash socks

681
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,240
But I can learn

682
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,760
I can learn

683
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,640
I can learn

684
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
I have more stories

685
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,320
That's what we love to hear

686
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,720
Tell your story

687
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Actually, this story is a bit tragic

688
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
And a little sad

689
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
It really makes listeners cry

690
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Get ready emotionally

691
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,640
Alright

692
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Try not to cry

693
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,640
Okay

694
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,840
Me

695
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,960
I arrived at Tianjin

696
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,640
I didn't learn anything

697
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,320
Talking about this story, I still

698
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,480
Honestly, I feel pretty bad inside

699
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,400
And I've never seen such a handsome mentor

700
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
So I'm a bit excited

701
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm a little thrilled

702
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,800
Sorry

703
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,120
I understand

704
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,440
I think you have to pick me

705
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,800
Thank you

706
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,000
You two

707
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,040
I'll give you ten seconds, hurry and pick me

708
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,480
No

709
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,720
Four

710
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,280
Why are you starting to threaten us

711
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,160
Trust me

712
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,360
Pick me and you'll win

713
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
Okay

714
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,600
Hey, man, you—

715
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,920
If you don't choose, I'm going to take action.

716
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,680
I'm getting a little scared.

717
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
Still joking around.

718
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,160
Hurry up and pick.

719
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,600
Something's happened.

720
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,360
I—I want you.

721
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,840
How about this.

722
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,440
We're also doing a music show today.

723
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
Yes.

724
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,920
We should show something, right?

725
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,040
Right?

726
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,240
Give me a world-shaking—

727
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,080
bass.

728
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,320
Give me a world-shaking—

729
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,960
bass.

730
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
Here it comes, teacher.

731
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,440
The brightest star in the night sky.

732
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,080
Teacher.

733
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,680
The brightest in the night sky.

734
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,960
The brightest star in the night sky.

735
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
In the night sky.

736
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,040
Teacher, let me make a counter-choice first.

737
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,400
I haven't picked you yet.

738
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,920
That's some courage, right?

739
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,640
Yes.

740
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,360
Come to me.

741
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,680
Hello, teacher.

742
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Come to me.

743
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,360
Honglei is selected.

744
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,080
It's a two-way selection.

745
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,320
No female contestants? All guys?

746
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,040
Wasn't the first one?

747
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,560
Yes.

748
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,160
Is there anything explosive?

749
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
We need something explosive.

750
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,520
I just hope the teachers

751
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,040
will let me perform a song.

752
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,080
Sure.

753
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,880
No problem.

754
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,880
Alright.

755
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
Teacher Ouyang,

756
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,560
wherever you go, we'll follow.

757
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,960
You're switching sides just like that?

758
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
Please make your choice quickly.

759
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,040
Show us the way.

760
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,640
Hurry up and choose.

761
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,320
Right.

762
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,680
This is definitely a promising talent.

763
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,440
Yes.

764
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,120
I'll definitely mention this in the interview later.

765
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,080
I think Ouyang is actually more suited than some people

766
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,000
to be a mentor.

767
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
Teacher Ouyang, do you need a manager?

768
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,480
How about this,

769
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,400
we form our own team,

770
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,520
and let those two be a team.

771
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,160
We’ll be the mentors.

772
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,280
What are you doing?

773
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,480
Your pants...

774
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,320
Why do they keep slipping down?

775
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
They're elastic.

776
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know why.

777
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,400
Every time I stand up, I have to pull them up first.

778
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm the mentor.

779
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:08,960
No.

780
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,520
If you don't stand up, no one notices.

781
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,480
You know your pants are falling down, right?

782
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,080
The mentor is confused now.

783
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,840
What should we do?

784
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,640
What now?

785
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,360
Why don't you guys choose instead?

786
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,800
Were you just messing around?

787
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,160
Is it really this casual?

788
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,760
Let's just turn our backs like this.

789
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,120
Your pants are slipping a bit too often.

790
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,480
I will follow Teacher Gong to the end.

791
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:28,880
Come on.

792
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
Then I'll choose my junior.

793
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,520
So,

794
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,280
who will get

795
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,360
the support of the local guest performer?

796
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,320
Let's head to the Etna Rooftop.

797
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,960
Let's compete.

798
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,760
Let's go.

799
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,640
Go!

800
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
Etna Rooftop.

801
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,160
Located on Etna Avenue in Catania,

802
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,520
facing the magnificent Mount Etna.

803
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,800
Here, you can experience the blend of volcano and city views,

804
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,720
a unique fusion and contrast.

805
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
Can you see the volcano?

806
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,720
From the side near that iron tower.

807
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,000
All of this is...

808
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,240
That whole area in the back is too.

809
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,000
It's faintly visible.

810
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,560
There's thunder.

811
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,480
Thunder is rumbling.

812
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Who's transcending here?

813
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
You.

814
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,080
It shouldn't be me.

815
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
What?

816
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,960
He Ge

817
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,440
Take a look in Sicily.

818
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,360
"Hahahahaha" is making a cameo.

819
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,000
Hello.

820
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,440
What's wrong?

821
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,600
Naiwen Ge

822
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,280
Who?

823
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Isn't this Chao Ge?

824
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,520
Chao Ge

825
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
We agreed to play ball in Shanghai.

826
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,760
Call me when you're in Beijing.

827
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,880
Let's play billiards.

828
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
Anytime.

829
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,800
I learned billiards just for you.

830
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,560
You really talk big.

831
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,680
I think he wants to come.

832
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,400
Right, Chao, do you want to come?

833
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,160
Chao, come join us.

834
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,560
We named this after you.

835
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,960
It's called "Earth Super Fresh."

836
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,600
Yes, Super Fresh.

837
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,440
Why?

838
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,920
What's up, Captain?

839
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,360
I'm not your captain.

840
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,280
You didn't pick me.

841
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,360
You're holding a grudge, look at you.

842
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,320
No, I want to join your team.

843
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,680
They'll lose badly.

844
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,920
Aren't we supposed to sit in groups?

845
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Why did you switch sides?

846
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,640
Sorry.

847
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,480
Captain.

848
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
Yes, Captain.

849
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
Next up,

850
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,320
Let's welcome the local band from Catania.

851
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,200
They'll perform

852
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,160
a classic Italian song everyone knows.

853
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,720
Please welcome.

854
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,600
Welcome.

855
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,560
Welcome.

856
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
So confused.

857
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,520
Maybe it's because I love you.

858
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,240
A wonderful feeling comes over me.

859
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,840
It grows wildly.

860
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,920
Hold me tight.

861
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,480
Come a little closer.

862
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,640
If you feel happy,

863
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,520
maybe it's because I love you.

864
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,560
Fly with me.

865
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,040
The world goes crazy.

866
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,920
Fly with me.

867
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,360
Come a little closer.

868
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,160
Because love is gone.

869
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,920
Tell me, where are we?

870
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,080
Amazing!

871
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,640
Amazing!

872
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,520
Thank you.

873
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,120
This is our special

874
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,160
guest performer.

875
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,680
The winning team of the next challenge

876
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,320
will get their support in tonight's show.

877
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,920
They'll help you out.

878
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,520
We must win this.

879
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,600
We have to win.

880
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
We can't lose this.

881
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,520
"Hole-Hiding Youth"

882
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,200
There are two teams: the Hiding team and the Observing team.

883
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,800
The Hiding team secretly picks one person.

884
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,440
They stick a hole on them.

885
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,840
During the whole dance,

886
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,040
they must not be discovered by the Observing team.

887
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,160
Hiding team.

888
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,920
Observing team.

889
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,480
The Observing team can ask the Hiding team

890
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,680
to change moves and formations.

891
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,960
Guessing the right person earns a point.

892
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,600
Which team goes first for hiding?

893
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,920
Your Youth team.

894
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,480
Yes.

895
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,400
"Hole-Hiding Youth," our Youth team goes second.

896
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,160
You hide first.

897
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,400
It has to be you.

898
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,440
The two captains play rock-paper-scissors.

899
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,480
Let's be fair.

900
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,440
Rock-paper-scissors.

901
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:22,880
Okay.

902
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,800
Didi, you're up.

903
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,480
Didi.

904
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,480
Rock-paper-scissors.

905
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,000
No complaints.

906
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,000
Wait a second.

907
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,760
Confidence.

908
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,400
Yes, best of three.

909
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
Cheating, huh?

910
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Even the "King of Cheating" is silent.

911
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm thinking.

912
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,760
Help me out here.

913
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,440
I'm thinking.

914
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,040
Whoever wins goes first, right?

915
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,600
Whoever wins can choose who goes up next.

916
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
See, you didn't explain the rules.

917
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,480
Okay, let's start over.

918
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
You learned it too, right?

919
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,719
There's no way I'll lose.

920
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,320
You learned it too.

921
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,080
I've never lost.

922
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,880
Captain, we're not bad.

923
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,239
You lost.

924
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
Let's do best of four, first to three wins.

925
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:17,800
Okay.

926
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,120
Alright, sounds good.

927
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Come on, it's fine.

928
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,920
Doesn't matter, let's go.

929
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,120
Epic showdown, your turn, keep going.

930
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,800
Rock, paper, scissors.

931
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,360
Sorry.

932
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,719
One to one.

933
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,679
Alright, next one, let's go.

934
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,480
Come on.

935
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll beat him all the way.

936
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,880
Let's do it.

937
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,719
Rock, paper, scissors.

938
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,679
Go down.

939
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,159
Two to one.

940
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,719
Go up.

941
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,719
It's okay.

942
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,679
Go up, Wen, it's fine, you got this.

943
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,880
Playing with the "King of Cheating."

944
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,360
Rock, paper, scissors.

945
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,160
Victory fist!

946
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,920
Come on.

947
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,480
Keep going.

948
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,240
Let's go.

949
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,800
Come on.

950
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

951
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,080
That's awesome.

952
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,200
Straw King.

953
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Rock, Paper, Scissors King.

954
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,080
I accept it.

955
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,360
Okay.

956
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,120
You guys go first.

957
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
Still cheating, bro.

958
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,480
Still cheating.

959
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,120
You really picked two great teammates.

960
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,080
Otherwise, how could I win?

961
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,200
We'll listen to the captain.

962
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Captain, you decide.

963
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,600
Alright.

964
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,960
I think...

965
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,320
Big bro is right.

966
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,400
Exactly.

967
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,640
You don't have any...

968
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,520
You weren't like this before.

969
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,560
I used to be such a kind person.

970
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,000
Welcome to "Earth Super Fresh."

971
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,720
How about we let the elders go first?

972
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,880
No, we can't let Didi go.

973
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,640
That's exactly what they're waiting for you to say.

974
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
We definitely won't give in.

975
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,360
Can you show some care for the young?

976
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,800
Yeah.

977
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,840
Hurry up, you guys.

978
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Let's take a selfie.

979
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,480
Come on, let's take a selfie.

980
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,000
Let's get a photo with the volcano.

981
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,680
Let's take a group photo.

982
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,000
Let them discuss it themselves.

983
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,440
Yeah.

984
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,480
We can take a selfie too.

985
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,400
They're so unreliable.

986
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,360
Come on, it's no big deal.

987
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
The weather's nice.

988
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,200
They're ignoring us.

989
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,440
Let's just take the photo.

990
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
The volcano.

991
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,320
So happy to be traveling!

992
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,480
So much fun.

993
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,760
We really ran into some bad people in Italy.

994
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,080
Come on.

995
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,960
Let's go.

996
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,400
We're not bad.

997
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,520
Come on.

998
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,200
Over here.

999
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,920
We need to show the front, bro.

1000
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,200
Don't look at us.

1001
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,600
Gentleman's game.

1002
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,240
You know, this gentleman's game is the least...

1003
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,840
...the least convincing.

1004
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,320
Yeah.

1005
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,480
And for example,

1006
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,400
That's way too obvious.

1007
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,800
You want me to lose, right?

1008
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,560
Can you stick it on my face?

1009
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,880
Can I move my leg?

1010
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,080
This leg is in the way.

1011
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Don't stick it on me.

1012
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,640
Stick it on Sun Honglei.

1013
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,680
Here.

1014
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,200
Okay.

1015
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,920
Okay.

1016
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,440
You've learned it.

1017
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,640
You're Li Naiwen's apprentice, right?

1018
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,960
You're ready to graduate.

1019
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,360
I think this way...

1020
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,800
Don't overthink it.

1021
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,720
It doesn't matter where you stick it, it's just the front.

1022
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,800
As actors,

1023
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,280
Whether it's there or not,

1024
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,760
If you believe it, it's there.

1025
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,960
For example, I have to cover...

1026
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,200
Xingxu's chest.

1027
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,320
Even if I switch hands, I have to do it like this.

1028
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,360
Like this.

1029
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,120
Put your own hand on yourself.

1030
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,320
It's also to protect your front, right?

1031
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,440
Everyone, find a spot that's comfortable for you.

1032
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,680
Stomach and left chest.

1033
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
Okay.

1034
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
These four spots never move.

1035
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,520
Got it.

1036
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,240
Stick it on.

1037
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,600
Come on.

1038
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,240
Come on.

1039
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,040
See how much they want to win.

1040
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,680
They've been discussing this for over ten minutes.

1041
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,280
They really want to win.

1042
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,560
Make sure to cover it well with this hand.

1043
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,120
Be sure to cover it.

1044
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,800
Cover your own stomachs.

1045
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,960
Make it look convincing.

1046
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,320
You have to cover it well.

1047
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,320
Okay.

1048
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,560
Come on.

1049
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,240
Come on.

1050
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,080
Let's move little by little.

1051
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,000
Move slowly.

1052
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
My arm's getting sore.

1053
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,120
Let's not get too far apart.

1054
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,480
Aren't you coming?

1055
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,520
Bro, aren't you coming?

1056
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,200
Let's spin around.

1057
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840
Come on, spin.

1058
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,440
Their hands are placed...

1059
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,800
We can spin in front of you too.

1060
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
Don't get too close.

1061
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,600
Not too far, He.

1062
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,360
You're just showing us your backs.

1063
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
What are we supposed to look at?

1064
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
We've really bonded, you know.

1065
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,040
This spot is pretty awkward too.

1066
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,480
How about He and Naiwen do a solo performance?

1067
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,760
Wait a second.

1068
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,640
Put your hand here on him.

1069
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,120
Put it here on him.

1070
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,920
You've stumped them.

1071
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,520
You're right.

1072
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,920
Put your hand here.

1073
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,880
Put your hand on him here.

1074
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,360
On He.

1075
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,800
It's my turn to perform solo.

1076
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,320
Okay.

1077
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,040
Alright.

1078
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,160
Done, okay.

1079
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,120
Me.

1080
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,240
It's my turn now.

1081
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Come on, switch hands.

1082
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,880
You're overacting a bit.

1083
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,680
Can you not mess around?

1084
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,360
It's on He Ge's left hand.

1085
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,320
Come on, this pair.

1086
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,040
Switch hands.

1087
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,360
Spin around, you two.

1088
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,720
Spin around.

1089
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,680
Twist.

1090
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,560
Didn't you notice?

1091
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
You've all switched positions.

1092
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,120
Stomach and left chest.

1093
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,120
Come on, let's combine. Come here.

1094
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,080
Come on, hurry, I'll be the head.

1095
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,840
Let's go.

1096
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Then I want to see Naiwen and Xingxu dance.

1097
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,240
Wait, it's a bit messy.

1098
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,360
He Ge, look at He Ge.

1099
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,520
Wait, it's a bit chaotic. Hold on.

1100
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,040
Don't move.

1101
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,800
Don't move, stay still.

1102
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,400
It fell off.

1103
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,840
He Ge is like a wall.

1104
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,280
He's too broad.

1105
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,760
There's a bit of an accident.

1106
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,400
Then it's not with He Ge.

1107
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,560
It's with Honglei Ge.

1108
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,680
At Honglei Ge.

1109
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,440
Here we go.

1110
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,240
We're back again.

1111
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:12,840
Naiwen Ge.

1112
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,400
Here we go again.

1113
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,440
What's up with the chest?

1114
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,680
Naiwen.

1115
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,560
My hand should be on Naiwen, right?

1116
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,200
Stomach and left chest.

1117
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,360
That's not right.

1118
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,560
Why are both your hands on one chest?

1119
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,680
There's nothing on my chest.

1120
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,280
Let's not move anymore.

1121
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Bro, come back.

1122
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,160
Go back.

1123
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,080
Naiwen Ge and Xingxu dance.

1124
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,840
Here we come.

1125
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,360
Alright, solo performance right here.

1126
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,440
No way, that's not allowed.

1127
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,120
Solo performance is allowed.

1128
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,600
We need to block, go block.

1129
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,800
You're good at blocking, move aside.

1130
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,760
Move aside.

1131
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,520
See, they're getting physical.

1132
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,760
Backstage, you know?

1133
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,920
We need to change clothes.

1134
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,680
Xingxu's hand position has changed.

1135
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,160
This is really...

1136
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,760
This is exhausting.

1137
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,480
Xingxu is out.

1138
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,440
He is the one who hasn't changed.

1139
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,600
He Ge's.

1140
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,320
He Ge's left hand.

1141
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,120
Naiwen Ge's left hand.

1142
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,600
Naiwen Ge's chest area.

1143
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,680
And He Ge's...

1144
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,920
Waist, what's that part called?

1145
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,680
Kidney.

1146
00:43:59,680 --> 00:43:59,960
Kidney.

1147
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,080
Appendix.

1148
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,040
The appendix is on the other side, I've had it removed.

1149
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,960
The duodenum area.

1150
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,560
It hasn't changed.

1151
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,960
My Naiwen Ge.

1152
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,480
Naiwen Ge.

1153
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,200
Listen to Ning Ge, Naiwen Ge.

1154
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,960
Let's go with him.

1155
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,560
It's him.

1156
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,280
Then you guys...

1157
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,200
If you want to pick me, that's fine.

1158
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,440
Guess which hand.

1159
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,360
Just guess the right person.

1160
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,160
Just guess correctly.

1161
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,800
Right.

1162
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,360
Why though?

1163
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,880
Hurry and open it, bro.

1164
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
Reveal it.

1165
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,600
No.

1166
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,840
Honglei Ge.

1167
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,280
It's with Honglei Ge.

1168
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,000
We've already lost, come on.

1169
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,680
Show them.

1170
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,360
Go ahead.

1171
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,240
They've already lost.

1172
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,120
He Ge, it's really with He Ge.

1173
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,240
Come on, guess again.

1174
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,400
He Ge, it's right at your kidney.

1175
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,200
Okay.

1176
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,400
Great job, performance coach.

1177
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,880
Playing with these veterans,

1178
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,640
they don't stand a chance.

1179
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,320
Just now, my hand

1180
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,880
was on Xingxu's chest the whole time.

1181
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,400
Can you guys stop focusing on Xingxu's chest muscles?

1182
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,160
I'm just here for fun.

1183
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,800
I'm really enjoying this.

1184
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,000
Darn it, I really didn't see that coming.

1185
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,120
They'll definitely make us perform solo.

1186
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,520
So, from that angle just now,

1187
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,280
we can go back-to-back.

1188
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,480
It's hard to defend from the back.

1189
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,640
It's hard to guard you, you know?

1190
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,720
It's hard to switch from the back.

1191
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,000
So we have to defend from the front.

1192
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,320
Right.

1193
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:45,960
Let her go.

1194
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,240
That's it.

1195
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,920
Alright, that's it.

1196
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,360
Like this.

1197
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,800
Always remember your left shoulder.

1198
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
And your left hem.

1199
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,840
Where's your hand?

1200
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,080
Your hand needs to join in.

1201
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,600
Yeah.

1202
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Okay.

1203
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,040
Wait a second.

1204
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:02,800
No.

1205
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,400
You can't put everything on me.

1206
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,960
That's it.

1207
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,080
Put your left hand here.

1208
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,920
We're really in sync here.

1209
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,800
I've got one hand here myself.

1210
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,640
Where did this hand come from?

1211
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,560
It's like this.

1212
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,120
No, not you.

1213
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,760
What about me?

1214
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,840
You handle your own.

1215
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,600
Take care of your own.

1216
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,600
You need to touch her shoulder.

1217
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,040
I know.

1218
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,920
You need to focus on yourself.

1219
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,160
Otherwise, you'll be missing yours.

1220
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,400
Right, you handle your own.

1221
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,400
I'll handle mine.

1222
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,680
Exactly.

1223
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,600
Yeah, sorry.

1224
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,040
Okay, right.

1225
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,480
Alright.

1226
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,320
Now it's correct.

1227
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:38,680
Yes.

1228
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,120
Don't assume it's on you.

1229
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,600
Just be sure it's on me.

1230
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,600
When we switch, you two need to block too.

1231
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,360
Okay.

1232
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,120
Aren't you afraid of messing up while dancing?

1233
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,640
Three words.

1234
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Alright, that's about right.

1235
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,920
I want to win so badly.

1236
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,560
Give it your all when you jump.

1237
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,200
You're the most relaxed.

1238
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,520
Okay.

1239
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,840
I won't relax either.

1240
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,640
What are you doing? Go over there.

1241
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,560
Aren't you guys tired?

1242
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
When we were resting just now,

1243
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,760
were you doing this the whole time?

1244
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,400
Yeah.

1245
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,280
Is it tough?

1246
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,880
Are you tired?

1247
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,400
It's alright.

1248
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,680
Go back quickly, bro.

1249
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,880
Go back and sit down.

1250
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,000
Come on.

1251
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,600
How do we dance?

1252
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,760
Bump your chest three times, then start twisting your hips.

1253
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,640
Seven, eight.

1254
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,200
Not yet, sorry.

1255
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,000
Not time yet.

1256
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,480
Your turn, Wen.

1257
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,680
There's still the group part.

1258
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,400
Yuning, it's your turn.

1259
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,880
He winked at me.

1260
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,000
He's distracting me.

1261
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,680
Dance.

1262
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,360
Hurry, go over there.

1263
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,160
Then do it like this.

1264
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,200
Okay.

1265
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,200
That's right.

1266
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,880
I think that

1267
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,120
It can't be behind Didi

1268
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,880
Because it's easy to lift up

1269
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,480
It's easy to get exposed

1270
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,800
Big Sis and Second Sis, do a solo performance

1271
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,280
Okay, no problem

1272
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,280
No problem

1273
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,040
Alright, let's go

1274
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,760
Alright, go ahead

1275
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,600
This

1276
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,360
Come

1277
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,400
This

1278
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,760
This, touch it properly

1279
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,480
No, not the one from earlier

1280
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,520
Okay

1281
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,600
Pretend it's on the waist here

1282
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,640
Remember this

1283
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,240
Right here

1284
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
Yuning's one

1285
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,280
The hand on Didi's lower back isn't there anymore

1286
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,520
Do a wave

1287
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,560
Both of you, switch hands

1288
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,480
No problem

1289
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,440
No problem, change clothes

1290
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,600
Come

1291
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,200
Don't

1292
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,920
Mine is already

1293
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,320
It's fine

1294
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,760
Gong Jun has a slim waist

1295
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,280
Okay

1296
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,960
It must be with those few people

1297
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,320
That's what they're most nervous about

1298
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,080
Right

1299
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,800
Three words: give it your all

1300
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,000
Give it your all

1301
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,000
Jump up

1302
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,680
Almost doing somersaults

1303
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,800
Those two guys, do a solo performance

1304
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,040
No problem

1305
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,600
Block it

1306
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,480
Come quickly, block it

1307
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:21,800
Block it well

1308
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,320
No

1309
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,240
We can perform solo anyway

1310
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:23,800
No need to block

1311
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,680
We're already performing solo

1312
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,040
Right

1313
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,400
No need to block

1314
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,760
Yeah, we're already doing a solo performance

1315
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,880
Alright, like this

1316
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,600
What they're grabbing is really tricky

1317
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,320
Looks awkward

1318
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,600
Right

1319
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,640
Like this

1320
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,040
Make it a bit sexier, what are you doing?

1321
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,200
Then do it like this

1322
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,360
Just a bit like this, then I'll go lower

1323
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:56,840
Like this

1324
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,200
Right

1325
00:51:59,520 --> 00:51:59,840
Come

1326
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,080
You go first, then me

1327
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,640
You go first, then me

1328
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,920
You go first, then me

1329
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,240
What kind of phrase is that?

1330
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,320
Come on, again

1331
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,000
Come

1332
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,160
You two, switch hands

1333
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,920
No problem

1334
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,560
Come over

1335
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,880
This side, over here

1336
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,680
On my left

1337
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,640
Block it

1338
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,600
Grab this

1339
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,480
Block it

1340
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,040
I'll grab you

1341
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:34,440
Wait a second

1342
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,720
Grab it yourself

1343
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,640
Wait a second

1344
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,960
No rush

1345
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,560
It's fine

1346
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,120
Switch yourself again

1347
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,320
Wait, I'll touch it myself

1348
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,840
Alright, that's fine

1349
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,640
Grab my shoulder here

1350
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,600
Left shoulder

1351
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,040
Gong Jun

1352
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,320
I suspect it's

1353
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Not sure if there's this

1354
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,960
Some kind of trick

1355
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,160
Jun Jun, do a solo performance

1356
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,000
Music starts

1357
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,200
Wait a moment

1358
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
I'll block for you, like this

1359
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,480
Right

1360
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,760
Grab your own shoulder

1361
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,160
Grab your shoulder with your left hand

1362
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,920
Okay

1363
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,800
That's fine, okay

1364
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,040
That's fine, okay

1365
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,000
The truth is already very clear.

1366
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,120
Xiao Wen or Gong Jun.

1367
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,520
Yes.

1368
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,280
I think Xiao Wen's left hand.

1369
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,040
Shoulder.

1370
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,800
Left hand.

1371
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,160
That's the place she hides the least.

1372
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,280
Right now, we shouldn't say a word.

1373
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,120
Keep a straight face.

1374
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,400
Don't give any reaction.

1375
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,040
Let them choose.

1376
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,720
His guess is actually...

1377
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,320
They've already learned from our mistakes.

1378
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,840
We've taught them a lot.

1379
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,600
They're standing on our shoulders.

1380
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,120
Right?

1381
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,120
Yes, learning from seniors is still...

1382
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,520
They've learned.

1383
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,840
Otherwise, it's...

1384
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,200
Going the opposite way.

1385
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,320
It's in Didi's hand.

1386
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,040
Didi.

1387
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,320
Didi slipped, right?

1388
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,080
Didi.

1389
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,280
She slipped.

1390
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,280
We can't speak.

1391
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,680
Don't give any reaction at all.

1392
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,880
I think Jun's right hand is possible.

1393
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,000
Raise your hand if you vote for Jun.

1394
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,160
I think it looks like it.

1395
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,960
Okay.

1396
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,240
It's fine.

1397
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,960
Don't show any expression.

1398
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,960
Then I'll vote too.

1399
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,040
Jun, alright.

1400
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,680
Go.

1401
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,360
It's in your right hand.

1402
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,200
Right hand.

1403
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,400
Yes.

1404
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,080
Didi.

1405
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,760
Didi.

1406
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,160
Didi, go.

1407
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,080
Jump with everything you've got.

1408
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:17,880
Jump.

1409
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,040
Come on.

1410
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,280
Here we go.

1411
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,880
Amazing.

1412
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,960
Always keep your back to them.

1413
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,640
So impressive.

1414
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,680
That's incredible.

1415
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,680
I only remembered...

1416
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,120
One thing Ning said to me.

1417
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,400
Give it your all.

1418
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,720
With a one-to-one tie,

1419
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,560
our two teams

1420
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,680
will join the guest performers

1421
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,200
to perform together.

1422
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,080
Alright.

1423
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,960
Pulse, save me!

1424
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,520
Bro, this is way too intense.

1425
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,840
This is way more exhausting than lifting weights.

1426
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,040
So impressive.

1427
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,320
Here's a Pulse as a reward.

1428
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,920
Thanks, bro.

1429
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:08,960
I'm back in shape.

1430
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,360
Whatever move you make, I can handle it.

1431
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,720
I'll set up a challenge for you.

1432
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,640
Extreme state challenge.

1433
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,680
Extreme state challenge.

1434
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,320
No problem.

1435
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,240
So thirsty and tired, about to collapse.

1436
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,760
Join the "Stay Strong, Pulse Returns" challenge.

1437
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,320
Win and get a Pulse supply pack.

1438
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,360
Start.

1439
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,800
One hand.

1440
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
Last round, let's go.

1441
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,720
Challenge failed.

1442
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,840
You can take another sip of Pulse.

1443
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,080
Then you'll get one more chance.

1444
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,640
I'll drink a bit more.

1445
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,080
Are you back in the zone?

1446
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,880
Back instantly.

1447
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,720
Are you fully charged?

1448
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,400
Fully charged.

1449
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:38,800
Come on.

1450
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,440
Let's go.

1451
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,760
Sun Honglei, please present to Chen Xingxu

1452
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
the Pulse Recovery Pack.

1453
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,360
With Pulse, you're fully recharged.

1454
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,000
Ready for more challenges on the journey.

1455
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,280
Ning.

1456
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,360
Let's go.

1457
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,000
Let's go, bro.

1458
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,960
If the east isn't bright, the west will shine.

1459
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,400
As the sun sets, I bask in my sorrow.

1460
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,320
I've gained so much weight lately.

1461
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,800
My jawline is gone.

1462
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,120
It's still there.

1463
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,720
No, what is this even now?

1464
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,440
Darn it.

1465
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,120
You still have it now.

1466
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,120
It's obvious.

1467
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
Can't eat anymore.

1468
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,120
What do you mean?

1469
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,040
I only know, for example,

1470
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,600
how to say hello.

1471
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,160
Isn't it hello?

1472
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,520
That's more formal.

1473
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,200
Like if I want to order a coffee.

1474
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:26,680
It's just

1475
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,080
Hello, I'd like a coffee.

1476
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,560
There's a little rolled sound.

1477
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,040
Another rolled sound?

1478
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,360
Can't handle it.

1479
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,200
There's a rolled sound.

1480
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,800
And then,

1481
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,840
For example, pharmacy is

1482
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,240
pharmacy.

1483
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,880
That square.

1484
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,280
Like what we just mentioned.

1485
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,120
Going somewhere means

1486
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,600
it means square.

1487
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,440
And then,

1488
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,080
is

1489
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,800
school.

1490
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,320
Chinese person or Chinese means

1491
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,320
You're really

1492
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,520
so hardworking.

1493
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,320
Because I really like Italian.

1494
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,840
Not many artists speak Italian.

1495
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,120
If you master it, you'll be amazing.

1496
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,600
What's the use?

1497
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,400
It's useless.

1498
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,720
It's only useful for traveling.

1499
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,640
Makes things a bit easier.

1500
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,640
Looks good.

1501
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,160
A family living here

1502
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,240
is pretty comfortable.

1503
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,440
What are you doing?

1504
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,040
Bro.

1505
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,800
I really liked our

1506
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,960
Italian song just now.

1507
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,280
So I'm transcribing it phonetically.

1508
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,920
Isn't this the one we just learned?

1509
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,360
Yeah.

1510
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,320
Do you want to join in?

1511
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,840
Let's do it together.

1512
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,440
Come on.

1513
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,920
Grab the iPad.

1514
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,720
Open this notebook.

1515
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,240
You write on the left.

1516
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,720
I'll write on the right, okay?

1517
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,040
This house is so beautiful.

1518
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,440
This garden is amazing.

1519
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,960
The color combination is gorgeous.

1520
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,880
It feels so cozy.

1521
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,960
It really has a family vibe.

1522
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,760
You guys go over there.

1523
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:01,920
We’ll be one group.

1524
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,360
Come over here.

1525
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,800
Let’s split into teams.

1526
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,800
I want to eat.

1527
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,520
Master Liu’s Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

1528
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:09,960
Okay.

1529
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,560
Today.

1530
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,840
I have a pot ready in a bit.

1531
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,240
I’ll put all these ingredients inside.

1532
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,200
I’ll start steaming it for you.

1533
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,760
Steam a whole pot.

1534
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,920
Alright, everyone.

1535
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,200
Tonight, we’re going to

1536
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,000
perform at Elephant Fountain Square.

1537
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,600
So,

1538
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,960
let’s warm up our voices first.

1539
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,920
Our team will never fall apart.

1540
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,440
Italians have a deep love

1541
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,080
and respect for Bellini’s operas.

1542
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,040
and respect.

1543
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,000
Opera uses bel canto

1544
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,120
as an important technique.

1545
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,680
Let’s try singing pop songs with bel canto.

1546
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,440
Get a feel for it in advance.

1547
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,400
I don’t know if you’ve seen it.

1548
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,680
I’ve heard a bit about it.

1549
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,040
You show everyone how it’s done.

1550
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,600
Let’s all learn to meow together.

1551
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,240
Together.

1552
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,040
The essence.

1553
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,360
Wen can go to the square by herself.

1554
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,280
The rest of us don’t even need to go.

1555
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,720
Let’s open the lyrics board.

1556
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,320
You can try it too.

1557
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,000
No, that’s not right.

1558
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,400
You changed the key.

1559
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,440
See injustice, give a loud roar!

1560
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,800
Now you’re singing “Black Cat Detective.”

1561
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,680
Start with a key.

1562
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,320
See injustice, give a loud roar!

1563
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,760
Take action when it’s time!

1564
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,680
Eat the peach.

1565
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,800
Eat it, then sing.

1566
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,360
See injustice, give a loud roar!

1567
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,160
Why start so high?

1568
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,080
Let’s go lower.

1569
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,200
Don’t make it so high.

1570
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,680
Otherwise, I can’t reach it, bro.

1571
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,680
I want to send you my endless longing.

1572
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,080
Send a postcard that represents my love.

1573
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,640
Alright.

1574
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,320
That works.

1575
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:53,840
It’s good.

1576
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,280
That has a bel canto feel, right?

1577
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,840
Absolutely great.

1578
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,880
Old-school bel canto style.

1579
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,320
That’s right.

1580
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,160
And it also has that

1581
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,480
bouncy rhythm to it.

1582
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,760
A bit shy and coy.

1583
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,960
Slowly igniting the feelings she won't admit

1584
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,760
How did it turn into rap?

1585
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,400
It's got this kind of rhythm change

1586
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,160
That's the highlight

1587
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,040
What's this?

1588
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,880
No way

1589
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,720
What is this?

1590
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,920
Don't be surprised

1591
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,240
Hip-hop is starting to grow

1592
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,000
Forget you exist

1593
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,640
What song is this?

1594
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,320
Are you really from my generation?

1595
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,200
Never heard this song

1596
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,320
Me neither

1597
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,960
Pulling our hair and fighting

1598
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,720
Let someone from our team try

1599
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,680
Show them how it's done

1600
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,680
Let me show you what a real gap is

1601
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,000
Looks like you still don't get it

1602
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,360
The difference between you and me

1603
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,680
The difference between you and me

1604
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,320
Game-winning move

1605
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,000
Our group is seriously underestimated

1606
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,400
You four do one together

1607
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,240
Like a group performance

1608
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Who can sing this?

1609
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,560
I think I've heard it from Lao Jiu

1610
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,600
Is this Lao Jiu's song?

1611
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,440
It's from the Go Boys group

1612
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,240
Lao Jiu and his three nephews

1613
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,240
It's from the Go Boys group

1614
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,800
That's right

1615
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,480
Bro

1616
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
Lao Jiu

1617
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,080
You mean "draw a dragon with your left hand with me"?

1618
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,720
That's the one

1619
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,120
So it's this song

1620
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,280
I see

1621
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,200
A dragon with the left hand

1622
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,160
A dragon with the right hand

1623
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,560
Two dragons playing with a pearl

1624
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,440
Not that one, bro

1625
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,040
Just follow my left hand

1626
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,480
A slow motion with the right hand

1627
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,440
Right hand

1628
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,520
See?

1629
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,680
I was just messing with you

1630
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,600
So it's this song

1631
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,240
Is there a way to play like this?

1632
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,200
For example

1633
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,760
When I see a lyric, I do this

1634
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,480
Stand up first

1635
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,200
Just follow this rule

1636
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,360
The team that stands the bottle first

1637
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,720
Gets the chance to sing

1638
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,920
Within the set number of rounds

1639
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,720
The team with the higher score

1640
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,400
Wins

1641
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,320
I'll do it here

1642
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,720
That's enough, just drink a little more

1643
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,200
Then you handle the bottle

1644
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:54,800
We'll do the singing

1645
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,160
Whoever stands it gets to grab, right?

1646
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,000
Nice

1647
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,920
We're counting on you

1648
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,520
If you didn't stand it, don't speak yet

1649
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:00,480
Come on

1650
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,840
Now the competitive spirit is fired up

1651
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,120
Three, two, one, go

1652
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,040
What you're saying is unclear to me

1653
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,040
Only music, nothing else

1654
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,000
I can't

1655
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,720
What you're saying is unclear to me

1656
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,800
Only good music

1657
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,120
What you're saying is unclear to me

1658
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,400
You can't just make it up, bro

1659
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,520
Original songs aren't allowed

1660
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,000
That's not allowed either

1661
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,160
"Our Song" by Wang Leehom

1662
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,080
No

1663
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,360
Darn it

1664
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,880
No one could sing at first

1665
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,560
Is it "The Beat Is Too Strong"?

1666
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,360
No

1667
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,160
Elva Hsiao

1668
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,520
What are you talking about?

1669
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,800
Feels like everything

1670
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,680
Not that one

1671
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,840
You're saying

1672
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,160
There's no "saying" in it, right?

1673
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:03,640
I know

1674
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,280
Bel canto

1675
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,240
I can't really understand what you're saying.

1676
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:20,280
Only good music makes things clear to me.

1677
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Words start to lose their meaning here.

1678
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,400
Only rhythm connects us.

1679
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,640
What song is this?

1680
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,000
No idea.

1681
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,320
I still don't get it.

1682
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,000
I have no clue.

1683
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,280
Never heard it.

1684
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:41,640
Come on.

1685
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,400
Next one.

1686
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,960
We have to win this one.

1687
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,440
Friends walk together for life.

1688
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,440
Friends walk together for life.

1689
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,520
Those days.

1690
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,240
And there's a tenor part.

1691
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,400
I'm a baritone, can't reach it.

1692
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,960
No more.

1693
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,360
Friends are never alone.

1694
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,680
One word, "friend," and you'll understand.

1695
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,440
There are still wounds, still pain.

1696
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,720
Still moving forward, and I'm here.

1697
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,520
You reckless guy.

1698
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,160
You went so high.

1699
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,080
Friend.

1700
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,840
Three, two, one, go.

1701
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,000
I can do it.

1702
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,320
Quick, pick it up.

1703
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,520
If we can't stay in each other's arms,

1704
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,760
why not, when we part,

1705
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,400
enjoy it while shedding tears?

1706
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,920
Off-key counts too, right?

1707
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:05,360
Walking through familiar streets.

1708
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,360
It's like talking, don't be afraid to make mistakes.

1709
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,680
Just don't get every word wrong.

1710
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,200
You know?

1711
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,320
Like this.

1712
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,000
Come on.

1713
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,040
Go up against Xingxu.

1714
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:21,880
Go ahead.

1715
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,040
Go easy on Xingxu.

1716
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,080
What are you talking about?

1717
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,720
Xingxu hasn't succeeded once.

1718
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,360
Xingxu, don't feel any pressure.

1719
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,880
Yeah.

1720
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,200
Just throw it however you want.

1721
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,720
It's fine.

1722
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,080
No worries.

1723
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:30,960
Next question.

1724
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,640
Suddenly.

1725
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,920
Suddenly.

1726
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,320
Suddenly, the sky turned dark.

1727
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,760
The world can suddenly become empty.

1728
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,000
I thought of you.

1729
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,560
Then I thought of myself.

1730
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,800
Why am I always so vulnerable?

1731
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,800
It's so hopeless.

1732
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,280
Missing you.

1733
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,920
Let's just enjoy the view for a bit.

1734
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,640
I think I've heard this song.

1735
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,560
But after you sang it,

1736
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,720
I feel like I haven't heard it before.

1737
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:15,880
Like this.

1738
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,800
Gong Jun, your turn.

1739
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,520
Go ahead.

1740
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,680
Xingxu, maybe let someone else try.

1741
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,400
Go ahead.

1742
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:21,680
He.

1743
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,040
You do it.

1744
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,800
Who do you want us to throw?

1745
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,040
I think the girl over there.

1746
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,800
It was her just now.

1747
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,880
She succeeded in one try earlier.

1748
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,480
It was her just now.

1749
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,920
She did it in one go.

1750
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,320
One second.

1751
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,280
I almost missed the "suddenly" part.

1752
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,600
Suddenly.

1753
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,440
It's Junjun's turn.

1754
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,560
It's Junjun's turn.

1755
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,160
Alright, that's fine.

1756
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,040
Why do I feel like I can beat him?

1757
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,040
Gong Jun.

1758
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,120
Time to wise up.

1759
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:50,800
Gong Jun.

1760
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,960
Gong Jun, don't be too competitive.

1761
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,280
I'm very competitive.

1762
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,880
I'm strong.

1763
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,840
It's just temporary.

1764
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,720
Just be quiet.

1765
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,200
Come on.

1766
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,920
Three, two, one, go.

1767
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,960
Curled lashes, eyes blinking away

1768
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,800
Solo

1769
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,800
Your smile is curved like the crescent moon

1770
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,120
The atmosphere is so romantic

1771
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,920
I need you by my side

1772
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,399
Curled lashes, eyes blinking away

1773
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:34,000
The world feels so fun when my heart flutters

1774
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:38,240
Off key

1775
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,399
Now that's really off key

1776
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:46,040
Someone who falls in love at first sight

1777
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,120
If we let this pass

1778
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,600
We'd be going too easy

1779
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,960
Let's leave it at that

1780
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,200
Be sensible, Junjun

1781
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,479
One point

1782
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,399
Okay

1783
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,080
What song is this?

1784
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,760
Who cares what song it is

1785
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,439
I don't know either

1786
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,760
Come on, let's start

1787
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,000
Me

1788
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,840
Don't give them any hints

1789
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,680
I ask why, that girl sent

1790
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,640
I don't know this song

1791
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:19,680
You don't?

1792
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,600
I don't

1793
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,520
You

1794
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,200
Can't throw it

1795
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,040
Can't do it either

1796
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,640
Can't do that either

1797
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,880
You go on

1798
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,880
If we throw it, we sing

1799
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:29,680
Come on!

1800
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,520
Almost there

1801
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,760
I ask why

1802
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,439
That girl sent me a message

1803
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,720
But why do you

1804
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,000
Stay silent, head down, without explaining

1805
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,760
Can't tell what they're singing

1806
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,840
No idea at all

1807
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:55,480
But I understand, you don't want to fix anything

1808
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,120
I'm trying hard to hear his voice

1809
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,880
Can't make it out from here

1810
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,080
They're singing it right

1811
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,200
Somewhere between off key and harmony

1812
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,800
Songbird harmonies

1813
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,440
Let's make it harder

1814
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,720
Four versus four

1815
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,280
Everyone has to succeed before we can sing this

1816
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,520
Alright

1817
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:13,920
What about you?

1818
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,600
You're not singing?

1819
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,720
Then just take this skill

1820
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,960
And master it for me

1821
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,600
I'll tell you in the future

1822
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,320
You can throw this and make it stand like this too

1823
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,200
Alright?

1824
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,040
Max out this skill for me

1825
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,880
Give me one more chance

1826
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,520
Come on

1827
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,000
Three, two, one, go

1828
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,680
I can sing this one

1829
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:46,400
There are so many people in this world

1830
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:08,680
There are so many people in this world

1831
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,200
You always start so high

1832
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,560
In the crowd, there is

1833
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,400
You start one

1834
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,920
This world

1835
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,560
has so many people

1836
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,040
There's an open door in the crowd

1837
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,960
In my hazy eyes, it always remains

1838
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,280
The first time I saw you, in the blue morning

1839
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,240
After it's over, take one back to your room

1840
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,240
Practice in your room

1841
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:45,760
Alright

1842
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,080
I'll test you tomorrow morning

1843
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,000
Okay, come on

1844
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,080
Three, two, one, go

1845
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,520
You do your thing

1846
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,920
They can't do it anyway

1847
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,400
No rush, take it slow

1848
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,080
Okay

1849
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,720
Just missing the right feel

1850
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,640
What is this

1851
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,240
Three, two, one, go

1852
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,120
No big wishes

1853
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,640
No big wishes

1854
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,120
Nothing urgent to do

1855
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,880
See the red light at the intersection keep flashing

1856
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,160
It's like a little sun winking

1857
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,640
So light doesn't help with this

1858
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,360
You need to know how to sing

1859
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,840
How do they know so many songs

1860
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,880
Because we have people from every age group

1861
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,760
We're about the same

1862
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,000
They're doing something over there, what's up

1863
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,120
What's going on

1864
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,400
Yours covers a wider range

1865
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,400
Actually, it's broader

1866
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,120
You have one here

1867
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:48,800
Post-95s

1868
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,960
Post-95s

1869
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,920
I'm useless

1870
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,760
Come on, keep going

1871
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,200
We can't let them mess up our rhythm

1872
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,840
This, them

1873
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,200
Even if they try, I don't think they'll get it

1874
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:14,560
Love is like quicksand

1875
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,080
I won't struggle

1876
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,280
Let it be

1877
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,920
I'm not afraid

1878
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,760
Love is like quicksand

1879
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,200
Like quicksand

1880
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,280
The worries in my heart

1881
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,520
I don't want to let go

1882
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,040
Baby, let me be like this

1883
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,080
Next time, can I start

1884
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,840
You're too intense

1885
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,680
You always start in the female key

1886
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,240
Friends walk together for a lifetime

1887
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,040
Those days are gone

1888
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,440
Since we can't stay in each other's arms

1889
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,080
Why not, when we part

1890
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,160
There are so many people in this world

1891
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,520
In the crowd, there is

1892
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,520
Guys can't reach this key

1893
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,880
And girls can't go that low

1894
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,800
I can't understand what they're singing over there

1895
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,520
Next question

1896
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:23,840
Start

1897
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,680
What's up with you two

1898
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,160
Like me

1899
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,720
Was it wrong

1900
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,520
Wrong, you sang it incorrectly

1901
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,920
This one's wrong, this one

1902
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,720
No.

1903
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,760
For all the pain of persistent love.

1904
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,880
You're singing this one.

1905
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,040
How, after more than twenty years,

1906
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,840
are we still drifting in the crowd?

1907
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,600
Isn't it this song?

1908
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,040
No.

1909
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,760
Do you need us to show you?

1910
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,080
People as outstanding as me

1911
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,400
should have had a brilliant life.

1912
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,760
You're singing "For all the pain of persistent love."

1913
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,200
For all the wounds of persistent hate.

1914
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,280
Right.

1915
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,080
People as outstanding as me

1916
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,640
He can.

1917
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,560
Xingxu will sing it for you.

1918
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,280
He can sing it.

1919
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,600
People as outstanding as me

1920
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,200
Shut up.

1921
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,120
You sing.

1922
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,080
should have had a brilliant life.

1923
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,400
I don't know the tune either.

1924
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,760
Wait, hold on.

1925
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:41,840
Honglei will sing.

1926
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,040
People as outstanding as me

1927
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,240
should have had a brilliant life.

1928
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,760
How, after more than twenty years,

1929
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,840
are we still drifting in the crowd?

1930
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,720
Let me tell you why it's wrong.

1931
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,960
Because your first line's melody is off.

1932
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,600
I'll help you start.

1933
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,040
It's like this.

1934
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,600
People as outstanding as me

1935
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,880
should have had a brilliant life.

1936
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,440
Come on, let's start over.

1937
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,280
People as outstanding as me

1938
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:16,920
Okay.

1939
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,200
Three, two, one, go.

1940
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,080
People as outstanding as me

1941
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,120
should have had a brilliant life.

1942
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,920
Seriously, stop singing.

1943
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,520
Let's skip this one.

1944
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,160
How, after more than twenty years,

1945
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,440
are we still drifting in the crowd?

1946
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,000
No, I can't do it either.

1947
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,200
I can't find the tune.

1948
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:42,880
This is hopeless.

1949
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,200
Sing it again.

1950
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,480
The first line is

1951
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,840
People as outstanding as me

1952
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,840
should have had a brilliant life.

1953
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:57,120
People as outstanding as me

1954
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:01,280
should have had a brilliant life.

1955
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,480
Okay, next line.

1956
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,200
Go on.

1957
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,920
How, after more than twenty years,

1958
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,680
are we still drifting in the crowd?

1959
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,880
Okay.

1960
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,640
Great, well done.

1961
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,520
Give it to them.

1962
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,320
Give it to them.

1963
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:18,840
Just give it to them.

1964
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,200
It's not a fair win.

1965
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:21,800
Come on.

1966
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,400
Three, two, one.

1967
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:31,880
Spring leaves, spring returns

1968
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,040
Spring leaves, spring returns

1969
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,960
Alright, let's start

1970
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,640
Spring leaves, spring returns

1971
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,880
Three, two, one

1972
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,240
You start

1973
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,800
Spring leaves, spring will come again

1974
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,240
Flowers fade, but will bloom again

1975
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:51,000
As long as you want

1976
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,800
Let dreams sail into your heart

1977
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,160
Seriously? What a coincidence

1978
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,200
We got this part, and then

1979
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,520
He didn't stand up

1980
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,400
Guys, be sensible

1981
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,320
Alright, be sensible

1982
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,200
Be sensible

1983
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,320
Just don't toss the bottle too fast

1984
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,160
Okay

1985
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,640
Just pretend your hand's numb

1986
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:14,480
It's hot

1987
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,480
They're talking like this

1988
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,120
It means they've already grabbed their stuff

1989
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:17,920
Right? Now they've already

1990
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:19,720
Is that so?

1991
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,360
Alright, next

1992
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,880
They'll definitely get this one

1993
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,280
It's my turn again

1994
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,080
Wait a second, guys

1995
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:31,840
Are we singing or not?

1996
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,920
I'll toss it again

1997
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,960
Hold on, wait a moment

1998
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,600
Yeah, you go again

1999
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,760
I'll be more sensible

2000
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,720
Wait a second, bro

2001
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,560
Let me try again

2002
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,640
Wait, yeah

2003
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,360
Look at the table

2004
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,320
Just like that, you conquered it

2005
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,840
I'm embarrassed to sing

2006
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,960
But you still dare to start

2007
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,040
You sing it yourself

2008
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,400
Cut off all escape routes

2009
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,640
Can we have some dignity, please?

2010
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,360
You guys don't know this song, do you?

2011
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,880
Do you want us to know it or not?

2012
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,160
Bro, do you know it or not?

2013
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,680
I can't say it

2014
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,120
Me neither

2015
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,880
Figure it out yourself

2016
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,000
Figure it out yourself

2017
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,160
How about this

2018
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,800
Let's sing it in English

2019
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,760
Let the guys

2020
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,640
Sing to us

2021
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,680
Like they've been conquered by us

2022
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,920
We'll count it as their win

2023
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,320
You can't humiliate them like this

2024
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:30,800
You can

2025
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,480
They can lose

2026
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,600
But don't insult them

2027
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,720
That's really humiliating

2028
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,120
What you just said

2029
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,040
Already lost all dignity

2030
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,920
Alright, we'll sing

2031
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,960
Are you giving us points or not?

2032
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,360
We'll give them to you

2033
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,320
Then sing

2034
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,600
What's the big deal?

2035
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,480
Ready, go.

2036
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,080
Just like that, I'm conquered by you.

2037
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,680
Just like that, I'm conquered by you.

2038
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:58,920
All my escape routes are cut off.

2039
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,560
My mood is strong.

2040
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,040
But my decisions are confused.

2041
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,320
Alright.

2042
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,160
It's five to four now.

2043
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,640
Five to four.

2044
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,200
Wait a second.

2045
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,960
You can blame something else.

2046
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,160
You can even blame the score.

2047
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,320
Just insist.

2048
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,320
Just insist.

2049
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,440
Naiwen, next round.

2050
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,440
I won.

2051
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,400
I won.

2052
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,520
Next.

2053
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:27,920
Start.

2054
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,800
I've really mastered it.

2055
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,240
Sometimes, sometimes,

2056
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,920
I believe everything has an end.

2057
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,840
Meeting and parting both happen sometimes.

2058
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,080
Nothing lasts forever.

2059
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,080
Bro.

2060
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,400
You got so excited.

2061
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,280
How did you turn it into rock?

2062
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,560
He got so excited that...

2063
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,760
Nothing lasts forever.

2064
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,640
Really.

2065
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:04,960
So excited.

2066
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:05,680
Caught up!

2067
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,320
Alright.

2068
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,080
Go for it!

2069
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,680
Go for it!

2070
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,320
Finally revived.

2071
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,360
Just need to get through one round.

2072
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,560
Then it'll be smooth sailing.

2073
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,360
Let me tell you.

2074
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,840
After this question, we'll eat.

2075
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,640
Alright, let's go.

2076
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,680
We're not letting them win anymore.

2077
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,320
Come on.

2078
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,600
Three, two, one, start!

2079
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:21,680
I've really mastered it.

2080
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,560
The one who loves you most is me.

2081
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,400
How could you bear to make me sad?

2082
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,280
When I needed you most,

2083
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:46,720
You left without a word.

2084
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,320
Go.

2085
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,080
Vocal practice is over.

2086
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,520
The young team wins.

2087
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,160
Next, everyone can start

2088
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,400
enjoying the Catania family-style dinner.

2089
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,080
Come on, let's eat.

2090
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,080
It's hard to beat them.

2091
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,520
But with you here, it's not hard.

2092
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,480
With you here,

2093
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,720
it's not hard.

2094
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,640
I'm hungry.

2095
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,560
Have a piece, this is delicious, really good.

2096
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,680
Nice, this meat is so tender.

2097
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,760
Have another piece.

2098
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:22,840
Give it to them.

2099
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,960
I just had one.

2100
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,800
Steamed beef ribs.

2101
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,080
Yeah, it's really tasty anyway.

2102
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,960
It's like our Sichuan cuisine.

2103
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,120
Who made this?

2104
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,000
It was the elderly lady from the guesthouse.

2105
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,560
At a local restaurant.

2106
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,960
She arranged dinner for everyone.

2107
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,320
Hello.

2108
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,120
Hello.

2109
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,040
Thank you.

2110
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,360
Thank you.

2111
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:48,600
Hello.

2112
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,720
Thank you so much.

2113
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,440
Your visit truly touched me.

2114
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,400
It's a great honor for us.

2115
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:53,920
Thank you for your hospitality.

2116
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,880
This meal is delicious.

2117
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,280
It's so tasty.

2118
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,160
The food at this restaurant

2119
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,200
is the best to me.

2120
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,960
Not just for me,

2121
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,320
but for all of Italy.

2122
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,800
And for Sicily too.

2123
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,360
Sicily.

2124
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,240
Do you know why?

2125
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:10,480
I knew this place since I was five.

2126
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,080
I'm sixty-seven this year.

2127
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,640
It's been here for sixty-two years.

2128
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,720
More than sixty-two years.

2129
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,120
Yes.

2130
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,640
Come again if you have time.

2131
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,240
Maybe next time.

2132
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,640
Maybe next year.

2133
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:27,680
Some people come three or four times.

2134
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,600
Because Sicily is so livable.

2135
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,440
Great food, good weather.

2136
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,480
Sicily is beautiful everywhere.

2137
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,400
Yes.

2138
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,720
Sicily also has a famous landmark.

2139
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,320
Mount Etna.

2140
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,040
We saw it today.

2141
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,400
In history, Catania

2142
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,960
was destroyed several times by lava and earthquakes.

2143
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,240
But people rebuilt on the same site.

2144
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,040
Because volcanic ash makes the land

2145
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,920
extremely fertile.

2146
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,680
So the flowers here,

2147
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,520
food, fruits, and vegetables

2148
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,760
are different from anywhere else.

2149
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,160
Thank you.

2150
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,160
Thank you.

2151
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,240
Thank you very much.

2152
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,720
Looking forward to seeing you next time.

2153
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:14,760
Thank you.

2154
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,160
What song should we sing?

2155
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,000
Let's discuss.

2156
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,960
I think we should sing a Chinese song here.

2157
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,240
Yes.

2158
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,680
Of course, that's what I meant.

2159
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,440
Pick a song everyone knows.

2160
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,680
Didn't you want to sing Beyond? You guys before...

2161
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,880
Boundless Ocean, Vast Sky.

2162
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:26,800
If it's Beyond,

2163
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,360
we can sing it in Cantonese.

2164
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,120
Let's do this one.

2165
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:29,880
Boundless Ocean, Vast Sky.

2166
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,520
Yes.

2167
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,120
Okay.

2168
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,520
What are we doing now?

2169
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,040
Going to the square.

2170
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,440
Let's go.

2171
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,040
Hurry up, friends.

2172
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,600
We're going to rock the street, right?

2173
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,560
Time to dance.

2174
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,400
Yes, let's dance.

2175
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,640
Elephant Square.

2176
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,840
Is it really this lively?

2177
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,760
Amazing!

2178
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,360
Fantastic!

2179
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,120
Hello, everyone.

2180
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,880
We are from China.

2181
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,600
We'd like to sing a song for you.

2182
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:28,840
Let's get started.

2183
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,160
Alright.

2184
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:29,840
"Bella Ciao"

2185
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:30,800
We'll sing it in Chinese.

2186
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,640
Come on.

2187
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,320
Are you ready?

2188
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,880
Come on, everyone.

2189
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,560
I love China.

2190
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,640
Thank you.

2191
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,520
Thank you.

2192
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,480
Thank you.

2193
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,520
Thank you.

2194
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,600
Thank you.

2195
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,640
We hope you all have a wonderful night.

2196
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,400
Good night.

2197
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,720
Good night.

2198
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,480
Good night, thank you.

2199
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,480
The world is so fresh.

2200
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,240
The world is right before our eyes.

2201
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,000
Sicily has an unbreakable bond with cinema.

2202
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,160
Today, we're here too.

2203
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,280
To experience a movie-like life.

2204
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,200
Today, the eight siblings of the Earth Family

2205
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,080
are discussing a family business merger plan.

2206
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,680
We'll have three rounds of voting

2207
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,720
to find the two who oppose the merger.

2208
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,920
Today is

2209
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,760
Trying to sow discord among us eight siblings, huh?

2210
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,080
This is getting interesting.

2211
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,480
You don't look like a good guy.

2212
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,120
Do I look like a bad guy?

2213
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,160
Why do you keep posing like a boss?

2214
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:01,600
Just now.

2215
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,880
I didn't do anything.

2216
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,920
It's just the first round of voting.

2217
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,440
It's a blind vote.

2218
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,680
Every vote is stressful for the opponents.

2219
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,080
Filming location of "Malèna".

2220
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,000
Syracuse.

2221
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,360
Was that scene shot right here?

2222
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,040
The scene where they look for the lawyer.

2223
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,480
Let's do a Sicilian one.

2224
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,960
Yuwen, let's go.

2225
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,680
I'll pretend to be a couple with Didi.

2226
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,480
Are there any flowers?

2227
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,080
The three of us will play three street punks.

2228
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,240
Street punks.

2229
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,600
You're making me uncomfortable.

2230
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,440
Look at you.

2231
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,360
You make me uncomfortable like this.

2232
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,160
Look at you.

2233
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,360
Where should I look?

2234
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:34,720
I'm looking.

2235
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,600
This is too hard.

2236
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:40,600
That's amazing.

2237
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,160
He finally became the captain.

2238
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,000
I want to be the only vice-captain.

2239
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,400
Take him down.

2240
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,680
That's how bold I am.

2241
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,920
Kiss the shark.

2242
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,320
So who are the "two wolves" in your mind?

2243
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,240
Like Naiwen.

2244
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,120
Xingxu.

2245
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,120
Let's see if we win or lose.

2246
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:05,880
I'm really looking forward to this answer.

2247
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:06,160
Come on.

2248
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,960
Dance with youth.

2249
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,720
Come on, twist!

2250
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:15,920
Left and right.

2251
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,800
Left—you stepped on my foot.

2252
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,560
Sorry, bro.

2253
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,240
I saw it.

2254
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,240
How did it get stuck there?

2255
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,640
Jump and go wild!

2256
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,280
Let's go, I'll buy groceries. Come on.

2257
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,040
It's so big.

2258
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:35,800
Grilled eggplant.

2259
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,200
Guys, should we get some more chicken legs?

2260
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,760
Vegetables, I want vegetables.

2261
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,440
Can we buy some?

2262
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,400
Cilantro, spinach, cabbage.

2263
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,040
Is this cilantro?

2264
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,200
This isn't cilantro.

2265
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,000
A silk scarf from the Palace Museum

2266
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,280
You have to tell him

2267
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,360
I have a beautiful daughter

2268
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,040
She doesn't have a boyfriend

2269
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,960
She says she has a very beautiful daughter

2270
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,360
Who doesn't have a boyfriend yet

2271
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,600
Xingxu, stay here

2272
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,560
I'm getting nervous

2273
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,280
I don't even know what to say

2274
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:29,800
I don't even know what to say

2275
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,560
Please help take more photos

2276
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,240
My two daughters

2277
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,080
Stay here, such a big house

2278
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,480
But I don't have any special skills

2279
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,120
It's okay, you can learn

2280
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,960
Grow eggplants

2281
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:47,760
Grow eggplants

2282
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,480
I'll fix that iron house for her

2283
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,120
And there are gifts you can give her

2284
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,240
A Chinese lion dance figurine

2285
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,560
Dried wild mushrooms

2286
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,880
A hairpin for putting up hair

2287
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,000
It even comes with a small comb

2288
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,240
A Chinese panda

2289
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,040
This is a traditional Chinese sachet

2290
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,960
And you look like someone who stepped out of a painting

2291
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:02,880
A beauty

2292
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:05,200
I have to say something

2293
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,480
I'm old

2294
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,920
And I'm married too

2295
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,400
Otherwise, we would have eloped long ago

2296
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,600
Thank you

2297
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,360
See?

2298
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,400
You've stirred up the old lady's heart
