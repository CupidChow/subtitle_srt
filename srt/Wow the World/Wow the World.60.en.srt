1
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
The romance of Barcelona

2
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
Passion and imagination

3
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,200
run deep in the veins of this city

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,600
crystallized in its architecture

5
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
culture and daily life

6
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,760
At the heart of this spirit is

7
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,080
"enjoying life to the fullest"

8
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,240
Today, we are part of it too

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,280
opening our senses

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
and feeling the warmth of the Mediterranean sun

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
the passion of Barcelona

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
and the wonders of Gaudí's architecture

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,560
Good morning

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,640
Morning

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
Hello

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm back

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,240
Grand return

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,080
Official announcement

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,280
Officially back

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,040
Solo time is over

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,480
You’re all sitting here

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,720
Yu Ning and I were just talking about old soy sauce

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,520
Your legs are really long

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,200
Why are you wearing a vest underneath?

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,760
What do you mean?

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,000
Everyone

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,320
With a warm round of applause

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,000
Let’s welcome Sister Wang back

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
Missed you

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,440
Missed you so much

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
I heard a lot happened

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
Stories nobody knows

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,080
Because you weren’t here

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,040
Xing Xu and Lin Yi

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
Developed quickly

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,440
Yeah

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,640
Bro

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,280
Let the unknown stay unknown

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
What was it called?

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
Xing

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,320
“One Xing, One Heart”

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Yu Wen

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,480
Let’s switch seats

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,160
Come over here

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,840
Come here

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Everyone

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,480
Barcelona

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
Is a city full of passion

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,160
Next

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,000
We will use

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,320
The upgraded “Cover the Hole” game

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,680
To experience Barcelona’s

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,440
Sunshine and passion

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,960
Groups of three

56
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,840
The Cover group needs to

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,800
Copy the dance moves from the other group

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,960
If the Observer group guesses right, they get a point

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,840
Otherwise, the Cover group gets a point

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,600
The group with the lowest score must give the winning group

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,400
During today’s tour

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
The whole time

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Hold an umbrella

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
That’s so cruel

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,920
This is good

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,360
What are the rules for dividing?

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
Since Sister Wang is back

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
Let Sister Wang divide the teams

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,960
Okay, let me think

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
The “old couple” can’t be in the same group

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,640
Why?

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,640
Look

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
Trust me

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
You know my heart will break

75
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,880
Alright

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,920
Listen to Captain Wang

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,640
Xing Xu and Lin Yi can’t be in the same group

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay, they can’t be together

79
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay

80
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,320
Sister Jing and Ning can’t be in the same group

81
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,360
You two can’t be together either

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,920
The Burp group

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,800
Today is all about splitting up

84
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
One word: split

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Alright then

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,800
He, Lin Yi

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
The three of us are a group

88
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Three girls

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Good for covering

90
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,920
Alright

91
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Okay, first group

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Girls, right?

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,680
No problem

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,280
Go ahead

95
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,640
Take the smallest one

96
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,080
The kind of globe you don’t even need to reach out for

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,640
Come on, let’s go over first

98
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,160
Come here

99
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,880
There’s someone acting like a spy

100
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
Keeps watching us

101
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,400
Everyone needs to keep a poker face, you know?

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Got it

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Everyone has to think it’s about themselves

104
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
Let’s play rock-paper-scissors

105
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,040
Let fate decide

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay, but you have to remember.

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,880
Alright.

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,760
It's not with me.

109
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,160
On us.

110
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,600
Yeah.

111
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
Just remember, it's with her.

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,440
Okay.

113
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,160
Like this, stick it here.

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,399
Hold your clothes like this.

115
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
Then they won't notice.

116
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,519
Alright.

117
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,400
Is it that cool?

118
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
This look.

119
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Jump, everyone!

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
Can you guys in front move aside?

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,600
Sorry.

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,920
Sorry.

123
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,400
It's fine.

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,000
It's fine.

125
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,480
Jing Jing is fine.

126
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,360
I totally forgot.

127
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,440
I forgot about them sticking the tag.

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,360
Okay.

129
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,280
Done jumping.

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to...

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to do a move.

132
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,840
What move, bro?

133
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,120
Go ahead.

134
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm confused.

135
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
What do I do now?

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
My move is too hard, seriously.

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
That's wild.

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,240
Wait a second.

139
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,080
Hold on.

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,440
Wait.

141
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,400
Let me do it myself, okay?

142
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,600
You do it yourself.

143
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,840
Yeah.

144
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,600
Hands up.

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
Raise your hands too.

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,680
Up.

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,240
It's fine.

148
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,160
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

149
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,560
Alright then.

150
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay.

151
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,160
What's this?

152
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,480
No.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hands need to open.

154
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,800
They're open.

155
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,440
It's my turn.

156
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,040
I can do it myself too.

157
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,680
Okay.

158
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
Run over at this angle.

159
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Actually, it's just...

160
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,320
I can't.

161
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,400
I can't do it myself.

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
Can you guys cover for me?

163
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
Wait a second.

164
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,520
You pinch my side.

165
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,160
Wait.

166
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,760
Hold on.

167
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,640
One, two, three.

168
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,520
Okay.

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,040
It's with Yu Wen.

170
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,120
Maybe.

171
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,360
It's not on the pants at all.

172
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,280
They're holding it in their hands.

173
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,280
I saw it.

174
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
It's in Sister Jing's right hand.

175
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,680
That's the one.

176
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,560
That's it.

177
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,160
In Sister Jing's right hand.

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Sister Jing's right hand.

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
Let me do one.

180
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,800
Like this.

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay.

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,640
Yu Wen.

183
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,480
Yu Wen, do it once.

184
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,680
I'll pinch yours, you pinch mine.

185
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
Wait, I...

186
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,320
No, I'll pinch myself.

187
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
I'll pinch, let's pinch together.

188
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Ready.

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,960
Go.

190
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Let's switch to someone else.

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,120
Sister Jing.

192
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,360
Come on.

193
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,520
Jing, let's have you do it.

194
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,000
Use that side.

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,280
Okay.

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,880
Ready.

197
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,640
Wait, my pants are about to be pulled down.

198
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
It's not in my hand.

199
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
You're looking at the nails, right?

200
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm looking at the nails.

201
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
Yeah, you're looking at the nails.

202
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,360
It's the nails.

203
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,240
No flaws at all.

204
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,680
Right.

205
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
No flaws.

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
We want Yu Wen to do it again.

207
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,120
No way.

208
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,440
No, I already finished.

209
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
Why?

210
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
Because I didn't see it just now.

211
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,960
It's done.

212
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,800
It's done, why is there one more round?

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,960
How can we do it again?

214
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
How many times do we have to do this?

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,360
It's our turn.

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,720
This one.

217
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,280
This move.

218
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,160
So cool.

219
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Looks good.

220
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,880
Alright.

221
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,280
Then I need to lift my hand.

222
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,240
Yeah, so do it like this.

223
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Face this way.

224
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,640
No.

225
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,520
They already know it's Sister Wang.

226
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,160
Okay.

227
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
Alright, I'll do it like this.

228
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,600
You need to spin.

229
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,280
Twist together.

230
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,080
Twist clockwise.

231
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,640
Okay.

232
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,680
One, two, three.

233
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Alright.

234
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
Okay.

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,160
It's on Yu Wen.

236
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,920
How did you know it was on her?

237
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Brother Honglei, do one.

238
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,000
This isn't hard.

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
It's not hard for you three.

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
Three rounds.

241
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,280
Lei Zi.

242
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
You guys are making it so difficult.

243
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
Be careful later, I'm warning you.

244
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,880
Just wait.

245
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,960
We'll do the splits then.

246
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,040
Lei Zi.

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,760
Sun Honglei, playing tricks, huh?

248
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,120
No.

249
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,760
Trying to mess with us, huh?

250
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,280
It's just a game.

251
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,360
Gotta have the spirit of the game.

252
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,640
Lei Zi.

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Don't take it to heart.

254
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,720
Like this.

255
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,240
The people below should squat down.

256
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
That way, hands won't hit each other.

257
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,680
Alright.

258
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:05,960
Let's go.

259
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,360
Okay.

260
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
Come on, I'll grab one each.

261
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Do we need to spin?

262
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,640
Yes.

263
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,880
Let's do it together.

264
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Go this way first.

265
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Sister Jin, let's lower ourselves.

266
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Let her do this, yeah, good.

267
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,120
One, two, three.

268
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,840
Go.

269
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,120
Smart.

270
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,680
Alright, let's go.

271
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay.

272
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,440
Okay.

273
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,960
So dizzy.

274
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
Very smart.

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
I still haven't figured it out.

276
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,000
Can't guess it.

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,720
Absolutely can't guess.

278
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
They're amazing.

279
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,720
Really incredible.

280
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,400
No clues at all.

281
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Girls.

282
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
They're just awesome.

283
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,280
Actually, those three girls

284
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,000
Honestly, they're a bit sneaky.

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They're like a beautiful scenery.

286
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,560
To be honest,

287
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,120
Because I

288
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
Halfway through the game,

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,160
I just realized

290
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,280
we were actually competing.

291
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,480
I was just watching them.

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
All their moves,

293
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
were perfect.

294
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
So impressive.

295
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Lose to them.

296
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,080
Come on.

297
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's just lose to them now.

298
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,400
I'll confess.

299
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,440
I'll tell them right now.

300
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,320
I'll confess.

301
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,560
Confess.

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,640
It's me.

303
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,240
Confess.

304
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Let's sum up who among us three.

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
Jin Jing, Sister Jing.

306
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,880
I think it's her too.

307
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,760
Who do you think?

308
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
I think it's her too.

309
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,200
Didi, is it you?

310
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
You can think it's me.

311
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
I think it's you.

312
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,680
It's us.

313
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,480
It's one of the three of us.

314
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,960
Three, two, one.

315
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,680
Alright, let's go.

316
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,760
Play the music.

317
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
No.

318
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,360
Flawless.

319
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,960
So tiny.

320
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,920
Tall.

321
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,040
Really tall.

322
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,280
Totally convinced.

323
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,200
High five.

324
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,600
Awesome.

325
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,440
See, I said they're the scenery.

326
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,520
I didn't even see when the hand moved away.

327
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
Just watching people, right, He?

328
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,120
Yeah.

329
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,440
We're basically just

330
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
completely defeated.

331
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,560
We perfectly avoided

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
all the correct answers.

333
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Congrats to our beautiful scenery.

334
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,200
Alright.

335
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,920
Earned a point alone.

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,960
Impressive.

337
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
Impressive.

338
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,680
Amazing, girls helping girls.

339
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,560
Come on.

340
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,040
Come on.

341
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,120
One on the face.

342
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,240
How about one on the chest?

343
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,360
Grab it.

344
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
Covering the chest too.

345
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,240
Pretty awkward.

346
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Someone has to be awkward.

347
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
Can't be totally not awkward.

348
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,320
Okay.

349
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,160
I'll take the blame.

350
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
My hands are big.

351
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,520
Five Finger Mountain.

352
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,920
At first, bro,

353
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,720
Bro's gotta save face.

354
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,160
Bro's gotta save face.

355
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, but this

356
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,120
Our chest has to be like this too.

357
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,560
We have to do this.

358
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
Yeah, thought it was here.

359
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,680
Preset it.

360
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,360
All stuck on.

361
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,480
Let's crush them, come on.

362
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,200
Just do it.

363
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Okay.

365
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,200
You started it.

366
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,800
So ugly.

367
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
What kind of dance is this?

368
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,440
Doesn't matter.

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,080
My heart hurts.

370
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Lin Yi.

371
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,720
What are you doing, Lin Yi?

372
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,280
Lin Yi, are you itchy?

373
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,320
Go take a shower, Lin Yi.

374
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,920
Come on.

375
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Okay, I'll give them a move.

376
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,040
Go easy on us.

377
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,440
What is this?

378
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,880
Alright.

379
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,240
Okay.

380
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,520
Great.

381
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,000
Awesome.

382
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,720
What should we do?

383
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,200
How do we do this?

384
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,040
What now?

385
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,840
Turn around.

386
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,160
That's dangerous.

387
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,840
Should I cover it?

388
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,400
Uh...

389
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,040
Wait a second.

390
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,440
My chest.

391
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,000
My chest.

392
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
What's wrong with your chest?

393
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,760
Someone needs to cover my chest.

394
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Right, okay, let's go.

395
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,720
Look at Lin Yi.

396
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,960
It's tough for Lin Yi.

397
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
Put your hands together and shake your head.

398
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,680
Clap and shake your head.

399
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
From top to bottom.

400
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,080
Alright then.

401
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,120
Okay.

402
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,120
That was close.

403
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
That's enough.

404
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,640
Second person.

405
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,840
Is this okay?

406
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,200
Yes.

407
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,640
Then...

408
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,800
What are you doing up there?

409
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,600
Come.

410
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,200
Yeah, head movement starts here.

411
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,840
One, two, three.

412
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
What kind of performance art is this?

413
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,160
Come on.

414
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,280
Lin Yi.

415
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,840
Lin Yi, come here.

416
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,320
Naiwen, don't forget to cover your chest.

417
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,080
Naiwen.

418
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,880
Naiwen, remember your chest.

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,599
Forgot.

420
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,599
Come.

421
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,640
It's probably with He Ge.

422
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,840
Because he's the only one covering his face with his right hand.

423
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,800
So it's easier for him.

424
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,320
Most likely in He Ge's right hand.

425
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,840
Yeah.

426
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,360
Face.

427
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,800
Almost slapped me hard.

428
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,360
Alright.

429
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,560
Lin Yi's chest is really bouncy.

430
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,040
You're not covering for me anymore.

431
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
What is he doing?

432
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,120
He went to chat.

433
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,920
Okay.

434
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,320
No need to cover the chest now.

435
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
Ruled out.

436
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,040
You covered the wrong spot.

437
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
You got both sides wrong.

438
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,000
It's fine.

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,360
No chest covering, we're freer.

440
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,320
This hand is done.

441
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,800
Definitely on the face.

442
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,320
Right.

443
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,040
The second move is this.

444
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,080
Okay, just like that, let's go.

445
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,760
Alright.

446
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
Naiwen.

447
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
He's never covered his left cheek.

448
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Why are you covering him?

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,240
No.

450
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,160
Confuse.

451
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,960
Confuse everyone.

452
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,400
Who can you even confuse?

453
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,200
Such a sense of participation.

454
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,520
Join in.

455
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,720
Exposed.

456
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,880
Exposed.

457
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,240
Lin Yi, your face.

458
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,000
Your face.

459
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Your own face.

460
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,080
The whole round fell apart.

461
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,800
Now there are only two options left.

462
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
It's obvious.

463
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,840
Us.

464
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
Our group is too "dumb".

465
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,640
I give up.

466
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,880
Two "idiots".

467
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,320
Hurry.

468
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,920
Cover my face quickly.

469
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,120
You two play by yourselves.

470
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,080
Hurry up.

471
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,440
Right on my face.

472
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,880
Lin Yi isn't covering anymore.

473
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,440
It's all out in the open.

474
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,840
That's hilarious.

475
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,680
Lin Yi, you're our treasure.

476
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,560
I can see that.

477
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,040
Bow your head and admit it.

478
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,080
Bow your head and admit it.

479
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,040
Okay.

480
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,200
Come on, do another move.

481
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,120
What is all this?

482
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,760
Nice, girls. Awesome.

483
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,040
Go ahead, flip your hair.

484
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,320
Come on, it's easy.

485
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Uh...

486
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,040
You don't need to touch it.

487
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,000
Step aside, Lin Yi.

488
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,960
Lin Yi, no need to cover.

489
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,240
Lin Yi, no need to cover.

490
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
He really stepped aside.

491
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,440
Lin Yi, come here.

492
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,440
Lin Yi.

493
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,680
Cover this side tighter.

494
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,880
He really can't help at all.

495
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,640
Ready, go.

496
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,640
It's possible.

497
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,960
It could be with Naiwen.

498
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,120
Impossible.

499
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,440
Impossible.

500
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,440
Really?

501
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,520
Chen He.

502
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Look.

503
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,800
He didn't say left first or right first.

504
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,640
He's too casual.

505
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,680
He's too relaxed.

506
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,520
He, it's with He.

507
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,880
Alright.

508
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:15,840
Come on.

509
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,720
Is this necessary?

510
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,920
Lin Yi, just do it with empty hands.

511
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,960
Just do it with empty hands.

512
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,600
Alright.

513
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,920
Bow your head and admit it.

514
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,960
Bow your head and admit it.

515
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,800
You two are unbelievable.

516
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Darn it.

517
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,480
Totally forgot.

518
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,880
Forgot, got too happy and forgot we're competing.

519
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
Just playing for fun.

520
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,760
How do we choose?

521
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,520
How should we choose?

522
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,160
Let's go with He.

523
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,280
Alright, we'll listen to you, bro.

524
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,800
Okay, let's go.

525
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,960
Let's keep it the same.

526
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,320
Okay, still...

527
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,800
Naiwen.

528
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,360
They're with He.

529
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,920
It's nicely spread out.

530
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,400
Come on, give your answer.

531
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,800
You guys are something else.

532
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,280
Just two people.

533
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,120
Of course.

534
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,440
We're so smart.

535
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
Do you know how I figured it out?

536
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,600
Naiwen covered with this part.

537
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
You all covered with this part here.

538
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,840
And Lin Yi's...

539
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,880
His pinky was like this.

540
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,320
He was showing it from the start.

541
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,160
No personal attacks.

542
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,320
Personal attack.

543
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,640
The girls' team has two points now.

544
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,320
Honglei's team has zero points.

545
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,400
Naiwen's team has zero points.

546
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,240
Let's go.

547
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
Go.

548
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
Because the three of us are still, you know...

549
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:50,960
Alright.

550
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,880
Our heights are different.

551
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
That feels different too.

552
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,240
Okay.

553
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,840
The problem is our hip heights are different.

554
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,320
It's fine.

555
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,840
This...

556
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,360
This...

557
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
Look at him overall.

558
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Pretty much the same.

559
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
What's our basic move?

560
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,320
Yes, just like this.

561
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
Right, that's how I do it too.

562
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,840
We go out like this too.

563
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Just what you can hold onto.

564
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Your pants aren't winning today.

565
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
You two's pants.

566
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,760
Do you usually wear baggy pants?

567
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,360
Why are they so slim today?

568
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,160
Then put it on me.

569
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,720
Just put it on you.

570
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,440
Let's do it this way.

571
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay.

572
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,200
You can't see this.

573
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
Where should we put it?

574
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Let's put it here.

575
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
Alright, just like that.

576
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,640
Half.

577
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,400
Okay.

578
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
I'll go last.

579
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,120
You go last.

580
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,800
Let's stand by height.

581
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,080
Alright.

582
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Welcome.

583
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
One, two.

584
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,880
So cool!

585
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,120
One, two, three, go!

586
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,480
They're really choreographing inside.

587
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
You guys are doing this kind of dance?

588
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,960
Useless stuff, right?

589
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Each of us watches one person.

590
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,600
Alright, one person each.

591
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,360
I'll watch Brother Ning.

592
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,960
I'll watch Xu.

593
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,760
Then I'll watch Brother Honglei.

594
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,640
Alright, bro is dancing solo first.

595
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,840
He went to change into Pinru's clothes.

596
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,280
So handsome!

597
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,120
There's still some footwork.

598
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,960
Go, Didi.

599
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,440
Didi.

600
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,760
Go.

601
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,320
Didi, go.

602
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Be careful in the back, I'm telling you.

603
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,280
Come.

604
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,520
Come on.

605
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,760
Come here.

606
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:24,920
Bro.

607
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,600
You weren't like this with us just now.

608
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,280
This won't work.

609
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,120
Then let's do it this way.

610
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,640
Like this.

611
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,920
What's this?

612
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
What is this?

613
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,040
Wang Yuwen.

614
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,240
Me.

615
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,400
You grab this side of him.

616
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,520
I'll grab this side.

617
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,440
Then...

618
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Let's roll together.

619
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
The three of us roll together.

620
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,080
We can't roll together.

621
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,720
That's true.

622
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
How do we roll like this?

623
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,000
Isn't this the Invincible Wind Fire Wheel?

624
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,960
Got it.

625
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,640
Understood.

626
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,600
Oh, right.

627
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,320
Wait, no.

628
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,080
Come.

629
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,440
Alright.

630
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,480
Okay.

631
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,440
Good.

632
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,040
Alright.

633
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,200
I'll do it.

634
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,800
Come, you do it.

635
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,960
Help block for me.

636
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,840
Of course.

637
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,200
Come on.

638
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,080
Okay.

639
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,400
Roll.

640
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,800
He wasn't nervous at all when he rolled just now.

641
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,000
Bro, it's your turn.

642
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,320
It's my turn?

643
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,600
Alright.

644
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,840
Let's go all out.

645
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Let's do it.

646
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,480
Lift your legs.

647
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,640
Lift your legs.

648
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,000
Right.

649
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Okay.

650
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
It's in his right hand.

651
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
He never lets go of his right hand.

652
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:01,920
Go.

653
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,360
Go.

654
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,560
Go.

655
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,640
That's scary.

656
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,040
I really didn't see it.

657
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,440
I think it's...

658
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,080
With Brother Yuning, I guess.

659
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,920
I think so too.

660
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,720
He's very

661
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,360
nervous.

662
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,920
tense.

663
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,320
Yeah.

664
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,160
Instinctively.

665
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,920
Second move.

666
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,880
Let me try one.

667
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,280
Go ahead.

668
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,560
This one.

669
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,880
Leg needs to stretch.

670
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,520
Ballet move.

671
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,160
Stretch.

672
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,320
Yu Ning.

673
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:45,960
Okay.

674
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
It's fine.

675
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,960
Stretch.

676
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,080
Alright, I'll go in the middle.

677
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
You two still hold me here.

678
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,800
Left hand, your left hand.

679
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Xing Xu, no, you have to—

680
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,560
Wait, I'll use this hand.

681
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,280
Use this hand, use this.

682
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,840
Use this hand.

683
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,800
Alright, five, six, seven, go!

684
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,400
No way, these pants are too tight.

685
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,080
I don't want to watch you three perform anymore.

686
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,640
Because his hips—

687
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,760
aren't in the same place as theirs.

688
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,440
He can only squat like this.

689
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,720
He's helping to support others.

690
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,520
This game is way too hard for our team.

691
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Because Yu Ning's hip height—

692
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
isn't the same as ours.

693
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,240
All done.

694
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,760
Let's switch again.

695
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,200
Switch.

696
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,560
Xing Xu, come on.

697
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,840
Help me hold this.

698
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,600
Of course, I have to—

699
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Help me hold this.

700
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,080
Okay.

701
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,600
Three, two, one, go!

702
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
It's given to us.

703
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,480
Let's vote.

704
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,240
Who do you think?

705
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,680
Xu.

706
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:08,760
Okay.

707
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,560
Alright, good.

708
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,600
It's Brother Honglei.

709
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,880
Alright, we've finished choosing.

710
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,920
Xu.

711
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,760
Brother Honglei.

712
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,200
Are you sure?

713
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,520
Okay, let's go.

714
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,600
You won't regret it, right?

715
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,440
No regrets.

716
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,160
Alright, let's do it.

717
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,120
You go.

718
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,800
One hand, put one hand down.

719
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,080
Darn it.

720
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,000
He didn't.

721
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,760
Come back.

722
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,280
I'll do it.

723
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,280
Breakdance king.

724
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,960
His left hand.

725
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Because he doesn't have anyone on his left.

726
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,480
Right.

727
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,440
I couldn't tell at all.

728
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,960
We're too strong.

729
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,520
Total victory.

730
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,960
Yeah, you didn't miss a single point.

731
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,680
Perfect score.

732
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,920
So impressive.

733
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,920
This team is guaranteed to win, right?

734
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,360
I think so too.

735
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,920
What should we call our team?

736
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,640
We're called

737
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,920
Beautiful Scenery.

738
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,320
Beautiful Scenery Team.

739
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,000
Beautiful Scenery.

740
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,000
This team is really strong.

741
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,880
Usually,

742
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,440
we always team up with you.

743
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,080
Actually,

744
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,240
it kind of brings us down.

745
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,200
We're really holding back.

746
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,960
Seriously.

747
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
It's hard to go easy on you.

748
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,200
The next game is tug-of-war.

749
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,000
The next game is flipping.

750
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,080
So today,

751
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,960
the six of us gentlemen

752
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,920
will serve the ladies the whole time.

753
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,560
I feel a bit dizzy and unwell now.

754
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,240
I want some Mizone.

755
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,560
Someone's feeling faint.

756
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,440
Can you move?

757
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,400
Not feeling well.

758
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,920
It's so hot.

759
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,400
I want something to drink.

760
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,760
Where's the Mizone? Give it to her.

761
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,160
Who?

762
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
How do you open this?

763
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,560
It's stuck.

764
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,760
Let me try.

765
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,400
Let me try.

766
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
It's so hard to open, what should we do?

767
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,120
I'll do it.

768
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,320
I'll do it.

769
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,720
I'll do it.

770
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,800
It won't open.

771
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,840
Here.

772
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,080
Here, Miss Jin.

773
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,520
Why are you the one opening it for me?

774
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,880
Even if the "Duke" opens it for you, you complain.

775
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,400
Do you still want to get by in Spain?

776
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,800
Sorry.

777
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,120
Sorry.

778
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,600
Mizone, save me.

779
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,600
Wenzi, why are you taking a break?

780
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,520
After this round,

781
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm tired and hot.

782
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Am I really in the worst shape here?

783
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,520
No way.

784
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Could your energy be worse than us, the "old couple"?

785
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,440
Mizone, hurry and get some for Sister Wang.

786
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,320
How is it?

787
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,880
Refreshing.

788
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,720
Packed with vitamins.

789
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,120
One sip and I'm back to normal.

790
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,080
Mizone is back.

791
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,360
Mizone is the perfect travel buddy.

792
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,400
I've heard about it.

793
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Your famous bottle-standing moment.

794
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,680
Since I've recovered,

795
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,720
Should we have a little competition?

796
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,200
You want to challenge me?

797
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,360
Mizone challenge: within the time limit,

798
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,000
whoever tosses and stands the most Mizone bottles wins.

799
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,320
The variety show gods are on my side.

800
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,440
We're like Crouching Dragon and Young Phoenix here.

801
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm done playing.

802
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,520
Invite Sun Honglei.

803
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,120
Send a Mizone recovery pack to Wang Yuwen.

804
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,640
Get your energy back with Mizone.

805
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,720
Ready for more challenges on the journey.

806
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
I think just now,

807
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,480
it was because I didn't drink Mizone.

808
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,280
How is that possible?

809
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,320
I always win.

810
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,040
I couldn't get my energy back.

811
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,160
Alright, every knight, grab an umbrella.

812
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
You can even open it yourself.

813
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,400
Um...

814
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,360
You can hold the umbrellas,

815
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
but don't poke our heads with them.

816
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,080
Let's do an umbrella dance.

817
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,560
Umbrella dances are usually

818
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,080
a bit cooler than this.

819
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,520
Why are you doing it like that?

820
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,960
I see rain.

821
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,600
I see rain.

822
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,120
"Singin' in the Rain"

823
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,800
It's "Singin' in the Rain," right?

824
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
Isn't it just this?

825
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,640
Yeah.

826
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,800
Why are they so happy with umbrellas?

827
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,320
Never give guys

828
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,440
anything shaped like a stick.

829
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,040
Seriously.

830
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,760
They just can't stop playing.

831
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,920
They really love to play.

832
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
They just keep playing.

833
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,960
Go!

834
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,480
Hurry!

835
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,720
Umbrellas in the back, keep up!

836
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,840
It's so hot.

837
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,520
Me too.

838
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,160
Princess, please walk.

839
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,320
Princess, walk slowly.

840
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,280
What title do you want?

841
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,000
Call me...

842
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,080
Queen.

843
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,240
Hurry!

844
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,920
Hurry, Lin Yi!

845
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,200
Or I'll pick an even more embarrassing title.

846
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Your Majesty.

847
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,720
Your Majesty.

848
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,680
Your Majesty.

849
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:27,960
Call that...

850
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,680
What are you talking about?

851
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,240
Call that...

852
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,000
Master.

853
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,600
Master.

854
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,440
Master.

855
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,280
My master.

856
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,920
That's way too embarrassing.

857
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,120
So embarrassing.

858
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,200
Careful.

859
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
Why do I feel like I'm supporting both of you?

860
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm worried you'll both fall.

861
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm speechless.

862
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,720
You finally noticed.

863
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,520
Princess.

864
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,120
Princess Wen'er.

865
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,000
Come on, Princess Wen'er.

866
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,000
Come, Princess.

867
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,320
Hurry!

868
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,920
Please.

869
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,320
I've been giving you signals for ages.

870
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,960
No one picked up on it.

871
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,840
No one made way for me.

872
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,320
Look at what I'm doing.

873
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,960
Seriously.

874
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,120
Darn it.

875
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,680
Someone else sit in the back.

876
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,520
Uncle Nai.

877
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,120
No.

878
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,000
Let someone handsome join.

879
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,480
Come on.

880
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,199
Let the handsome one join.

881
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,840
I'll take this one.

882
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,440
I'll take this one.

883
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,360
Are you satisfied, Princess Jin?

884
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,199
Not bad, right?

885
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,920
A novel's male protagonist comes to life.

886
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,040
Isn't he handsome, Didi?

887
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,080
Who is this?

888
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,520
I'm asking too.

889
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
How can our Xing Xu be so good-looking?

890
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,639
He's honestly the most handsome guy in the world.

891
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,440
I want to eat some ice cream.

892
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,800
You sound just like Patrick Star.

893
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,400
Who?

894
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,400
The one who talks with the tip of his brain.

895
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,440
SpongeBob SquarePants.

896
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,199
You really sound like Patrick Star.

897
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,679
I want to eat some ice cream.

898
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,679
SpongeBob, should we catch jellyfish?

899
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,520
Say something.

900
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,560
SpongeBob SquarePants.

901
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,480
Let's eat ice cream together.

902
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,880
You need to add a Beijing accent.

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,240
Right, SpongeBob is from Beijing.

904
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,440
From Shichahai.

905
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,560
There's Liuzhou snail noodles here.

906
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,920
Snail noodles.

907
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,240
Chinese food in Barcelona these past two years

908
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,720
has really improved in quality.

909
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,000
Yes, I can feel it.

910
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,600
I could tell from breakfast.

911
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,600
This shows how strong China is.

912
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,760
This big clock.

913
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,600
We're here.

914
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
It's too hot. Let's go inside.

915
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,240
Hey, Xing Xu, come here.

916
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,640
The three of us share one sofa.

917
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,320
Squeeze in.

918
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,960
Why squeeze?

919
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,520
I'm not Lin Yi, you know.

920
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,680
Xing Xu showing up

921
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,960
really made some people

922
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,880
feel flustered.

923
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
Huang Minghao is crying now, really crying.

924
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,000
No way to comfort him now.

925
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,920
Alright, everyone.

926
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,280
Gaudí once said,

927
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,200
Only a madman would try to depict

928
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,800
things that don't exist in this world.

929
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,040
Just now, we experienced firsthand

930
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,560
and entered Gaudí's imaginative fantasy world.

931
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,200
Now,

932
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
let's unleash our imagination together

933
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,320
and have

934
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,160
a script scenario imagination challenge.

935
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,880
By completing the task,

936
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,520
you can earn ingredients for dinner.

937
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,960
The game is called "Who's My Acting Partner?"

938
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,040
Among the nine members, there are two undercover players.

939
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,600
Regular players need to

940
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,920
use the scenario they receive

941
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,160
to randomly pick someone

942
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,040
as their acting partner.

943
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,720
They'll perform two lines together.

944
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,040
The undercover players don't know the scenario.

945
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,400
If both undercover players are voted out,

946
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
the regular players win.

947
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,920
Is there writing on the blank card too?

948
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,680
Why is it called a blank card?

949
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,880
It's actually hard for the blank card to win.

950
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
It's really tough.

951
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,160
Because they have no clues at all.

952
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,560
It's best not to go early.

953
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,440
and get picked.

954
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,080
Let's do it.

955
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,160
Give me one with writing, please.

956
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,640
I don't know.

957
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,360
I don't know.

958
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,360
Darn it, Sister Wen looks suspicious.

959
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,160
Blank card sis.

960
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,960
Are you the blank card?

961
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,040
Blank card.

962
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,960
You must be the blank card.

963
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,680
Stop pretending.

964
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,240
You're definitely the blank card.

965
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
You're the blank card.

966
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,760
I'll pick you to act with me.

967
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,360
Alright, you pick me.

968
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,680
Okay, say your lines.

969
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,160
A's line is: Is this enough?

970
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,800
B's is: I don't think it's enough.

971
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,880
Alright, let's draw one.

972
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,360
Let's take the ninth one.

973
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,840
The last one.

974
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,800
The top one.

975
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,440
Okay.

976
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,600
Xing Xu.

977
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,520
It's best not to get picked early.

978
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,080
Come on, blank card bro.

979
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,120
Xing Xu.

980
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,520
Pick another one as your partner.

981
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,680
I want the first one.

982
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,360
Didi, come on.

983
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,520
Two blank cards.

984
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,840
You little blank card, stop talking.

985
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,200
You two are definitely both blank cards.

986
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Do you want A or B?

987
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,920
You choose.

988
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,760
Then I'll take A.

989
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,040
Alright, you take A.

990
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,840
You're A?

991
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,680
You let him be A?

992
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,400
Let him be A.

993
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
Okay, you're A, I'm B.

994
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,320
I heard them say

995
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,120
Let's come up with the lines first.

996
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,880
Let's see how he does.

997
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,680
This is important.

998
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,800
Come on.

999
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,040
What lines?

1000
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,760
Is this enough?

1001
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,280
There's too little useful information.

1002
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,760
Is this enough?

1003
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,200
Is this enough?

1004
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,400
What?

1005
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,680
What?

1006
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
Did you give up?

1007
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,520
What are you acting?

1008
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
You just clapped your hands.

1009
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,720
Gave up.

1010
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,640
Is this enough?

1011
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,560
Is this enough?

1012
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,720
Is this enough?

1013
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
Is this enough?

1014
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,560
Okay.

1015
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,000
Okay.

1016
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,720
Alright, got it.

1017
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,440
Got it.

1018
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,000
Pretty impressive.

1019
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,400
Pretty impressive.

1020
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,080
Pretty impressive.

1021
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,360
I'll pick someone with a fair face.

1022
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,960
Jin Jing.

1023
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,680
Then I'll be A, okay?

1024
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,720
Alright, you be A.

1025
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,280
I'll do it.

1026
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,200
Is this enough?

1027
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:08,680
Not enough.

1028
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,040
Not enough.

1029
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,480
Not enough.

1030
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,560
This isn't enough.

1031
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,280
Alright, that's good.

1032
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,800
No need to act anymore.

1033
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,280
Go back and sit down.

1034
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,720
Go back and sit down.

1035
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,480
No need to act anymore.

1036
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,200
Lin Yi.

1037
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,040
Who do you choose?

1038
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,760
Brother Honglei.

1039
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,920
What's this move?

1040
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,160
Are you acting as A or B?

1041
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,040
You pick.

1042
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,920
I'll be B.

1043
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Then I'll be A.

1044
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,720
What else?

1045
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,440
You be C.

1046
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,720
Come on.

1047
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
What's this move?

1048
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Is this enough?

1049
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,800
Is this enough?

1050
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,320
Is this enough?

1051
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,080
Still not enough.

1052
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,440
Alright.

1053
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,720
Still not enough.

1054
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,400
Is it okay?

1055
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,720
Yes, very good.

1056
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,120
I've cleared my suspicion.

1057
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:00,960
Brother Naiwen.

1058
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,760
What do you think of their acting?

1059
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,280
Brother Naiwen.

1060
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,400
I didn't see that person.

1061
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,480
I didn't see that.

1062
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,200
No need to look at this.

1063
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,280
Why look at it?

1064
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,560
You.

1065
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
They look like they're about to fight.

1066
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,160
Who's A and who's B?

1067
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,720
Either is fine.

1068
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
I can be A too.

1069
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,640
You be A, I'll be B.

1070
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,280
Alright.

1071
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,080
You chose B.

1072
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,640
He plays A.

1073
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,960
Is this enough?

1074
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,080
Is this enough?

1075
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,280
I think it's still not enough.

1076
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,240
It's obvious now.

1077
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,600
I got it.

1078
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:38,920
That's enough.

1079
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,560
That's enough.

1080
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,920
I've cleared my suspicion, right?

1081
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,440
Cleared.

1082
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,800
Cleared.

1083
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,120
Cleared.

1084
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,440
I choose Brother He to act it out again for me.

1085
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,280
I'll be A.

1086
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,120
No problem.

1087
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,960
Not enough, I think it's not enough.

1088
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,240
Not enough, this isn't enough.

1089
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Is this enough?

1090
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,160
Is this enough?

1091
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,280
I think it's not enough.

1092
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,320
Not you.

1093
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,000
Not you.

1094
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
Not you.

1095
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,320
Who else could it be?

1096
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,440
It's still me.

1097
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,880
I want to see Xing Xu and He Ge act it out.

1098
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,520
Okay.

1099
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,160
Go ahead.

1100
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,120
Go ahead.

1101
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,720
Go ahead.

1102
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,720
Add more details.

1103
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,400
Okay.

1104
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,640
What are you doing?

1105
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,680
I'm fine with anything.

1106
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,400
Then can I do A?

1107
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,920
Okay.

1108
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,280
Is this enough?

1109
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,440
Let me tell you.

1110
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,480
You haven't even figured out A and B.

1111
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,000
He just acted as B, right?

1112
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,120
You just acted as B.

1113
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,960
Is this enough?

1114
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,120
I don't think so.

1115
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,880
These two newbies are even doubting each other.

1116
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,680
How is that possible?

1117
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,960
Let me tell you about A.

1118
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,360
A is like this, got it?

1119
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm tired.

1120
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,600
I'm fine.

1121
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,120
This should be enough, right?

1122
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,000
I think...

1123
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,640
Not enough.

1124
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,840
This is a bit hard.

1125
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,760
Now I'm a bit confused.

1126
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,400
Now they don't seem that similar anymore.

1127
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,960
Yeah.

1128
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,080
They acted it out correctly.

1129
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,320
Yeah.

1130
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,040
Yeah.

1131
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,960
Why is it still me?

1132
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,040
Who else could it be?

1133
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,800
I've already made it pretty obvious.

1134
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,480
I already...

1135
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,000
Right?

1136
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,360
Let me ask you, what sport is this?

1137
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
What sport is this?

1138
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,920
If I explain it...

1139
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,720
Directly...

1140
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,600
Wouldn't that give it away?

1141
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,280
Make it more abstract.

1142
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,800
Can you say what sport that is?

1143
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,000
How should I explain it?

1144
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,320
Just explain it.

1145
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
No, I can do this in a second.

1146
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,400
Xing Xu, what do you think?

1147
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,000
Don't push the question to me, bro.

1148
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,080
No, because I was first.

1149
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,720
Now I'm really suspicious of you.

1150
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,480
No need to ask Xing Xu.

1151
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,880
It's already a sure thing.

1152
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,560
Go ahead.

1153
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,640
Why make it difficult?

1154
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,880
Why make it hard for them?

1155
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,520
This moment is too painful.

1156
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,000
The moment I drew the first one...

1157
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,320
I was already done for.

1158
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,240
I think...

1159
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,640
Starting with "I think" isn't right.

1160
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,240
Yeah.

1161
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,920
What sport do you think it is?

1162
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
You also think so.

1163
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,400
And you say it's me.

1164
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,080
What sport is this?

1165
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,520
Window.

1166
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,120
Go ahead, your turn.

1167
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,720
What sport do you think it is?

1168
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,120
I'm just too straightforward.

1169
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,240
Window.

1170
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
It's fine to just say it directly.

1171
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,400
Maybe you'll guess it right.

1172
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,160
How should I put this?

1173
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,840
Computer.

1174
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
It really is.

1175
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
It really is.

1176
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,040
So where did it happen?

1177
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,600
E-sports.

1178
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,200
It really is.

1179
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,480
Kind of.

1180
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,400
A bit on the edge.

1181
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,280
Xing Xu, I'll give you another chance.

1182
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,240
So you think it's...

1183
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,120
There must be electricity, right?

1184
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,600
That's important.

1185
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,560
It's e-sports.

1186
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,360
It won't work without electricity.

1187
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,160
Come on, cast your vote.

1188
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,680
First is Xing Xu.

1189
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,440
Alright, let's go.

1190
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
Three, two, one, please vote.

1191
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,200
Xing Xu.

1192
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,800
Alright, congratulations everyone.

1193
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,160
We've found the first blank slate.

1194
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,920
He's unlucky, the first one.

1195
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,040
This is so hard for me.

1196
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,600
This is so hard for me.

1197
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,200
This is too difficult.

1198
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,800
I guessed they were dancing.

1199
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,960
There's a dance element, right?

1200
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:35,960
Very close.

1201
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,760
And maybe an elder.

1202
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That's actually true.

1203
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,400
It's an old person.

1204
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,200
Asking a young person how to use WeChat.

1205
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,280
Now let's guess the next one.

1206
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
What about He Ge?

1207
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,400
I might suspect him.

1208
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,160
You suspect him?

1209
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,760
You suspect Lin Yi?

1210
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,640
Then I suspect Lin Yi too.

1211
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,880
Let's all suspect Lin Yi then.

1212
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,400
I think Lin Yi is definitely suspicious.

1213
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,760
Yeah.

1214
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,400
I think so too.

1215
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,240
Come on, vote.

1216
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,520
Three, two, one, please vote.

1217
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,440
Chen He.

1218
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,600
Chen He.

1219
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,720
Congratulations, we've found the second blank slate.

1220
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,720
Bro, it's really too hard.

1221
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,280
So what was the emotion just now?

1222
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,440
It was the cafeteria lady serving food.

1223
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,600
Her hand was shaking.

1224
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,600
Just shaking hands.

1225
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,080
How do I put this... computer.

1226
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,040
E-sports.

1227
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
I don't think that's enough.

1228
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,320
No need to look, why bother?

1229
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,800
It's painful, right?

1230
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,080
It's too hard.

1231
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,000
The blank slate is actually a bit pitiful.

1232
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,960
Really.

1233
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,880
I'm so afraid it'll be my turn.

1234
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,200
I'm really scared I'll be the blank slate.

1235
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,360
Me too.

1236
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Please, no more.

1237
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,760
Please.

1238
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,480
Please.

1239
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
No one expects much from me.

1240
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,080
But I'm actually the funniest.

1241
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,000
Or let the two blank slates recognize each other, okay?

1242
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,960
No, we've already recognized each other.

1243
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,520
We knew long ago.

1244
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,880
We already knew.

1245
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,480
I knew it was him too.

1246
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:57,880
But it doesn't help.

1247
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,640
We have no clues at all.

1248
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,280
Okay.

1249
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,200
Let's do another round.

1250
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,720
Let's do another round.

1251
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,200
Come on, let's go, guys.

1252
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,320
Heavenly spirits, earthly spirits.

1253
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Let the heavens show their power.

1254
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,680
Please, don't let it be me.

1255
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,680
I really can't handle it.

1256
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,320
My nerves are really weak.

1257
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,200
Let me tell you the lines.

1258
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,160
Line A is: "Why don't we split up quickly?"

1259
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,040
Line B is: "Does one minute really matter?"

1260
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,880
I think this round,

1261
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,320
we should ask more questions.

1262
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,280
No need to ask more.

1263
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,240
Honestly, you really don't need to ask.

1264
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,400
It's too obvious.

1265
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
You answer first.

1266
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,480
Do you think it's indoors or outdoors?

1267
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,360
Outdoors.

1268
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,120
Are we picking a whiteboard now?

1269
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,000
Actually, about being in the pool,

1270
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,440
If you ask again, the game will be over.

1271
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,840
Come on, pick a number.

1272
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,160
I'll pick six.

1273
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,400
Chen Xingxu.

1274
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,040
Lin Yi.

1275
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,400
Lin Yi.

1276
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,800
Xingxu.

1277
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,840
This person is really annoying, seriously.

1278
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,920
I really can't stand this person.

1279
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,560
Then you be A, I'll be B.

1280
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,320
Otherwise, let's just split up quickly.

1281
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,360
Got it.

1282
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,600
Does this minute really matter to you?

1283
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,200
Okay.

1284
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,680
No problem at all.

1285
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,440
No problem.

1286
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,000
No problem.

1287
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,920
Friends from outside

1288
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,560
Friends from outside

1289
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,320
Friends from outside

1290
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,680
No wonder she said that as soon as she came back

1291
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,160
Maybe we should ask more questions this round

1292
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,080
Are you doing part A or part B?

1293
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,640
Either is fine

1294
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,240
Then pick one

1295
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,520
You decide

1296
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,240
Choose

1297
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,600
Let's go with A

1298
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,400
Part A

1299
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,240
Should we split now?

1300
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,000
That was like not acting at all

1301
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,640
Stage play

1302
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,000
Does one minute really matter?

1303
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:27,840
Okay

1304
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,360
Okay

1305
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,320
Maybe we should split quickly

1306
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,800
Wait a second

1307
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,560
You just need one more minute?

1308
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,040
Are you sure about this?

1309
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,800
Brother Naiwen, this one

1310
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,920
She acted like she was checking her watch

1311
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,840
You didn't act at all

1312
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,680
I did act

1313
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,280
I swallowed my saliva

1314
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,560
Very subtle

1315
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,080
Very subtle

1316
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,680
Too subtle

1317
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,280
That's impressive

1318
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,880
Stop going along with it

1319
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,920
It's no use, Jin Jing

1320
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,680
Stop going along with it

1321
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,280
Jin Jing glared at Yu Ning, gritting her teeth

1322
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,640
Brother Honglei, pick someone

1323
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,760
I choose Xing Xu

1324
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,120
Go

1325
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,280
You picked me, right?

1326
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,640
Come on, bro

1327
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,920
Are you doing A or...

1328
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,440
I'll do A

1329
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,080
A is fine

1330
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,520
You do B

1331
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:21,920
I'll do B

1332
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Should we split now?

1333
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,000
What?

1334
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,400
Should we split now?

1335
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,680
Bro, can you...

1336
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,800
I didn't see it, sorry

1337
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,880
Should we split now?

1338
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,440
Do it again, bro

1339
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:39,560
No need

1340
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,320
He doesn't need to do it again

1341
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,440
His action hasn't changed

1342
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:41,800
Right

1343
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,960
Should we split now?

1344
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,600
Yeah, I felt that

1345
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,120
I felt it

1346
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,240
I felt this one

1347
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,520
You felt it?

1348
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,360
Really

1349
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:50,520
Really

1350
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,600
I get this

1351
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,360
I really get this

1352
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,120
I really get it

1353
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,720
This is...

1354
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,280
I don't feel it

1355
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,520
I can't say anymore

1356
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,760
Can we switch and act it out again?

1357
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,520
Sure, let's do it

1358
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,080
I'll do A

1359
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,480
Should we split now?

1360
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,360
I want to be precise

1361
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,240
Or else it'll be exposed

1362
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,520
Or else it'll be exposed

1363
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,160
It's already exposed

1364
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,680
Or else it'll be exposed

1365
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,520
Does one minute really matter?

1366
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,320
Does one minute really matter?

1367
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,360
The story of Yu Gong moving mountains

1368
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,440
How about I act with Brother Honglei

1369
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,160
Alright

1370
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:31,560
Okay

1371
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
Let's do one together

1372
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,240
You want to pass

1373
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,720
It's hard to prove yourself through him

1374
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,640
We have to do our best

1375
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,400
Stay steady, bro

1376
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,080
We have to do our best

1377
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,960
Stay steady

1378
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:42,880
Right

1379
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,920
Should we split now?

1380
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,840
Does one minute really matter?

1381
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,240
Come on.

1382
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,920
Is it really just one minute left?

1383
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,760
A minute?

1384
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,000
That's accurate.

1385
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,560
That's awesome.

1386
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,680
This is really something.

1387
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,120
It really works.

1388
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,320
So impressive.

1389
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,560
You guessed it.

1390
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,840
So precise.

1391
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,480
You even sensed that.

1392
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,040
Just now,

1393
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,400
You figured out my moves.

1394
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,680
Stop messing with me, okay?

1395
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,480
That's spot on.

1396
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,080
You even guessed this.

1397
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,480
Right?

1398
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,520
I'm pretty smart.

1399
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,440
I guessed it a long time ago.

1400
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,080
Come on, Didi's not here.

1401
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,560
Didi and Yun Ning haven't started yet.

1402
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,920
Yeah, let's go.

1403
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,160
Here we go.

1404
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,720
I'm A.

1405
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,800
Maybe we should split up now.

1406
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,280
Maybe we should split up now.

1407
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,520
Is it just one minute left?

1408
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,880
Okay, sure.

1409
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,720
She's fine.

1410
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,000
Can anyone feel it?

1411
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,800
Everyone can feel it.

1412
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,760
I feel it.

1413
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,360
I feel it.

1414
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:47,960
That's true.

1415
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,320
I thought about it and realized.

1416
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah, we're doing just fine.

1417
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,160
I think we should ask some questions.

1418
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:54,600
Okay.

1419
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,520
What do you think, Jing?

1420
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,160
I really admire you.

1421
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm already done for.

1422
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,880
You're still holding on.

1423
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,480
Don't you get what's going on with us?

1424
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,800
Let's not vote for Jin Jing.

1425
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,560
Let's protect her, okay?

1426
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,080
Thank you, everyone.

1427
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,000
Let her win this time.

1428
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,880
We'll vote for the other one.

1429
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,840
Three, two, one.

1430
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,360
It's too hard for them.

1431
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,800
Can maids talk like this too?

1432
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,000
My lord.

1433
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,320
Should we split up now?

1434
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,600
I'll separate by gender too.

1435
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
But how did you guess mine?

1436
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,280
Because of you.

1437
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,080
Because of this.

1438
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,920
It has nothing to do with maids.

1439
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,400
I didn't guess at all.

1440
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,720
All I could think was to keep smiling.

1441
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,240
Keep smiling.

1442
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:42,800
Keep smiling.

1443
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,720
Keep an awkward smile.

1444
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,040
Thanks for your hard work, sis.

1445
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,560
All I could think was

1446
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,080
Don't be too awkward.

1447
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,640
Don't make it too obvious.

1448
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,960
Sister Wang is coming back today.

1449
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,400
Let's get ready for the family dinner.

1450
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,360
Everyone can start preparing.

1451
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,720
Does Yun Ning need us to do anything?

1452
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,560
No.

1453
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,480
Nothing needs to be done.

1454
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,080
Yu Wen didn't get to have the lamb soup yesterday.

1455
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,800
Let's make lamb soup, and they'll stir-fry eggplant.

1456
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,880
Make some braised pork.

1457
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,120
After draining the blood, fry it a bit, right?

1458
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,200
Yeah, make sure to fry it.

1459
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:22,880
Be careful.

1460
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,160
Get up.

1461
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,760
Why can I already smell the lamb?

1462
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,560
Smells like goat milk.

1463
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,240
Let me know if you need anything.

1464
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,160
I'll pass it on to Lin Yi.

1465
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,360
Pass it on to Lin Yi.

1466
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,480
Do you think Lin Yi is deaf or something?

1467
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,480
Look, Lin Yi is pretty good at working.

1468
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,360
What you're doing is

1469
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,560
Cut half the garlic, drop half the garlic.

1470
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,360
Smash it.

1471
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:04,920
Cut it myself today.

1472
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,040
It's like a wall.

1473
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,480
Made it harder for myself today.

1474
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,960
It used to be a blanket.

1475
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,680
Now it's become a bed.

1476
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,760
Isn't it?

1477
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,720
Needs this much oil, right?

1478
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,840
Hurry, bro.

1479
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,920
It is fast.

1480
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,080
I can't keep up.

1481
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,840
With so many kids, it's really hard to manage.

1482
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,360
Let me tell you.

1483
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,880
The fastest way is to fry with chopsticks.

1484
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,920
Use chopsticks.

1485
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,560
The chopsticks are too short.

1486
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,400
I'm afraid it'll splash on me.

1487
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,520
Protect myself.

1488
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,040
Here, let me do it.

1489
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,080
You can go.

1490
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,600
You can go.

1491
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,080
It's this bowl of eggplant.

1492
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,480
I'm really surprised.

1493
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,080
Cut by the "Duke".

1494
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,840
Do you see any that look similar?

1495
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,280
This is exactly what we want.

1496
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,080
Is this a cartoon?

1497
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,920
Is this Gaudi's design today?

1498
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,440
Yes.

1499
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,560
After assembling different shapes into a plate of eggplant,

1500
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,840
it has a unique beauty.

1501
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,480
Can you find one that's similar?

1502
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,720
Right, no right angles.

1503
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,160
There's no perfectly right-angled eggplant.

1504
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:02,720
Very good.

1505
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,960
Making eggplant with eggs and pork.

1506
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,480
Want me to wipe your sweat?

1507
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,680
No need.

1508
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,120
No need.

1509
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,200
Isn't this how you do surgery?

1510
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,880
Me here...

1511
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,480
I'm flattered.

1512
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,160
No need.

1513
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,320
Wipe your sweat, come on.

1514
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,720
Okay.

1515
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,480
Does he even have sweat?

1516
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,400
This is the Tianjin style braised eggplant.

1517
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,080
This look,

1518
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,480
is good.

1519
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,040
Good.

1520
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,400
Good.

1521
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,840
Pork belly for braised pork.

1522
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,320
Brother He looks so professional.

1523
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,240
He really cooks at home all the time.

1524
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,240
You can tell he knows how to cook.

1525
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,560
He really knows how to live.

1526
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,640
What is this? Just pour it all in?

1527
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,880
So much.

1528
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,400
I think my mom does it this way too.

1529
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,240
No water added.

1530
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,120
Fry.

1531
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,160
Peel the eggs, come on.

1532
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,360
This dish is

1533
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,880
the most controversial one.

1534
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,320
Braised pork, forty minutes.

1535
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,680
Come on, I'll grill the skewers.

1536
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,680
Okay.

1537
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,240
The fire's good.

1538
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,160
Smells so good, my friend.

1539
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,360
So fragrant.

1540
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,480
So fragrant.

1541
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,640
How's the heat? Is it good?

1542
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,360
This is really

1543
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,640
really good.

1544
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,840
This definitely makes you hungry.

1545
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,480
Come on, some chefs are hungry.

1546
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,120
Who's hungry? Want a skewer?

1547
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,040
This has no chili, no cumin.

1548
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:04,640
Oh my bro.

1549
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,920
Bro grilling for us is awesome.

1550
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,960
Awesome, thanks bro.

1551
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,240
Nice.

1552
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,440
Let's keep grilling.

1553
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,160
Great.

1554
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,000
Really awesome, bro.

1555
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,480
Got praised.

1556
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,560
Instantly got excited.

1557
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,520
Overjoyed.

1558
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,080
Overjoyed.

1559
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,600
Keep working.

1560
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,040
Smells amazing.

1561
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,280
Awesome.

1562
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,120
Give it to them.

1563
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,440
Director, come here.

1564
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,040
No.

1565
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,040
Take it to them to eat first.

1566
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,760
They have it.

1567
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,760
Try it, come on.

1568
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,440
Super fragrant.

1569
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,400
Mushrooms need oil, Didi.

1570
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,280
Okay, Sister Wen.

1571
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,560
Look at Sister Wang.

1572
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,680
The oil with this chili powder.

1573
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,080
Looks like blush.

1574
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,000
I use this as a base.

1575
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,640
This is the highlight.

1576
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,880
The cumin is the highlight.

1577
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,240
Set it with powder at the end.

1578
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,080
Right.

1579
00:58:59,440 --> 00:58:59,960
Delicious.

1580
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,680
Okay.

1581
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,080
Pack up.

1582
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,600
Sister Wang's barbecue was a big success.

1583
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,040
The boss is going for a late-night snack.

1584
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,720
Smells so good.

1585
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,680
Main dish, lamb soup first.

1586
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:12,920
Okay.

1587
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,680
Thank you.

1588
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,640
Alright.

1589
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,760
Amazing.

1590
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,560
Thanks, bro.

1591
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,880
Bless me with a bowl of lamb soup.

1592
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,520
You know what?

1593
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,440
In my shot,

1594
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,400
You really look like our cafeteria chef.

1595
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,120
Auntie's hand shakes.

1596
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,000
Auntie's hand shakes.

1597
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,600
Is it enough, kid? Is it enough?

1598
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,560
Look, this chef is handsome.

1599
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,320
I don't think so.

1600
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Today's table

1601
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,880
This meal is because you cooked.

1602
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,320
So sit inside, be good.

1603
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,040
Okay.

1604
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,280
Super tasty.

1605
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,640
How does it taste?

1606
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,080
I think it's better

1607
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,760
Better than yesterday's.

1608
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,440
Really good.

1609
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,240
Overall review.

1610
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,200
Really nice.

1611
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,960
If you want meat, scoop it up.

1612
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,560
Scoop it into your plate.

1613
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,480
It's full of meat inside.

1614
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,360
Bro, hurry.

1615
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,000
Eat quickly, bro.

1616
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,120
I already

1617
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,240
I'm already getting a second bowl.

1618
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,320
It's really delicious.

1619
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:12,920
Really.

1620
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,880
Unbeatable.

1621
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,240
Unbeatable.

1622
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,200
Seriously.

1623
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,120
You know,

1624
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,560
This guy,

1625
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,200
Right?

1626
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,880
He's handsome and can cook.

1627
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,360
Seriously.

1628
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,320
How are we supposed to live?

1629
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,080
Seriously.

1630
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,560
He can even sing.

1631
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,240
So talented.

1632
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,320
Great at acting too.

1633
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,680
Great at acting.

1634
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,960
Liu Yuning is truly beyond words.

1635
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,440
His charm is irresistible.

1636
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,000
Really.

1637
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,200
Praised too soon.

1638
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,160
Yuning, Yuning.

1639
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,200
Can't do without you.

1640
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,840
Alright.

1641
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:38,880
Alright.

1642
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,000
Thank you.

1643
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,160
Here it comes.

1644
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,840
Absolutely stunning.

1645
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,400
Rice lovers, dig in!

1646
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,680
Let me take a photo.

1647
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,000
Take a photo.

1648
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,640
Must eat it with rice.

1649
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,280
This is amazing.

1650
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,800
Once it cools, it's ruined.

1651
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,720
A touch of green onion finishes it.

1652
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,640
Nice.

1653
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:03,760
Sweet and sour.

1654
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,080
Smells incredible.

1655
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,480
This is really something.

1656
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,880
Let’s have some of these quail eggs.

1657
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,920
These eggs are amazing.

1658
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,120
Did you peel them?

1659
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,360
Try the quail eggs I peeled with my mouth.

1660
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,960
I sucked them out.

1661
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,960
This braised pork has no water added.

1662
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,480
It’s especially delicious.

1663
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,480
Tasty.

1664
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,840
It’s unbeatable with some rice.

1665
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,600
Right.

1666
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,240
The aroma is overwhelming.

1667
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,440
Is the braised pork good?

1668
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,480
It’s good.

1669
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,080
It’s really good.

1670
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,560
Let’s each have a bowl of rice.

1671
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,440
Awesome.

1672
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,440
Look at this.

1673
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:44,880
Awesome.

1674
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,360
Awesome.

1675
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,400
We ate so much we’re all in a food coma.

1676
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
Two master chefs.

1677
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,280
No.

1678
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,080
Yu Ning and He.

1679
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,480
You guys suggest.

1680
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,560
After we finished cooking,

1681
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,760
we just watched everyone eat.

1682
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,120
Happy.

1683
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,800
Eat well, drink well.

1684
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,560
Welcome, Yu Wen.

1685
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,280
Sure.

1686
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,040
Welcome back.

1687
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,440
Love you all.

1688
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,280
Love you all.

1689
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,920
Eat well, drink well.

1690
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,160
Chen He.

1691
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,280
You’re impossible.

1692
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,680
Chen He, Chen He.

1693
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,440
You’re impossible.

1694
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,440
Rhyme?

1695
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,200
It rhymes.

1696
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:21,960
It’s all “e”.

1697
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,880
Yu Ning, Yu Ning.

1698
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,440
Can’t do it without you.

1699
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,280
Where’s “Duke”, “Duke”?

1700
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,360
“Duke”, “Duke”.

1701
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,840
You’re truly amazing.

1702
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:33,720
Now, really,

1703
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,960
it’s feeling more and more like home.

1704
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,320
Yeah.

1705
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,920
Next, let’s play Cantonese song guessing.

1706
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,840
So, two team captains.

1707
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,160
One captain is Lin Yi.

1708
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,680
Nai Wen.

1709
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,160
Aren’t you happy?

1710
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,480
Trust me.

1711
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,280
I listen to Cantonese songs every night to sleep.

1712
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,360
He’s talking about “Ride the Wind and Waves”.

1713
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,880
Let me translate.

1714
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:04,960
Mushroom.

1715
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,840
People from Liaoning speaking Cantonese sounds the same.

1716
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,040
Everyone, get ready to go out.

1717
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,160
Park Güell.

1718
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,320
Alright, it’s unbeatable.

1719
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
There’s always one that suits you.

1720
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,480
What is this?

1721
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,000
What did you shoot? Not everyone’s in it.

1722
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,960
You want everyone in the shot?

1723
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,880
Let’s go.

1724
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:21,960
Ning.

1725
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,240
Want to see prehistoric civilization under the sea.

1726
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,800
Let’s end this farce.

1727
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,480
Let’s choreograph a group dance to our theme song.

1728
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,240
Or the two of us can just go wild.

1729
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,920
This is the dance from my concert.

1730
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,040
I’m already using it here for you.

1731
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:38,760
Right?

1732
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:39,960
Come on.

1733
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,360
Get ready to go in.

1734
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,280
Pose, ending pose.

1735
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,400
Who’s my scene partner?

1736
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:51,720
Come on.

1737
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,040
It’s so itchy.

1738
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,000
This is so hard.

1739
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,640
Are you the undercover?

1740
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,800
Lin Yi, what are you doing?

1741
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,600
You seem to be in pain.

1742
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,800
How are you?

1743
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,200
I’m good.

1744
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,320
I think you look really fair.

1745
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,400
Even sunglasses can’t hide how fair you are.

1746
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,040
Stop hitting.

1747
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,000
Stop hitting.

1748
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,800
Stop hitting.

1749
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,360
This proves innocence right away.

1750
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,520
Stop hitting.

1751
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,680
Stop hitting.

1752
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,600
Awesome, I’m super good at this.

1753
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,120
It’s different once you get a role.

1754
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,640
Ning Ge is really quiet this round.

1755
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,760
Male or female?

1756
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,400
I’m playing a male character.

1757
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,320
So hard to guess.

1758
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,200
Three, two, one, please vote.
