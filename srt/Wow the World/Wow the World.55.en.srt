1
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,080
Time to eat.

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,240
Great!

3
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm coming.

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,680
Try this, it's delicious.

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,240
Really.

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,640
Foie gras, fries, high in calories.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,520
How could it not taste good?

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,480
Look, everyone—

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,160
No one's talking now.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,800
That means it's tasty.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
This foie gras is amazing.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,120
Foie gras.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,880
This foie gras is really good, yeah.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,840
The egg on top is kind of like—

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
It's a bit like a soft-boiled egg.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,120
This roasted eggplant is good too.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,760
Roasted eggplant is nice.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
It's pretty natural.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
It's a very organic dish.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,440
So what's the connection between this restaurant and F1?

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,040
Yeah, it's about racing.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,000
Are they race car drivers?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
Since you asked,

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,720
let's briefly

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,800
introduce this restaurant.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,040
This restaurant is called El Trabuc.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,560
Because it's close to the F1 racetrack,

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,760
relatively nearby.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,920
So this place has become

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,480
the spot where F1 drivers and motorcycle racers

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,640
gather most often.

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
All over the walls

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,760
are famous drivers

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,120
posing with the owner.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,120
Is that an F1 car?

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,920
Is it a movie?

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,760
It's a race.

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,280
I watch the races.

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,400
I just started watching recently.

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,800
That movie is really good.

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
You finished watching it?

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
Yeah, it's awesome.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,400
I watched it before I got on the plane.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,480
Let's play that game—

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,280
"Kiss the Shark."

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,680
Everyone can eat while

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
I explain the game rules.

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,680
Basically,

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,759
it's just Lin Yi and Jin Jing,

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,520
just listen.

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,040
Okay.

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
Everyone puts on headphones.

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
The first person uses the melody they hear

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
to sing the lyrics they see to the second person.

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,120
The last person

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,240
guesses what song the first person

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
was listening to.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Do we eat first or play while eating?

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,280
Let's eat first.

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,160
Eat and play.

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,160
Whoever eats the least loses.

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,880
Brother, I'll declare you the winner first.

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,560
No, let's change the order.

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,040
I can't be the last one.

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
You can do it.

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,960
Because Xing Xu is in the musical theater class,

67
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
this won't be hard for him.

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,360
Are you sure, brother?

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,840
Who knows what songs they'll pick today?

70
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,800
What if I haven't heard it before?

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,320
Xing Xu will be fine.

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,840
Lead singer from Les Misérables.

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
The song "Stars."

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Alright, I'll go first.

75
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,080
Okay.

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,240
Let's go in this order then.

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,200
Right.

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Alright.

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,640
Go ahead.

80
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,200
Let's do it.

81
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,400
Otherwise,

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
Let's play casually while we eat.

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,520
Yeah.

84
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
Xingxu, you know a lot of songs.

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,960
Not necessarily.

86
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,720
I'm not sure.

87
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm not sure.

88
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,960
Honestly, I'm not sure.

89
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
My song list isn't that big.

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,600
Who here knows the most songs?

91
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,240
Gong Jun.

92
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Brother Ning.

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
Wang Yuwen.

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
From here to there.

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,640
It doesn't matter how many songs you know anymore.

96
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,800
It doesn't matter if your song list is big or not.

97
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Xingxu is from the musical theater class.

98
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,480
We'll take care of it.

99
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,120
Alright.

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,600
Okay.

101
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go.

102
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Let's keep it relaxed.

103
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
Just one round.

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,640
You've definitely heard this song.

105
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:43,960
Okay.

106
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,240
Wait a second.

107
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
It's not that part yet.

108
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,840
Cross the bridge.

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,320
Cross the bridge.

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,120
Alright, coming up.

111
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
That's a long bridge.

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Alright, here we go.

113
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
Okay.

114
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
I got it.

115
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,279
Sadly, it's not you.

116
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,720
Together.

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,720
Alright.

118
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
You've definitely heard this one.

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,120
Wait a second.

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Lend me, lend me.

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
Lend me, lend me.

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
Why say goodbye?

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,680
I know it.

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
Lend me, lend me.

125
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,280
So it was you.

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,000
Darn it.

127
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,440
Very familiar.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,320
This...

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
No, don't do the rest.

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,240
Just sing a little bit, that's enough.

131
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,560
That's fine.

132
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,840
That's fine.

133
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,880
Are you sure?

134
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,000
This one's already obvious.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,760
It's really obvious.

136
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,080
Yeah.

137
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,120
So, am I supposed to copy it?

138
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,680
No, wait.

139
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,760
Like this.

140
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,000
Jin Jing, like this.

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,080
I'll record a voice message for you.

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,320
Then you might not know

143
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,960
what you're singing yourself.

144
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
Then sing it again for Brother He.

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,320
Okay.

146
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll record one for you.

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,000
Record my own voice.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,880
Yeah, I'll record your own voice.

149
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,800
See if you can recognize it yourself.

150
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Alright.

151
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,520
Go ahead.

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,400
I don't want to listen.

153
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,080
I don't want to listen.

154
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm begging you.

155
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm begging you.

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm begging you.

157
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
Don't do this to me.

158
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm begging you.

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,200
I'll send it to the group.

160
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,760
I'll copy it.

161
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,760
Lend me a pair of wise eyes.

162
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,560
Lend me a pair.

163
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,760
Let me escape the chaos.

164
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
See things clearly.

165
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,200
Brother.

166
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm definitely copying it.

167
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah.

168
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,640
Alright then.

169
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,080
But I think Jin Jing was ahead.

170
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,960
I'll accept any challenge.

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
The other side is pretty ruthless.

172
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,120
Here it comes.

173
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,160
It's pretty much the same.

174
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,880
Actually, yes.

175
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Where is it?

176
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm afraid time will pass too quickly.

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,480
One.

178
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,720
Brother He sang for nothing this round.

179
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,440
It might interfere.

180
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,480
Do we still need it?

181
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,040
Do it again.

182
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,400
This is too hard.

183
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,920
Last time.

184
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,600
This is too hard.

185
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,920
I am.

186
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,480
Did Jin Jing create this herself?

187
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,160
Brother, I can't hear you.

188
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't believe it's you.

189
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,040
Brother, I can't hear you.

190
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,120
Then do it again.

191
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,800
I can definitely do it.

192
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Ninety-five percent restored.

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Yes.

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
I copied it, right?

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,920
Copied, yes.

196
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,680
The melody is basically right too.

197
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,240
I just believe.

198
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,160
Brother Naiwen can tell.

199
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
You're overthinking it.

200
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,720
Brother Naiwen can tell.

201
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Right, Yu Ning?

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
The beginning is important.

203
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,120
The rest is just random singing.

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
The beginning is important.

205
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
I really sang it like this.

206
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,600
The first three notes are important.

207
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
His first three notes are correct.

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,800
The night is so beautiful, even though...

209
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
Brother, you've definitely heard this song.

210
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,480
I got these lyrics, right?

211
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes.

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,720
Are you ready?

213
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,160
This is basically messed up.

214
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,679
I think it got messed up at Jin Jing's part.

215
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
But Yu Ning just approved it.

216
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,679
I'll give it to you now.

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,440
Is that okay?

218
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,360
Are you that confident?

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,480
Here it comes.

220
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
That's not right, is it?

221
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,240
Almost.

222
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Almost.

223
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,520
That's exactly how you sang it just now.

224
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Exactly the same.

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,280
Yes, it's basically identical.

226
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,280
Do you want to do it again?

227
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,760
No need.

228
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,680
Before I forget.

229
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,200
No need.

230
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,560
Just listen to the first three notes.

231
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
The rest doesn't matter.

232
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,680
If you...

233
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
If you...

234
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Right? Just three notes.

235
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,440
If you...

236
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,400
He seems to have hummed it already.

237
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,040
Stay with me till the end.

238
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,440
What song is this? Let me think.

239
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Sadly, it's not you.

240
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Stay with me till the end.

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,920
That's awesome.

242
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,800
That's tough.

243
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,440
Pass it down.

244
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,160
Amazing.

245
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,440
You're amazing.

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,920
We're from the same property management company.

247
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,440
If you're willing.

248
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,520
It's all your fault.

249
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,360
With you...

250
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,440
You know what song it is now, right?

251
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,560
Awesome.

252
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,280
Brother Naiwen, this one...

253
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
This is really great.

254
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
You're awesome, Brother Naiwen.

255
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
You saved my life.

256
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
You saved my life.

257
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,920
Saved my life.

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,560
Come on.

259
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,840
Didi, you've definitely heard this one.

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes.

261
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,720
Okay.

262
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,280
You've definitely heard this one.

263
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
Focus on the beginning.

264
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,800
A long, long time ago...

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
Sadly, it's not you.

266
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,120
A long, long time ago...

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,400
Just get the number of words right.

268
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,320
It doesn't have to be that smooth.

269
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,080
Yes, that's it.

270
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,400
Just sing five words at a time.

271
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,160
Stay with me till the end.

272
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,680
Okay, that's enough.

273
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,800
Sadly, it's not you.

274
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,520
Stay with me till the end.

275
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,000
Right.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
That's enough for him to guess.

277
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,920
He can do it.

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,280
He can do it.

279
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,520
He can do it.

280
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,840
Go for it!

281
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,680
Alright, Xingxu.

282
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,160
Come on.

283
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,000
All the beauty only...

284
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,800
Just sing up to "only."

285
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,120
...was yesterday's intoxication.

286
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,160
...was yesterday's intoxication.

287
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,480
A hint of bitterness is today's flavor.

288
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,880
That's awesome.

289
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
This matches perfectly.

290
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,280
Unity.

291
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,160
So beautiful.

292
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,240
It's really so beautiful.

293
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
This round fit so well.

294
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
Brother Naiwen did a great job.

295
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,160
Impressive.

296
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,880
Seriously, Brother Naiwen, you're amazing.

297
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Turned the tide.

298
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
Turned the tide.

299
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,280
Fantastic.

300
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,280
Musical genius.

301
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
Feeling better right away.

302
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Everything.

303
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,880
The first line is crucial.

304
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,680
Faint.

305
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,400
Darn it, wait a second.

306
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,880
Why do I feel like I sang it wrong?

307
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,640
Right.

308
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,360
That's right.

309
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,160
That's enough.

310
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,480
One line is enough.

311
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,840
That intersection.

312
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,480
Right.

313
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,640
Isn't it?

314
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,880
"Sadly, It's Not You"

315
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,760
Awesome.

316
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,760
Awesome.

317
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,920
Awesome.

318
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,880
Brother Naiwen was actually the best this round.

319
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,480
Naiwen Li.

320
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,480
What happened?

321
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm really curious.

322
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,240
Couldn't hear it, such a pity.

323
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,560
Up front.

324
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
There was something ahead.

325
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,360
I almost fell off the cliff right away.

326
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
Then I got here from the side.

327
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
I pulled it back up.

328
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,120
How did you figure that out?

329
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,200
Brother Honglei.

330
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
Those first three notes you did,

331
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,720
you repeated them perfectly.

332
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:55,960
Right.

333
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
So he got it instantly.

334
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,480
Yes.

335
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,920
Actually, there was nothing wrong.

336
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
But the second line...

337
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,800
Even the latter half of the first line was already a bit...

338
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Because in this industry,

339
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,080
this kind of melody is rare.

340
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,320
It's really rare.

341
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
There aren't melodies with such a wide range.

342
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
Right, so it's easy to spot.

343
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Really great.

344
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm relieved.

345
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,360
How about we switch?

346
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,960
Let's switch.

347
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,280
Sure.

348
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,960
I don't think that's okay.

349
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,920
It's fine.

350
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,840
I think I'll do better if I listen.

351
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
It'll be better if I sing while listening.

352
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Okay.

353
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,840
Come on, Brother Naiwen, Brother He.

354
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,520
Are we switching or what?

355
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,440
I'm good with anything.

356
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I can never guess the song title.

357
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,560
I can't be last.

358
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,040
Yeah.

359
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,160
I don't know the song title either.

360
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,320
I think Xingxu, you did really well.

361
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,760
You're good, Brother Xu.

362
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,080
It's fine, no problem.

363
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,040
Let's do it this way.

364
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,080
Or maybe Didi and Brother He can switch.

365
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
No.

366
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,560
Listen to Brother Ning's.

367
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,360
He'll teach you.

368
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,080
Didi, go ahead.

369
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,040
Brother Ning will teach you.

370
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,840
Great working together.

371
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,320
Hello.

372
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,040
Hello.

373
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,320
Hello.

374
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,320
Hello.

375
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Sure, sure.

376
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
Alright, let's go.

377
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,080
Awesome.

378
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,840
Music.

379
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,320
Darn it.

380
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,200
This one.

381
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,440
That's fine.

382
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,200
You got this, Brother.

383
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,440
It's that easy?

384
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,800
Brother Naiwen.

385
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,680
It has to be Brother Naiwen.

386
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,200
Naiwen Li.

387
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,840
Wow, that's impressive.

388
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
You figured it out in two lines.

389
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,560
"Jacky Li."

390
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,360
"Jacky Li."

391
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,480
"Li Ming."

392
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,440
"Li Fucheng."

393
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,080
"Andy Li."

394
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,880
It's actually "Hacken Li."

395
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,280
Got it, right?

396
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,960
"Hacken Li."

397
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,200
"Andy Li."

398
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
Being a person,

399
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,000
should cooperate with you.

400
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,080
I should play along with your act.

401
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,600
Pretend not to see.

402
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
Forcing the one who loves you most.

403
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,560
Improv performance.

404
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,680
When?

405
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,800
When did we start lowering our standards?

406
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,280
Is it this song?

407
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
Yes.

408
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,720
Is it this song?

409
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,240
Yes.

410
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,600
Yes.

411
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,920
It's true, don't doubt it.

412
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,480
You asked first, right?

413
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,360
Okay.

414
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
Did I sing it right?

415
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,320
That's right.

416
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,360
What am I doing?

417
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,920
Brother, you're amazing and so cool.

418
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,960
Brother, how are you so great?

419
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,320
Glorious image.

420
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
You look tall even without standing up.

421
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Virtuous and talented.

422
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,080
We juniors really learned a lot from you.

423
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,760
Really.

424
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,320
Sometimes I look at myself, then at you.

425
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
I feel ashamed.

426
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,960
That's right.

427
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,440
If I'm interviewed in the future,

428
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,560
about what I learned from this show,

429
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
I'll definitely say I

430
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,960
learned

431
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,440
how to be a better person.

432
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
how to be a better person.

433
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,400
Teacher Li Naiwen.

434
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,600
It's really helpful.

435
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm looking forward to it.

436
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,200
That's great.

437
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,680
That's fine.

438
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
We have to win, right?

439
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,079
He said,

440
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,160
We're supposed to win, right?

441
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,560
Lin Yi.

442
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,000
Who's the undercover?

443
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,920
As long as the key is right.

444
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,520
Right.

445
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,120
This key is easy to guess.

446
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Don't bite your tongue.

447
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,680
Don't bite.

448
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,360
Don't bite your tongue off.

449
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,400
I can't anymore.

450
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,880
Almost.

451
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,200
Which song is it?

452
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,080
Which song? I...

453
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,040
He said this...

454
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,480
Song title.

455
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,840
Did you recognize it?

456
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,400
I recognized it.

457
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,880
Lin Yi's Cantonese pronunciation,

458
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
I've learned it too.

459
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,560
Just sing whatever line comes to mind.

460
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,320
I think you two

461
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,600
should sing it in Shenyang dialect.

462
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,880
How is Lin Yi's pronunciation so good?

463
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,400
Just say the title.

464
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,960
No need to sing it.

465
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,080
I can't remember the title.

466
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,960
Can you sing that song?

467
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,840
Two words.

468
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,080
If you can sing it, it's correct.

469
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,160
So, is it okay?

470
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,320
It's okay.

471
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,960
Is it okay?

472
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,640
Does it count for extra points?

473
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,600
Extra points.

474
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,120
Red Sun.

475
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,680
Correct.

476
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,440
Red Sun, okay.

477
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,040
Bro.

478
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,040
You...

479
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,360
What should I sing?

480
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
The beginning tune was right.

481
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,920
But your Cantonese is really...

482
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,800
With me...

483
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,120
I can't hear it.

484
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,800
I don't even know how I'm pronouncing it anymore.

485
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
So cute.
