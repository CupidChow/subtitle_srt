1
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,240
Family

2
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,000
holds an important place in Italian culture

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,000
just like in China

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,480
People cherish family bonds

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,960
and value family reunions

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,960
Today

7
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,840
the whole Earth family is together

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,960
starting an unexpected family journey

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,520
Good morning

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,320
Good morning

11
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,440
I think this town shows us

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,800
the kind of life I had as a child

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,240
I feel a bit reluctant to leave

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
Did everyone bring their credit cards today?

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,200
I only brought cash

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,400
You pay for the big things

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll cover the small ones

18
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,760
Okay?

19
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
No problem

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,440
So I'm the young master today, right?

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
Young Master Gong

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,800
Young Master Ning

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Please call me Wei Shao

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,640
Which of your songs do you like the most?

25
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,320
They're all fine

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,040
I want to hear "Jiang Zhen De"

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Let's not

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
"Jiang Zhen De" was your earliest, right?

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
Yes, when I just debuted

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,320
In 2018

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
Back then you still had

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
that hairstyle with bangs

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,800
Honestly

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,520
Could it be me

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,760
who was bewitched

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,560
This is your song

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,280
At first, it was a cover of someone else's

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
Then I released my own version

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,440
This song was really popular back then

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,280
We're here, everyone.

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,320
Let's eat.

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
Let's go.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,400
This is pretty good.

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,760
So beautiful.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,320
Every plate here is amazing.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
This is a century-old restaurant.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
It's been passed down for four generations.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
The restaurant has collected many

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,160
tableware styles from different eras.

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,040
The things here

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
I want to take them all, what should I do?

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,640
Even I want to take them all.

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,200
The old designs are just too good.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,480
The old designs

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
What is this for?

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Didi

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
"Ziwen little brother"

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,480
"Ziwen"

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,720
No

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Yuwen

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,000
All wrong.

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,360
Even the gender is mixed up.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
"Yuwen little brother"

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
"Auntie Huang Lei"

65
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
I fought back.

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,280
I can't take it anymore.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,800
Leilei

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm telling you, this isn't my fault.

69
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
"Auntie Huang Lei"

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,400
I didn't say that.

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,720
"Ziwen little brother" and "Auntie Huang Lei"

72
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,320
This restaurant was established in 1909.

73
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,200
It has been over 110 years since then.

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
The ingredients used in this restaurant

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
have one very important element.

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
It is the small red chili pepper.

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
The small red chili pepper

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,920
in the Naples region of Italy

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,200
holds great significance.

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,800
Red symbolizes a prosperous life.

81
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,040
Red

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,000
is pronounced "chi chi" in Chinese.

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
Two "chi" characters.

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,440
Here, the small red chili pepper is a symbol of good luck.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,720
That's why you see many chili pepper ornaments on the streets.

86
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,280
People believe that carrying one every day

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,480
will bring them good luck.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,760
We hope the small red chili pepper

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,400
can also bring good luck to our journey

90
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
and bring us good fortune.

91
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,560
Alright, you can serve the dishes now.

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Can Xingxu make it for the meal?

93
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Will he make it in time to eat?

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,080
He won't make it.

95
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,320
Let's eat first.

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Friends,

97
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,680
this restaurant has been recognized as

98
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
one of Italy's historic long-established brands.

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,360
These are all their signature dishes.

100
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,080
Clam pasta.

101
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,400
The steak is here, everyone.

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
This looks delicious.

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,320
Go ahead, dig in.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Has "Wang" started eating?

105
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,000
Once "Wang" picks up his chopsticks, you can start too.

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
Go ahead.

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
The steak is great.

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
It's very special.

109
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
It's really tasty.

110
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,360
Guobaorou

111
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
This sauce is the kind used for Guobaorou.

112
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Sweet and sour sauce.

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,680
Guobaorou is good, not "Guobao again."

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,400
Good.

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
Like fish.

116
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
Just like fish.

117
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,600
Stir-fried shredded potatoes, try some.

118
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
After Yuning mentioned this,

119
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,880
I felt like I was back in Dandong.

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
You have to talk about Dandong.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,120
Bro, these shredded potatoes are really tasty.

122
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Really tasty.

123
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,400
Really tasty.

124
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
Really tasty.

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,960
This Xingxu

126
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,720
didn't get to eat it.

127
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,040
Take a photo for him.

128
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
Let me quickly record one, okay?

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Xingxu has already arrived.

130
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
To welcome his arrival,

131
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
we have prepared for Xingxu

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,200
a welcome gift.

133
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,440
This welcome gift

134
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,960
requires everyone's cooperation.

135
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,280
Isn't that easy?

136
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,600
The few of us

137
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
are full of mischief.

138
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,000
No.

139
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,360
Just you.

140
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,120
Only you.

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
Only you are full of it.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
The family atmosphere in southern Italy

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,640
is very similar to China.

144
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Family members are all very closely connected.

145
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,000
Today, we will begin here

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,080
our first family task.

147
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,000
Because according to local customs,

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,240
the good luck of chili peppers must be passed among friends and family

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,200
by mutual exchange.

150
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,080
So we will first give this symbol of good luck,

151
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,840
the chili pepper title, to Xingxu.

152
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
Then let him pass it on to every member of the Earth Team.

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
For this,

154
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,840
everyone needs to, during three rounds of tasks,

155
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,640
have Xingxu use a specific action

156
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,600
to pass on good luck to you.

157
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
And your task is

158
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,640
at least four people

159
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,760
during today's three rounds of tasks,

160
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,280
to be passed the good luck by him without him noticing.

161
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,520
He must not find out.

162
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,920
Okay.

163
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,840
He can't know

164
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,480
that we know he is the "chili spirit."

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,040
You can discuss and decide on

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,560
the specific action for Xingxu to pass on good luck.

167
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,000
How about we let one of us here

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
the one who's not too mischievous, come up with an idea

169
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,280
Is there any way

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,320
Me

171
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,560
I underestimated myself

172
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,440
Put on a jacket or

173
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,720
Wearing a jacket is tough, since it's so hot

174
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,080
Yeah

175
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
You have to ask everyone

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
Like, "Hey, how do you think my training's been lately?"

177
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,320
And the other person has to touch his muscles

178
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,640
And say, "Wow, your muscles are huge!"

179
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,280
Squeeze three times

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,960
Like, if we squeeze once, then squeeze two more times

181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,960
That works

182
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,240
Squeezing three times is the rule

183
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,880
That's really interesting

184
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,640
No one can mess up today

185
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,200
Gong Jun

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
You go to each person and say

187
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,160
"Do you want to feel my muscles?"

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,320
Let's see who laughs

189
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
Let's do a

190
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,080
test first

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
I think we can try it

192
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
Jun Jun, you go

193
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,880
Bro

194
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
I've been training pretty well lately

195
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
Been working out a lot

196
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,280
Try it

197
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,120
What are you doing

198
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Touch it

199
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,560
Why

200
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,320
I've trained a lot

201
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,520
Why am I getting nervous?

202
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,520
Just two sentences and it all fell apart.

203
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
It was exposed right away.

204
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,920
This is actually a bit difficult.

205
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,640
I think Xingxu isn't as good as Junjun.

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
Stop messing with me.

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Hege, give it a try.

208
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
I think you'll be the most natural.

209
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,560
That coach.

210
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
A Russian coach taught me.

211
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
This muscle training method is completely different.

212
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,960
You try it.

213
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,160
Split it into three sets.

214
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,440
I said "da da da."

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
Can you grip it? Come on.

216
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,880
Come on.

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,040
Twenty, fifty, seventy.

218
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,760
Go ahead.

219
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,480
Trust me.

220
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,960
But be careful at seventy.

221
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,560
Because at seventy,

222
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,360
that's when it's easiest to get injured.

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,480
You'll get hurt, not me.

224
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Like this.

225
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,480
Go ahead.

226
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,840
Look.

227
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,560
Careful.

228
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
That's awesome.

229
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
It's really strange.

230
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,520
Actually, he's really strange.

231
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
So strange.

232
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,760
So strange.

233
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
That person can be strange.

234
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,960
We just need to pretend to be him.

235
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Actually, the acting is pretty good.

236
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,960
Let's not expose how strange he is anymore.

237
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't overreact.

238
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,840
There's another situation that could happen.

239
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
If Xingxu wants to say something,

240
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,600
It looks way too hard.

241
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
He broke down.

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,760
What if he doesn't want to play anymore?

243
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,960
What if he exposes himself?

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
If Xingxu, during the mission,

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,799
realizes that everyone knows his identity,

246
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,080
or fails to assimilate successfully,

247
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,679
at least four "Chili Spirits,"

248
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,280
then everyone fails the challenge.

249
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,240
Next stop, everyone has to sleep in tents.

250
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,520
We have to help him win.

251
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,240
It seems like he's being tested, but actually it's us.

252
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,799
Right.

253
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,680
It's actually testing us.

254
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,280
We all need to be in sync.

255
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
The people he passes to

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,400
just need to

257
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,840
pretend to help him for real.

258
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,560
Exactly.

259
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't forget, we're all actors.

260
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,520
For us, what do we call this?

261
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,400
It's a test of our acting skills.

262
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,440
Remind me a bit, you guys.

263
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,200
What if I...

264
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,960
If I try to get out of it, it comes back to me.

265
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,280
That's good.

266
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,040
You just be the one who dodges.

267
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,200
Bro, first round.

268
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,640
Come on, bro.

269
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,400
Let's wish him luck.

270
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,280
Welcome.

271
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
Xingxu.

272
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,240
I think you'll pass today's test.

273
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,800
Bro.

274
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,720
In Henan dialect, it's called

275
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,480
"Why are you only just here?"

276
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
That's good.

277
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
Nice to meet you, please take care of me.

278
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
Only by understanding each other can we get straight to the point.

279
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,080
Hope you have a

280
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
happy day.

281
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
Let's compete today

282
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,840
to see who has the lower body fat.

283
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,040
Xingxu

284
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
You’ve trained really well.

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Cheers!

286
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,160
Success!

287
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,600
Let's go.

288
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,360
Let's go.

289
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,320
He said, "I'm so excited right now."

290
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
Here he comes.

291
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,760
Here he comes.

292
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,640
He added one.

293
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,920
Take off!

294
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
He added a symbol.

295
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,640
They're all cute emojis.

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
I can hear his tone rising.

297
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
So cute.

298
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,000
Very good.

299
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
No, when he wrapped up filming, he felt

300
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,760
Finished filming, then went to have fun.

301
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
Wrapped up again and came to have fun again.

302
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,760
He's the type who gets double the happiness.

303
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,480
Today, let's make him question his life.

304
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,880
Don't be too sure about today either.

305
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,280
We can't let our guard down.

306
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,640
Yes.

307
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,160
I really just finished filming.

308
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,880
Then,

309
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,920
I rushed over here without a break.

310
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Came straight here.

311
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,000
I really missed everyone.

312
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,960
Because I saw them in the group chat.

313
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,680
They posted some

314
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
fun stuff.

315
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Like,

316
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
where they went,

317
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,840
and what they were doing.

318
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,720
And I was

319
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,280
really envious.

320
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,480
While they were recording these past few days,

321
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,880
they kept mentioning you.

322
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,280
Saying, "Let's wait for Xingxu to arrive."

323
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
The day before yesterday,

324
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
Hege wanted to call you at night.

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,720
But at that time,

326
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,320
it was already 4 a.m. back home.

327
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,000
So they didn't call.

328
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I thought

329
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,800
I thought everyone had already forgotten about me.

330
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm so nervous.

331
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,800
No way.

332
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,080
This time,

333
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,640
I won't trust you guys again.

334
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,120
I'll be extra careful.

335
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:09,960
Let's go.

336
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,320
So beautiful.

337
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,640
So beautiful.

338
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's take a group photo.

339
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
This way, everyone can fit in.

340
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,880
That's good.

341
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,720
Amazing.

342
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,160
Let's go.

343
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,680
We really split into groups automatically.

344
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,320
Seriously.

345
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,120
We walk at different speeds.

346
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,560
Okay.

347
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,120
Automatic elimination.

348
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,600
Ning wants one.

349
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,640
This isn't you.

350
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,720
It suits you.

351
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Make fried noodles for us.

352
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,680
Make one for Ning.

353
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,120
I'll do it later.

354
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
Is it okay to wear this for fried noodles tonight?

355
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Yes.

356
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Make fried noodles for us.

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,000
Sure.

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,920
Wear it shirtless.

359
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,360
You said it yourself.

360
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,960
Yeah, so you can feel the muscles and all.

361
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,160
Sexy.

362
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,560
No spoilers.

363
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,000
We'll run into it later.

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,280
Touch it.

365
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,280
Are we there?

366
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,280
They walk so slowly.

367
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,400
They really are slow.

368
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,920
So comfortable.

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,680
Really.

370
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,640
The atmosphere is so relaxed today.

371
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,320
Has Xingxu arrived?

372
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
Let's hurry over and meet him.

373
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,520
He's here.

374
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Uncle, you're here.

375
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
Welcome.

376
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,640
You made it.

377
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,080
You finally arrived.

378
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,280
We were having such a good time we didn't want to leave.

379
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,800
We almost couldn't make it back.

380
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
You can go out and look around later.

381
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,720
Ning wants to wear that apron with no shirt.

382
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,520
I want to buy an outfit for today.

383
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah, buy a set of clothes.

384
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,600
Today's outfit is...

385
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,800
Wait a moment.

386
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,120
Excuse me, teachers, I need to go urgently.

387
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,520
What does it mean...

388
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,720
OOTD?

389
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,800
It means what you wear every day.

390
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,880
You're here.

391
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,440
Thank you.

392
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,880
A warm welcome! Welcome, welcome!

393
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,200
Long time no see.

394
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,800
A warm welcome.

395
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,560
Hello.

396
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
You finally made it, I'm telling you.

397
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,280
We told him.

398
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,120
The Italian way of greeting.

399
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,520
Hello.

400
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,240
Hello.

401
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
Hello.

402
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,880
Come, have a seat.

403
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,920
I'll just sit next to you.

404
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,640
Sit here.

405
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,400
Here.

406
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,080
Quick.

407
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,040
You're new here.

408
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
We'll take care of you today.

409
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,080
The newcomer.

410
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,800
New here.

411
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,360
New to this city.

412
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,400
We're locals.

413
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Sit.

414
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,320
Sit.

415
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
No, you sit first.

416
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
If you don't sit, I don't dare to sit.

417
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Go ahead and sit.

418
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,920
No, I can't.

419
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,600
Please, have a seat.

420
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,320
No, I can't.

421
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,720
After what happened last time,

422
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm scared now.

423
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,760
Sit.

424
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,280
Let's stand for a while.

425
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,920
No.

426
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,720
No.

427
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:02,960
No.

428
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,520
I'll sit with you for a while.

429
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,320
Italy is hot.

430
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,280
I'll keep you company too.

431
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,760
I'll start sweating soon.

432
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,200
No.

433
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
On such a hot day,

434
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
why are you wearing a sweater?

435
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,400
No, it's because this is a set outfit.

436
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,920
Today's outfit.

437
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,600
Go ahead and sit, it's fine.

438
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,240
Sit.

439
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
You only get this special treatment today.

440
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Just for one day.

441
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Is it that bad?

442
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,440
I'm sitting.

443
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,840
Didn't we say we wouldn't do this?

444
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,440
This bench is a bit hot.

445
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,280
Bro, stop moving.

446
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,320
Can we let the kid have a happy day first?

447
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,880
Can we start again tomorrow?

448
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,920
Need to get used to it.

449
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,280
You miss us.

450
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,200
Which one of us

451
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,240
do you miss the most?

452
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,320
The one you miss the most.

453
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,280
You can rank us by age if you want.

454
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,960
Uncle Nai.

455
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm feeling complicated.

456
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,480
I came because I heard you were coming.

457
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,800
That's why I joined this show.

458
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,640
Then I miss you the most.

459
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,360
And then,

460
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,120
You were gone for a few days this time.

461
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,840
I was a bit disappointed.

462
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,680
Really?

463
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,040
I felt down.

464
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm sorry.

465
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,760
Disappointed and down.

466
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,440
I really didn't mean it.

467
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
I've been holding on for four or five days.

468
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,080
After you came,

469
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,960
I feel much more at ease now.

470
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,440
Yeah.

471
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,400
He cried a couple of days ago.

472
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,560
Everyone said at the time,

473
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,720
He cried whenever we talked about you.

474
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,600
Wait a second.

475
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
Why does this feel a little weird?

476
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Do you still remember the thing about the socks?

477
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,160
I remember.

478
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,640
What happened after that?

479
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,720
You have a really good memory.

480
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,840
Now there's a new team.

481
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,000
Hello, owner.

482
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,880
Hello, owner.

483
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,920
I'm the security captain.

484
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,120
I'm the chef.

485
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,400
Give me your socks.

486
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,160
I'll wash them for you.

487
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
Why are the socks still yours?

488
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,280
See, that's just how it is.

489
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,440
It's just such a coincidence.

490
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Yes.

491
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,240
I missed so much.

492
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
What exactly happened?

493
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,440
We need to explain it to him slowly.

494
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
Too many things have happened.

495
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,520
Today,

496
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,240
Xingxu came.

497
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,840
He also brought good luck to everyone.

498
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,960
In Italy,

499
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
especially in Sorrento,

500
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,480
there is also something that represents good luck.

501
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,120
It's called chili pepper.

502
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,960
Chili pepper.

503
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,680
Chili pepper.

504
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,440
Today's challenge

505
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,000
is called "Passing Good Luck."

506
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,840
Among the eight members,

507
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,840
one person is the "Chili Pepper Spirit" who represents good luck.

508
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,400
During today's three rounds of tasks,

509
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,600
he needs to pass good luck to four people through specific actions.

510
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,920
The winner of each round

511
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,480
can get a clue about the "Chili Pepper Spirit."

512
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,560
Then, after each round,

513
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,680
everyone chooses who they think is the "Chili Pepper Spirit"

514
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,440
and votes.

515
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
We will reveal their identity.

516
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,960
Wait, say it again later.

517
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,880
Director, what do you mean?

518
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,960
I didn't understand either.

519
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,760
I'll know once I play a round.

520
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,359
I won't ask anymore.

521
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,920
I'll know once I play a round.

522
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,079
If

523
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,960
the "Chili Pepper Spirit" doesn't complete the good luck passing task,

524
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
the "Chili Pepper Spirit" can only sleep in a tent.

525
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Sleeping in a tent

526
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
Isn't that a good thing?

527
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,040
A bed and a tent

528
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,160
Why would you choose the tent?

529
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,680
You want to set up a tent, right?

530
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sleeping in a tent is great

531
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,359
There's no bathroom

532
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,840
You have to put a small basin inside

533
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,720
No

534
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Everywhere except the tent is full of basins

535
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,080
No, in the living room

536
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,200
Set up the tent in the living room

537
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,760
Kid

538
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
What have you been through this month?

539
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
Then let's draw roles

540
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,360
Okay

541
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,280
Ning, you go

542
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,040
I'll go first

543
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,480
Come on

544
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
Hopefully, don't pick me

545
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,880
If you pick me, I'm doomed

546
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,520
Come on

547
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,840
Okay

548
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,720
Okay

549
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,840
It's showing

550
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
No, it's not

551
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,240
What role?

552
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
What role?

553
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
I'm a good guy

554
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,680
I think Yuning has a good role

555
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,560
Kid, come help me draw one

556
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,320
I'm going.

557
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,600
Okay.

558
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,920
It's you, right, bro?

559
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
It's really you, isn't it?

560
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,240
Let's go.

561
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
Stop acting.

562
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm done acting.

563
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm done acting.

564
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,080
So tired.

565
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,400
You're way too excited.

566
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,320
You're too excited.

567
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,920
I've always been excited.

568
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,280
As long as everyone's reaction is different,

569
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,440
that's normal.

570
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,800
If we feel it's a bit too much,

571
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,520
we'll bring it back.

572
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Yeah, that's right.

573
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,880
Yeah.

574
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Draw one?

575
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,840
Draw a random card.

576
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,200
This one.

577
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,600
Is this one okay?

578
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
Alright, show it.

579
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,040
Can I look at it first?

580
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
Just don't pick me.

581
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
If you pick me, I'm doomed.

582
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,680
If you pick me, I'm doomed.

583
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,960
Are you guys messing with me?

584
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,840
Are all the cards the same?

585
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
They're all blank cards.

586
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,920
I don't believe it.

587
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
If you pick me, I'm doomed.

588
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,560
What action?

589
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,280
The way "Chili Essence" passes on good luck is

590
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,400
to naturally get other members

591
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,480
to pinch any of their muscles three times in a row.

592
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,120
Let's chat.

593
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,600
Let me tell you.

594
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,640
Today I must

595
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,960
First, I have to keep an eye on Naiwen.

596
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,080
I definitely won't let him run first.

597
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
Because your condition is hard to predict.

598
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,120
Xingxu, is that you? Xingxu?

599
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,040
Xingxu, what does it say on your card?

600
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,520
Nothing.

601
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,440
What?

602
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,080
Nothing's written.

603
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,160
I have a feeling.

604
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,800
I'll be the first one voted out.

605
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,600
Let your dream come true.

606
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,760
Are we starting the voting now?

607
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,000
How about we do one round of voting first?

608
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,480
Let's do one round first.

609
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,440
I vote for Li Naiwen.

610
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
Me too.

611
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
I need to put on my glasses.

612
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,920
Come on.

613
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,040
Our first challenge is called

614
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,960
Snap a Photo.

615
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,560
You can't give them hints like that.

616
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,040
Why is everything related to those socks?

617
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,920
We keep talking about things Xingxu doesn't understand.

618
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,520
I need to take a look.

619
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
I missed too many here.

620
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,520
Members take turns as photographers.

621
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,280
Put on a blindfold.

622
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,120
Guess which place

623
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,080
will have more members gathered.

624
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,480
And take a photo.

625
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,960
The person with the most people in their photo wins.

626
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,520
The winning member can get

627
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,920
a clue for "chili essence."

628
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,080
This game

629
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,320
We can't go over there, right?

630
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,240
We can't go outside, right?

631
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,560
That's right.

632
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,120
Man Yidali will go look for him.

633
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,800
Yes.

634
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,920
Come on, everyone.

635
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,440
Who will be the first photographer?

636
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,880
I don't want to go first.

637
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
How about I go first?

638
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,680
How about it?

639
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
Okay.

640
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Awesome.

641
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,480
Alright, let Xingxu come.

642
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,120
Let him blend in for a bit.

643
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,880
Put on the blindfold properly.

644
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
Alright.

645
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,160
Done.

646
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,880
I took the photo.

647
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,440
Spread out.

648
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,040
Five.

649
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,320
Four.

650
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,480
Three.

651
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,800
Two.

652
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,560
One.

653
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Done.

654
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,800
Done.

655
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,640
He took the photo facing me.

656
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,520
Really?

657
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,280
He took it like this.

658
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
You're amazing.

659
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
How did you know?

660
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,120
Did you get the shot?

661
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,680
Got it.

662
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Took two.

663
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,040
Both Ning and I are in it.

664
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,960
Everyone, you smiled.

665
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,880
No.

666
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,360
Who's next?

667
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,520
You go.

668
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,080
Five.

669
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,320
Four.

670
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,440
Three.

671
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,320
Two.

672
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,600
One.

673
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,640
Zero.

674
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,960
Sneaky.

675
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,760
Look.

676
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,480
The original.

677
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:16,960
This is the original.

678
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
This is so hard for me.

679
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,200
Five

680
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,200
Four

681
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,280
Three

682
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,280
Two

683
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,000
One

684
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,720
This hand counts as one person.

685
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,720
Okay.

686
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,520
You can take the photo.

687
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,960
Alright.

688
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,800
Five

689
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,800
Four

690
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,640
Three

691
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,920
Two

692
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,520
One

693
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,000
Who?

694
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,440
Uncle Nai, Xingxu

695
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,120
So many people.

696
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,440
Three.

697
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,720
I used to think

698
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,400
the most dangerous place

699
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,240
was actually the safest place.

700
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Turns out, it isn't.

701
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,920
Come.

702
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,760
Let me do it for you.

703
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,280
I suspect that during the photo,

704
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,200
we completed

705
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,280
some people made certain moves.

706
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,040
From now on, nobody touch me.

707
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,440
Okay.

708
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
No one is allowed to have any physical contact with me.

709
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,440
Stay away from me.

710
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,240
No one.

711
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,280
Let me press it twice for you.

712
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,280
Done.

713
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,840
Nice.

714
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,800
Beautiful.

715
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,720
Uncle, why are you sticking your butt out?

716
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,080
I'm showing my utmost respect.

717
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,640
It's so hot. I'm so hot, brother.

718
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,480
Why is it so hot here?

719
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,440
It's too hot.

720
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,600
Honestly, it's way too hot.

721
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,320
It's too hot.

722
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,320
Your hand is really hot, Xingxu.

723
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,640
Yeah.

724
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm practically burning up.

725
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,600
Be careful.

726
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,920
His hand is kind of dangerous.

727
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,000
Then it was a problem when you touched me earlier.

728
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,440
I didn't touch your hand.

729
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,040
What?

730
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,320
Tell him.

731
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,000
What has his hand done?

732
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,440
What are you doing?

733
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,920
One day, he went to the bathroom and there was no toilet paper.

734
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,680
When I went to the restroom,

735
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,200
I locked the door.

736
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,640
Then, when I was done,

737
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,840
I looked and saw there was no paper.

738
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,160
I was stuck inside.

739
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,280
But there were wet wipes.

740
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,880
Here, let me do it.

741
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,760
Come on, Liu.

742
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,360
Come.

743
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,560
See, this angle can capture a lot of people.

744
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,440
This feels like surveillance.

745
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,640
This height is just like a security camera.

746
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,200
Come.

747
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,600
Don't move.

748
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,440
Five.

749
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,840
Four.

750
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,240
Come.

751
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Three.

752
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,120
Two.

753
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,480
One.

754
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,080
Come.

755
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,480
Come.

756
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,200
Okay.

757
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,800
Got it.

758
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,560
Nice.

759
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,960
This should count as two.

760
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,760
Two.

761
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,120
Even if you take a picture of two people,

762
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,080
I'm still number one.

763
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
You really want to be first.

764
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
Is there something wrong with that?

765
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,840
I want to know.

766
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm a good person.

767
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,760
Let me tell you today,

768
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm keeping a close eye on you.

769
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,560
Just you wait.

770
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,680
Come on.

771
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,640
Come on, brother.

772
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,800
Come on.

773
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,480
Come.

774
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,400
Get ready.

775
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Here, let me give you a massage.

776
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,480
Five

777
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,640
Four

778
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,720
Three

779
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,840
Two

780
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,920
One

781
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,520
Jun Jun

782
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,080
Got it

783
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,800
What are you doing?

784
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,000
Let me massage you a bit

785
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,680
Your shoulders are really tense

786
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,200
No

787
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,400
All of your shoulders are tense

788
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,040
Let me massage you all

789
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,760
Stop with that act

790
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,280
Has that task started already?

791
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,240
Like, for example

792
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
For example, if I touch him

793
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,160
Has this already started?

794
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,840
Yes

795
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,920
It’s already started

796
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,600
Don’t move

797
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
Cut it out

798
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,280
You guys are a bit tense

799
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,760
His shoulders are the most tense

800
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,000
Whose?

801
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,960
Alright, go ahead

802
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
He even tried to act cool

803
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,840
Gong Jun tagged three people

804
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,040
Got the first clue

805
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,480
Sorry about that

806
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,600
Let him take the clue

807
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,720
Good-looking face

808
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,480
What’s up, Jun Jun?

809
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
Later, I’ll take you out for ice cream

810
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
Not you

811
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,720
Can you share the clue first?

812
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,400
Let me analyze it

813
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,320
You can rule it out too

814
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,280
Is it eye gunk or something?

815
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
Wait a moment.

816
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,560
It's him.

817
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,560
What do you mean?

818
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,720
He's a bit good-looking.

819
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,560
Are you here to "choose a consort"?

820
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,480
What are you doing?

821
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,880
But the one who feels like he could be eliminated is your brother.

822
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,040
What do you mean?

823
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,920
My brother is talented.

824
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,640
Say it.

825
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,280
My brother is talented.

826
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,640
Red Lei and I are both talented.

827
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,720
What about him?

828
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm used to being called just a pretty face.

829
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,520
A total pretty face.

830
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,200
This term,

831
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,360
means good-looking.

832
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,040
Good-looking.

833
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
But it can be used for both men and women.

834
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,920
Now the three of us come out,

835
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,720
Look at these five people.

836
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,840
All are good-looking.

837
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,960
Alright.

838
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,280
I admit it too.

839
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,440
He Ge,

840
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,240
Where are you going?

841
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880
Come back.

842
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,000
Even if I admit I'm "spicy,"

843
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,120
I still want to be good-looking.

844
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,760
Good-looking, me too.

845
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,640
So these three are already eliminated, right?

846
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,720
Yes, of course.

847
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,720
No, I don't think we should eliminate them.

848
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Don't forget,

849
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,440
our teacher Sun Honglei is called the "King of Looks."

850
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,680
What does that have to do with me?

851
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm just a rough guy.

852
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Don't say that.

853
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,400
You can't be excluded.

854
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,360
You can't be excluded, bro.

855
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,680
Let me tell you about Li Naiwen.

856
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,480
When he was young,

857
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,040
he charmed so many girls.

858
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,000
I admit it.

859
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,080
Alright.

860
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,800
That's you.

861
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,880
But you need a comparison.

862
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,000
Compared to whom, right?

863
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Yeah, it depends on who you're comparing to.

864
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,080
Like Honglei.

865
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
He's a bit scared now.

866
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,520
He keeps distancing himself.

867
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,600
I think he might have a bit of a problem.

868
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,520
But I'm not sure.

869
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,360
Got it.

870
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
Can I defend myself?

871
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,400
Sure, it's your turn to speak, bro.

872
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,760
Alright.

873
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,720
I won't say anything else.

874
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,920
First, let me tell everyone

875
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm just an ordinary person.

876
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,360
Because I know

877
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,040
everyone likes my personality and soul.

878
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,240
Natural beauty has a little to do with me.

879
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,440
But good looks have nothing to do with me.

880
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
That's all I have to say.

881
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,160
I think "good looks"

882
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
just means all your facial features are present.

883
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
That's way too broad.

884
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,560
Everyone has good looks.

885
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Yeah, I think so.

886
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,160
You can't exclude anyone for this.

887
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
No one can be excluded.

888
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,280
Why were you so quiet just now?

889
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,560
What should I say?

890
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,160
Could I even get a word in?

891
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,040
Xingxu is so pitiful.

892
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,320
Xingxu made a really good point just now.

893
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,440
He couldn't get a word in.

894
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,960
He couldn't get a word in.

895
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,720
If you do it like this,

896
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,680
for the next minute,

897
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,640
all the footage will just be your reactions.

898
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
Like, "Oh, really?"

899
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,840
That's not necessary, really.

900
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,480
We can always let you jump in.

901
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,800
We'll give you reaction shots.

902
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,080
We'll cue you, and you can react.

903
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,680
Okay.

904
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:46,920
He Ge,

905
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,360
He shouldn't be considered good-looking, right?

906
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,080
Should he be included?

907
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,840
He should.

908
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,040
And gestures, too.

909
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,000
Do you think she counts as good-looking?

910
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,080
What about me?

911
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,080
Actually, he's a bit scared.

912
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,440
You see, he always does this when he talks.

913
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,200
It's a self-protective state.

914
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,200
A self-protective state.

915
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,200
I think

916
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,960
Let me analyze it briefly.

917
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,280
The first round has already turned into such a debate.

918
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,440
I think it's a personal grudge.

919
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
A personal grudge.

920
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,920
That's too accurate.

921
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,160
Because I just arrived,

922
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,600
so I feel like everything...

923
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
This is too broad.

924
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,480
It shouldn't be chosen.

925
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,720
Then how about this,

926
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
I think Xingxu...

927
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
Since he doesn't know how to play,

928
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,760
or maybe he's still not familiar with it,

929
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
let's vote him out first.

930
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,760
So are you the "Chili Essence"?

931
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,200
I can be.

932
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,280
No, because he definitely can't figure us out right now.

933
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,120
So he needs some time to adapt.

934
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,480
I think it's Gong Jun.

935
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,240
Come on, then.

936
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,400
Go ahead, cast your vote.

937
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,560
Vote now.

938
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,280
Come on.

939
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,920
Get ready.

940
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,360
First round of voting.

941
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,440
Three.

942
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,880
Two.

943
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,200
One.

944
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Please vote.

945
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,000
Why are you voting for me?

946
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,120
So many people voted for me.

947
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,720
It's just a personal grudge.

948
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,400
I don't know about that.

949
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,800
Fine, then abstain.

950
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,800
It's okay.

951
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,160
Jun Jun has five votes now.

952
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,360
You guys, seriously...

953
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,280
Wait a moment.

954
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
It's about to be revealed.

955
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Jun Jun's identity is...

956
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,560
Civilian.

957
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,560
Civilian.

958
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,320
You talk too much, bro.

959
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,120
It doesn't really matter.

960
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,920
Because in this round,

961
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,880
we really couldn't have guessed.

962
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,120
My identity is cleared now.

963
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,320
Next,

964
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,160
we'll start the second task.

965
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,840
Hurry up.

966
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,680
Hurry up.

967
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,160
Our second round task is

968
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
a shopping challenge.

969
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
This town has many

970
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,440
souvenirs with lemon and chili themes.

971
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,120
Each person randomly writes a number from 1 to 10.

972
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,400
The total shopping amount closest to

973
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,040
the sum of everyone's numbers wins.

974
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,719
If everyone writes 10,

975
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,800
then the person whose shopping total is closest to 80 wins.

976
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
After finishing shopping

977
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,480
we headed to the seaside to settle up.

978
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,719
We enjoyed the beautiful sunset over the sea.

979
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,560
Shopping

980
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,920
Let's go, that's enough talking.

981
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm heading off now, bye.

982
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,679
Bye.

983
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,000
I have to check out that little shop up ahead.

984
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,840
That's the one farthest away.

985
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,480
I'll go there first.

986
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Then I'll come back.

987
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,080
I've been looking forward to this for so long.

988
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,280
Finally, I'm out shopping on the street.

989
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,760
Then the four of us will head out.

990
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,640
Let's go, the four of us.

991
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:28,960
Okay.

992
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,360
Hello.

993
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Hello.

994
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,960
Hello.

995
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,520
Hello.

996
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,720
Brothers from China.

997
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,680
These are the lemons they have here.

998
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,280
Look.

999
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,360
Look.

1000
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,960
I see.

1001
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,200
They're so big, like pomelos.

1002
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,840
The wall over there looks really nice.

1003
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,840
It feels like every corner here

1004
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,000
looks great in photos.

1005
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,680
Aren't you going to buy a bag or something for your wife?

1006
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,280
I don't even know what kind she likes.

1007
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,720
Mainly, I'm not good at shopping.

1008
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,160
You're not good at shopping?

1009
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,880
Are you?

1010
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,480
I am.

1011
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,680
This one actually looks pretty nice.

1012
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
These are the team uniforms we bought.

1013
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
We bought them here.

1014
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,120
We revealed it.

1015
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,800
The team uniforms were bought here.

1016
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,480
They really suit us.

1017
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,560
They're good for going to the beach too.

1018
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,280
Yeah.

1019
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,160
Then why didn't you get us bikini styles?

1020
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,680
Something a bit sexier.

1021
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,560
Thank you.

1022
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
So the lemon you mentioned,

1023
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,880
is it really lemon?

1024
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,800
The best thing here is the lemon.

1025
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,440
It's super tasty.

1026
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Let's get that lemon ice cream later.

1027
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,920
It's super tasty.

1028
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,640
Really?

1029
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,160
Ice cream.

1030
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,440
Come in quickly.

1031
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,200
Xingxu.

1032
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,520
Where is it?

1033
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,920
Have they already left?

1034
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,960
Xingxu.

1035
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,240
There's ice cream here.

1036
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,640
There's ice cream here.

1037
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,360
I'll go take a look first.

1038
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,440
Let's have some ice cream, come on.

1039
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,960
Let's do our own thing.

1040
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,240
He'll come find us later.

1041
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,840
Exactly.

1042
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,560
Chili pepper.

1043
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Buy it for "Chili Pepper Spirit."

1044
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,120
Buy it for Xingxu.

1045
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,080
That actually works.

1046
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
But this looks really nice.

1047
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,400
He's under a lot of pressure.

1048
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,520
You can tell.

1049
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Let me do it.

1050
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,720
I'll do it.

1051
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,520
No.

1052
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,640
Let the older brother do it.

1053
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,560
You'll have plenty of chances later.

1054
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,560
One caramel, one yogurt.

1055
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Look, you order.

1056
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,960
I want to eat this too.

1057
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,160
Let's get another one.

1058
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,080
This Italian ice cream is so delicious.

1059
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,040
How much is it in total? Keep track.

1060
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,600
Let's sit down and rest for a bit.

1061
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,200
Thanks, bro.

1062
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,040
It's really tasty.

1063
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,600
You sit.

1064
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,320
Sit down.

1065
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,560
I'm not tired.

1066
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,040
It's about our show.

1067
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,280
I think the recording went really well.

1068
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,600
It's just so natural and comfortable.

1069
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,440
Thank you.

1070
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,440
That's right.

1071
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,640
You look pretty happy.

1072
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,040
Very happy.

1073
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,480
This show is actually pretty good.

1074
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,000
Hello.

1075
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,080
Want one?

1076
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,840
I'll have one.

1077
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,440
You pick one.

1078
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,400
Want another one?

1079
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm good, thanks.

1080
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,680
Let me analyze it for everyone first.

1081
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,640
I've already spent all the money.

1082
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,880
What did you buy?

1083
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,960
I bought two paintings.

1084
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,280
Let me see the paintings you bought.

1085
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,280
You can open them and look.

1086
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,760
You can open them and take a look.

1087
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They're painted by a local artist, right?

1088
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,080
A local photographer.

1089
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,120
Jun Jun.

1090
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,600
Come here.

1091
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,600
Can I vent my frustration?

1092
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,960
Is someone controlling you?

1093
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,360
Guys, I'm going out to take a look.

1094
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,880
He ran away.

1095
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,880
That's way too obvious.

1096
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,400
This kid really doesn't know how to play.

1097
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,800
It's way too obvious.

1098
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,280
I'm really struggling here.

1099
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,640
When I first got this task,

1100
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,280
I thought

1101
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,360
I could only hide myself and not get found.

1102
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,880
I think Xingxu is just too naive.

1103
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,640
Now it's basically all exposed.

1104
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,160
He's way too nervous.

1105
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,200
Let's get moving then.

1106
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,400
Let's move.

1107
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,840
Let's move.

1108
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,760
We can split up too.

1109
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,080
Split up.

1110
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Don't scare the kid.

1111
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,440
It's too intimidating when all of us gather together.

1112
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,760
Three old-timers together.

1113
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,880
He's really scared.

1114
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,760
No.

1115
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,800
If it really doesn't work, we can just go and get ourselves eliminated.

1116
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,400
Someone will come in a bit.

1117
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,320
The three of us can't be together.

1118
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,720
If we're together, we'll scare Xingxu.

1119
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,680
He'll have a hard time finding us.

1120
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,880
And Xingxu is up ahead.

1121
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,320
Right in front of us.

1122
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,120
Let's go.

1123
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,080
How much money do you have left?

1124
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,000
I didn't spend any money.

1125
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,760
Otherwise, I'll just follow you.

1126
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,120
You.

1127
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,120
Treat me to some food.

1128
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,760
Let's go.

1129
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,880
Let's go.

1130
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,240
Bro, let's go together.

1131
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,560
Go take a walk for a bit.

1132
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,120
Take a walk for a while.

1133
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,760
Go take a walk.

1134
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,040
Jackie Chan.

1135
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,160
Jackie Chan, right.

1136
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,120
Great, so beautiful.

1137
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,640
She said I'm beautiful.

1138
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,480
Right? She said you are.

1139
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,200
Thank you.

1140
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,040
So beautiful.

1141
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,760
She said me.

1142
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,440
Actually, guys can too.

1143
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,560
Yes, they can.

1144
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,120
It's just having good looks.

1145
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,240
Xingxu is probably quite happy over there too.

1146
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,720
Those older guys must be taking good care of him.

1147
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,240
I wonder if they've squeezed his muscles yet.

1148
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Do you know why Li Naiwen was sent away?

1149
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,240
Why?

1150
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
Being with him never ends well.

1151
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,440
He has too many tricks.

1152
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,360
And his looks...

1153
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,360
Let me tell you about his looks.

1154
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,240
Why?

1155
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't know why.

1156
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,560
He has a role in every event.

1157
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,720
Letting a man shop by himself

1158
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,440
is really an awkward thing.

1159
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,440
I don't even know what to buy.

1160
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,120
Which one suits me?

1161
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,520
The one that suits you.

1162
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
Maybe this one, this is good.

1163
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,600
I'll buy two.

1164
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,160
One for my wife.

1165
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
And one for myself.

1166
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,600
We can find a place to sit down.

1167
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,480
Or whatever works.

1168
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,960
Let's order a cup of coffee for the two of us.

1169
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,680
Order a cup of coffee.

1170
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,480
You weren't here a few days ago.

1171
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,040
I was going to say

1172
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,080
that you could help me practice every day.

1173
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,560
You could help me practice every day.

1174
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,040
Practice with me every day.

1175
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,240
Practice with me every day.

1176
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,560
I'll do it.

1177
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:52,880
Okay.

1178
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,480
I'll do it.

1179
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,760
Hello.

1180
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,760
I'd like a coffee.

1181
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,000
It's that espresso.

1182
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,360
Espresso.

1183
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,760
Okay.

1184
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,200
Okay.

1185
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,640
Alright.

1186
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,240
Sit.

1187
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,880
And then what?

1188
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,600
And then what did you say?

1189
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,920
Help me practice.

1190
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,880
But then you weren't here.

1191
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,400
Yeah.

1192
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,120
So I ended up eating a lot for several days.

1193
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,000
Mainly, I...

1194
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Showed me the photo

1195
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,360
Super impressive

1196
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,840
It seems like you have no body fat at all

1197
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,040
No, I do have body fat

1198
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,200
It's mainly because I only have five abs

1199
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,880
Only five abs

1200
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,960
Abs are genetic

1201
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,320
It's determined by genes

1202
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,360
Whether they're aligned is also genetic

1203
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,400
Gong Jun's are very aligned

1204
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,800
Gong Jun has six abs, and they're very aligned

1205
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,640
There's nothing you can do about it

1206
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,360
It's a matter of talent

1207
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,120
I've never touched them

1208
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,720
I've never touched them

1209
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,320
I've never touched them

1210
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,760
These abs of mine

1211
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,400
I hope you can guide me

1212
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,480
Let me touch them once

1213
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
No problem, absolutely

1214
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,040
What he's looking at is

1215
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,120
This spot

1216
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,760
This spot

1217
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,720
Absolutely no body fat here

1218
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,200
Look here

1219
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,720
Touch this spot

1220
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,160
You're as tough as a locomotive.

1221
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,800
And then this,

1222
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,560
this spot,

1223
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,760
if you run your hand down from the top,

1224
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
run your hand down from the top,

1225
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,920
there's an edge.

1226
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,440
How do you train for this?

1227
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,160
Don't think of it as a burden.

1228
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,200
Just train whatever you want.

1229
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,400
If I were like him,

1230
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,240
I'd never wear clothes when I go out.

1231
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,040
I'd never wear them.

1232
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,880
Lend me some later.

1233
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
No, I mean—

1234
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,880
Give it all.

1235
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,720
That's not necessary.

1236
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,480
After you pay, give me twenty.

1237
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,720
No, after I pay, you use it.

1238
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,880
Give it all to me.

1239
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,640
Give it all to you.

1240
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,000
Him? I vouched for him.

1241
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,720
Because the basic logic of this game is

1242
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,840
daring to spend the money.

1243
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,640
Because you don't need clues.

1244
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,000
Because you absolutely don't need clues.

1245
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,400
This is definitely a good identity.

1246
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,680
No.

1247
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,880
Identity doesn't matter.

1248
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,960
Let's finish eating first.

1249
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,680
Now I think

1250
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,800
Anyway, you should be careful.

1251
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,040
Li Naiwen, be careful.

1252
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,720
Yuning, right?

1253
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,080
Yuning is impressive.

1254
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,560
Jun Jun is sly.

1255
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,960
Why have you never suspected me?

1256
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,400
You're doing okay.

1257
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,080
You just got here, so you shouldn't feel too much pressure.

1258
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,240
Let's go.

1259
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,560
Let's go buy something.

1260
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,680
I'll walk over there.

1261
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,840
Okay, I'll go ahead.

1262
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,240
Alright.

1263
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,480
I've finished the task.

1264
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,560
I've finished the task.

1265
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,320
This isn't me.

1266
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,480
This isn't me.

1267
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,040
It wasn't voluntary.

1268
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,680
I paid as well.

1269
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,840
The reward.

1270
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,560
I gave it to him.

1271
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,080
Money.

1272
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,360
So my conscience is clear.

1273
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,800
My brother is a really good person.

1274
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,320
A good person.

1275
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,560
At Xingxu's level,

1276
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
I won't go up to deliver it.

1277
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,240
That's it for today.

1278
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,520
He still thinks he's really cool.

1279
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,040
No trace at all.

1280
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,840
I didn't expect that.

1281
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,320
Really.

1282
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,960
This is amazing.

1283
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,160
Now, next up,

1284
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,800
Let's look for Honglei.

1285
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,720
This street is pretty comfortable.

1286
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,320
Having a coffee here is quite nice.

1287
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,040
It's awesome.

1288
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,320
It's pretty comfortable.

1289
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,240
Bead bracelet

1290
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,360
Do you want a bracelet?

1291
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,440
I need to handle it.

1292
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,120
The paint comes off easily when you handle it.

1293
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,800
Because that's just the color it has.

1294
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,920
This hat actually looks pretty good.

1295
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,280
You need one.

1296
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,040
I think I could use one.

1297
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,200
Can I try it?

1298
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,000
Looks nice.

1299
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,040
It fits well.

1300
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,240
It matches your outfit.

1301
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,160
Get one.

1302
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,760
Thank you.

1303
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,360
Lemon soap

1304
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,520
This smells great.

1305
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,040
Yeah.

1306
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,960
I want this one.

1307
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,600
Bro, I want this one.

1308
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,120
Look at that.

1309
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,200
That bag over there is pretty nice.

1310
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,000
How much is this?

1311
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,520
The green one looks nice too.

1312
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,400
The green one is nice too.

1313
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Let's each take one.

1314
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,880
This is our group bag.

1315
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,280
Today's fashion look.

1316
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,920
Yes.

1317
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,560
Fashion show

1318
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,640
Let's do a runway segment.

1319
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,640
Runway

1320
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,560
Show off today's haul.

1321
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,280
Ready

1322
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,480
Go

1323
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,560
Show some energy.

1324
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,520
Lift the bag.

1325
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,400
Swing the bag.

1326
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,640
Turn around.

1327
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,120
Motorcycle, be careful.

1328
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,840
Spoils.

1329
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,440
Yuning, where are you guys?

1330
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,640
Being alone is really...

1331
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,440
I don't know how to shop, you know?

1332
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,920
I've never gone shopping before.

1333
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,320
So I'm really bored.

1334
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,160
We're on the main street.

1335
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,840
Ask around how to get to the main street.

1336
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,040
I'll come find you.

1337
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,760
This is edible.

1338
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Try a fry.

1339
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,400
Here.

1340
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,760
Italian fried dough.

1341
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,520
This one's on me.

1342
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,280
Ning Shao is paying for everything.

1343
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
Thank you, Ning Shao.

1344
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,320
Thank you, Ning Ge.

1345
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,040
Why did it jump up?

1346
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,160
This is it.

1347
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,360
A reward for mealtime.

1348
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,480
That means it's been spent.

1349
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,520
Then the dancing starts.

1350
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,600
The audience eats first.

1351
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,280
Thank you.

1352
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:39,920
Thank you.

1353
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,040
Thank you.

1354
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,760
Goodbye.

1355
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,640
Hello.

1356
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,760
Thank you.

1357
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,560
Thank you.

1358
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,280
Thank you.

1359
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
Just buy a few small things.

1360
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,720
It's pretty fun.

1361
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,480
Okay.

1362
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,440
I'll buy it.

1363
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,680
I want a lemon.

1364
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,400
I want an apple.

1365
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,080
Chili pepper.

1366
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,400
Then I want a plane.

1367
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400
This counts as mine.

1368
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,040
Alright.

1369
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,800
I just want to eat that lemon ice cream.

1370
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,160
Let's find a lemon ice cream.

1371
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,400
He said that place is the best.

1372
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,560
There's an old shop over there.

1373
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,760
So big.

1374
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,840
Do you want some, Didi?

1375
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,040
I just had one.

1376
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,440
Let me do it, you don't need to.

1377
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,040
It's so big.

1378
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,840
Let's take a picture together.

1379
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,480
Sure.

1380
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,200
Today's bill is on Young Master Gong.

1381
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,840
Jun Shao.

1382
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,400
Naiwen Ge.

1383
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:30,680
Bro.

1384
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,800
That was so fast.

1385
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,560
Did you spend any money?

1386
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,200
I did.

1387
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:34,840
What did you buy?

1388
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,240
I treated them to ice cream.

1389
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,200
I guess

1390
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,560
Now Chen He will be passed on.

1391
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,000
Actually, in this case

1392
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,360
Because Xingxu is very nervous.

1393
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,800
He's really nervous.

1394
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,520
After one person is passed on,

1395
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,000
he might relax a bit.

1396
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,800
He has a partner now.

1397
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,480
You know, right?

1398
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,200
Who's calling me?

1399
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,480
Hello?

1400
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,800
Where are you, Xingxu?

1401
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,200
Where are you guys?

1402
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,840
We're at the lemon ice cream shop.

1403
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,200
I saw Honglei Ge.

1404
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
That's great!

1405
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,640
It's been a long time since we took a selfie.

1406
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,800
I saw Honglei Ge.

1407
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,680
Lemon ice cream shop.

1408
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,920
He looks

1409
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:26,960
handsome.

1410
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,240
They're at the lemon ice cream shop.

1411
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,240
This is the tastiest one.

1412
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,640
I'll buy it for you, let's go.

1413
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,800
Where are you?

1414
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,560
I've already delivered it.

1415
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,320
I've already sent this.

1416
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,160
I'm already "out."

1417
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,040
Okay.

1418
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,320
Yeah, I already did.

1419
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,560
I've already had good luck passed to me.

1420
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,240
Okay.

1421
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,680
Okay.

1422
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,080
Okay.

1423
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,800
Goodbye.

1424
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,840
Chen He has already been passed to.

1425
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,200
Okay.

1426
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,680
Let's not crowd together.

1427
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,800
Let's go, otherwise...

1428
00:50:59,480 --> 00:50:59,960
Let's go.

1429
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,600
This is his line of thinking.

1430
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,200
He took Chen He,

1431
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,640
Sun Honglei,

1432
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,840
and me,

1433
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,920
the three least suspicious people,

1434
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,480
and passed it on.

1435
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,120
Today, there's really a "genius" among us.

1436
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,800
I just got a blank card.

1437
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,040
The two of us are the same.

1438
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,440
So it definitely isn't us.

1439
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,800
I also brought that.

1440
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,320
You bought a bag.

1441
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,920
Yeah.

1442
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,080
It looks great.

1443
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,840
"Lemon spirit"

1444
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,440
This looks really nice.

1445
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,080
Yeah.

1446
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,840
Where did you buy it?

1447
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
I want to go buy one too, in a bit.

1448
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,560
I'll take you there later.

1449
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,080
Alright.

1450
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,680
Okay then.

1451
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,720
What's this?

1452
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,280
Each of us ties one on.

1453
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,880
Soon, we both need to be careful not to get contaminated.

1454
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,560
We have to tie ourselves together.

1455
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:50,720
No.

1456
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,320
Are you on a mission, bro?

1457
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,400
No.

1458
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,040
What is this thing?

1459
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,960
An anti-theft rope.

1460
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,440
A child anti-theft rope.

1461
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,480
To prevent getting lost.

1462
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,360
Right.

1463
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,960
So this way, he can't contaminate us.

1464
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,200
Because with two people, he has to—

1465
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,880
He has to contaminate one of us.

1466
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,920
Or contaminate me.

1467
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,320
Right.

1468
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,320
Both of us would notice.

1469
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:08,960
Right.

1470
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,520
Okay, no problem.

1471
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,800
Just remember, we can't split up.

1472
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,160
If you end up alone,

1473
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,440
if you get contaminated, it's over.

1474
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,320
Or if I get contaminated.

1475
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,040
Alright.

1476
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,000
Wait, bro, why aren't you putting it on?

1477
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:20,880
I can't put it on.

1478
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,360
This side is for kids.

1479
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,800
So this is the only way I can do it.

1480
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,200
This doesn't seem right.

1481
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,520
What's not right?

1482
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,640
Then why don't you take this end?

1483
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,760
No, that's not possible.

1484
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,640
It's all fine.

1485
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,440
Why do I feel a bit...

1486
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,680
What is it?

1487
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,760
There's a task.

1488
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,520
It's not a task.

1489
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,120
What task?

1490
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,720
If there's a task, you've already been caught.

1491
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,400
You can't escape now.

1492
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,040
Right?

1493
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,400
Why is it so weird?

1494
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,960
It's not weird.

1495
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,200
Let's go.

1496
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,960
Seriously, whoever comes near us...

1497
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,880
The two of us together is enough.

1498
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,120
What does this mean?

1499
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,560
What's going on here?

1500
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,800
Why are we tied up?

1501
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,360
What does this mean, bro?

1502
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,760
Can you not come near us?

1503
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,120
Stay a little farther away from us.

1504
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,120
Among you guys...

1505
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,320
Including He, for sure...

1506
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:06,960
And Naiwen...

1507
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,560
There must be a "spicy troublemaker" among us.

1508
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,920
Bro, I think you're the most suspicious.

1509
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,120
Why?

1510
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,840
Because you tied people up.

1511
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,920
You just want to make sneaky moves all the time.

1512
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Let's add one more person.

1513
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,520
Add another person.

1514
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,120
Add more people.

1515
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,560
It's fine if everyone is together.

1516
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,480
I'm just worried about someone being left alone.

1517
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,960
It's really strange, bro.

1518
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,680
Be careful, Chen Xingxu.

1519
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,440
You're too late.

1520
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,080
Xingxu, what are you guys doing?

1521
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,920
Li Naiwen.

1522
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,880
Li Naiwen.

1523
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,720
What are you guys doing?

1524
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,320
I don't know either.

1525
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,920
Watch out for Li Naiwen.

1526
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,880
There's already a murderous look in his eyes.

1527
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,040
We shouldn't split up.

1528
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,240
I can't separate now.

1529
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,600
Hello, where are you from?

1530
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,000
China.

1531
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,880
Nice to meet you.

1532
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,440
Thank you.

1533
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,520
I want to tell my friends I met you.

1534
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,160
What are your names?

1535
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,160
Honglei.

1536
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,920
Xingxu.

1537
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,680
Hello.

1538
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,560
Nice to meet you.

1539
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,560
See you next time.

1540
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,200
See you next time.

1541
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,320
Xingxu wants to help everyone.

1542
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,280
What a pity.

1543
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,960
Everyone.

1544
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
None of us are good people.

1545
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
We're not good people.

1546
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,200
Keep your voice down.

1547
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,360
Soon the news will leak out.

1548
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,120
Soon Chen Xingxu will leak the news.

1549
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,440
It's been found.

1550
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,000
Leak the news, say it.

1551
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,360
Don't talk about that.

1552
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,920
Xingxu thinks he's the hunter.

1553
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,720
We're the prey.

1554
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,680
And now the prey is going after the hunter.

1555
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,640
Now we don't know who the hunter is.

1556
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,000
Who?

1557
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,240
No one followed us.

1558
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,320
I was afraid someone was following.

1559
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,120
It's fine, let them follow.

1560
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,240
As long as we're together,

1561
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,680
he won't dare to reveal himself.

1562
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,760
The shop you bought from,

1563
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,000
their bags are sturdy.

1564
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,440
It's this one.

1565
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
Pick a color.

1566
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,680
You choose one for me, bro.

1567
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,880
One like this.

1568
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,760
And one like this.

1569
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,880
I think this one is good.

1570
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,520
Blue.

1571
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,520
I'll buy it for you.

1572
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,880
No, I'll do it myself.

1573
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,520
Let me give you a bag.

1574
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,640
One more, please.

1575
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,400
Ten euros.

1576
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,880
You can still bargain.

1577
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,280
Of course.

1578
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,640
Italians are very friendly.

1579
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,080
You can bargain.

1580
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,120
Thanks, bro.

1581
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,720
Cool.

1582
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,400
Here.

1583
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,400
Hello.

1584
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,800
Live in the moment.

1585
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,720
Please.

1586
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,920
I'll go over there in a bit.

1587
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,240
Wait until he's done "killing," then it'll be safer.

1588
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,080
That way, he'll have someone with him.

1589
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,840
You know?

1590
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,400
This way, Honglei can cooperate with him.

1591
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,320
"Kill" me.

1592
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,200
See you next time.

1593
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,920
Goodbye.

1594
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,520
Goodbye.

1595
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,360
Hello.

1596
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,840
Very good, see you next time.

1597
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,000
We can find a place to have a drink.

1598
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Any soda, anything is fine.

1599
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,800
As long as there's "chili extract."

1600
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,480
If he can't "kill" us before dark,

1601
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,400
then there's no problem.

1602
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,480
Yes.

1603
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,960
I still have to bump into him.

1604
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,240
And it has to be accidental.

1605
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,000
Let's go.

1606
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,680
Let's get out of here.

1607
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,840
That scared me to death.

1608
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,000
You startled me.

1609
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,080
You startled me.

1610
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,000
Let's go in.

1611
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,080
Can you go over and take a look for me?

1612
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,440
I'll see if there are any mugs.

1613
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,600
No one's here, don't worry.

1614
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,480
No one's here, don't worry.

1615
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Is there anyone who drinks coffee?

1616
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,320
Because I love drinking American coffee.

1617
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,280
I'll buy one as a souvenir.

1618
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,240
Don't you usually drink coffee too?

1619
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,320
Yeah.

1620
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,480
Then I'll buy a mug.

1621
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,440
Let's each get one.

1622
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,000
Okay.

1623
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,280
Each one is painted a bit differently.

1624
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,400
These are hand-painted.

1625
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,600
Which one do you want?

1626
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,480
You pick first, bro.

1627
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,120
You want this one?

1628
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:37,520
Yeah.

1629
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,040
Then I'll take this one.

1630
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,760
Then I'll take this one.

1631
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,200
Okay.

1632
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:39,560
Is that okay?

1633
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,040
Okay.

1634
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,840
I'll tell you now.

1635
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,280
I suspect someone has a problem.

1636
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,200
Wait a moment.

1637
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,000
Stop messing around.

1638
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,560
What are you doing?

1639
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,920
Why did you come looking for us yourself?

1640
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,800
I suspect someone has a problem.

1641
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,280
Who?

1642
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,960
That person.

1643
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,920
They bought me a hat.

1644
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,840
Who bought you the hat?

1645
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,720
Why did he buy you one?

1646
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,040
Such a small hat.

1647
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,520
So there's something wrong.

1648
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,080
Who?

1649
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,160
That Yuníng.

1650
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,080
Can you help me pick one?

1651
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:12,920
This one.

1652
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,680
This one looks nice.

1653
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,160
I'll buy it for you.

1654
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,560
It looks like a wonton.

1655
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,280
Wonton.

1656
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,000
Maybe a bun.

1657
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,960
When he was buying the hat,

1658
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,000
he kept touching me like this.

1659
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,320
He kept bumping into me, touching me.

1660
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,960
Shouldn't you two explain first?

1661
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,960
What does this mean?

1662
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,480
It's like, if "Chili Essence" comes over and tries to contaminate me,

1663
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
then I can't tell you.

1664
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
Anyway, I'm sure the two of us are on the same team now.

1665
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,760
This is my master, right now.

1666
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:45,840
My master.

1667
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,280
Why?

1668
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,440
I suspect someone has a problem.

1669
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,560
My master.

1670
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,960
Did you see it?

1671
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,720
Fitness.

1672
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,840
Take a look.

1673
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,600
Just take a glance.

1674
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,720
Touch it.

1675
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:58,760
Just take a look.

1676
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,800
What's this?

1677
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,760
Like this.

1678
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,520
Like this.

1679
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,760
Like this.

1680
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,760
Just use your finger like this.

1681
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,520
Trust me.

1682
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,000
I've never seen muscles like this before.

1683
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,320
One, two, three.

1684
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,240
Go down.

1685
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,360
One, two.

1686
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,280
What are you doing?

1687
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,960
I've already finished two.

1688
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,440
What about the third one?

1689
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,200
What about Naiwen?

1690
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,960
I've never seen anyone rush at the courier like that.

1691
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,200
You definitely have to make it look like a collision.

1692
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,320
Wine bottle cap

1693
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,200
Wine bottle cap

1694
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:54,960
How much is it?

1695
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,240
Eight euros

1696
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,600
Uncle Nai, what are you buying?

1697
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,840
What are you buying?

1698
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,720
To be honest,

1699
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,200
I really don't know what to buy.

1700
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,960
Do you know what this is for?

1701
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,760
Wine stopper

1702
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,240
Wait, what are you two doing?

1703
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,280
Wait, where are you going?

1704
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,480
I'm just wandering around.

1705
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,520
Let's walk around together.

1706
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,920
Why do you keep avoiding us?

1707
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,160
Are you hiding something?

1708
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,440
Don't touch me.

1709
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,040
What are you doing?

1710
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,240
Don't touch me.

1711
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,920
What's up with these two?

1712
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,320
I just don't get it.

1713
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,120
Are you the problematic one?

1714
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,480
Wait, what are you doing?

1715
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,960
He keeps touching me, he...

1716
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,280
So what's going on between you two?

1717
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,800
He said he's afraid someone will get close to us.

1718
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,840
Xingxu, look closely at his face.

1719
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,240
It's already starting to look like a chili pepper.

1720
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,320
I just heard some bad news.

1721
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,280
What?

1722
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,240
I don't know if you have the same

1723
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,320
bad news as I do.

1724
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,680
He's a "chili spirit."

1725
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,000
Master

1726
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,480
I just bought one of these.

1727
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,240
You bought it?

1728
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,080
Yeah.

1729
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,760
Why?

1730
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:08,880
Come on.

1731
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,400
What are you doing?

1732
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,640
Wait a second.

1733
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,840
Come on.

1734
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,760
What is this thing?

1735
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,640
Let me tell you, I am

1736
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,600
so stupid.

1737
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,920
I asked him for fitness advice.

1738
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,280
You are the "Chili Spirit."

1739
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,720
I asked him for fitness advice.

1740
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,800
Bro, here's the thing.

1741
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,680
How stupid I am.

1742
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,360
I was the first one to be passed on.

1743
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,040
Now we're on the same team.

1744
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,480
Yes.

1745
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
The four of us are together.

1746
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,040
Right.

1747
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,880
I'm leaving.

1748
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,200
You guys need to split up.

1749
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:41,920
Otherwise, it'll look too suspicious.

1750
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,600
I'll go with you.

1751
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,240
I'll go with you.

1752
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,680
Luckily, He Ge helped me.

1753
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,560
Really.

1754
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,440
He said it's because he wants to work out lately.

1755
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,600
So I told him, "Feel this."

1756
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,880
I haven't really been working out lately.

1757
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,920
I guess if you talk to me,

1758
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,880
you'll never get to the fitness part.

1759
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,600
Yeah.

1760
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,880
Returning with a full load.

1761
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,480
Guys, get in the car.

1762
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,160
Let's go.

1763
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,560
Go.

1764
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,560
Xingxu's last round.

1765
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,200
He just needs to find one more person.

1766
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,120
Pick one more from among us.

1767
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,200
Let's put on a show for them, come on.

1768
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,960
This "Chili Spirit" is really playing well.

1769
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,760
Very skilled.

1770
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,560
That's him.

1771
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,440
Vote for him later.

1772
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:31,960
This round

1773
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,280
Sure, whatever, it's fine like this

1774
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,240
I promise, like this

1775
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,480
This round, vote for Naiwen

1776
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,440
Next round, vote for me, okay?

1777
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,600
That won't work

1778
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,280
Why?

1779
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,840
We just can't let you survive

1780
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,520
The rhythm is messed up

1781
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,400
You messed it up

1782
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,560
Earth is super fresh

1783
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,520
Earth is super fresh

1784
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,480
Earth is super fresh

1785
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,680
Earth is super fresh

1786
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,440
Earth is super fresh

1787
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,560
Even this can be the same

1788
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,800
Bro, you know what I'm going to play, right?

1789
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,320
I know

1790
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,400
If you know, that's not good

1791
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,520
Impressive

1792
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,040
So fierce

1793
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,760
I think you guys should take care of me a bit

1794
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,880
Treat me well

1795
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,320
Hurry up, bro

1796
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:08,960
Workout

1797
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,760
Hurry up, bro

1798
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,160
I'm telling you

1799
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,960
Hurry up

1800
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,960
It's more than just working out, come here

1801
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,080
Brother

1802
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,920
Brother

1803
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,160
So this is how you treat me

1804
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,520
Congratulations on winning the game

1805
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,440
Now you're completely safe

1806
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,640
Amazing, really

1807
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
You both are suspects.

1808
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,560
He's protecting you.

1809
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,880
Because you don't have leg hair.

1810
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,280
I think he could do anything.

1811
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,440
Found a restroom.

1812
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,400
Went in and shaved his leg hair.

1813
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,360
If you vote for me,

1814
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,200
you won't have any chance.

1815
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,120
There is no worse.

1816
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,440
Only the worst.

1817
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,120
You guys, seriously...

1818
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,240
Let's go in and have a look.

1819
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,760
It's really old.

1820
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,800
This one looks nice too.

1821
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,880
This is actually pretty cute.

1822
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,600
Is it awesome or not?

1823
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,520
Can I buy this for you?

1824
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,360
I'll pay.

1825
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:50,840
Is that okay?

1826
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,400
It's quite cute.

1827
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,200
It really is pretty cute.

1828
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,920
Let's each get one.

1829
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,360
I'll buy a chili for Xingxu.

1830
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,160
I'll get one for Xingxu.

1831
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,200
Let me try a bite of the vanilla one.

1832
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:58,760
It's so delicious.

1833
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,720
I still want to eat more, what should I do?

1834
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,240
It's so big.

1835
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,000
You're the ice cream king, you know.

1836
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,440
Why did you buy a mesh bag?

1837
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,560
It looks so nice.

1838
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,680
It matches my outfit today.

1839
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,640
How much is this?

1840
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,280
Twenty.

1841
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,720
Mine was only five.

1842
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,520
Yours is twenty.

1843
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,440
Ours is five.

1844
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,680
Did you get ripped off?

1845
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,520
How much was yours?

1846
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,040
Ten.

1847
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,440
You guys have such a strong variety show vibe.
