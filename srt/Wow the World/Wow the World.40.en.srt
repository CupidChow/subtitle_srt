1
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,800
The latest stop at 40 degrees north latitude

2
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,720
Our Earth Squad

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,600
has arrived in Madrid, the capital of Spain

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,240
This is a city

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,520
with diverse cultures

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,640
and warm hospitality

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,480
Here,

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,040
life itself is a celebration

9
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,240
This time,

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,440
our members will follow

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,080
the fiery Flamenco dance

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,200
spinning and leaping

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,200
through the streets and alleys

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,920
discovering the flavors of century-old shops

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,960
experiencing Spain’s unique food culture

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
and local customs

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,360
It's about to burst.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,200
My clothes...

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,880
You put it on.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
I'll put it on right now.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
Yeah, you stay here.

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,760
Let's go.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,600
Ning.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
Looking amazing.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,600
Baby face.

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
Look at your tiny waist.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Look, check out this waist.

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Yeah.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
He just wants us three to compliment him.

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Should I compliment you?

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,200
Just say something nice about me.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,520
Am I skinny?

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,800
Look how this camera angle shoots us.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,039
Don't we look like a divorced couple?

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
We're both crossing our arms.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,840
And each of us is looking away.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,880
He looks left, I look right.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,120
And we're both talking to ourselves.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm the unwanted child.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,400
Mom wants you.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Dad wants you.

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,280
Dad's not responsible.

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,680
So don't go with him.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
Let's fight for custody.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,280
Depends on who I pick.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
I can cook.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,360
I can eat.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
See?

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
See?

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,880
That's the useless man in the family.

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,440
Today on the show,

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
we're going to eat a lot.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,920
On our show,

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm always eating.

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeah.

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,520
If you can't play the game, just focus on eating.

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,240
Don't bring me up in the game again.

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Is that what you think?

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,720
Lin Yi is here.

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
This time I feel like

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
I might have

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,920
someone on my side now.

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,240
No way.

64
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Then I won't be alone.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,680
No.

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,360
You two are just fighting over who's last, right?

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,760
Yeah.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
At least

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
I can't be last every time.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,840
It's a group of acquaintances, right?

71
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,920
Who's familiar?

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
No one is.

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Jin Jing, Lin Yi.

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,240
Lin Yi.

75
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
It's okay.

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,120
Just met.

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,800
Xiao Yi is...

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,720
It's my first time meeting too.

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,600
Jin Jing.

80
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Yu Ning is familiar.

81
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Yu Ning is familiar.

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm closer with Jin Jing.

83
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,080
Jin Jing is such a nice girl.

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
She's unusually cheerful.

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,240
You guys might feel a bit...

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,160
So we don't even need to talk, right?

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,880
Pretty much.

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
Having her alone is enough.

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
Driver, how old are you?

90
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,640
I'm forty-two.

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,560
Sir, can you teach us a phrase

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
that's always useful?

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
But not something basic like "hello" or "thank you."

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,080
Not that basic.

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
The best one is "awesome."

96
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,240
How do you say "awesome"?

97
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,600
Very good.

98
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Very good.

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,800
You should say it in Spanish.

100
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
It probably sounds nice.

101
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,760
Say it a bit more vaguely.

102
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,000
Come on.

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
What do you think of Spain?

104
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
It's great.

105
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
What do you think of our show?

106
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,400
It's great.

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,240
What do you think

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
of our regular guests?

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,880
They're great.

110
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,560
So professional.

111
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,279
Perfect.

112
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,279
What do you think of me?

113
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,399
Perfect.

114
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,520
You're great too.

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Really great.

116
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,040
And the pronunciation sounds so laid-back.

117
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,520
Yeah.

118
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,840
Very good.

119
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,160
So relaxed.

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,160
Mr. Lin Yi,

121
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,600
do you have any expectations for Spain this time?

122
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm hoping to check in at

123
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,080
the Crayon Shin-chan spot.

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Wherever Mr. Lin goes, it's all about Crayon Shin-chan.

125
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,080
Is there Crayon Shin-chan here?

126
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,400
There's an episode where Shin-chan's family

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,320
comes here for a trip.

128
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Really?

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
Do you have any expectations?

130
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,840
Well,

131
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
this is the first time in my life

132
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,040
I've met Mr. Sun Honglei.

133
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,600
Me too.

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Mr. Sun Honglei,

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,920
Mr. Chen He,

136
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Mr. Li Naiwen,

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,680
and

138
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
Ouyang Didi.

139
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm meeting everyone else for the first time.

140
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,480
But this is the first time in my life

141
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
I've met Sun Honglei.

142
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,360
It's pretty amazing for me.

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,080
I was a bit nervous when I saw him.

144
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,160
Because his presence is so strong.

145
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,240
Is that Real Madrid's stadium on the left?

146
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
Real Madrid's stadium.

147
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,480
Naiwen bro bought it.

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,000
No.

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,880
I sold it.

150
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
It's not interesting anymore.

151
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
Real Madrid isn't good anymore.

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,920
Back in the day,

153
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,000
well,

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,760
when Beckham and the others were there,

155
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,920
I was interested and bought it.

156
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,840
You bought it back then?

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
After they retired,

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,480
you sold it?

159
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,080
Yeah, I sold it.

160
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,840
Why didn't you buy Fan Zhiyi back then?

161
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Fan Zhiyi was at Crystal Palace in England.

162
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,080
We're here.

163
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,760
Let's go.

164
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,480
Let's go.

165
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Over there.

166
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:51,920
Let's go.

167
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,440
Didi.

168
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,200
Bro.

169
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,840
Didi today,

170
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,400
looks cool.

171
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
Home game today.

172
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,960
Let's go.

173
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,560
So thin and long.

174
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,240
Compass.

175
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,480
Compass.

176
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,320
A compass compared to chopsticks.

177
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,480
A compass has a tip.

178
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
Yours doesn't have a tip.

179
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
Okay.

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's go, bro.

181
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,560
Let's go up and check it out first.

182
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
Is this a palace?

183
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
So beautiful.

184
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,040
Really beautiful.

185
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,680
So pretty.

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
There are so many details here.

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
It's stunning.

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,560
Look, they're eating down there.

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
See, they have those...

190
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,200
...like a party gathering.

191
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
Bro, walk down from here.

192
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
Then greet them.

193
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,440
Like this.

194
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,240
Yeah.

195
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
Because we're royalty.

196
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Is this how royalty greets people?

197
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,400
Like this.

198
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,520
Twist your wrist.

199
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,600
This elevator...

200
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
This is interesting.

201
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
This elevator is kind of cool.

202
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
And its design...

203
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,800
...looks amazing.

204
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,680
No.

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,520
No.

206
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,880
Let me try.

207
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Don't.

208
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
You'll end up forcing it open.

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, I didn't, I...

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
But I can't open it.

211
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,040
Come to our place.

212
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
You have to greet people, you know?

213
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,040
No.

214
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,280
Why?

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,880
Xingxu.

216
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,160
It won't open, bro. It won't open.

217
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,040
If it's not exactly in place...

218
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,560
...the elevator door won't open.

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Let's go.

220
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
This painting is beautiful.

221
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
Welcome to...

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,800
your...

223
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,320
your home.

224
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,040
your castle.

225
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,440
It's too big, hard to clean.

226
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,920
Stop showing off.

227
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,040
You can only keep it up for one round.

228
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,880
Let's take a photo.

229
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,560
Let me explain.

230
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm wearing...

231
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
I'm wearing pants.

232
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,280
Not a skirt, guys.

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,520
It's just that my pants are a bit big.

234
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,880
They really are pants.

235
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Yeah, they're pants.

236
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
Pants.

237
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Very good.

238
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
Perfect.

239
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,680
Spain is so comfortable.

240
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,920
Hello.

241
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Very good.

242
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Hello.

243
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,280
This is really fresh.

244
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
Very good.

245
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,840
Have a great day.

246
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Good morning.

247
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,640
Very good.

248
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,080
This elevator is great.

249
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,760
You're the smart one.

250
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
So beautiful.

251
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
This is perfect for photos.

252
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,240
Come on, let's make a movie.

253
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,280
Let's pretend we're

254
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,400
living in this building.

255
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,720
But

256
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Let's act out that scene.

257
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
Have you seen Avengers?

258
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
Captain America fights Hydra here.

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you want to be Captain America or

260
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Hydra?

261
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
Who's fighting who?

262
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,840
Captain America fights Hydra.

263
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,600
No, let's do the one

264
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
where we live in this building.

265
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
But today you have to hit on me.

266
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,840
Start.

267
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,720
Go.

268
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,000
Very good.

269
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Who are you?

270
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,520
Don't move.

271
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,120
Two hundred.

272
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:19,920
Don't move.

273
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,920
Thank you.

274
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Here?

275
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Come.

276
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,280
Welcome everyone to

277
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,960
passionate Spain.

278
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's give a big hand to

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,480
Jin Jing and Lin Yi.

280
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,280
Welcome.

281
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,400
Welcome.

282
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Come.

283
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Welcome.

284
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,120
Awesome.

285
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

286
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,320
Hello everyone.

287
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,760
My name is Jin Jing.

288
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
I'm a famous beauty in China.

289
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
Welcome.

290
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,520
Lin Yi.

291
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,680
You really should say something too.

292
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,240
Alright.

293
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
I think I should introduce myself.

294
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
Hello everyone, I'm Lin Yi.

295
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm 6 feet 2 inches tall.

296
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
I weigh 68 kilograms.

297
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,280
Graduated from Beijing Sport University.

298
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
Majored in ballroom dance.

299
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,080
Ballroom dance major.

300
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,840
So should we

301
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,560
Step back.

302
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,520
Now we can officially show it.

303
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:21,840
Sure.

304
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Come on.

305
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,560
Music.

306
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,000
It's for two people, right?

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,600
Right?

308
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,240
Yes, for two people.

309
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,520
So who's the "trouble" here?

310
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Come on, Didi.

311
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,360
Didi.

312
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,400
Come on.

313
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,800
Hurry, Didi.

314
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,280
Work together.

315
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,160
Come.

316
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,960
Lin Yi.

317
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
Didi doesn't have a boyfriend yet.

318
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,160
Bro.

319
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,120
Know each other.

320
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,760
What?

321
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
Isn't your mom coming today?

322
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
Bro, my mom is coming soon.

323
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,040
Let's call mom out.

324
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,760
Let her witness this moment.

325
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,240
Mom.

326
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,280
Are you there, mom?

327
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,040
Has mom arrived?

328
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,120
Mom.

329
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes, witness it.

330
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
Meeting the parents is fine.

331
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,560
You two, get closer.

332
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,920
Bro, wait a second.

333
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,880
Bro, we're filming a show, not matchmaking.

334
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,800
Come.

335
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,560
What's this?

336
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,160
It's from sports school.

337
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Warm up a bit.

338
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
What are these moves?

339
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,200
No idea.

340
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,320
Sorry

341
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
We're being a bit strict

342
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,720
That last kiss wasn't right

343
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,720
No, bro, you have to

344
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,600
You need to show us

345
00:12:59,520 --> 00:12:59,960
Naiwen

346
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,800
Naiwen

347
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
I think this

348
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,800
When it comes to charm, I can't beat you

349
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,560
I think you should do it

350
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,200
About being charming

351
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,920
Let me tell you

352
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,920
Only one person can handle this

353
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,080
Come over here

354
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,640
Seriously

355
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,160
Move aside, don't

356
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,560
I don't want to join this part

357
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,080
I don't want to

358
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,240
I'm telling you

359
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,240
Don't do it

360
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,600
Xingxu can't take it anymore

361
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,480
I don't need to

362
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,080
I don't need to

363
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,280
Xingxu

364
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,920
I don't need to

365
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,440
Xingxu

366
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Come on

367
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,960
Actually

368
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,760
Yuning

369
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,280
Don't

370
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,800
Yuning

371
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm just here to watch

372
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,240
Okay

373
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Come on

374
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,440
Like this

375
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,480
Like this

376
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,960
No, let Linyi do it like this

377
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,400
Come here, come on

378
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:36,920
Stand here

379
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Try one by one

380
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
Alright, come on

381
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,960
Come on

382
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,760
I'll go first

383
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,240
First one

384
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Come on

385
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,400
Go, contestant number one

386
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,440
Contestant number one

387
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,960
I can't do it

388
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,320
Come on, go

389
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,280
I love watching this

390
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,800
I like it

391
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,440
How is it

392
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,720
Is it a man

393
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm kind of

394
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,440
Go

395
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,000
Hurry

396
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
A bit soft and delicate

397
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,680
No

398
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,160
Just now, the two of us

399
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Because of the microphone

400
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,400
Didi made a sound just now

401
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,200
When I turned around, Didi

402
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,440
Ning bro

403
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,960
I can't do it

404
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Two compasses

405
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,560
These two

406
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,400
Alright, how do we do this

407
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
Let's rehearse together

408
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's

409
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,160
Let's start right away

410
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,040
Come on, music start

411
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Let's improvise

412
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,360
Ready, go

413
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,880
Add some expression

414
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,480
Like this, right

415
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes

416
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Like this

417
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,800
Sure.

418
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,480
Come on, everyone has danced before.

419
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,000
Why are we dressed like this today?

420
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Because this is Spain.

421
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
The one thing you can't miss.

422
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,520
The Flamenco dance experience.

423
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,640
Flamenco dance.

424
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,560
It's one of today's

425
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,160
most captivating dance styles.

426
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,560
It's a blend of Gypsy culture and

427
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,880
Andalusian folk traditions from Spain.

428
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,920
Flamenco

429
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
is not just singing, dancing, and guitar music

430
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
combined into one art form.

431
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,280
It also represents passion and generosity,

432
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,480
a bold and free-spirited lifestyle.

433
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,560
Let's welcome

434
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
our Flamenco teachers.

435
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,720
Here they come.

436
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,000
Hello, everyone.

437
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,880
Welcome.

438
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,720
Hi.

439
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,680
Hello.

440
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,840
Hi.

441
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,840
Hello, everyone.

442
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,160
My name is Yao Tianhui.

443
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I've been learning Flamenco

444
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,120
for fifteen years.

445
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,200
This is Yoel Vargas.

446
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,120
He won

447
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
the "Oscar" of Flamenco at age twenty.

448
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Now let me introduce our palmero.

449
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,480
Paul Martinez.

450
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,120
Female palmero, Nerea Dominguez.

451
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,320
She comes from a Flamenco family.

452
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,800
Singer, Eleazar Cerreduela.

453
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,400
He also comes from a Flamenco family.

454
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,640
He can play and sing.

455
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,440
Claudio Villanueva.

456
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,520
He has studied Flamenco guitar since childhood.

457
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,320
Thank you, everyone.

458
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's have our teachers

459
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
give us a short performance.

460
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,120
Very good.

461
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,760
Come on.

462
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
Teacher, please show us one

463
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,680
classic Flamenco move.

464
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,560
Now we

465
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,840
will teach everyone this

466
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,480
basic spinning technique.

467
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
This is the basic stance.

468
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,680
It's okay, I'll say it in Spanish.

469
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,080
This is our basic stance.

470
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,480
It doesn't stop.

471
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
You're twenty.

472
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,080
They're all over fifty.

473
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,280
This one.

474
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
She can do it.

475
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,720
Let her try.

476
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Let Wen show us.

477
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,320
Wen, come on. Wen.

478
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,080
My outfit is really something.

479
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:14,880
Careful.

480
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,640
Be safe.

481
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
Okay.

482
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,360
Beautiful.

483
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,680
Come on.

484
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,360
He.

485
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,120
That's good.

486
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,360
Go down.

487
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,320
Here, I'll do it.

488
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Uncle Nai.

489
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,560
You want to do it yourself.

490
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,800
Can you introduce yourself later?

491
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
We're moving on to the next part.

492
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,160
Come up yourself.

493
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,720
I'll do it.

494
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
Let me try.

495
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,120
If you want to play, play yourself.

496
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll show you how.

497
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,480
I'm not doing it again.

498
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,440
How do you do it?

499
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,320
How do you do it?

500
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,800
Look.

501
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
One dares to teach, one dares to learn.

502
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
The teacher is here.

503
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
Teacher, show us again.

504
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,280
Okay.

505
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,680
That's right.

506
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,080
Okay.

507
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,320
Okay.

508
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,320
Okay.

509
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,320
No.

510
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,200
Getting older.

511
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Don't push yourself too hard.

512
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,920
Help me out.

513
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Both revolving and rotating.

514
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,520
Right.

515
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,920
Come on.

516
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,000
Ladies,

517
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,960
pick your dance partner.

518
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
Finally, it's our turn to choose.

519
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,440
Aren't they going to fight for us?

520
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,680
Why aren't they trying to win us over?

521
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,160
Yeah.

522
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
They're just standing there.

523
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,600
Let them fight for it.

524
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,760
Come on.

525
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,000
You and your tricks.

526
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,720
From July to August,

527
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,280
it's crayfish season.

528
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Jin Jing,

529
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,640
change your last name.

530
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Make it "Leng" (cold).

531
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,000
Stay calm.

532
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,640
That's the finishing touch.

533
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,520
Bro, nice one.

534
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,400
But there are six guys.

535
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
Six guys, three pairs.

536
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,440
So three girls.

537
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,920
The rest will be guy-guy pairs.

538
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,280
I can imagine that.

539
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,720
I could pick two.

540
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,000
One on each side.

541
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,440
I want two as well.

542
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,080
Who wouldn't want two?

543
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,080
One is enough for me.

544
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,480
Alright.

545
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,080
You're still young.

546
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
Let the older girls go first.

547
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
Sorry, we're a bit old.

548
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,320
Talking about getting food stuck in your teeth.

549
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
Honestly, my heart already belongs to someone.

550
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,160
Who do you want to pick?

551
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,000
Da Ning.

552
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
Da Ning.

553
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,680
Da Ning.

554
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
What does that mean?

555
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,640
Want money?

556
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,080
Paso Doble?

557
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,280
It's not Paso Doble.

558
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,040
She was singing "Railway Guerrillas" just now.

559
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
We're all sharpshooters.

560
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,720
Every bullet takes down an enemy.

561
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,840
What are we doing?

562
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I've already chosen.

563
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm done picking.

564
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,960
Then I'll pick too.

565
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,800
I pick He bro.

566
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,040
I want to dance with my bro.

567
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,400
Sure.

568
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,960
What about Yuwen?

569
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,000
Yuwen, him.

570
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,520
Lin Yi.

571
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,440
Over here, teacher.

572
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,840
You have to pick a male partner.

573
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
Who would you pick first?

574
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,480
For this game,

575
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,600
me.

576
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,920
Then I'll stick with my student.

577
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,840
That works out for us.

578
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,640
The two of us are judges.

579
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,320
Judges.

580
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,000
No way.

581
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,920
The two with bad teeth have to dance together.

582
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,720
Let's see who's better.

583
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,160
If they dance, they'll both need dentures.

584
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,840
Naiwen, I love you.

585
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,680
Come on.

586
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:48,920
Let's go.

587
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,440
Everyone, join in.

588
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,080
Everyone, come on.

589
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,880
Come on.

590
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,080
Turn

591
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,200
The two start with a cold war.

592
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,040
Then they make up.

593
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,720
Time to switch dance partners.

594
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,040
Switch partners.

595
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,280
Switch partners.

596
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,360
Thank you.

597
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,280
Let's thank

598
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,800
our Flamenco dance teachers.

599
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,200
Thank you, everyone.

600
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,600
Thank you.

601
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,640
Thank you.

602
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,480
Very good.

603
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,240
Very good.

604
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,000
Very good.

605
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,440
Great job.

606
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,040
Everyone,

607
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,760
I believe you've experienced

608
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,040
the essence of Flamenco dance.

609
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,200
The next task

610
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,480
requires everyone to fully

611
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
show the charm of dance.

612
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,480
Since the girls are wearing these skirts,

613
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,520
it seems a bit inconvenient.

614
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,080
So let's take a break.

615
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,440
Let everyone change clothes.

616
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,080
Alright.

617
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,720
Okay, let's go.

618
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,560
Let's go.

619
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,000
Today's themed trip

620
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
will be a competition between three teams.

621
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,120
We'll try local specialty foods.

622
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,240
The losing team

623
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,880
will get a special experience.

624
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
Besides the usual foods in Madrid,

625
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
there are many niche dishes.

626
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,440
For those not used to them,

627
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,960
they might seem strange.

628
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,080
For example,

629
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,240
blood-cooked lamprey.

630
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,880
An eel with seven gills.

631
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,160
Is that tasty?

632
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,440
It sounds weird, but is it good?

633
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,720
If it's called weird, it's probably not

634
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,360
very tasty.

635
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,440
Spanish stew.

636
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,840
Do locals actually eat it?

637
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,440
They do.

638
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,600
Do many people eat it?

639
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,080
Yes, a lot.

640
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,240
So choosing your teammates

641
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,080
is crucial.

642
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,360
Pick someone who can eat to help out.

643
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,600
That's one strategy.

644
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,640
Bro He,

645
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,560
Are you the team's garbage disposal?

646
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,720
Come on.

647
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's start with the first

648
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,800
group task.

649
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
It's another big battle.

650
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,440
What dance is this?

651
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,560
Nine members

652
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,080
each pick a dance style name for themselves.

653
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,120
And create a matching dance move.

654
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
One member starts,

655
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,840
the two next to them join in.

656
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,280
First, shout your dance style.

657
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,200
Do the move three times,

658
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,000
then call out another member's style.

659
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
The member whose style is called

660
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
must respond immediately.

661
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,040
If you mess up the name or move, you're out.

662
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,320
The final winner

663
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,760
gets first pick of teammates.

664
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,960
Alright, got it.

665
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,800
That's easy.

666
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,640
This is fun.

667
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:43,720
Go ahead and pick.

668
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,120
Pick a name.

669
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,920
Pick a name first, right?

670
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,440
Pick a name first.

671
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,520
End it with "dance."

672
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,920
I'll pick one.

673
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,200
I'll be called

674
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,200
Diamond King Dance.

675
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,560
Diamond King Dance.

676
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,680
Bro Naiwen, your turn.

677
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,280
Next Year Fifty Dance.

678
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,560
I'm fifty-one.

679
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,120
African Parrot Dance

680
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,840
Okay

681
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm the useless dancer, is that alright?

682
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,600
I'm the useless dancer

683
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,440
You're the useless dancer

684
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Alright

685
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,200
Like this

686
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,640
That's fine

687
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,680
That's what I was thinking too

688
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,920
I'm the useless dancer

689
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,240
No, I'm the real useless dancer

690
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,160
We're even fighting over this

691
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,160
Keep playing music, keep dancing

692
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
This one's good

693
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,920
Do something seductive

694
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,280
Move

695
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,000
No one will choose yours

696
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,680
No one will pick hers

697
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,480
Yours is so hard

698
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,160
It's way too hard for three people to dance together

699
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
The two on the side could easily kick each other

700
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,160
Mine

701
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,280
Tonight, do the classic dance

702
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,400
Tonight, do the classic dance

703
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Tonight, do the classic dance

704
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,720
Then I'm the one

705
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,560
Crying Boohoo Dance

706
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,880
Crying Boohoo Dance works too

707
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,800
Diamond King Dance

708
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,280
African Parrot Dance

709
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,800
I'm the useless dancer

710
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,680
Hoeing Dance at Noon

711
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,880
Keep playing music, keep dancing

712
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
Honglei bro, like this

713
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,280
I've already thought it out for you

714
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,240
You just thought about the dance

715
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,960
That's fine

716
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,440
Thinking about the dance is fine

717
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,960
Show a move

718
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,600
What's the move?

719
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,880
Just thought about the dance

720
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,120
You just shook a little

721
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,080
That's what you did

722
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,080
Now let's officially begin

723
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,800
Let's go

724
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,880
Wait a second

725
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,840
I still don't get the rules

726
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Your task is

727
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Keep playing music and dancing

728
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,480
Then it's the Diamond King Dance

729
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,000
Just remember mine

730
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,880
You have to do this one

731
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
You have to do your own

732
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
And Xingxu's, you have to do that too

733
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
You don't need to do the others

734
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,760
I don't need to worry about it

735
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,280
Right

736
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,640
Just remember yours, mine, and his

737
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,440
Got it completely

738
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,080
Okay

739
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,440
Let's go

740
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,240
Start with Xingxu

741
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,120
Diamond King Dance

742
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
Diamond King Dance

743
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,880
Honglei bro, eliminated

744
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,840
Viewing spot

745
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,400
Facing the wall

746
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,200
Understood

747
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,760
Totally got it

748
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,560
Alright

749
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,080
So nervous

750
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
Even more nervous now

751
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,840
Because if I get eliminated again

752
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
I'll have to team up with Honglei bro

753
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,200
What are you doing?

754
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,320
What's this?

755
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,640
Already picked sides

756
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
Can we clear the area?

757
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,640
I want the area cleared for this round

758
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
Think about the Diamond King Dance

759
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,920
Think about the Diamond King Dance

760
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,280
Hoeing Dance at Noon

761
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
After Honglei bro finishes

762
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,440
Next should be Didi

763
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,280
Okay

764
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,080
Let's go

765
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,760
Three, two, one

766
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,120
Start

767
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,720
Play music and keep dancing

768
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,920
Wait a second

769
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,720
What did he say?

770
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,360
I couldn't keep up

771
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,600
No, that one

772
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,160
Xingxu, go find Honglei bro

773
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,480
Should I go?

774
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:17,880
Go ahead.

775
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,120
Go ahead.

776
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,920

What's up, Honglei bro?

810
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,480
What's really going on?

811
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
A true master.

812
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,680
All the advanced players are here.

Can't stand straight.

855
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
So dizzy.

856
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
He said, "I can't stand straight."

857
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,440
So dizzy.

858
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,800
So dizzy.

859
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,680
Come on.

860
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,000
That's it.

861
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,000
Go ahead.

862
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,680
I agree.

863
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:31,920
Go ahead.

864
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,040
Go ahead.

865
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,400
It's a do-or-die round.

866
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,800
Okay.

867
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,320
It's my turn, right?

868
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,680
One, two, three.

869
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:41,920
Go.

882
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,760
I'm eliminated.

883
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,520
What does "trapped in your own cocoon" mean?

884
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,720
Please, have a seat.

885
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
I want to give up.

886
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
I'm going to throw up, seriously.

887
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,880
I really need to throw up.

888
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Don't underestimate Chen He.

889
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,160
There's a reason he made it this far.

890
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,240
He can handle it.

891
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,600
Can you handle it?

892
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,080
Yes.

893
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,320
Come on, keep going.

894
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,800
Don't give him time to think.

895
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,560
Come on, let's start.

896
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,600
Tonight's Old Dance begins.

897
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,160
Let's go.

898
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,760
Three, two, one.

899
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,600

900
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,560

00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,720
One-Two-Three-Four Dance.

904
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,600
One-Two-Three-Four Dance.

905
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,480
One-Two-Three-Four Dance.

906
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,400
I can't do it anymore.

907
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,440
We need to split into three teams.

908
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,560
Two winners.

909
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,720
Rock, paper, scissors.

910
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,880
Winner picks teammates first.

911
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
Come on, rock, paper, scissors.

912
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

913
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,080
Okay.

914
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,640
You choose.

915
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll pick first, Jin Jing.

916
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,320
Come on.

917
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,880
That's unexpected.

918
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,920
That's unexpected.

919
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,560
Didn't see that coming.

920
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,280
Okay.

921
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,560
Then I'll pick Lin Yi.

922
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,080
Come on.

923
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,560
Then I'll pick He bro.

924
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,639
Yes.

925
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,239
Xing Xu.

926
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,679
I'm done picking.

927
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,360
Mom.

928
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,440
Mom.

929
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,800
Mom.

930
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,000
The old bull and young grass duo

931
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,960
So why did those three team up?

932
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,719
Because she picked them

933
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,360
What’s unclear about that?

934
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,560
Lin Yi and Xing Xu

935
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,120
Then the three of us are a team

936
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,080
So why were you so unhappy just now?

937
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,120
Bro, she wasn’t just unhappy a moment ago

938
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,000
She still hasn’t cheered up

939
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No, that’s not true

940
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,400
How could that be, Honglei bro?

941
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Uncle Honglei

942
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,280
Didi

943
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,320
So young and already wearing a mask

944
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,880
Really

945
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,320
Right before she said “no,”

946
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,000
she took a deep breath

947
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
No, I didn’t

948
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,760
I’m happy to be on their team

949
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
The two of us will treat you well

950
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,000
We’re definitely going to win

951
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
After the three teams are formed

952
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,320
we’ll start the Spanish food challenge

953
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,680
This food street in Madrid is famous

954
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
In this area of downtown Madrid

955
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,720
It’s perfect for city walks

956
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,080
It’s a popular way for travelers to explore

957
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,000
There are many century-old shops here

958
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,440
You can check in freely

959
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
You need to finish three food stops within the time limit

960
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,840
The team that loses

961
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,520
will have to try some niche dishes

962
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,880
So before you set off

963
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,120
you can come to me

964
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,960
to draw your random budget

965
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,080
I’ll take the one in the middle

966
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,680
I want this one

967
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,440
Alright, everyone.

968
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,640
Let’s toast together with Pulse.

969
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,360
Okay.

970
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,400
Spanish.

971
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Spanish.

972
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,040
Everyone.

973
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,160
Let’s go find some food now.

974
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,320
Let’s go, we’re heading out.

975
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,440
I’m hungry.

976
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,120
Eating happily is important.

977
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
I checked just now.

978
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,720
Looks like the three of us have the most money.

979
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,360
Yeah.

980
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,520
We should pool our money together.

981
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,720
Spread it out.

982
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,040
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

983
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,560
Don’t put them in one basket.

984
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
We could hide the money in our shoes.

985
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,080
Them.

986
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,440
They won’t steal it, right?

987
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,840
They wouldn’t do that.

988
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,400
I think so.

989
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,640
No, everyone just wants to eat.

990
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,880
Let me tell you.

991
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
With these two uncles,

992
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,960
You’ll be really happy.

993
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,360
Actually, I’m very happy.

994
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Honestly, I’m a bit sad inside right now.

995
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,120
I just found out.

996
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,800
You know, the two of us with you—

997
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,120
I really like you guys.

998
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,920
At that moment,

999
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
Maybe she hadn’t realized yet

1000
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,120
how happy it is to be with two uncles.

1001
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,520
You know?

1002
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,200
But if you think about it,

1003
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,480
this,

1004
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,440
it’s definitely a happy thing.

1005
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,800
Yeah.

1006
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,440
I get it now.

1007
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
The main thing is, we both have daughters.

1008
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Yes, that’s right.

1009
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,520
That’s what spoiling means.

1010
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,160
So I’m really happy.

1011
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,200
At least I’m not

1012
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
too stingy.

1013
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I should at least give

1014
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,240
five bucks for you to spend.

1015
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,880
Bro, you have sixty.

1016
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,040
And you’re saying you’ll give five?

1017
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,800
Naiwen, how much are you planning

1018
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,840
to give Didi to spend?

1019
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
I’ll give everything I have.

1020
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,200
For example?

1021
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,840
I’ve got forty.

1022
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,440
The three of us have 120, that’s enough.

1023
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,800
They only have sixty together.

1024
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That’s rough for them.

1025
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,880
I have thirty.

1026
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,640
Who doesn’t?

1027
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
We have fifty together.

1028
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,400
That’s not too little, right?

1029
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,160
Personally, I think

1030
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,480
we shouldn’t pick

1031
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,520
really expensive restaurants.

1032
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
I’ve already picked.

1033
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,920
Internet-famous places are expensive.

1034
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,520
Let’s not go to those places.

1035
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
That one’s tasty.

1036
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,160
Then let’s eat something good.

1037
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,880
I think we should just eat whatever we want.

1038
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Let’s not worry about that for now.

1039
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,920
Actually, those internet-famous places—

1040
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,680
I asked a local the other day,

1041
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,360
and they said

1042
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,800
you don’t have to go to those places.

1043
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,240
A lot of local spots

1044
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,200
are even tastier.

1045
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,640
Right?

1046
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,080
Yeah.

1047
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,440
Street food is fine too.

1048
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,360
Yeah.

1049
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,960
Show off your food.

1050
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,000
Let’s go.

1051
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,280
Let’s go.

1052
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,120
Madrid Old Street.

1053
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,840
It’s both commercial and relaxing.

1054
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,760
Cafés and restaurants line the street.

1055
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,960
Perfect for strolling day or night.

1056
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
The bronze plaques of century-old shops

1057
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,080
are one of the area’s highlights.

1058
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,280
Founded in 1916,

1059
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
San Miguel Market

1060
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,600
is Madrid’s most famous market.

1061
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,680
It gathers all kinds of Madrid delicacies.

1062
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,640
What’s wrong? You were so energetic dancing just now.

1063
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,120
Why are you tired now?

1064
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,560
It’s so hot today.

1065
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,480
Just a few moves and I’m thirsty and exhausted.

1066
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
It’s not just me.

1067
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,640
Even Xingxu and the others

1068
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,200
can’t handle it.

1069
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Grab a bottle of Pulse.

1070
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Pulse saves me.

1071
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,120
Drinking my old friend again.

1072
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,240
Check out the ingredients list.

1073
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,040
It’s got vitamin B and C, pretty good.

1074
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,480
Later, when we hit the food street,

1075
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,000
I’ll definitely win.

1076
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,800
For sure.

1077
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,320
Travel with Pulse, keep moving.

1078
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Food street, delicacies, champion.

1079
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,040
I guarantee it.

1080
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,320
Let’s go.

1081
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,480
This street is gorgeous.

1082
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,960
This place has food.

1083
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,280
Yeah, this one’s tasty, for sure.

1084
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,800
That stew.

1085
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,960
Is that the stew?

1086
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Seems like it.

1087
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,440
Two eggs, egg stew.

1088
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
Whatever, just order one.

1089
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,440
Order one.

1090
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,040
Order one.

1091
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,520
It’s mainly restaurants.

1092
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,560
None are open at this hour.

1093
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,480
Should we ask someone?

1094
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
Which place is open?

1095
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,960
Hello, friend.

1096
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,280
You won’t get arrested, right?

1097
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,960
Here they come.

1098
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,040
Hello, friend.

1099
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,240
You might scare people.

1100
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,200
Hello, friend.

1101
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,560
Nice, that’s a good pace.

1102
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,600
Hello, friend.

1103
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Hello, friend.

1104
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,920
Wait a second.

1105
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,360
Hello, friend.

1106
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,760
Do you mind?

1107
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,360
Okay.

1108
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,760
Thank you, have a wonderful day.

1109
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,600
Goodbye.

1110
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
It’s all tourists here.

1111
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,880
Can we find

1112
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,400
a more reliable-looking restaurant?

1113
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,440
Many places aren’t open.

1114
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,160
They probably open at night.

1115
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,360
Most are closed in the afternoon.

1116
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,760
They have set hours, right?

1117
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,640
Eight o’clock.

1118
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,920
Open from 8:15.

1119
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,880
Until midnight.

1120
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,920
I’m already hungry.

1121
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,000
If I don’t eat soon, I’ll lose weight.

1122
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,520
Seriously.

1123
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,240
This place looks

1124
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,440
Let’s go in.

1125
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,880
Where’s the entrance?

1126
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,360
This way.

1127
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,800
Hello, friend.

1128
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,480
Can we sit here?

1129
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,120
Is that okay?

1130
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,040
But it’s closed today.

1131
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,080
Boss, Your Majesty, he’s messing with you.

1132
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,920
Messing with me?

1133
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,480
Why?

1134
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,520
This place has food.

1135
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,600
Is it open?

1136
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
It’s open.

1137
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,000
Sorry.

1138
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,280
This one.

1139
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,440
Fried croquettes.

1140
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,920
Yes.

1141
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,640
Fried croquettes.

1142
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,320
Okay.

1143
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,440
Thank you.

1144
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,400
Thank you.

1145
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,240
Thank you.

1146
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,240
That was fast.

1147
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Smells great.

1148
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,160
Tastes good.

1149
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,400
It instantly awakened my taste buds.

1150
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,040
Or we could just stay here.

1151
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,800
And eat more.

1152
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,440
Crispy outside, rich inside.

1153
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,880
Yeah.

1154
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,920
There's ham wrapped inside.

1155
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,440
And that cheese.

1156
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
They made it into a filling.

1157
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,760
So it's soft inside.

1158
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,720
Excuse me.

1159
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,520
What is this?

1160
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,800
Padron peppers.

1161
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,160
That's right, I'll have one.

1162
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,840
Here you go.

1163
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,280
Sorry.

1164
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,600
How much is it?

1165
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,600
You want a sausage?

1166
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,600
A sausage like that one?

1167
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,120
Yes, that's the one.

1168
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,480
The whole thing.

1169
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,200
These are pan-fried Padron peppers, right?

1170
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,720
How do they make it like this?

1171
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,960
Some parts are charred, some are really tender.

1172
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,120
Let me see how this sausage compares to ours.

1173
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,240
What's the difference from Harbin red sausage?

1174
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,360
Is there a difference?

1175
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,520
Honestly, it's pretty similar.

1176
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,160
Very similar.

1177
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,040
But this one has a bit of sourness.

1178
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,960
It's so tasty.

1179
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,000
Is it that place?

1180
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,920
Yeah.

1181
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,680
Let's sit on this side, the three of us.

1182
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,280
Menu.

1183
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,160
Can I have the menu, please?

1184
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,720
Sure.

1185
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,280
Thank you.

1186
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,400
I researched this place before.

1187
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,440
This is the one.

1188
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,400
Lobster rice.

1189
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,040
One lobster rice, please.

1190
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,080
And one oxtail, please.

1191
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,880
Just fish with scrambled eggs.

1192
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,680
Change it to the Iberian ham croquettes.

1193
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,160
Thanks.

1194
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,000
Look.

1195
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,400
Hello.

1196
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,440
Hi.

1197
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,400
Hey everyone, we're at this

1198
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,560
restaurant right now.

1199
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,680
And then,

1200
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,880
we're eating.

1201
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,000
We're about to try some local Spanish

1202
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,920
delicious dishes.

1203
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,560
What dishes?

1204
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,840
You two, don't—

1205
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,360
You two are like Conan.

1206
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,120
What dishes?

1207
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,080
What did we just ask about?

1208
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,640
Lin Yi.

1209
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,720
Strike our pose.

1210
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,120
I think you're up to something.

1211
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,480
Wait, the food's coming.

1212
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,520
Iberian ham croquettes.

1213
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,160
This one.

1214
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,920
This dish is tough.

1215
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,520
There's also squid.

1216
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
This dish is really tough.

1217
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,960
Let's eat after we finish filming.

1218
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,600
Okay, you take it.

1219
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,120
Wait.

1220
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,120
Are you filming?

1221
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,720
What's wrong if I film?

1222
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,160
Can't I film, teacher?

1223
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,000
Then let Lin Yi film.

1224
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,040
Okay, Lin Yi will film.

1225
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,960
I'm a professional photographer.

1226
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,920
He's a professional landscape photographer.

1227
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,480
What are you filming?

1228
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,040
This angle is great.

1229
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,920
Like this.

1230
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,480
Yeah, like that.

1231
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,000
Why don't I trust him?

1232
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,760
I don't trust him either.

1233
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,240
This is wild.

1234
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,760
Seriously, this is wild.

1235
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,440
Look up.

1236
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,320
Okay.

1237
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,400
Can I trust you?

1238
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:01,960
Nope.

1239
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,640
There are five ham croquettes in total.

1240
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,720
I'm the sixth one.

1241
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,600
He's filming from the ham's point of view.

1242
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,440
She's the sixth ham croquette.

1243
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,520
Lines and composition.

1244
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Move aside.

1245
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,920
Let the audience eat first.

1246
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,600
Audience eats first.

1247
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,800
Look.

1248
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,960
Inside this,

1249
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,840
there's cheese and ham.

1250
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,720
Look at Xingxu's face,

1251
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,120
it's delicious.

1252
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,560
I'm going to try a squid.

1253
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,080
Squid tentacle.

1254
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,760
This is tasty.

1255
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,040
It's really authentic.

1256
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,000
That charcoal-grilled squid flavor.

1257
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,240
This is good.

1258
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,800
This one's not bad.

1259
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:49,680
Come on.

1260
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,760
For our

1261
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,960
friendship, cheers!

1262
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,840
The three of us need to pool our money.

1263
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,520
Alright.

1264
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,240
Bro, can I keep ten?

1265
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:04,760
No, you can't.

1266
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,320
Bro, I only have twenty.

1267
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,760
No.

1268
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,280
Still no.

1269
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,760
Here.

1270
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,320
Sorry, I'm a bit stingy.

1271
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,640
Give it to the poor kid.

1272
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,040
We have a total of 120.

1273
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,880
120.

1274
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,400
Okay.

1275
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,000
Alright.

1276
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,640
Should we ask a local?

1277
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,560
Let's ask where we can buy the dish we need.

1278
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,320
Let's ask this lady.

1279
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,240
I think that's good.

1280
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,360
Okay.

1281
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:23,840
Hello.

1282
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,040
Paella.

1283
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,920
Can you recommend a place?

1284
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,760
Good paella is probably over there.

1285
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,280
Thank you.

1286
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:30,840
Okay.

1287
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,600
Thanks.

1288
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,640
Did you understand?

1289
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,240
Yeah, let's go.

1290
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,800
Thank you.

1291
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,560
Alright, goodbye.

1292
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,320
Uncle.

1293
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,720
Hong.

1294
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,080
Wait a second.

1295
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,840
Uncle's gone.

1296
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Didi didn't want to team up with me earlier.

1297
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,040
I'm going to tease her.

1298
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,560
A little payback.

1299
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,520
The three of us are a team.

1300
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,640
Then why were you upset just now?

1301
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,520
He ran off with the money.

1302
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,120
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

1303
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,640
See, he betrayed us.

1304
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,880
This uncle is so bad.

1305
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,840
What should we do?

1306
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,480
Where are they?

1307
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,840
But he still has to eat with us.

1308
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,200
I'm so mad it's funny.

1309
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,760
Where did he go?

1310
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,160
Didi.

1311
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,600
He's definitely inside.

1312
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,480
Really?

1313
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,960
Now we...

1314
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,840
Now we actually have another task.

1315
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,320
Yeah.

1316
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,480
We have to find our teammate.

1317
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,960
And my eyesight isn't great.

1318
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,840
I'll go look for someone else now.

1319
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,600
Should I form another team?

1320
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,040
I'll call Wen.

1321
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,000
Honglei bro.

1322
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,520
Wen, do you guys have enough money?

1323
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,960
We don't have any money, bro.

1324
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,520
I've got plenty of money here.

1325
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
Are you planning to treat us?

1326
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,360
Can you lend us some?

1327
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,440
The problem is, I have too much money.

1328
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,480
I think

1329
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,760
I'll form a new team.

1330
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,080
Send me your location.

1331
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,720
Okay.

1332
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,680
Anyway, if you need me,

1333
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,480
just call me.

1334
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
We do, bro.

1335
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,040
Come over right now.

1336
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,160
What do you mean?

1337
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,920
No idea.

1338
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,720
Based on your previous

1339
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,440
recordings,

1340
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,240
anything could happen at any time.

1341
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,080
Is it possible

1342
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,400
the three of them split up?

1343
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,080
So from the start,

1344
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,800
they were scheming against each other.

1345
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,720
Let me analyze this.

1346
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
I don't think it's scheming.

1347
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,840
They probably teamed up.

1348
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,320
Each person joined a different team.

1349
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,520
Then

1350
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,080
freeloaded.

1351
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,160
Spent their money.

1352
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,360
Ate and drank for free.

1353
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,520
People's brains

1354
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,920
How can they be this clever?

1355
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,440
After eating,

1356
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:04,960
right?

1357
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,840
But how will they finish the task?

1358
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:08,680
Yeah.

1359
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,400
Is it possible

1360
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,360
one person does the task?

1361
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:18,880
Look,

1362
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,080
Didi hasn't said anything.

1363
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:20,760
So Didi

1364
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,360
we haven't seen her.

1365
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:21,920
Right.

1366
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,400
So Didi probably has the money.

1367
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,040
She took all the money to do the task.

1368
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,280
Naiwen bro went to that team.

1369
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,840
He joined He bro's team.

1370
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,120
Then Honglei bro decided to come to us.

1371
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,280
Things

1372
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,280
are very likely

1373
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,520
Really?

1374
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,000
Very likely.

1375
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,160
are getting weird.

1376
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,360
Don't trust Honglei bro.

1377
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,720
Don't trust Honglei bro.

1378
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,800
Don't trust Honglei bro.

1379
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,240
I should go back and lead them.

1380
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,280
Bro, where did you go?

1381
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,480
Get the money back first.

1382
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,040
I'm just messing with you.

1383
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,360
Bro, I won't trust you anymore.

1384
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,320
Give him the money first.

1385
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,720
I didn't bring it.

1386
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,400
Then how did you

1387
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,280
How could you pull it out of my pocket?

1388
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,600
It's impossible to keep it on me.

1389
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,840
Your money—

1390
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,000
Where did you put your money?

1391
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,840
I definitely put it somewhere else.

1392
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,840
Did you donate it?

1393
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,800
Are we still a team now?

1394
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:11,880
Not anymore.

1395
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,400
Then I'm leaving.

1396
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:12,880
Wait a second.

1397
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,520
Wait.

1398
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,240
Wait.

1399
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,480
Bro, how could you do this to us?

1400
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,360
Let you taste what it's like to betray us.

1401
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,000
What? Who betrayed whom?

1402
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,160
She betrayed us.

1403
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,440
She picked us out.

1404
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,240
And suffered for a while.

1405
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,720
Do you remember?

1406
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,720
So I'm just here watching the drama, right?

1407
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,400
Yeah.

1408
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,960
Playing Go Fighting, huh?

1409
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,240
Here you go.

1410
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,280
Take it.

1411
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,320
It's right here.

1412
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
So that's how it is.

1413
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,920
Honglei bro, let me tell you.

1414
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,880
Now the money's in my pocket.

1415
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,360
So,

1416
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,520
you have to listen to me now.

1417
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,240
Alright.

1418
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:51,720
Is that okay?

1419
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,280
Okay.

1420
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:52,640
Let's go.

1421
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,400
Forget what happened before.

1422
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,120
Didi.

1423
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,040
It's fine.

1424
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,040
I've got all the money.

1425
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,520
I trust Didi.

1426
00:49:59,520 --> 00:49:59,840
Come on.

1427
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,240
Alright, let's head out.

1428
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,880
Let's go.

1429
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,480
Goodbye.

1430
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,200
Bye.

1431
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,880
See you.

1432
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,480
Have a nice day.

1433
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,400
Goodbye.

1434
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:11,680
Bye.

1435
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,240
Perfect.

1436
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:12,720
Bye-bye.

1437
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,840
Thank you.

1438
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,280
Is this a restaurant?

1439
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,440
This one seems more reliable.

1440
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,080
Yes.

1441
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,200
Just like this, a roadside one.

1442
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,800
Ham shop.

1443
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,480
What? Ham shop?

1444
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,600
There's a ham shop here.

1445
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,080
Hello.

1446
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,360
Three people?

1447
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,040
Three.

1448
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,680
Is outside okay?

1449
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,160
Outside.

1450
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,280
Yes, outside.

1451
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,800
Right.

1452
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,480
Just speak Chinese directly.

1453
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,920
We'll choose.

1454
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,520
Can we order this?

1455
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,320
Of course.

1456
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,240
Let's get one to try.

1457
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,600
We have to get it, have to eat.

1458
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,360
Gotta eat.

1459
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,200
Spanish seafood rice.

1460
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,800
I have Valencian-style seafood rice.

1461
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,000
Okay, I'll have the seafood rice.

1462
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,760
One seafood rice.

1463
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,360
Sit anywhere.

1464
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,680
Thank you.

1465
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,440
Did you order just now?

1466
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:56,840
Yes, I did.

1467
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,640
Ordered seafood rice and ham.

1468
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,960
Anything else? Let's order more.

1469
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,920
What about soup?

1470
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,040
No soup.

1471
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,480
Why don't we go inside and see what they have?

1472
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,160
Order two.

1473
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,480
Yeah, that's fine.

1474
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,280
Can you understand this?

1475
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,080
Try using translation on this.

1476
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,760
Then you try.

1477
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,600
How do you translate it?

1478
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,640
This.

1479
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,840
Okay.

1480
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,920
Brave potatoes.

1481
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,640
Brave.

1482
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,360
Curry chicken sauce with rice.

1483
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,880
Spiced chewy bites.

1484
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,800
You don't have this? Thanks.

1485
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,320
This looks like some kind of stew rice.

1486
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,280
Curry, curry rice.

1487
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,680
Maybe it's just curry rice.

1488
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,600
Curry chicken rice.

1489
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,960
So, one of this.

1490
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,480
And one seafood rice.

1491
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,240
Any recommendations?

1492
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,800
Fried squid.

1493
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,720
Should I eat this? I'm not sure I can handle it.

1494
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,160
Alright, I can do it.

1495
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,280
You can do it.

1496
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,560
Whatever, I can handle this.

1497
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,640
Don't you think it's a small portion?

1498
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,280
That one.

1499
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,200
Really?

1500
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,760
How do you normally eat this?

1501
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,560
Wrap it.

1502
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,120
Eat it wrapped.

1503
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,960
Yeah, wrap it with cheese.

1504
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,600
Tasty, this cheese is so fragrant.

1505
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,520
You did it again.

1506
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,360
Whether you want to or not, you have to do it.

1507
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,520
You can do it all.

1508
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,280
Do everything.

1509
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,440
If you can't finish, just pack it up.

1510
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,560
I can do anything.

1511
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,000
I think some people might not like this.

1512
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,280
Because it's undercooked rice.

1513
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,480
Undercooked rice, yeah.

1514
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,560
Let me describe the taste of this dish.

1515
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,960
So, what is it like?

1516
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,520
Have you ever made yellow croaker at home?

1517
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,480
Like braised yellow croaker.

1518
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,000
Rice soaked in that fish soup.

1519
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,760
That's the taste.

1520
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,320
This is squid.

1521
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,800
Try one.

1522
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:56,560
You don't want it?

1523
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,600
Aren't you eating?

1524
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,720
We have to finish everything.

1525
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Or should we pack it up?

1526
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,760
Finish it or pack it up?

1527
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,280
Do you guys want some?

1528
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,280
This is really tasty.

1529
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,440
Let me get you some.

1530
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,280
I'll get you one with cheese and ham.

1531
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:32,680
How about it?

1532
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,800
I'll make one for you myself.

1533
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,840
Let me make one.

1534
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,760
Here, let me make one.

1535
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,160
Come on, bro, help me out.

1536
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,760
Have one.

1537
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,680
Seriously, have one.

1538
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,960
Today, you're my cousin, okay?

1539
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:44,920
Come on, hurry.

1540
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,560
I really can't eat anymore.

1541
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,160
Help me out, quick.

1542
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,240
Come on.

1543
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,320
Cousin.

1544
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:50,880
Cousin doesn't want it.

1545
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,680
What does cousin like?

1546
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,000
What does cousin like to eat?

1547
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,080
Cousin, eat this.

1548
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,440
Cousin, you like this, right?

1549
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,680
Here, cousin.

1550
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,280
Cousin (female).

1551
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,360
Help me out.

1552
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,400
Help me out.

1553
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:04,840
Hurry.

1554
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,040
Cousin has already done enough.

1555
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:06,760
Come on, cousin.

1556
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,200
Cousin.

1557
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,480
Come on.

1558
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,720
More?

1559
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,400
Eat a bit more.

1560
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,840
That's enough.

1561
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,440
We need to have a...

1562
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,200
Because for this meal...

1563
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,440
The actual amount we spent...

1564
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,200
The three of us pooled together.

1565
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,840
Honestly...

1566
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,720
Yeah.

1567
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,240
Even paying for this meal is tough.

1568
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,480
I feel like I can't afford it.

1569
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,040
So I hope...

1570
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,440
We get a chance like this.

1571
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,440
To be able to...

1572
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,160
Play a little game.

1573
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,800
Let's play a game.

1574
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,560
So polite.

1575
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,320
So polite.

1576
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,160
I just want a free meal.

1577
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:38,720
Challenge.

1578
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,600
Eat for free.

1579
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,760
Pay the bill for us.

1580
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,520
Treat us.

1581
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,560
How many people just walked by?

1582
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,400
If you get it wrong...

1583
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,640
You have to accept a punishment.

1584
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:47,640
Okay.

1585
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,920
Speak in a squeaky voice.

1586
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,400
Keep it up for three minutes.

1587
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Okay, sure.

1588
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,880
That's fine.

1589
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,160
Worst case, we just keep talking like that.

1590
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:53,960
One person.

1591
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,520
One person.

1592
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,640
Okay.

1593
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:56,920
Okay.

1594
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,520
Let's start now.

1595
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,000
It's starting.

1596
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,240
Time to witness a miracle.

1597
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,000
The moment to witness a miracle has arrived.

1598
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,480
What happened?

1599
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,720
It looked like three people just passed by.

1600
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,920
No idea.

1601
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,520
Don't feel embarrassed.

1602
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,720
If it doesn't work, just stretch your philtrum.

1603
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,120
Pretend to be Li Naiwen.

1604
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,080
Pretend to be Li Naiwen.

1605
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,080
I'm Li Naiwen.

1606
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm Li Naiwen.

1607
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,120
I'm Li Naiwen.

1608
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,880
A real man needs dignity.

1609
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,520
I'm Bro He.

1610
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,720
You're Chen He.

1611
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,960
Brilliant.

1612
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,120
You're even more brilliant than Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

1613
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Brilliant.

1614
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,360
Hey bro.

1615
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,560
Sorry.

1616
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,160
What happened just now?

1617
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,880
Did I say anything just now?

1618
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,360
I don't know.

1619
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:52,760
I don't know.

1620
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,120
I was just eating.

1621
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,440
I've been eating the whole time.

1622
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,680
I didn't say a word during this meal.

1623
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,400
Eating is pure enjoyment.

1624
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,280
Need some dignity.

1625
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,360
Keep challenging.

1626
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,240
Paying the bill isn't an option today.

1627
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,840
Today I'm a tyrannosaurus.

1628
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,200
It's awkward to take from others.

1629
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,560
Today our hands are especially short.

1630
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,400
We're three tyrannosauruses.

1631
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,160
We're tyrannosauruses.

1632
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,440
Short mouths, short hands.

1633
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:10,960
Yeah.

1634
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,480
Just eating and drinking your stuff.

1635
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:12,840
How about this.

1636
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,760
Let's use that.

1637
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,280
The thing Xingxu is best at.

1638
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,000
What is it?

1639
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,640
Dancing or singing?

1640
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,000
Balancing bottles.

1641
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,520
Balancing bottles.

1642
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,720
When did that happen, bro?

1643
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,280
I'm the king of bottle balancing.

1644
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,000
Alright.

1645
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,920
Never lost.

1646
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,600
I'm really good.

1647
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,400
Just for now.

1648
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,520
Just shut up.

1649
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,200
Officially.

1650
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,120
Okay.

1651
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,320
Xingxu.

1652
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:46,760
Get started.

1653
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,160
Use Li Naiwen's technique.

1654
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,440
Stretch your philtrum.

1655
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:49,960
Together.

1656
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,560
We're Li Naiwen.

1657
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,640
We just succeeded.

1658
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,560
We're Li Naiwen.

1659
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:55,960
Nope.

1660
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,200
Alright.

1661
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,200
One person squats and pretends to be a cat, meowing.

1662
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,920
The other person.

1663
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,240
This is super gross.

1664
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,720
Such a cute little kitty.

1665
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,360
Easy.

1666
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,600
Such a cute little kitty.

1667
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:14,840
Okay.

1668
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,080
Okay.

1669
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,800
Alright.

1670
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,080
Thanks, bro.

1671
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,200
Thanks, bro.

1672
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,680
Thanks, bro.

1673
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,920
Okay.

1674
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,320
Let's keep challenging.

1675
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,360
Three, two, one, go.

1676
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,120
I'm the cutest big dummy on Earth.

1677
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:35,960
Last time.

1678
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:36,480
Come on.

1679
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,160
Start.

1680
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,760
Okay, again.

1681
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,360
Guess the next license plate at this intersection.

1682
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,000
It must have which number?

1683
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,400
Okay.

1684
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,240
I want to pick seven.

1685
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,560
It's seven.

1686
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,400
Eight.

1687
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,320
Eight.

1688
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Or maybe nine.

1689
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,000
Okay, none.

1690
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,200
Bubble voice.

1691
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,960
What should we do?

1692
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,240
We're just three unlucky guys.

1693
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,520
Thank you.

1694
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,880
Thank you.

1695
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,280
Thank you.

1696
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,400
Mission accomplished.

1697
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
You’re beautiful.

1698
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,200
Shall we change places first?

1699
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,440
So pretty.

1700
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,040
Looks great.

1701
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,160
Let’s go.

1702
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,520
Look, that wall is beautiful.

1703
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,520
Live here.

1704
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,400
Look how pretty this little building is.

1705
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,200
This pink one.

1706
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah, this one is so nice.

1707
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,840
Yeah.

1708
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,320
This place, here.

1709
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,800
Naiwen, this place is really delicious.

1710
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:54,880
Okay.

1711
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,560
Let’s drink the soup first.

1712
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,480
Why do I feel like the two of us

1713
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,680
are taking a kid out to eat?

1714
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,160
A couple.

1715
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,920
Still a couple.

1716
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,880
So you’re the wife, I’m the husband.

1717
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,560
What the heck?

1718
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,920
Flamenco is still around today, right?

1719
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,840
That’s right.

1720
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,200
A family of three.

1721
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,000
So happy.

1722
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,680
I have two dads.

1723
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,320
Come on.

1724
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,680
Let’s take a family photo.

1725
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,760
The three of us are living happily.

1726
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,560
I feel so domestic right now.

1727
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:33,880
Thank you.

1728
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,640
Thank you.

1729
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,200
Thank you.

1730
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:36,960
Delicious.

1731
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,120
Come.

1732
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,560
Come.

1733
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,400
Are you from China?

1734
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,200
I love you.

1735
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,240
Okay.

1736
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,720
You know.

1737
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,520
Thank you.

1738
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,280
Do you know him?

1739
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,600
I know him.

1740
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,960
I live in China.

1741
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,080
I like him.

1742
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,560
You have overseas fans.

1743
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,080
Alright.

1744
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,440
Come to China.

1745
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,120
Here.

1746
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,280
He’s very famous.

1747
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,040
Okay, sure.

1748
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,080
She’s your fan.

1749
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,720
Very impressive.

1750
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,280
She says you’re amazing at acting and singing.

1751
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,640
I hope to meet you again next time.

1752
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,400
Thank you.

1753
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,160
Thank you.

1754
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,920
Thank you so much.

1755
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,440
Thank you so much.

1756
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,960
Thank you.

1757
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,120
Opened in 1868.

1758
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,800
So cool.

1759
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,320
Like this.

1760
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,000
A special bronze plaque at the entrance.

1761
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,320
It’s the mark of Madrid’s century-old shops.

1762
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,480
And a symbol of honor.

1763
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,760
Madrid has many century-old shops.

1764
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,680
Behind them is

1765
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,440
generations of family dedication and tradition.

1766
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,560
Botín restaurant on this street

1767
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,080
was certified by Guinness World Records

1768
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,840
as one of the oldest restaurants in the world.

1769
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,800
It’s been around for 300 years.

1770
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,520
Hemingway once visited here.

1771
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,960
And wrote about it in his novel.

1772
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,080
This restaurant has what you want to order.

1773
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,040
Cold tomato soup.

1774
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,520
Then let’s

1775
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,200
just order directly.

1776
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,760
You have overseas fans.

1777
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,600
You’re awesome, Liu Yuning.

1778
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,640
Boss, boss, you’re doing well!

1779
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,560
Cold tomato soup.

1780
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,240
This is ours.

1781
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,040
Thank you.

1782
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,640
Thank you.

1783
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,360
Thank you.

1784
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:08,880
Thank you.

1785
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,640
This looks tasty.

1786
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,400
I don’t think so.

1787
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,080
You try a bite.

1788
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,760
I’ll try one.

1789
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,440
I think it should be fine.

1790
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,560
This is it.

1791
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,480
It's some salad dressing used for mixed salads.

1792
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,040
You know what I mean.

1793
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:28,800
Water was added.

1794
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,680
Mixed together.

1795
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,280
That's too much, I warn you.

1796
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,320
Hehe.

1797
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,400
Way too much.

1798
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,120
Can you do it?

1799
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,720
I can do it.

1800
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:52,880
Give it a try.

1801
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,120
Describe it.

1802
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,760
This is that salad dressing.

1803
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,120
It got watery in the fridge.

1804
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,920
And it has a fridge smell.

1805
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,040
It's weird.

1806
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,760
Right?

1807
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,920
Let me tell you what it tastes like.

1808
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,000
It tastes like the fridge, right?

1809
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,560
No.

1810
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,400
Have you ever had smashed cucumber at home?

1811
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,600
The kind mixed with garlic.

1812
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,160
I've had it.

1813
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,480
It tastes like that.

1814
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,120
They're here.

1815
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,800
Let them try this.

1816
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,840
Hello.

1817
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,440
What a coincidence.

1818
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,280
Hi, everyone.

1819
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,640
Please have some soup.

1820
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,400
Try some soup.

1821
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,760
What is this?

1822
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,000
Cold tomato soup.

1823
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,360
It's really refreshing.

1824
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,160
Perfect for hot weather.

1825
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,000
It's great for cooling off.

1826
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:46,800
Yeah, you have to drink big sips.

1827
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,280
Big sips.

1828
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,680
Small sips don't work, you can't taste it.

1829
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,680
Is it good?

1830
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,640
Isn't it refreshing?

1831
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,640
It's tangy.

1832
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,440
Yeah.

1833
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,560
It's really good.

1834
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,560
Let me try a sip.

1835
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,160
You're just holding the bowl like that, bro.

1836
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,120
You're drinking straight from the bowl.

1837
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,680
Drink from the bowl.

1838
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,200
Take a sip.

1839
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,040
Yeah, have a sip.

1840
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,280
Take a sip.

1841
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:03,920
Did you finish it?

1842
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,560
No need to finish.

1843
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,280
No need to finish, here.

1844
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,520
Tastes good.

1845
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,520
Do you want to try it?

1846
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,360
Does that mean it's bad?

1847
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,280
Are people's tastes really that different?

1848
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,280
Those two aren't picky at all.

1849
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,760
Everything they eat is "so good, so good."

1850
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,880
It's really tasty.

1851
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,320
Mainly because it's cold, it's chilled.

1852
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,760
He finished it.

1853
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,800
He finished it.

1854
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,560
Thanks, Xingxu.

1855
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,320
Actually, we didn't mean for you to finish it.

1856
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,400
We just wanted you to taste it.

1857
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,800
But you boldly finished it.

1858
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,280
Xingxu, if your group

1859
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,720
is the last to finish all the dishes,

1860
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,160
you'll have to eat weird food tonight.

1861
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Weird food, not even dogs

1862
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,280
would eat it.

1863
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,360
You'll be eating weird food.

1864
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,960
The three of us have no money.

1865
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,160
And no dignity.

1866
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,880
What did you just play? You all lost?

1867
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,480
We just played this game.

1868
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,960
Never won.

1869
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,360
That's how we play games.

1870
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,000
So you always have to speak in a funny voice.

1871
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,320
Really?

1872
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,880
Sometimes a squeaky voice.

1873
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,760
Sometimes a bubbly voice.

1874
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,200
We're already crazy.

1875
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,320
So entertaining.

1876
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,360
We came to this restaurant for pig ears.

1877
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,240
Alright, friends.

1878
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,360
So as winners,

1879
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,640
we'll leave first.

1880
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,280
Okay, you guys eat.

1881
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,400
We'll leave the battlefield to you.

1882
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,880
Let's head out.

1883
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,560
Bye.

1884
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,400
I've never seen this before.

1885
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,800
The whole pig ear is here.

1886
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,520
Let me slice it for you.

1887
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,480
Let me slice it for you. Here.

1888
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:55,880
Give it to me.

1889
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,400
This.

1890
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,760
It's really crunchy.

1891
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,000
It has earwax.

1892
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,280
Bro.

1893
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,120
All my mental preparation is gone.

1894
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,040
Let me try. What does it taste like?

1895
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,400
I ate the eardrum.

1896
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,000
It's actually pretty good.

1897
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,400
Savory and salty.

1898
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,520
How can it be salty?

1899
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,000
It sweated.

1900
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,480
Of course it's salty.

1901
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,560
Why don't you try it?

1902
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,600
Did it sweat?

1903
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,400
It's not about sweating.

1904
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,120
Why is it salty?

1905
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,240
Do you know what this is for?

1906
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,120
There’s ear hair too.

1907
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,520
Ear hair.

1908
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,720
Is this edible?

1909
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,600
You can eat it.

1910
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,720
Didn't I just eat it?

1911
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,760
Ear hair.

1912
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,200
This is really something else.

1913
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,640
So tough.

1914
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,280
It's just tough.

1915
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,000
Seriously, these two are fitness gods.

1916
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
They have no sense of taste.

1917
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,960
They can eat anything.

1918
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,280
Anything is fine for them.

1919
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,280
Let's take on the challenge.

1920
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:11,840
Let's pay first.

1921
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,520
Okay, let's pay first. Here.

1922
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,800
Ready, go.

1923
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,040
Earth Squad, super fresh.

1924
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,080
Look.

1925
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,200
Earth Squad, super fresh.

1926
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,600
Here, let me do it.

1927
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,160
No way we'll lose this time.

1928
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,560
Earth Squad, super fresh.

1929
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,680
How can someone lose all day?

1930
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,760
I get it, I need to stand up.

1931
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,520
Earth Squad, super fresh.

1932
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,000
We really have nothing.

1933
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,080
Can't win the game either.

1934
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,720
No money either.

1935
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,600
Let's go buy some fried dough sticks.

1936
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:08,760
Let's go.

1937
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,800
This is the dish.

1938
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,040
Then we can do it.

1939
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:16,920
Seafood paella.

1940
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,560
Okay, thank you.

1941
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,840
Did we fill up our dishes?

1942
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,080
We won.

1943
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:24,920
Not necessarily.

1944
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,920
They definitely lost.

1945
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,120
We're second place.

1946
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,760
Because they have no money.

1947
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,520
Guys.

1948
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:38,840
Bro, lend me some.

1949
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,280
We already...

1950
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,440
...lost completely.

1951
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,000
Unbelievable.

1952
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,040
Over here.

1953
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,240
Big villain.

1954
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,360
What?

1955
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,600
I just knew about that video.

1956
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,680
He asked where we are.

1957
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,080
We sent him our location.

1958
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:53,640
He said it's too far.

1959
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,080
Let's leave this family.

1960
01:07:59,360 --> 01:07:59,840
Divorce.

1961
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,560
Wait a second.

1962
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,480
Divorce.

1963
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,400
We have to divorce. This marriage is over.

1964
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,520
We still need to split the assets.

1965
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,600
It's all ours.

1966
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,080
All the money's in my pocket.

1967
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,160
Then let's go.

1968
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:07,560
Let's go.

1969
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,440
Thirty-nine sixty.

1970
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,080
Please pay.

1971
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,279
You can't leave.

1972
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:32,040
You have to stay and pay the bill, hurry up.

1973
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:32,920
No.

1974
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,920
Don't.

1975
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,880
Skipping out on the bill, leaving.

1976
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,680
Now it's finally balanced.

1977
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,479
Balanced now, right?

1978
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:44,680
It's time to let him win once, isn't it?

1979
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,319
I'm doing this for you, "Mom."

1980
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,520
Good thing you kept up this time.

1981
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:50,840
Yeah.

1982
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:52,200
Luckily, I reacted fast.

1983
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,399
How did bro Honglei react?

1984
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,720
This is life.

1985
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,439
This is the cycle.

1986
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,000
Bro, if you want to leave this place,

1987
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,680
that's fine.

1988
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,520
There's a song called "Madrid Mystery."

1989
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,479
Later, you have to recite its lyrics passionately in public.

1990
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:12,439
The lyrics of this song.

1991
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:18,720
Bro.

1992
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,319
What's wrong?

1993
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:20,160
What's wrong, bro?

1994
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,160
Need help?

1995
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,120
Give me a look.

1996
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,520
Awesome.

1997
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,279
He's really into it.

1998
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,560
He's really into it.

1999
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,680
To

2000
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,319
my wife

2001
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,319
Naiwen

2002
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,680
my daughter

2003
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,560
Ouyang Didi

2004
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,080
Performer

2005
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,400
Sun Honglei

2006
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,200
So scary

2007
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,040
I can't look

2008
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,720
Title of the essay

2009
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,880
Sunlight gracefully

2010
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,240
walks across the hotel lawn

2011
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,280
Wait, what about his wife and daughter?

2012
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,000
No idea, maybe they left him

2013
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,320
They abandoned him

2014
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,440
Wife and daughter gone

2015
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,240
Wife and daughter gone, yeah

2016
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,200
I'm already a little tipsy

2017
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,000
Fiery red dance dress spins along the shady path

2018
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,760
Even the footsteps sound like Flamenco

2019
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,880
Gently responding to the wind

2020
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,080
Turns out love can be silent

2021
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:34,840
Madrid

2022
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,160
Wonder

2023
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:38,720
Suddenly so nice

2024
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,960
Suddenly I miss you so much

2025
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,920
Miss you

2026
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,800
Perfect

2027
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,320
Perfect

2028
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,920
Perfect

2029
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,120
Let's go

2030
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,280
What's up?

2031
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,600
No more talking, let's go

2032
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,120
He's making his exit

2033
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,160
Let's buy that

2034
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,600
We should have money for churros, right?

2035
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,560
We do

2036
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,800
Let's spend it

2037
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,400
Spend it all, don't save

2038
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,160
One last round

2039
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,640
We want to spend a little on ourselves

2040
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,680
No more relying on games

2041
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,640
We still have a bit of dignity left

2042
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,800
Feels great

2043
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,000
We should take a photo here

2044
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,080
Tyrannosaurus

2045
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,320
Let's go

2046
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,520
Thank you

2047
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,120
Thank you

2048
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,080
Thank you

2049
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,560
Sir, thank you

2050
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:35,920
Hello

2051
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,720
Come on

2052
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:40,920
Okay

2053
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,840
Spending money feels great

2054
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,080
This kind of counts as

2055
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,560
before facing our final

2056
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,560
defeat

2057
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
we had a little fun

2058
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:52,680
Nice

2059
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,400
Nice

2060
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,200
Spending money is awesome

2061
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,440
Thank you

2062
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,480
Thank you

2063
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:58,960
Come on

2064
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,640
This is a pure giant churro

2065
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,240
This is churros

2066
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,360
It's hot, eat it while it's hot

2067
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,680
So crispy

2068
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,240
Cheers

2069
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,000
Cheers

2070
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,560
Cheers

2071
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,680
This is the joy of spending money

2072
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,680
This is the joy of spending money

2073
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,120
We don't have to beg anyone

2074
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,120
This feeling is really

2075
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,600
intoxicating

2076
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,520
So intoxicating

2077
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,760
This darn feeling

2078
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,040
Not needing to beg anyone, plus

2079
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,280
Why do you look so bossy?

2080
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,480
You finally understand what

2081
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,880
darn sweetness means

2082
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,920
It's not sweet, but it's tasty

2083
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,200
I think it's good even without chocolate sauce

2084
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,520
Just that crispy kind

2085
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,280
Awesome

2086
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,200
Delicious

2087
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,360
Excellent

2088
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,080
Excellent

2089
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:53,960
Really nice

2090
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Good thing we came

2091
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,720
Besides losing today

2092
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,000
we also enjoyed some good food

2093
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,280
I really enjoyed it

2094
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:07,880
Speed up.

2095
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:09,880
Changing pace.

2096
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,480
Start running.

2097
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,040
Your heart rate needs to reach about

2098
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,880
180 to burn calories.

2099
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,280
Really?

2100
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:15,640
Seriously.

2101
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,800
Otherwise, you have to jog

2102
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,800
for more than thirty minutes.

2103
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,040
Raise your heart rate, bro.

2104
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,560
Bro, I'm catching up to you.

2105
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,080
Oh, really?

2106
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,160
You're crazy.

2107
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,880
Is this

2108
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,880
a restaurant that specializes in weird food?

2109
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,720
Come on, let's take a photo.

2110
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,440
Take a photo.

2111
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,240
Why are you today

2112
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,560
Do you have a Weibo assignment?

2113
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:40,960
Or something else?

2114
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,520
How many photos have you taken today?

2115
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,680
Handsome.

2116
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,880
You're so handsome, of course people want to take photos.

2117
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,560
Liu Yuning.

2118
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,640
Thank you.

2119
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,080
You look like this,

2120
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:53,920
and I can't take a photo?

2121
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,080
Sure, take one.

2122
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:55,880
Take a full shot.

2123
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,520
Stretch your leg out a bit.

2124
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,760
Yes.

2125
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,560
Daughter sits in the middle.

2126
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,440
Family.

2127
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,000
You two, make some space for me.

2128
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,840
We teamed up with Weibo to launch

2129
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,360
Earth Super Fresh,

2130
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,760
a global food and scenery showcase event.

2131
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,600
Earth Squad

2132
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,680
during our food tour in Spain,

2133
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,600
chose the dish

2134
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,240
that impressed them the most,

2135
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,520
and posted photos of it.

2136
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,120
They recommended their chosen dish

2137
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,640
to the audience.

2138
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,320
Next, we will

2139
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,240
announce the task results.

2140
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,040
Check-in dishes.

2141
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,320
The team in last place

2142
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,560
has to try a niche dish.

2143
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,640
Let's first announce

2144
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,280
the first team to finish.

2145
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,720
No need, actually.

2146
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,600
No need to announce.

2147
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,600
We all know.

2148
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,800
Everyone can see it.

2149
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,760
Really, no need.

2150
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,120
The first team to finish

2151
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,080
Chen He,

2152
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,240
Liu Yuning,

2153
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,240
Jin Jing.

2154
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,760
Standard procedure.

2155
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,720
Thanks to our interpreter, Ms. Jin.

2156
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,520
The two of us were like mutes all day.

2157
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,520
Wish you a pleasant day.

2158
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,360
Even though our family isn't united,

2159
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,360
we still

2160
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,240
got second place.

2161
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,360
Second place is pretty solid.

2162
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,760
Good thing Mom was here.

2163
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,240
Seriously.

2164
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,160
Rock solid.

2165
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,880
Mom was the only one who didn't run away today.

2166
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,720
She didn't run away.

2167
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,280
She ran faster than anyone.

2168
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:18,960
Come on.

2169
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,240
I went to look for my daughter.

2170
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:20,920
You—

2171
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:21,560
Let me tell you.

2172
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,240
I just—

2173
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,280
You've worked so hard raising the kids all these years.

2174
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,440
Today, I won't blame you.

2175
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm telling you.

2176
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,400
Third place.

2177
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,680
The unlucky trio.

2178
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,200
But their impressive part is

2179
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,600
they finished almost without spending any money.

2180
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,240
The three-dish food challenge.

2181
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,560
Begging for food.

2182
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,160
That's harsh.

2183
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,600
We call it "eating for free."

2184
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,960
Did you go to every restaurant

2185
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,880
and eat leftovers?

2186
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,920
We kept taking on challenges.

2187
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,600
And kept losing.

2188
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,320
Kept losing.

2189
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,120
What method did you use?

2190
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,160
Advanced techniques.

2191
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,280
Tell us about it.

2192
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,840
They relied purely on their own skills.

2193
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,560
To end up like this.

2194
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,080
Is that a compliment?

2195
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,440
Because we didn't spend money.

2196
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,240
It's because of Lin Yi.

2197
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,200
She brought two game black holes along.

2198
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,160
Of course.

2199
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,360
Food's here.

2200
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,680
This is way too fishy.

2201
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,160
Give it a try.

2202
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:32,800
Lamprey.

2203
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:33,800
This one.

2204
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,200
It's this.

2205
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,480
Is it good?

2206
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,720
A bit fishy.

2207
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:52,800
Tasty.

2208
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,280
It's good.

2209
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,080
It's really not bad.

2210
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,080
It's okay.

2211
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,720
It's okay.

2212
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,640
This one's really good.

2213
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,520
That's enough.

2214
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,120
Yeah, it's got that bloody taste.

2215
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,480
It's that old blood flavor.

2216
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,080
Like in those pork slaughter dishes.

2217
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,800
Old blood that's been boiled for ages.

2218
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,920
This is so delicious.

2219
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,760
This is really fragrant.

2220
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:21,800
Want to try it?

2221
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,200
Seriously, bro.

2222
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:22,520
I ate it.

2223
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:22,960
What?

2224
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,560
That lamprey.

2225
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,800
Lamprey, you have to eat it.

2226
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,560
Try it.

2227
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,160
This is really—

2228
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:29,840
Really tasty.

2229
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,240
I'm not joking.

2230
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:37,480
It's good.

2231
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,120
Isn't it good?

2232
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:38,800
This is good.

2233
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,280
I'd give it a nine.

2234
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:41,880
Eight.

2235
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,240
Is it good, Ning bro?

2236
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,560
At most, a six.

2237
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,240
It's edible.

2238
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,520
But there's no need to eat stuff like that.

2239
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,000
See?

2240
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,520
Anything else you want to try?

2241
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,880
Lamb intestines.

2242
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:08,720
Wait a second.

2243
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,440
What is this?

2244
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,200
These lumps inside.

2245
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,280
It's exactly what you're imagining.

2246
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,160
I'll have one.

2247
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,080
Let's share.

2248
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:18,760
We ate it.

2249
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,080
What does it taste like?

2250
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,000
And the taste lingers in your mouth for ages.

2251
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,800
Can you stop talking?

2252
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,160
Look, Ning bro is already going over.

2253
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,720
Isn't it already gamey?

2254
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,760
That's spot on.

2255
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,840
What category is this?

2256
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,120
I took a bite right out of the lamb's butt.

2257
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:17,520
The lamb even kicked me.

2258
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,880
But I still didn't let go.

2259
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,240
Zero points.

2260
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,200
Zero points.

2261
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,080
Zero points.

2262
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,720
Zero points.

2263
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,720
This deserves eight points.

2264
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,120
Seriously, eight points.

2265
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:29,960
Nine points.

2266
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,480
You.

2267
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,720
Don't you guys think it's sticky in the mouth?

2268
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,520
Not sticky.

2269
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,560
These two are real weird food brothers.

2270
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Alright, sheep brain.

2271
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,840
Sheep brain should be fine.

2272
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,760
Have you ever had pig brain?

2273
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:51,920
I've had pig brain.

2274
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:52,800
Pretty much the same.

2275
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,160
I think it's eight points.

2276
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:54,880
Zero points.

2277
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,760
This is all dough.

2278
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:57,600
No brain in it.

2279
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:57,960
There is.

2280
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,720
There is.

2281
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,040
No, there isn't.

2282
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,440
My piece has no brain at all.

2283
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,160
You're just eating your own kind.

2284
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,080
That's what you're doing.

2285
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,800
How is it, Liu Yuning?

2286
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,840
After eating the lamb intestines,

2287
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,200
I can't taste anything anymore.

2288
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,200
Maybe four points.

2289
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,800
It feels like you're eating brain,

2290
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,640
but it actually tastes just like tofu.

2291
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,840
Lamb sweetbread.

2292
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,160
This dish looks really healthy.

2293
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,160
I'd say seven points.

2294
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,280
I think seven points.

2295
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,760
What's wrong with you two?

2296
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,920
Five points, maybe.

2297
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:50,840
Five points.

2298
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,520
It tastes like chicken,

2299
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,200
but the more you chew, the less flavor it has.

2300
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,040
Here.

2301
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:00,840
Cheese.

2302
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,240
This one really looks like a chive pocket.

2303
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,360
The one in the middle is sheep cheese.

2304
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,160
There's blue cheese on the side.

2305
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:07,760
Which one?

2306
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,120
I can taste this one.

2307
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,080
I want to try.

2308
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,000
I'll have a chive pocket.

2309
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,160
You can't eat it plain, it's too salty.

2310
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,200
Eight point five.

2311
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,200
It tastes like a sewer.

2312
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,880
I was just praising it here.

2313
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:33,880
Just like a sewer.

2314
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,400
It's fragrant, really fragrant.

2315
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,440
You guys just don't get it.

2316
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,960
The weird food duo across from us.

2317
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,400
I'm not joining in.

2318
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,920
At most, I'm just a bit of a glutton.

2319
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,840
You guys are into weird food.

2320
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,600
I really don't get these two brothers.

2321
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,000
Do you really not have taste buds?

2322
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,240
I don't accept that.

2323
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,720
I'm being very objective here.

2324
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,640
Really objective.

2325
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,160
Ning bro is being objective.

2326
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,720
You're just a weird food addict.

2327
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:11,680
Finally,

2328
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,640
we're heading together to

2329
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,280
the Madrid Chinese Cultural Center

2330
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,160
to meet our friends in Madrid.

2331
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:17,960
Let's go.

2332
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,720
Let's head out.

2333
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:20,800
Let's go.

2334
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:26,360
We're here, right?

2335
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,480
Okay.

2336
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:29,960
Center.

2337
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,640
Chinese Cultural Center.

2338
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,680
Number 73.

2339
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,560
That's exactly the year diplomatic relations were established, 1973.

2340
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,120
With Spain.

2341
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:37,640
Really.

2342
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:38,760
That's what it means.

2343
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,120
Let's give a round of applause.

2344
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,240
The Chinese Ambassador to Spain.

2345
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:42,640
The Chinese Ambassador to Spain.

2346
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,360
Mr. Yao Jing.

2347
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,000
Hello, Ambassador Yao.

2348
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,440
Please.

2349
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,440
Welcome.

2350
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,840
Hello.

2351
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:51,600
Hello, Ambassador.

2352
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,080
Hello, Ambassador Yao.

2353
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,560
It's an honor.

2354
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:52,880
Honored.

2355
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,640
Nice to meet you.

2356
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,280
Please have a seat.

2357
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:54,840
Sit down.

2358
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,440
Please sit.

2359
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:55,960
Ambassador, please sit.

2360
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,880
Shouldn't we give the ambassador something?

2361
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,040
Should we give this first?

2362
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,760
From our show "Earth Squad Fresh".

2363
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,560
Let's give a gift.

2364
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,560
I'll give mine to the ambassador first.

2365
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,040
Is that okay?

2366
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,720
Take mine.

2367
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,640
Take mine, Ambassador.

2368
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,000
Take mine.

2369
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,520
Then you take it.

2370
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:10,960
You give it.

2371
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:11,640
No, you do it.

2372
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,240
What's this?

2373
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,280
Let me put it on your cuff.

2374
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,440
It's the "Earth Squad Fresh" logo.

2375
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:17,440
A logo.

2376
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:17,760
Right.

2377
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,560
You can give it to your child later.

2378
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,280
Since everyone has pinned theirs,

2379
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,080
Let's all do it.

2380
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:21,960
Everyone join in.

2381
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:24,880
This one.

2382
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,680
We have representatives.

2383
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,920
Each represents something different about us.

2384
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,120
So each one is unique.

2385
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,120
Everyone's is different.

2386
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,200
Ambassador, your outfit is a bit

2387
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,520
trendy.

2388
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:36,880
Lin Yi.

2389
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,200
You won't even let the ambassador's back go, huh?

2390
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,080
I'll be the man behind him.

2391
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,160
Thank you.

2392
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,440
This is pretty nice.

2393
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:43,880
Looks good.

2394
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,720
Very cute.

2395
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:48,720
Thank you.

2396
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,640
Alright.

2397
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,360
Everyone, take a seat.

2398
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,240
Ambassador.

2399
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,440
You didn't come empty-handed, did you?

2400
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,920
Our entire cultural center

2401
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,960
Take whatever you like

2402
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Feel free to take anything

2403
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,200
Then I'll take this one first

2404
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:07,520
Yes

2405
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,800
These are all famous photographs

2406
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,880
All of these

2407
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,960
Were these taken by photographers here?

2408
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,120
These are by photographers from China

2409
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:14,840
Chinese photographers

2410
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,600
They did a great job

2411
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,800
Yes, and also

2412
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,520
I remember that

2413
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,680
It was for World Environment Day on June 5th

2414
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,200
Our cultural center

2415
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,280
Held an event called "Homeland" here

2416
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,000
As part of the "Spanish Photography Festival"

2417
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:26,800
That's wonderful

2418
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,280
These are some of China's most famous

2419
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,520
Achievements in ecological protection

2420
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,400
Spanish cuisine is also very famous

2421
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,160
Here

2422
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,680
Because, as you know, Spain

2423
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,800
Is located along the Mediterranean coast

2424
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,560
This Mediterranean coastal

2425
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,360
Type of food culture

2426
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,720
Is quite diverse

2427
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,920
It has various cooking methods

2428
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,880
And all kinds of ingredients

2429
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,920
It's a bit similar to China

2430
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,720
Every region is different

2431
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,720
Secondly

2432
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,680
Its style is also diverse

2433
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,480
There’s steaming, boiling

2434
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,800
And also frying, deep-frying

2435
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,560
I’m not sure if you’ve tried Spain’s

2436
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,160
Spanish churros

2437
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,680
You can look it up, about churros

2438
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,200
We say they learned it from China

2439
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,760
Spaniards say they learned it from us

2440
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,440
But it shows

2441
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,080
That

2442
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,880
In this global village

2443
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,040
Many customs are probably shared

2444
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:17,680
Thirdly

2445
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,120
I think their eating habits are also diverse

2446
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,720
There are all kinds of

2447
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,360
If you go to the coast

2448
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,440
Seafood is the main thing

2449
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:24,800
Right

2450
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,440
If you go inland

2451
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,400
There’s a lot of rice dishes

2452
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,960
Like paella

2453
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:30,480
Paella

2454
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,600
There are many dishes like that

2455
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,600
At the same time, Chinese food here

2456
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,120
Is also quite popular

2457
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,120
It’s said that here

2458
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,880
Any city with over 2,000 people

2459
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,240
Will definitely have Chinese

2460
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,400
Communities living there

2461
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,640
They are here

2462
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,240
And have opened all kinds of Chinese restaurants

2463
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:47,840
So

2464
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,040
Chinese people won’t feel out of place here

2465
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,640
Nor will they feel lonely

2466
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:52,960
That’s great

2467
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:53,280
Ambassador

2468
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,160
You

2469
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:00,840
I invite you all

2470
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,560
Especially for us

2471
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,360
For guests from China

2472
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:05,680
I think

2473
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:08,120
We can easily adapt here

2474
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,400
There are about 200,000 of us here

2475
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,160
Chinese communities

2476
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,360
They are very well received locally

2477
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,760
But here

2478
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,200
They are basically considered

2479
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,640
A part of local society

2480
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,960
They have been fully

2481
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,120
Accepted and embraced

2482
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,440
When people mention China

2483
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,880
They all give a thumbs up

2484
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:26,720
Perfect

2485
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:27,880
Absolutely perfect

2486
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,280
Thank you, Ambassador Yao

2487
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,400
Finally, let’s invite the ambassador

2488
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,560
To take a group photo with us

2489
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,600
Come on

2490
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,160
Three, two, one

2491
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,200
We finally have a theme song

2492
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,720
The world is so interesting

2493
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,880
We’re not afraid to get muddy

2494
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,600
Let’s meet here by chance

2495
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,760
Time’s scars hide secrets

2496
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,320
Let’s all warm up first

2497
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,080
This

2498
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,360
Liu Yuning, I want to see you do this

2499
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,000
Let me show you the forbidden move.

2500
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,720
What is that?

2501
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,080
Yuning, do you want to show everyone?

2502
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,640
You have to move your hips with it.

2503
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,600
I got this, bro.

2504
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,800
Want.

2505
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,800
I want.

2506
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,360
To fly.

2507
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,520
Surround.

2508
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,400
Six people sang eight rhythms.

2509
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,000
Let's go shoot a music video.

2510
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:44,840
Are we in sync this time?

2511
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,360
Yes.

2512
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,800
Are we good now?

2513
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,320
Let's go in the wildest way.

2514
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,400
I'm telling you, ours is the most unique.

2515
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,200
I think so.

2516
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,680
Time to get on the bus, let's go.

2517
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,320
This stop, Earth Squad.

2518
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,080
has arrived in Barcelona.

2519
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,840
So beautiful.

2520
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,440
Really nice.

2521
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,920
All nine of you will be wrapped in toilet paper.

2522
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,320
Tightly bound together.

2523
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,440
If the paper breaks, the mission fails.

2524
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,120
One, two, one, two.

2525
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,200
Wait a second.

2526
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,920
It can't be me.

2527
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,120
I swear on my honor.

2528
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,240
Then I'll walk like this.

2529
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,520
Lin Yi.

2530
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,080
Was it you?

2531
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,120
You read people so well.

2532
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,640
I think it's Yuning.

2533
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,680
Yeah, one hundred percent.

2534
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,080
Next, you'll get

2535
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,120
a unanimous team mission.

2536
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,280
Can you ask easier questions?

2537
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,160
He asks all the questions.

2538
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,520
Let's all say "obtuse angle."

2539
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,360
What's an obtuse angle?

2540
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,000
And.

2541
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,120
Let's just say "and."

2542
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,040
You get what I mean now, right?

2543
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:43,840
No way.

2544
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,400
We don't give up.

2545
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,720
Today, we play until everyone wins.

2546
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,240
Please, give us two more chances.

2547
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,120
Let's try again.

2548
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,040
Two more times.

2549
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,800
I'm really into this, bro.

2550
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,280
Anytime.

2551
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,640
Anywhere.

2552
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,200
Super detectives take their cases seriously.

2553
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,280
Brilliant.

2554
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,600
What happened?

2555
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,440
We are your forever home.

2556
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,440
That's right.

2557
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,320
Come back soon.

2558
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,080
Come back.

2559
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,280
Let's dance well for him first.

2560
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:08,800
And then?

2561
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,360
Left, right, left, left.
