1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,300
I think this is fine.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,300
Let’s just go with this.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,900
Let’s boldly sing along this time.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,525
Is that okay?

5
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:07,225
We didn’t sing earlier.

6
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,000
Let’s listen and sing along with him.

7
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,250
No problem, right?

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Let him melt into colorful ice cream.

9
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,300
We’re not walking Roman Avenue today.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,300
Destiny has drifted off course.

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,240
Love and joy are the little lucks on the journey.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,640
All fell into the coffee cup.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,090
The swirling wine glass is my true happiness.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,690
This line is mine.

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,740
Let’s focus on C1, this part is super interesting.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,290
The folds of a fun life hide secrets.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,550
The pitch went so high.

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:08,550
Love and joy gone astray are the little luck on the way.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,050
Clouds fell into the coffee cup.

20
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,050
Even the swirling wine glasses are truly mine.

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,620
Of.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,070
The world is interesting.

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,070
Life hides secrets.

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,020
The world is so interesting.

25
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,120
Secrets are hidden in the world’s lilies.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,050
This world is super interesting.

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,050
Like wanting to bungee jump at the world’s end.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,050
The world is so interesting.

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,250
Want to be in your world.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,600
Just go with the feeling.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,600
Just feel it.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,190
This really can’t be pushed.

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,840
Right hand, left leg, right?

34
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,240
Left hand, right leg.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,590
Is there really a better way?

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,190
Who are you struggling for?

37
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,840
Only a phone number is left.

38
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,940
Never willing to give in.

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,840
I heard you once fell in love.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,360
Once couldn’t help yourself either.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,535
Bro.

42
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,160
You do it once.

43
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,810
Sure.

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,910
Any problem?

45
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,660
No.

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,260
Separate.

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,910
Separate.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,620
Separate.

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,470
Now you have to win back with true love.

50
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,770
Love isn’t something you can buy.

51
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,220
You can’t buy it just because you want to.

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,820
Let go.

53
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,795
Let them understand.

54
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,020
Love that lets go.

55
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,570
Go around.

56
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,770
See a flower on your body.

57
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,570
Makes me want to write for you every day.

58
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,610
A love song.

59
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,410
A romantic chorus.

60
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,360
Gently echoing along.

61
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,960
It’s also the choice of the determined.

62
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,085
Why does everything feel like tears?

63
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:30,610
Tears.

64
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,360
What did my big bro say?

65
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,410
Flowers.

66
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,960
Two six.

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,960
Those days are gone.

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Go dig for shells.

69
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,540
Capture the northern suburbs alive.

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,590
Sister.

71
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,490
Beautiful sister.

72
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,190
Sister, sis.

73
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,820
Red bud sister.

74
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,770
Lovely sister.

75
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,470
Sister.

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,770
Beauty in my heart.

77
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,770
Dad.

78
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,770
I’ll show a bit more.

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,740
Change a bit so I can really see.

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,090
By the novel’s grace, I’ll stay with you for countless days.

81
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,590
Let me willingly love you.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,290
Yuning.

83
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,390
Liu Yuning.

84
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,840
I want to ask if you’ve ever lost.

85
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,790
I haven’t lost in this show.

86
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,840
Let's piece together a story with countless short videos like this.

87
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,240
One day, I caught a glimpse of you.

88
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,390
This is your unexpected journey together.

89
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,178
Let's film it line by line.

90
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,690
It's not simple at all.

91
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,840
If it were simple, I'd know what to shoot next.

92
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,590
Film your hand.

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,890
He gave an example.

94
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,540
If I were the cameraman,

95
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,290
I'd film his hand.

96
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,240
Start with the hand.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,190
A hand holding him.

98
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,090
Holding your hand.

99
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,815
Maybe looking at your face.

100
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:27,465
Hold hands.

101
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:29,640
Then follow the hand to film him turning to look at you.

102
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,440
A glance back.

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,965
A smile.

104
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,890
You travel together.

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,990
Then do it in slow motion.

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,690
It's fine.

107
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,940
I'll show up later.

108
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,440
Next, a hand-holding shot.

109
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,440
Hand-holding starts here.

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,040
Let's try one take, start with three, then move forward.

111
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,390
Look at the camera.

112
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,840
Oh no.

113
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,090
I'm speechless.

114
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,740
From your hand.

115
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,515
Start from your hand?

116
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,740
Once I grab the hand, I film him.

117
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,115
Alright, let's go.

118
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,390
Ready, one, two, three.

119
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,010
Look up at the camera.

120
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,510
Don't run here.

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,510
Run forward.

122
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,510
I'm speechless.

123
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,485
The camera catches me first.

124
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:06,110
Look at me first.

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,310
Then pull back.

126
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,260
Then the two of them appear.

127
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Then you put your hand on.

128
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,710
My hand goes like this, then I speak.

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,035
Right.

130
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,060
It's just lip-syncing, right.

131
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,560
So we want something super fun with the camera.

132
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,460
Da di da di da.

133
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,280
That's what I mean.

134
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,180
Just like this.

135
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,055
Wave hello upwards.

136
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:24,230
Then look like this.

137
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,730
Film this first.

138
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,830
You're at this height.

139
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,580
Then pull out.

140
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,680
The three of us appear.

141
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,580
Then continue to the right side.

142
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,815
So let's vote out two or three people we don't trust.

143
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:40,515
Let him stand in the middle.

144
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:41,040
Let him block.

145
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,540
But he can't block it.

146
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,290
Let this break, okay?

147
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,490
We lost this round.

148
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:47,890
Right?

149
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,340
But we have to vote now, right?

150
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,440
Any doubts left?

151
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,890
This round.

152
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,565
Because I saw everything.

153
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,340
I saw you doing something weird in the back.

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,295
I want to ask you.

155
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,345
How did you walk?

156
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,220
Can you jump in like that?

157
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,470
You have to walk like this.

158
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,320
The easiest way is

159
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Let these two bros go in front.

160
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,420
Because the two of them won't

161
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,320
They can.

162
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,795
They can walk normally.

163
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,570
They won't have any of that tripping stuff.

164
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,745
It's hard for two people to trip each other.

165
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,920
Yeah, we can't trip each other.

166
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,670
Bro.

167
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,490
I still want to play a game with you.

168
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,865
If it's not me.

169
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,090
Would you play if you lived in Room 8?

170
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,590
I'm already in Room 8.

171
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,590
I'm not inside with him.

172
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,565
How do I pull from inside?

173
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:30,290
I pull like this.

174
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,540
Yeah, think about it.

175
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,440
If it breaks here, maybe someone over there is pulling hard.

176
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,940
Your arm length isn't the same as ours.

177
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,790
Like this, bro.

178
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Herniated disc.

179
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
How come I...

180
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,150
Why am I the most suspicious?

181
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,350
I just want a reason.

182
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,700
Today I can float.

183
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,225
Because you're too handsome.

184
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:48,750
Alright?

185
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,350
Just admit it.

186
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,625
This one I can admit.

187
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:55,900
Bro
