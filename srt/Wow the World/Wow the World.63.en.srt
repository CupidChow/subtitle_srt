1
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,240
The task is called "Who Is My Scene Partner?"

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,040
Out of nine members, two are undercover.

3
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,680
Regular player

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,920
You need to act based on the scenario you receive.

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,160
Randomly choose someone

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,040
to be your scene partner.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,640
Perform two lines of dialogue.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,040
The undercover doesn't know the scenario.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,360
If both undercovers are voted out,

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,320
regular players get one point.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
Otherwise, the undercover gets one point.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
Alright, everyone draw your role first.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,160
Please don't give me the role.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,760
Darn it.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm doomed again.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,080
Let me say the lines.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,120
How are you?

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,800
This is the line for character A.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,240
Character B's line is

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,840
I'm fine.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,760
How are you?

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,080
I'm fine.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,760
Who knows how to play? Go first.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
We choose, right?

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
No, he picks a number.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
He draws one.

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Xingxu

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,880
You act first.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Then you pick someone.

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:49,960
Go ahead.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,960
Are you A or B?

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm A.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,680
You're A.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,360
Then I'm B.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,040
Go ahead, say your line.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,120
You.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,400
How do I act?

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,840
Are you the undercover?

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Hello.

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,840
How are you?

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
How are you?

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm fine.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,120
Good.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm fine.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
What are you doing?

46
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Okay.

47
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm fine.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,640
I'm Feiwu.

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,400
Right?

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm Big Feiwu.

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
Linyi, what are you doing?

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,840
You seem to be in pain, aren't you?

53
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,200
How are you?

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm fine.

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,120
How are you?

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Hello, how are you?

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,520
How are you?

58
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,000
How are you?

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,280
Alright, okay.

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
That's enough.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,040
Okay.

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,800
That's enough.

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,920
What's this?

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
I probably get it now.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Very suspicious.

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,720
Let's keep going like this.

67
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,120
Yuwen

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,600
I'll pick someone with a blank card.

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,360
Naiven

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,520
Go ahead.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
What are you acting?

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,120
Anything.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,480
You choose.

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,280
I'm fine with anything.

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,840
So you're A, I'm B.

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,240
Alright.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,440
Start.

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,680
How are you?

79
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,120
How are you?

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
How are you?

81
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm fine.

82
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm fine.

83
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm fine.

84
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,880
This

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
You didn't act, bro.

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
Your acting is a bit too subtle.

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,600
Not quite right, bro.

88
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
You're an actor, bro.

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,840
Top-level.

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
This is advanced acting.

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,400
It's deadpan acting.

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
Naiven Li

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,280
You're too thick-skinned with this performance.

94
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
You're aiming too far.

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Your shell is too thick.

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,279
Give us a bit more.

97
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,000
That's too abstract.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,440
Give us a bit more.

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,120
Try it again.

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,800
A bit more, come on.

101
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,560
Go again.

102
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,839
Don't put them on.

103
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,680
Don't put on your glasses.

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't wear glasses.

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,200
You can't wear glasses in this round.

106
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Take them off.

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,200
Come on, try again.

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,120
Okay.

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,680
How are you?

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,800
How are you?

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,000
How are you?

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm fine.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm fine.

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm fine.

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,200
I think you're acting fishy.

116
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,000
That's really true.

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,560
Even sunglasses can't hide how fishy you are.

118
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
So fishy.

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Awkwardly stiff.

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
You're acting awkwardly stiff.

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,400
I was just now very...

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,240
You were really awkward just now.

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll go.

124
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,240
Right.

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Pick a scene partner.

126
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,240
You've played already, right?

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
You haven't played.

128
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,080
Haven't played.

129
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, I'll pick you.

130
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,440
How are you?

131
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm fine.

132
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
We can wrap it up.

133
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,000
White.

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,560
Black.

136
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Naiven Bro’s face looks awkwardly stiff.

137
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Didi.

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,880
Who wants to act with me?

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,080
Anyone’s fine.

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,840
I’m good with anyone.

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,440
Whatever.

142
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Princess.

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,440
Anything goes today.

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
Alright, I’ll do a scene with you, bro.

145
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,760
I’ll do it.

146
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,440
Can I play the lead male?

148
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,240
Sure.

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Then can I be B?

150
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,680
Alright.

151
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,840
Like this.

152
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Mine was a bit abstract.

153
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,760
What was that?

154
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,760
I’m fine.

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

156
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,200
Alright.

157
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,000
I think there’s nothing wrong with that.

158
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,040
Wait, hold on.

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Yuning, do it again.

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,560
Do it again.

161
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,400
Let me take a look.

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Sorry, I missed it just now.

163
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,240
How are you?

164
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,440
How are you?

165
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,640
How are you?

166
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,960
This...

167
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,080
This is fine, right?

168
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
I get it.

169
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,560
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

170
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,840
Yeah, that’s smart.

171
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,320
Did you get it?

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,480
No.

173
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Is this a move from “Zhe Yao”?

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,560
No.

175
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,680
No.

176
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
I don’t really get this.

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,200
Didi.

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,320
Do you agree?

179
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,360
I agree.

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
Are you family with them?

181
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,480
We’re family.

182
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,200
Family.

183
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,080
Family.

184
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
Naiven Bro.

185
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
That expression of yours.

186
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,200
Naiven Bro.

187
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,440
Do you think I did anything wrong?

188
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,480
I think it’s fine.

189
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
He Bro, do you think there’s a problem?

190
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,560
No problem.

191
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,160
Help me pick one.

192
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
I’ll choose Naiven.

193
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Do I even need to choose?

194
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Let He do it again.

195
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,720
Or let Lin Yi be your scene partner.

196
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,120
Lin Yi.

197
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,800
Let’s go with Lin Yi.

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Lin Yi, do a scene with him.

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,840
Do a scene with bro.

200
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
That last performance was impressive.

201
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
It left bro confused.

202
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
Bro looks pretty suspicious too.

203
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
How are you?

204
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,000
How are you?

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,560
How are you?

206
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
What is this?

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm fine.

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm fine.

209
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,120
Yeah.

210
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,800
Lin Yi is fine.

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
I know who's suspicious now.

212
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,680
I'm fine.

213
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm fine.

214
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,160
Okay.

215
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,080
I'm fine.

216
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay.

217
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,640
Alright.

218
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
I can.

219
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Alright.

220
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,960
You can.

221
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Now there's something here.

222
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,480
So what is this?

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Come back.

224
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,320
Forget it.

225
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,600
Kid.

226
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,840
Vote.

227
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,000
Everyone can discuss.

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Look at Naiven's expression.

229
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
Naiven, no need to discuss.

230
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm just saying.

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,480
Brother Naiven's chance of drawing undercover

232
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,280
is a bit too high, isn't it?

233
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
Brother Naiven is definitely set.

234
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,360
Who's next?

235
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,919
How about this.

236
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,360
Let me help you pick the other one.

237
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,559
I think it's him.

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,800
How could it be me?

239
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,720
I think it's He Bro and Lei Bro.

240
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,400
Because He Bro copies the other person.

241
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,480
Honglei Bro didn't look like it at first.

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,840
But...

243
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,040
He doesn't dare to question directly.

244
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
I think it's He Bro.

245
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,800
Because Lei Bro

246
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,160
He must know his own answer.

247
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,360
That's why he questions others.

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Makes sense.

249
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,560
No.

250
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,680
Do you think Lin Yi did it right?

251
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,160
I want to know.

252
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,800
Yeah.

253
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,840
Lin Yi is right.

254
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,080
Yeah.

255
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,360
He's just a bit confused.

256
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,120
Lin Yi was too suspicious the first time.

257
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,080
But he made up for it the second time.

258
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,240
What is it?

259
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,600
What is it?

260
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
What's the scenario?

261
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,360
You're the blank card, right?

262
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,720
I am.

263
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,360
Then why should I tell you?

264
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,240
What?

265
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,400
Why would I tell you?

266
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Because you don't know either, right?

267
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,120
Of course I know.

268
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
Come on, let's count the votes.

269
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,080
Three, two, one, vote.

270
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,840
Naiven Li.

271
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Naiven Li.

272
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,360
Everyone.

273
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,400
Congrats, you all got it right the first time.

274
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
Success, you won.

275
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
Before the second vote

276
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
If anyone seems suspicious

277
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,520
You can pick that person

278
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,480
and do another scene partner round.

279
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,000
He Bro looks awkwardly stiff now.

280
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
No.

281
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,680
Very relaxed.

282
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,720
Then you and Lei

283
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
I think He and Lei can do it.

284
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,600
He Bro and Lei Bro then.

285
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,080
He Bro then.

286
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,680
Come on.

287
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,760
How are you?

288
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,880
How are you?

289
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
That's a big problem.

290
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Actually, it's kind of big.

291
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
You actually have a bit of a problem.

292
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,600
Is it big?

293
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
This is big?

294
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Do it again.

295
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,120
How are you?

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,640
How are you?

297
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,240
Fitness coach.

298
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
Even I think he's suspicious.

299
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm fine.

300
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,600
Okay

301
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,840
Awesome

302
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,480
This instantly proves innocence.

303
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,480
This proves it right away.

304
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,760
Cleared up in one go.

305
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,240
Still the veteran artist.

306
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,960
Spot on.

307
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
I can do it.

308
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,760
You can, no problem.

309
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,600
No, Brother He is really good.

310
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Not stepping on me anymore.

311
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,240
Brother He, do you think it's in the gym?

312
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,360
Of course not.

313
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
How could it be?

314
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,120
Then where is it?

315
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,160
I can't say.

316
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,720
Vote

317
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,320
Let's vote.

318
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
Three, two, one

319
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,720
He

320
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Where is it, Brother He?

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Where is it?

322
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,080
It's something like doing laundry.

323
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,080
It's related to washing.

324
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
Guess again.

325
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
Washing face

326
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,840
Washing hair

327
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,640
Smart

328
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,640
Why are you washing hair?

329
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,680
What does "pep talk" mean?

330
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,120
Its keyword is

331
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,560
Salon manager gives staff a pep talk.

332
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,240
One

333
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,120
What did your first performance mean?

334
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
Don't you sit down first in a salon?

335
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,720
Just sit there.

336
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,000
Then I did this, right?

337
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,640
What do you mean, perm?

338
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,880
You're the customer.

339
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,360
Hair

340
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
It's just hair.

341
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,080
He acted as the salon.

342
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,000
No

343
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,840
I forgot that line.

344
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,080
I thought the manager went to the salon for a haircut.

345
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Manager goes to the salon for a haircut.

346
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,600
I forgot.

347
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
It's your company manager going to the salon.

348
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,480
Right?

349
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,000
But I was totally

350
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,240
defeated by Lin Yi.

351
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
His acting was too abstract.

352
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:01,920
Abstract

353
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Nothing to learn from it.

354
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,000
I was very precise.

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Alright, everyone

356
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
Draw for the second round of roles.

357
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,720
Please don't give me a blank card.

358
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
That's too scary.

359
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Don't give me a blank card.

360
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,360
I don't want it.

361
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,640
It won't happen.

362
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,080
Variety show god

363
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
Let me tell everyone the lines.

364
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,080
Stop hitting.

365
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
This is line A.

366
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,640
Line B is "This won't work."

367
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,720
Stop hitting, okay?

368
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,880
This won't work.

369
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,120
Come on, pick a number.

370
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
Let's draw the first performer.

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
Pick the first one.

372
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,520
Xingxu

373
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,240
What's going on?

374
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,480
Go ahead.

375
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
So unlucky.

376
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
Unlucky guy

377
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,760
Brother He, come on

378
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,640
Just reveal yourself.

379
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,000
Here comes one from Shanghai Theatre Academy.

380
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,960
And one from Central Academy of Drama.

381
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,360
Alright, let's go

382
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,240
Come on

383
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,120
Stop hitting.

384
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,640
Is that it?

385
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,240
That's it.

386
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,240
That's all.

387
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,280
That's all there is.

388
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm telling you clearly

389
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,040
My role is good.

390
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,280
Alright, let's go

391
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,640
This won't work.

392
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,120
That’s still kind of reasonable.

393
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Yeah.

394
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,520
Alright, next one.

395
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,160
Bro, is your face looking pale?

396
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,760
Honglei hasn’t said a word so far.

397
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Let me tell you.

398
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,640
Honglei.

399
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,880
Are you A or B?

400
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,520
I’m A.

401
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,360
You’re A?

402
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,880
Then use Xingxu’s line from earlier.

403
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,680
Alright.

404
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
He didn’t act it right, did he, bro?

405
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,400
What do you think?

406
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,240
I think Xingxu did it right.

407
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,680
Totally right.

408
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
It’s tough, I’m telling you.

409
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,640
Here we go.

410
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,760
Honglei.

411
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Bro, get up.

412
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,800
Agonizing.

413
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,880
You called me?

414
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,480
Yeah.

415
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,400
He just doesn’t want to go.

416
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,000
You need Honglei to play B.

417
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,920
He wants to wait another round.

418
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Come on.

419
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,280
Go ahead.

420
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,400
Stop hitting.

421
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,720
Stop hitting.

422
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,120
This won’t work.

423
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,640
This won’t work.

424
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,520
Still not working.

425
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,080
Okay.

426
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,280
Alright.

427
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,760
Alright.

428
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,520
Actually, you two

429
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,840
didn’t do so well, I think.

430
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
You’ve got the word now.

431
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,880
Your current state

432
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,040
is pretty obvious.

433
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
Forgot how you got here, right?

434
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,040
With effort,

435
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,120
you’ll succeed eventually.

436
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
Honglei, are you really not going to do anything?

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,480
Honglei.

438
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,400
Yeah, Honglei.

439
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Shouldn’t you ask a question?

440
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,560
I don’t think you need to ask.

441
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,800
Just let Honglei act as B.

442
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,240
Who’s acting with him?

443
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,880
Someone do A.

444
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,280
I’ll do it.

445
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,640
You do it.

446
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,120
It’s different when you have the role.

447
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,240
You can tell he’s got the word too, bro.

448
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,920
Playing openly.

449
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,720
Ning is really quiet this round.

450
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,880
Getting a bit tired, right?

451
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,520
A bit tired.

452
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,880
Exhausted.

453
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
Feeling a bit worn out.

454
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Totally exhausted.

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,560
Ning, I think you really

456
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,760
are so quiet this round.

457
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,400
Come up.

458
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,400
Naiven has already decided.

459
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,000
You’re up next.

460
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,640
Linyi, let me tell you.

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
You’re A.

462
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,240
I’m A.

463
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,040
Start.

464
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,360
Stop hitting.

465
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,760
Wait a second.

466
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,000
Alright, I got it.

467
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,600
What? What do you know?

468
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Act, be B.

469
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,440
What do you know?

470
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,760
No.

471
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,880
I really need to find the right way to act.

472
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,160
This won’t work.

473
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
This won’t work.

474
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
This won’t work.

475
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,640
Honglei hasn’t made a single move.

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,640
You’re confused, aren’t you?

477
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,520
Bro.

478
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You say it three times every time.

479
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,760
Are you hoping for a pun?

480
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,040
Put emphasis on the logic.

481
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Stress every word.

482
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,520
Try each one again.

483
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,640
This looks really suspicious.

484
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,600
No.

485
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,640
In your mind,

486
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,760
there are only three ways to act, right?

487
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,520
You’re not confused?

488
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,240
You tried each one, didn’t you?

489
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,400
You went one by one.

490
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
He tried each one.

491
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,160
The problem is, none of them were right.

492
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,640
Jing

493
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,920
Who am I paired with?

494
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,240
Lin Yi

495
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,240
What do you think?

496
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,440
You can pick me too.

497
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
Lin Yi hasn't acted yet, right?

498
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,680
Yeah.

499
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Which one do you choose?

500
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,120
Doesn't matter.

501
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,760
You play A.

502
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,200
Let Jing play B.

503
00:16:59,640 --> 00:16:59,920
Okay.

504
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,480
Stop hitting.

505
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,240
Stop hitting.

506
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,319
This won't work.

507
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,920
Actually, it's not bad.

508
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,359
Pretty awesome, right?

509
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,920
Mine is super cool.

510
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,520
Let's go.

511
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,480
What do you want?

512
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm fine with anything.

513
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,400
I'll be A.

514
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,760
Come on.

515
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,520
Start.

516
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,240
Stop hitting.

517
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,280
Still not working.

518
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,680
What's this?

519
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,200
What about Ning?

520
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,960
Stop hitting.

521
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,160
Me.

522
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,080
Okay.

523
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,040
Got it.

524
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,560
Understood.

525
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,040
You can vote for Honglei directly.

526
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,440
I think...

527
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,760
Are you sure you want to vote for me?

528
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,000
Absolutely sure.

529
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,320
Let me think.

530
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,840
No problem.

531
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,760
Honglei's card is definitely revealed.

532
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Yeah.

533
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,440
Ning, just now you...

534
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,520
Which era do you think this is from?

535
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,720
Modern times.

536
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,200
What other era could it be?

537
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Male or female?

538
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm playing a male.

539
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,560
Lin Yi

540
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Do you think B is male or female?

541
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,200
You could say either, I guess.

542
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,720
So hard to guess.

543
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
Ning, which season do you think this is?

544
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,040
Spring, summer, autumn, winter.

545
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,440
I can only tell you there's sun.

546
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,600
Which season doesn't have sun?

547
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
The sun stands for something.

548
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Then I get it.

549
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,680
Let's go.

550
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,880
I think that's about it.

551
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
That's about it.

552
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,360
Let's vote first.

553
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
Three, two, one.

554
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,560
Please vote.

555
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay.

556
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,320
Why is everyone voting for me?

557
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
Honglei's identity is blank card.

558
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,720
It's too hard.

559
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
Really tough.

560
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,440
This is way too hard.

561
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
No one can handle this.

562
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,280
Come on, Honglei.

563
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Can you briefly describe

564
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
your thought process?

565
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
My thought process is,

566
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,480
after seeing the blank card,

567
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,080
I just broke down.

568
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,480
We can tell, bro.

569
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,960
It's really tough.

570
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,520
Definitely hard.

571
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,440
Second one.

572
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Three, two, one, please vote.

573
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,720
Lin Yi

574
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,880
Lin Yi

575
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,920
It's not me.

576
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,040
Well...

577
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,920
Okay, who voted for me?

578
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,760
Act it out with me again.

579
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
How about I act with Lin Yi again?

580
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,080
Sure.

581
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,760
Come on.

582
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,440
You play A.

583
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,040
I played A just now.

584
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,760
You play A this round.

585
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,280
Alright.

586
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,040
Stop hitting.

587
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,000
This won't work.

588
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,560
I was wrong.

589
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,160
This won't work.

590
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,320
Go ahead and vote.

591
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,960
Vote, come on.

592
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,720
It's very clear now.

593
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,120
Come on.

594
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
Ready, everyone.

595
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,360
Three, two, one.

596
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,480
Why is it me?

597
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,760
Why not you?

598
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,280
What is this?

599
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,280
This.

600
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,120
Right.

601
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,080
It's dazzling, isn't it?

602
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,040
Let's announce it.

603
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,480
The second blank card is

604
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,040
Yuning.

605
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,000
See?

606
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,800
He's the Thor's Hammer.

607
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,320
He's doing this.

608
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Brother Ning, you...

609
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
Brother Ning, did you guess it?

610
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,680
I didn't guess it.

611
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,800
I just made that move randomly.

612
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,280
But this is...

613
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,040
But actually, it's really accurate.

614
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,000
Yuning.

615
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,280
Tell us your thought process first.

616
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
And what you guessed.

617
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
What do you think the scenario is in the end?

618
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,520
I guessed it was that...

619
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
It's really hot here.

620
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
So I was going to hold an umbrella for the girl.

621
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,800
The girl said...

622
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
She said maybe we don't need the umbrella.

623
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,760
She said it's so hot I'm sweating.

624
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,320
I don't know.
