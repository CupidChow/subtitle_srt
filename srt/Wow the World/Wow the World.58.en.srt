1
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,691
Want some coffee?

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:04,866
Do you know how to make it?

3
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,366
Sure.

4
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,241
How many cups should we make?

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,341
How does this work?

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,641
Who wants coffee?

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,910
Let’s have a few cups.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,510
Oh.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,960
It works like this.

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,000
Special.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,430
They’ll cut one for you later.

12
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,480
Who’s drinking first?

13
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,455
Just press the button to make it.

14
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,130
I pressed it for ages and nothing happened.

15
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,780
You didn’t put it in. How do you put it in?

16
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,640
Make a heart, but you forgot the capsule.

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,665
Just pick one and put it in, it’s easy.

18
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:30,690
Where’s the capsule?

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,790
Hey, Capsule Bro!

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,715
I must be blind!

21
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,140
Just put it straight in.

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,890
Throw it in.

23
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,965
It’s out of water now.

24
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,190
It’s actually really simple.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,665
Just put the capsule in.

26
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:40,440
Press this button.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,215
Choose medium size, not large.

28
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,315
Because the cup is a bit small.

29
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:43,790
Got it.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,670
Do you know which is which?

31
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,620
I don’t mind.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,770
Making Americano is pretty much the same.

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,670
Who said that?

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,770
It’s all similar anyway.

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,745
I can’t taste the difference.

36
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,920
Just put it inside.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,295
Then press the middle button.

38
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:54,820
I think so.

39
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,250
Hey.

40
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,800
Why isn’t it coming out?

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,100
It’s fine.

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,500
Did you get it to work just now?

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
I made a cup earlier.

44
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,900
Does this side work?

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,750
Why doesn’t this side work?

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,350
It’s fine, this one can fill up.

47
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,000
Maybe it’s full and out.

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,350
Why isn’t this working?

49
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,590
No worries.

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,390
Let’s just use the other side.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,090
Why doesn’t this side work?

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,140
Michelin restaurant.

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,570
Why isn’t it working?

54
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,320
Coffee.

55
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,320
Yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,395
So let’s just have a simple meal.

57
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,070
Let’s have breakfast.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,175
Is that okay with the owner?

59
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:31,925
So professional!

60
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:32,075
Bro.

61
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:32,500
Alright.

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,100
Add two more.

63
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,650
Oops.

64
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,100
High quality.

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,320
Service staff.

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,095
Why won’t this one turn on?

67
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:44,470
This one.

68
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,870
Why won’t this one start?

69
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,270
Try holding it down.

70
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,670
Oh, it’s working now.

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,920
Not enough.

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
What’s the difference between these?

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,585
Just the flavor.

74
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:00,660
Maybe the flavors are different.

75
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,960
This is so professional!
