1
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,320
Today, the Earth Squad members

2
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,600
will continue exploring Madrid, the capital of Spain.

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,600
This building looks great, He Ge.

4
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,160
It does.

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
Is this your house?

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Let me see which one.

7
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
I can't even remember.

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,800
This one.

9
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
See, he can't even remember.

10
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
Do you remember this building?

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,520
Duke Li.

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
I need to ask my butler.

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,040
This one.

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,960
How many butlers do you have?

15
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,800
How many take care of your houses?

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,040
And ministers too.

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,280
Do you really need to count them?

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,040
Even your butlers need to count.

19
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,960
Can't even count them all.

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,040
Too many to count.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,280
Do you remember this street?

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,160
Do you like this style?

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
I do.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,800
If you like the style,

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,840
it must be mine.

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,000
What's so satisfying about this?

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,280
We're here.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Same old place.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,400
Thank you, friends.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm really happy.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Welcome to our home.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,560
Brother Naiwen has gone "crazy."

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,920
He keeps saying, "This is mine."

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,720
"And that's mine too."

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Can't say about anything else,

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
but you can use anything here.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,080
Today,

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,400
is our second day in Madrid.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
It's our second day in Madrid.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,480
We have something big to do.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
It's about our theme song.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,960
It's on the agenda now.

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,200
Last time,

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,520
after Junjun had the "kiss the shark" moment,

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,560
saw the ocean and kissed a shark,

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,200
he wrote a song about it.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Thanks to

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,920
Yuning

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
for connecting us with the production team.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,520
They helped us create our theme song.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
It's called "The World Is Super Fun."

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,840
Junjun definitely thought you were thanking him.

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,120
That's what I thought too.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,200
Yes, after Gong Jun brought it up,

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,480
we decided to make this song.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,040
So let's all thank Liu Yuning.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
Today's task is

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,320
to split into groups and finish

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
shooting the music video for the theme song.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
Alright, let's go.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,760
Let's listen to the song.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's sing along once.

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,440
Roman Avenue is closed today.

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,280
Love and beauty drifting off course,

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,320
are the little blessings of travel.

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,240
Clouds fall into the coffee cup.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,280
Ripples swirl in the wine glass.

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Meet a whale fall, kiss a shark.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Wait for the sun to rise.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,560
Didi.

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,040
Sounds great.

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,680
The world is super fun.

73
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Let's do it together.

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's stride forward together.

75
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,200
The world is so much fun.

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,040
We're not afraid of getting muddy.

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
Mud.

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
What are you doing?

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's have a chance encounter here.

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,440
That's enough.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,160
The world is so much fun.

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,400
Even upside down, it's not surprising.

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Wait, hold on.

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,920
What's wrong?

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,800
There's something on my right.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,880
Impurity.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
You sang it seriously and well.

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
Come on, sing it properly.

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,040
What key?

90
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,280
One, two, three, four, five.

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
World super

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,440
Just five words.

93
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,800
The world is super fun.

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,680
The world is super fun.

95
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't make up your own tune.

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Again.

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,080
Hidden honey.

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,400
The world is so much fun.

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,520
Secrets hidden in the scars of time.

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
You're already singing with an opera vibe.

101
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,240
The world is super interesting.

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,960
I want to go bungee jumping at the end of the world.

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,360
The world is so fascinating.

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
He's really confident.

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
See prehistoric civilizations.

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,480
Do you guys get it?

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,360
I was just here.

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
Gong Jun just left.

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,440
Now Lin Yi is here, seriously.

110
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,280
Kiss a shark.

111
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,960
No, Xingxu, you do one.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Xingxu, you're the low octave type.

113
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,440
Sing it normally.

114
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,200
Can you give me a key?

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,240
The world is super interesting.

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,960
The world is super interesting.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
Life's wrinkles hide sweetness.

118
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,200
Life's wrinkles.

119
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,080
Life's wrinkles.

120
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,240
You're even teaching others now.

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Want to go.

122
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,360
What key is this?

123
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,560
Want to go to the end of the world.

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,120
What's up with Jinzi? Jinzi.

125
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
Jin Jing is just

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,560
a natural singer.

127
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,520
Jinzi, give us one. Jinzi.

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,680
As long as you nail the beginning and end,

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,320
the song will be fine, right?

130
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,800
The world is so fascinating.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,640
Want to see prehistoric civilizations under the sea.

132
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,600
Is that okay?

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,080
Teacher Jin Jing.

134
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,880
Please come over here.

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,280
Teacher Jin Jing.

136
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,240
Come on, Jin Jing, please.

137
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
This team.

138
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,400
Welcome.

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,320
We're kind of honored.

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,600
What's going on?

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,640
Let's sing together.

142
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,600
The three of us will sing together, come on.

143
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,480
Or you can just sing by yourself.

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Go ahead and sing solo.

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,520
No, let's sing together.

146
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
Here, I'll start the key.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,160
We're A cappella.

148
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,240
There's one more thing before we start.

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
Wait a second.

150
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,200
The world is super interesting.

151
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,800
Life's wrinkles hide sweetness.

152
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Time's scars hide secrets.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Actually, it's no problem.

154
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
Because with today's technology,

155
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
as long as you make a sound,

156
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
it can all be fixed for you.

157
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
That's how it works, right?

158
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,800
Before shooting the music video,

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
let's do a warm-up together.

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
First, let's watch a dance video.

161
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,560
Play it.

162
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
This one's easy.

163
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,679
This one's easy.

164
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,919
This one.

165
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,440
Liu Yuning.

166
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to see you do this.

167
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,160
Wait a second.

168
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,600
You tall guys,

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
can do this.

170
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,840
No.

171
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,560
Let the long-legged crew handle this.

172
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,280
You have to do this.

173
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,640
Go, hurry.

174
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Looks good.

175
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,960
You should've learned it, right?

176
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,760
No, it's my first time watching.

177
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,480
Wait a second.

178
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Can I watch from the side first?

179
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll watch it once first.

180
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
So the first move is like this.

181
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
Swing.

182
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,080
Swing your left hand.

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,880
The two of us will stand in the back.

184
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
It feels like we're walking into a forest.

185
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,800
You know what I mean?

186
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,720
A forest.

187
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,680
It's better to keep some distance, seriously.

188
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,240
No, He Ge, you three do one.

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,040
I can't do it.

190
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
You three do one.

191
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,840
I can't do it.

192
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,960
Do one.

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,400
I can't do it.

194
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
I really can't do this.

195
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,800
This is basically public humiliation.

196
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,280
You know?

197
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,360
He, let's challenge them, the three of us.

198
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,640
Bro.

199
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,600
Or maybe let's just forget it.

200
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,680
I think

201
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,800
I can't swallow this.

202
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,360
Take a step back and things will get better.

203
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,840
No.

204
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,880
You three can film the front part.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,920
What do you mean?

206
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,760
What does that mean?

207
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,640
She said you three film the front part.

208
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,600
And when showing legs, it's those three.

209
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,600
But you can't show their faces.

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,360
Our faces will be shown.

211
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
But the bodies are theirs.

212
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
No, let me tell you.

213
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
This is truly throwing all dignity out the window after filming.

214
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,600
Makes sense.

215
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,760
This is pure loss of dignity.

216
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,240
Seriously.

217
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,960
Let's challenge another group.

218
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Why does this feel so familiar?

219
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
We danced this yesterday.

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Ning Ge.

221
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
I think this suits you.

222
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,440
I can't do it.

223
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,880
I can't do it.

224
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Actually, the last one was really hard to dance.

225
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,120
The last one was tough.

226
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
This one is actually the hardest.

227
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,360
This kind.

228
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,920
Because they're all professional dancers.

229
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,160
Doing this kind of dance.

230
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
The feeling is totally different.

231
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,280
Okay.

232
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,840
As long as everyone has their own subtext, it's fine.

233
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,320
Come on.

234
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,160
Come on, go ahead, come on.

235
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,280
He, you're in the middle now.

236
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm in the middle again?

237
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,800
Center position, hurry up.

238
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,560
Bro, how about this?

239
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,520
You wear sunglasses.

240
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
You stand in the middle.

241
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,240
You stand in the middle.

242
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,280
This way, it'll feel a bit less awkward.

243
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,240
Let me lend you the glasses first.

244
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,640
Just wear them for a bit.

245
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,440
I think Lin Yi should lead the dance.

246
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,800
Lin Yi, you lead.

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,240
This stage is yours.

248
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Hurry up.

249
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Lin Yi.

250
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,360
Lin Yi leads.

251
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,000
I just want to be a spectator.

252
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,400
The three of us will be in the back.

253
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,640
Come on, you lead us once.

254
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,600
Lead us once, okay?

255
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,560
Okay.

256
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,880
Let's start.

257
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,920
Darn it.

258
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,120
Darn it.

259
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
My heart hurts.

260
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,040
Where did you go? Come back quickly.

261
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,320
It's so hot, turn on the fan.

262
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,840
Might as well make a burger.

263
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
What am I even doing?

264
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Darn it.

265
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,680
How am I supposed to go out?

266
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,600
My heart hurts.

267
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,440
Where did you go? Come back quickly.

268
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,280
It's so hot, turn on the fan.

269
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm kind of throwing caution to the wind.

270
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,480
It's so hot, turn on the fan.

271
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
Here's a mini burger, does it look tasty?

272
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,040
Are you buying or not?

273
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,560
Open up your heart.

274
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:02,960
Okay.

275
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Pretty good.

276
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
What is this, seriously?

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,160
It's all about business.

278
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Got it, I got it.

279
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,640
Stand in the middle, you got it.

280
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Alright.

281
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,240
Stand in the middle.

282
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,160
Listen to my command.

283
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,640
Go.

284
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
Listen to my command.

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Ready.

286
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Go.

287
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,200
Why am I like this?

288
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,040
My heart hurts.

289
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,280
So gross, disgusting.

290
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm telling you.

291
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,720
I won't be able to go out anymore.

292
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,760
Can't go out.

293
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,360
Make a burger.

294
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,200
He's so slow.

295
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,880
You're still there.

296
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm telling you.

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
My heart keeps hurting, hurts.

298
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,160
Still hurts, hurts, hurts.

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,840
You're way too slow, bro.

300
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,360
Yeah.

301
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,800
When he's on the eighth move,

302
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,680
you're still on the second.

303
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,160
He Ge already got it.

304
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,080
Not me.

305
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Darn it.

306
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,520
My heart hurts.

307
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,040
Where did you go?

308
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Come back quickly.

309
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,480
It's so hot, turn on the fan.

310
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Here's a mini burger.

311
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,520
Does it look tasty?

312
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,400
Are you buying or not?

313
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,480
Open up your heart.

314
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,560
Okay.

315
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,240
Alright, everyone’s pretty much warmed up.

316
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,400
This is just the warm-up.

317
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,400
With the next task,

318
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,960
we’ll split into three teams.

319
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,720
It’s called “Dance Without Singing.”

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,800
The winner gets

321
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,160
the absolute highlight moment in the music video.

322
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,200
What does that mean?

323
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
Can you stop copying me?

324
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,760
It’s the climax part.

325
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,880
Give the most dazzling moment to them.

326
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,920
That’s easy.

327
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
Just one person stands in the center.

328
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,920
Strike a pose like this.

329
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
Then everyone else does this.

330
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,760
Yeah, that’s the idea.

331
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,920
Doesn’t that look cool? Right?

332
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,520
Sounds good.

333
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,000
Here are the rules for our task.

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,720
Everyone sings according to the playlist.

335
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
While singing,

336
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,880
we’ll assign forbidden words.

337
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
You can’t sing the forbidden words.

338
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,200
But you have to do the designated dance moves.

339
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,280
This is super hard.

340
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,680
If anyone does the wrong move or sings a forbidden word,

341
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,720
they lose a point.

342
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,920
The two members with the fewest deductions

343
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,480
can choose their own actors.

344
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,360
If the forbidden word is a number in the song,

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,480
then any word in the lyrics with a number

346
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,840
can’t be sung out loud.

347
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,560
When you get to a number,

348
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
you have to do the matching move.

349
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,840
Like you’re choking, right?

350
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,600
Sister, sister.

351
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Yeah.

352
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,280
Fiery red buds.

353
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,080
Our first round is the two-person forbidden word version.

354
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,680
The forbidden words are “you, me, him.”

355
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
“You” and “me”

356
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,800
are single-person forbidden moves.

357
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,880
“him” needs a two-person coordinated move.

358
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,960
Everyone splits into a group of four and a group of six.

359
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,880
Then we do the challenge.

360
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,680
After the four-person group finishes,

361
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
the member with the highest score

362
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,520
gets a chance to boost their score.

363
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,040
With the remaining five members,

364
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,760
they’ll do the six-person group challenge.

365
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay.

366
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,160
Let’s go.

367
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,320
The solo move is like this, right?

368
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Left hand, left hand, right foot.

369
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,480
The two-person move is a tap.

370
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
What kind of monster are you?

371
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,920
Why are you so strong?

372
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,040
You scared me!

373
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,120
With my weight,

374
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,160
with that move of yours,

375
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,640
I got lifted up.

376
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,520
She lifted me up.

377
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,960
Come on.

378
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,240
Which beat do we start on?

379
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,360
Ning, give us a cue.

380
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
One, two, three, sing!

381
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,760
You have her watery scent on you.

382
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,040
It’s the inferiority you gave me.

383
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,720
The love you want is too perfect.

384
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,920
I’ll never learn.

385
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,800
Can’t learn.

386
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
One, two, three, sing!

387
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,440
The one I love has already flown away.

388
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,960
The one who loves me, she—

389
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
The one who loves me, she—

390
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
Sorry.

391
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,200
I really can’t handle this girl.

392
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,160
No time to look.

393
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,600
No time to look.

394
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,200
It’s exciting here and exciting there.

395
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,200
No.

396
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm done for.

397
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,600
This is too hard.

398
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
It's just too hard.

399
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,280
People next to me are arguing.

400
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,720
There's nothing in my heart.

401
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,160
You have to believe in friendship.

402
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Then I was like, what is this?

403
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,880
There's nothing I can do.

404
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,120
Every time it gets to "him,"

405
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,680
I have to make myself act gentler.

406
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,600
No, it's just that—

407
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,680
My heart only has you, not anyone else.

408
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,240
My heart only has... nothing.

409
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,960
It's really tough for me, really tough.

410
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,120
Lin Yi keeps holding the mic.

411
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,000
And doing this to me.

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,720
Neither of us can even find where our butts are.

413
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,240
Scores don't even matter anymore.

414
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,640
I think...

415
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,080
Come on.

416
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,240
Lin Yi, minus six points.

417
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Xing Xu, minus five points.

418
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,640
He Ge, minus four; Yu Wen, minus two.

419
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,920
You can get a second chance.

420
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
I'll give this chance to Lin Yi.

421
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Let me show you all something.

422
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,080
What a bulldozer really is, okay?

423
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm telling you, he's here to stir things up.

424
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,720
The ultimate butt-bumping player.

425
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,640
Anyone on his team might get knocked flying.

426
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,360
He'll knock everyone away.

427
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,720
The big task is yours now, go for it.

428
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,640
Go easy on us.

429
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,360
Go easy with your butt.

430
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,000
Take it easy with your butt.

431
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
Seriously, still this move?

432
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,560
It has to be butt-bumping.

433
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,920
Let you all experience it.

434
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,440
Butt-bumping.

435
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Now, butt-bump.

436
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,200
Your group over there—

437
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,600
Lin Yi is a grandmaster at this.

438
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,200
Three times.

439
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,240
Let's work together—three, two, one.

440
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,800
Just a little bump is fine.

441
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,800
Pretty skinny.

442
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,000
All bones.

443
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,600
We're both all bones.

444
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,320
Left hand, right foot like this, okay?

445
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,000
Is that okay?

446
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,400
Is it like this?

447
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,360
Like this?

448
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,480
What's wrong?

449
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,280
It's okay, just be yourself, baby.

450
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,760
We're already here.

451
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,800
It's already like this.

452
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,720
Bro, come on.

453
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,160
This works.

454
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Still my daughter.

455
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,840
Knows and understands your mom and dad.

456
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,600
That's great.

457
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,400
This is good.

458
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,600
Alright, okay.

459
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,040
Awesome.

460
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,920
Awesome, daughter.

461
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,600
You saved—

462
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,720
You saved your dad.

463
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,960
Alright, three, two, one, go!

464
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
You didn't sing "is".

465
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,800
You sang "he".

466
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,280
Our hero, Little Nezha.

467
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's him, yes.

468
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,840
Little Nezha.

469
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
Six people sang with eight different rhythms.

470
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,840
We need in-ear monitors for this.

471
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,360
Yeah, we need in-ear monitors.

472
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,160
Need in-ear monitors.

473
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,320
That's hilarious.

474
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,160
We need in-ear monitors.

475
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Can't hear what I'm singing.

476
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,240
Why do you always do this when you sing?

477
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,560
Do you have to do that?

478
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,240
Little Nezha.

479
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,560
What do you mean by that?

480
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Are you going to bite someone?

481
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,800
Really? Then I'll hold back a bit.

482
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,120
It's me, it's him, it's really him.

483
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
That's right.

484
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,960
How did I do?

485
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,560
Brother Naiwen loses eight points.

486
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,440
Out.

487
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,320
Brother Honglei loses nine points.

488
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,160
Out. Honglei is out.

489
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,680
Lin Yi loses five points.

490
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,320
Lin Yi loses five points.

491
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,600
Not bad.

492
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
Wait a second.

493
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,600
He just sang a bit off-key.

494
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
But he got all the lyrics right.

495
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
Yuning loses two points.

496
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Didi and Jin Jing lose one point.

497
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,600
Didi and Jin Jing lose one point.

498
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,040
We did pretty well.

499
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,760
Next up is the last song.

500
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,840
There's more.

501
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,280
All nine members will take on the challenge together.

502
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,320
Darn it.

503
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
This round's forbidden words are "you", "me", and "him".

504
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,280
Forbidden word gesture.

505
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Come on, show everyone.

506
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,320
What is that?

507
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,840
Just like this.

508
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,640
It's like a stiff neck.

509
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Stiff neck.

510
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
Then tilt to the right like this.

511
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,880
There's some intensity in it.

512
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,400
Bro looks like he's threatening someone.

513
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,640
Like he's pressing you down.

514
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,280
Yuning.

515
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,360
Do you want to show everyone?

516
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,040
You have to move your hips too.

517
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,720
I can do it, bro.

518
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
He's so playful.

519
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,280
Just change it to this.

520
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,160
Bro, it's your turn.

521
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
What's wrong?

522
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,640
A bit too cute.

523
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,680
I give his attitude full marks.

524
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,480
Very charismatic.

525
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,680
Right?

526
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,800
And that mouth movement.

527
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Come on.

528
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,920
Come on.

529
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Back then, we wanted to break up.

530
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
Break up, then break up.

531
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,480
Back then, we wanted to break up.

532
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,280
Break up, then break up.

533
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,240
Now you want to win me back with true love.

534
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
Trying to coax me back.

535
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,760
Love isn't something you can just sell.

536
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,880
You can't sell it just because you want to.

537
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,880
Let go, let it be clear.

538
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Love that lets go.

539
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,600
What are you singing?

540
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,240
What are you singing?

541
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,280
Everything feels...

542
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Turns out, it is...

543
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,120
The main song.

544
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,840
What are you saying?

545
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,800
You remember it after hearing it once.

546
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I didn't get a single thing wrong.

547
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I didn't get a single thing wrong.

548
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,960
But next to you,

549
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,200
I really can't find the key.

550
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,560
Why are we reciting it now?

551
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,040
I don't know.

552
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
If we don't recite, it's fine.

553
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,600
Everyone's rapping.

554
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,760
Yeah, rapping.

555
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,360
That's weird.

556
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,000
Not bad.

557
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,320
I definitely didn't get anything wrong.

558
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm so nervous.

559
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,760
Next, we'll announce the total scores for all three rounds.

560
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,560
We'll start with fourth place.

561
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,320
Yu Wen and Naiwen Ge

562
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,840
Nine points.

563
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,440
Third place: Yu Ning, eight points.

564
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,520
Second place.

565
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
Jin Jing

566
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
Four points.

567
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,320
Our overall runner-up.

568
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
Should we give something now,

569
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,040
like flowers or something?

570
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,520
Just keep it.

571
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,920
The overall champion of this dance round is

572
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,680
Didi

573
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,880
Three points.

574
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,280
Thank you, I worked really hard.

575
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,040
Can't lose face.

576
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,360
First and second place become team captains.

577
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,520
Each captain picks two people for their team.

578
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
The remaining three will form a team automatically.

579
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,240
Come on, I miss my brother.

580
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,520
Bro

581
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,120
Bro

582
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,640
Okay.

583
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,760
I'll pick my brother first.

584
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,520
Congrats to He Ge for joining the champion team.

585
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,120
Congrats.

586
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
My turn.

587
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,000
Then I'll pick my bro too.

588
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,560
Ning Ge

589
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,160
Well deserved.

590
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,640
Wifey

591
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,360
Show off your amazing charm now.

592
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,280
Wifey

593
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
And then we keep going, right?

594
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,640
Right.

595
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,640
Didi

596
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Didi

597
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,240
Didi

598
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,560
Wait, if Didi picks you,

599
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,040
she can only pick one.

600
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,400
Can you two be separated?

601
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Never thought of that.

602
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm truly honored.

603
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,760
But why, though?

604
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,040
Why?

605
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,480
I want to hear it.

606
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,800
Mainly, the three of us

607
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,080
aren't that strong.

608
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,440
We just really want to compete with the two pros.

609
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,160
Test our skills against you.

610
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,280
Compare ourselves in the music video.

611
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,960
We want to give it a try.

612
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
We've never competed with you two before.

613
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,440
Hope you both give it your all this time.

614
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,520
Let's go all out.

615
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,040
Looking forward to it.

616
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,560
Alright?

617
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,000
We just like seeing you together.

618
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,440
And splitting you up

619
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,040
would be too cruel.

620
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,360
Wifey, stand up.

621
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Now it's our turn to pick someone.

622
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,360
They even got picked back.

623
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,760
Now it's Yi and Wen.

624
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,680
We pick one of them.

625
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,320
Go ahead.

626
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,440
You want me to pick back?

627
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,760
Why did you two leave?

628
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,200
You do it.

629
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
Who do you really want?

630
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,080
Honestly,

631
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,160
I want Yu Wen.

632
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,160
And why is that?

633
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,440
Because of our Italian

634
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,120
company connection.

635
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,640
We could tell

636
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,240
you really wanted to join us.

637
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah.

638
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,880
Right?

639
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,680
Let's go with Yu Wen, okay?

640
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,560
Okay.

641
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,800
Yi Ge, take me with you.

642
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,840
Next, everyone can head to Vintage Street.

643
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,920
After picking your music video outfits,

644
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
start filming.

645
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Every street in Madrid

646
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,360
can be your filming location.

647
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,120
Alright.

648
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,760
Can we film one for Junjun too?

649
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,040
Just help him shoot one.

650
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,600
Sure.

651
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,840
We do have Junjun's face here.

652
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Okay.

653
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,560
We need him for the kissing shark scene.

654
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,280
We'll definitely use him.

655
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,720
Let's go.

656
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,360
Let's go.

657
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,160
We have a

658
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,960
video editing genius

659
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,320
No

660
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,920
I think

661
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,960
our natural advantage

662
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
is already

663
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,800
Yeah

664
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,760
He Ge is so good at filming

665
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,120
Seriously, he's amazing at it

666
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,880
Mainly, he's super creative

667
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,960
Just think about it

668
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Gotta film when we eat.

669
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,440
Gotta film when we eat.

670
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,240
Gotta film when we shop for clothes.

671
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,120
Gotta film when we shop for clothes.

672
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,760
Gotta film the outfit changes too.

673
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,440
Gotta film the outfit changes.

674
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,200
Yeah.

675
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,640
Didi.

676
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,120
Can you come up with something later?

677
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,720
Just something simple.

678
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,160
I want you to make it.

679
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Just one—

680
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,760
Or two moves.

681
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,160
Okay.

682
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
So we can stand in front of fans,

683
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,200
and get them to join us,

684
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,440
dance together.

685
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,320
So fans can easily learn it.

686
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,520
Alright.

687
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,440
Just keep repeating it.

688
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:24,920
No problem.

689
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,440
Just five or six seconds, seven or eight seconds.

690
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,080
Let me think.

691
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,920
Summing it up in one sentence—

692
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,560
We want to edit it into

693
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,160
a very relaxed and beautiful vlog.

694
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,880
A fast-paced vlog.

695
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,120
Yeah, the kind young people like.

696
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,760
For our music video,

697
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,880
should we go for a realistic style or abstract?

698
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,520
Abstract.

699
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,360
Purely abstract.

700
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Abstract.

701
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,240
Purely abstract.

702
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,880
So you never know

703
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,120
what’s coming next.

704
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
Right.

705
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,840
I think the three of us might be too traditional.

706
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,560
Not really working.

707
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,720
Seems like the three of us—

708
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,560
She’s seen a lot.

709
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
She’s into abstract stuff.

710
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,200
She’s watched a lot.

711
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,680
Yeah.

712
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Yu Wen reads a lot.

713
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,920
Abstract is the way to go.

714
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,720
And for a music video, I think

715
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,440
we can use some fisheye shots.

716
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,200
360 shots.

717
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,560
Let’s make it fun, interesting, and catchy.

718
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:04,640
Alright.

719
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,000
Right?

720
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
We can’t really do

721
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
that super romantic idol drama style,

722
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
but ours will be memorable enough.

723
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,560
Right?

724
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,160
Those are our lyrics, right?

725
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,440
So we can shoot however we want.

726
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,200
That fleeting moment when I met you.

727
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,920
Randomly going on a trip together.

728
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,520
Now we have a story for three people.

729
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,760
It’s a secret crush story.

730
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,160
Just as an example—

731
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,520
You two are a couple.

732
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,320
And I secretly like you.

733
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,240
Right?

734
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,480
You treat me as your best friend.

735
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
And always have me tag along

736
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,520
when you go out with your boyfriend.

737
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,760
But deep down, I’m in love with you.

738
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,600
Yeah.

739
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,880
Or we could film something like that.

740
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,480
A plot like “Child of Time.”

741
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,960
You’re my partner.

742
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,040
Then you pass away.

743
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
Your soul wants him

744
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,960
to stay with me instead.

745
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,520
Yeah.

746
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520
But I don’t want to accept him.

747
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,040
Right.

748
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
But then you realize

749
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,720
I remember everything about you.

750
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,160
What you liked to eat.

751
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,080
Later, I realize

752
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,760
I’m starting to like him a little.

753
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,440
But I won’t admit it.

754
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,880
Because I’m still thinking about you.

755
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,360
The you who’s gone.

756
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,160
Pretending in front of others

757
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,720
that I’m fine.

758
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,800
But actually,

759
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
it really hurts.

760
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,480
It’s that kind of feeling.

761
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,080
But you just won’t accept it.

762
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,160
Yeah.

763
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,760
So heartbreaking.

764
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,840
You’re amazing.

765
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,880
Like filming a bodyguard movie

766
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,000
Have you seen that movie?

767
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,560
No

768
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,160
So he's your bodyguard

769
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,080
And I'm the assassin

770
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,640
Then he gets hurt

771
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,320
And then you...

772
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,880
You realize while he's protecting you

773
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,760
You fall in love with him

774
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,000
And I'm just the pure villain

775
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,640
Right when the knife is about to stab your eye

776
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,160
Then you wake up

777
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,760
And realize it was all a dream

778
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,480
That works

779
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,160
That story just now

780
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,760
If we use it as an example

781
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,840
He's your bodyguard

782
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,600
During this process

783
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,840
You might fall in love with him

784
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,880
Then I try to kill once

785
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,560
But I fail

786
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,480
And he gets hurt

787
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,200
But in the end, you protect him

788
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
I like this

789
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,320
But it's hard to explain this plot

790
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,880
How many?

791
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,200
These character relationships are too complicated

792
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,360
First, we have to explain that both of us are bodyguards

793
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,960
Then also explain that I'm the traitor

794
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,520
This kind of place is great for filming

795
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,280
Yeah

796
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,520
Madrid Vintage Street

797
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,160
It's one of the most unique

798
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,480
and creative neighborhoods in Madrid

799
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,840
Near Gran Via

800
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,320
and Plaza de Cibeles

801
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,360
The area is known for its Bohemian style

802
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,040
and rich historical background

803
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,800
and vibrant youth culture

804
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,680
Today we are

805
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,480
going for retro disco

806
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,160
No scheming

807
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,120
We stand together against a common enemy

808
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,560
Right

809
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,160
United as one

810
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,880
United as one

811
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,720
This line

812
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,480
Who are you saying that to?

813
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,960
No one in particular

814
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,000
I just wanted to express it

815
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Isn't this a vintage shop?

816
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,560
Is this the one?

817
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,680
Is it this one?

818
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,720
Let's go in and take a look

819
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,320
Okay

820
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,200
Hello

821
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,240
Hello

822
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,760
Hello

823
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,560
Yes, yes

824
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,120
Ask if they have anything from the 80s

825
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,200
Disco outfits

826
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,080
Sure

827
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,000
Let's ask

828
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,600
Do you have anything from the 80s?

829
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,880
Yes, from the 80s

830
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,800
We really can't communicate with her

831
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,720
I'll use that

832
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,400
Your phone

833
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,480
I'll use the built-in Apple translator to ask

834
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,680
Hello, do you have any clothes from the 80s?

835
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Is it in Spanish?

836
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,920
Yes.

837
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,480
Yes.

838
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,560
This one's a bit expensive.

839
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,280
What's this?

840
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,800
Let's go to the next shop.

841
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,800
Okay.

842
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,360
Thank you.

843
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,800
Let's go.

844
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,000
Thank you.

845
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,560
Goodbye.

846
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,800
So cute.

847
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,360
Very pretty.

848
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,560
So actually,

849
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,080
The story doesn't seem very clear.

850
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,520
Yeah.

851
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm just worried that

852
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,639
Or maybe we could just

853
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,440
have no story at all.

854
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
Just

855
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
a realistic style.

856
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,840
What do you mean?

857
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,960
Just use some movements

858
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,320
to express the meaning of the lyrics.

859
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,760
That "Yellow" music video,

860
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,840
isn't it just the lead singer

861
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,639
walking like this the whole time?

862
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,440
The three of us could just keep walking like this.

863
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
And sing.

864
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,280
Sounds good.

865
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,679
Dance.

866
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,800
Do you want some ice cream?

867
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's have one.

868
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,120
I want some.

869
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,800
It's so hot today.

870
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,800
What flavor do you want?

871
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
I want chocolate.

872
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,000
What do you want?

873
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,360
What do you want?

874
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,760
Mango.

875
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,440
Mango.

876
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,000
One mango.

877
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,040
Mango.

878
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
One chocolate.

879
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
One of this.

880
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Okay, thank you.

881
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,800
Okay, thank you.

882
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,480
Thank you.

883
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,360
You eat ice cream so nicely.

884
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Just like a little kid.

885
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,920
I am a little kid.

886
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,600
How do adults eat?

887
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,040
Adults eat like this.

888
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,800
Adults eat this way.

889
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,720
Why are you so well-behaved?

890
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
I want to play the villain.

891
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,400
You want to play the villain?

892
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,160
Play a villain.

893
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,240
Such a stereotypical villain.

894
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,120
He did a bit in the car.

895
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,880
The villain he's supposed to play.

896
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,520
Show him how you'd act it.

897
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,880
You really look broken.

898
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,600
An extremely evil villain.

899
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,240
A broken person.

900
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,200
A broken person.

901
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,840
A broken person.

902
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,640
Let's study the script.

903
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,480
Time to start shopping for costumes.

904
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,360
Okay.

905
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,120
This is selling.

906
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,400
It means selling second-hand clothes.

907
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,720
Right?

908
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,680
Should we go for something brighter, or...

909
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay.

910
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,640
This suit.

911
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,840
It's actually pretty good.

912
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,880
It's like something from Friends.

913
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,240
Surprisingly.

914
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,640
It unexpectedly matches.

915
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,680
Feels like it goes with your outfit.

916
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,720
Yeah, it does.

917
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,760
Looks good.

918
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,480
This one looks nice.

919
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,960
Looks good.

920
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,520
Looks good.

921
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,000
Pretty nice.

922
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,840
This is really nice.

923
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,960
This one's really special.

924
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,640
Feels kind of Turkish.

925
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,160
Ross Geller.

926
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,120
Friends.

927
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,280
Really.

928
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,720
Is it this one?

929
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,440
This one's good.

930
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,040
The color is nice.

931
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,040
Looks good.

932
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,680
Really nice.

933
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,360
Very artistic.

934
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,440
Like that artist.

935
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
This whole tie.

936
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,600
Really brightens up your outfit.

937
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,960
You could actually wear a tie.

938
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,840
I don't have a shirt.

939
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,680
You don't need a shirt for a tie these days.

940
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,400
Dear.

941
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,640
Just tie it straight around your neck.

942
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,400
Tie it directly on your neck.

943
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,640
Yeah.

944
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,880
This looks good.

945
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,840
We really look like those people on the street.

946
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Singing a cappella.

947
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,640
Alright.

948
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,800
Let's go.

949
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Let's go.

950
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,760
This has already started...

951
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,520
Is this our music video now?

952
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,520
This one.

953
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,880
This tie-dye shirt looks pretty good.

954
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,920
Yeah.

955
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,040
What do you think? Is this okay?

956
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,680
I think it's pretty good.

957
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,040
If three of us wear it, it'll be awesome.

958
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,640
Sounds good.

959
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,760
Kind of explosive.

960
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,280
Hello.

961
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,120
Hello.

962
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,880
Hello.

963
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,520
This kind.

964
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,880
Actually, it's pretty nice.

965
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,040
We could each get one of these.

966
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,640
Floral shirt.

967
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,560
How should we match them? Let me think.

968
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
Let's go for that...

969
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,040
How about a bold, colorful palette style?

970
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,680
Sure, dopamine vibes.

971
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,520
No problem.

972
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,160
Not a problem at all.

973
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,160
Did you see that one just now?

974
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,640
It's similar to this.

975
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,000
This kind of explosive style.

976
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,440
The pants are here, bro.

977
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,600
Grab a blue one for contrast.

978
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,840
Bro, what do you think of this green?

979
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
It's pretty bold.

980
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,840
Honestly,

981
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,360
yours looks great.

982
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,960
It goes well with outfits.

983
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,640
Is it good?

984
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,960
Look, blue and green for us.

985
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,640
Pick one.

986
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I think this one's nice.

987
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:45,880
Sure.

988
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,640
I want to try this one.

989
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:47,960
Okay.

990
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,240
There are more options here too.

991
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,640
Alright.

992
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,360
Which one do you like?

993
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,120
I'm good with any.

994
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,680
Either works for me.

995
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
Let's just change clothes then.

996
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,000
It's my first time changing pants on the show.

997
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,000
Are you filming this too?

998
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,640
You want to watch this too?

999
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:00,880
Go ahead.

1000
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,280
It seems like you...

1001
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
This spot isn't great to come in.

1002
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,720
Everyone take a shot before going in.

1003
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,520
Each person takes one.

1004
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,600
Just show off a bit.

1005
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,680
Then go in.

1006
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
Flashy young man.

1007
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,640
Wait a second.

1008
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
I'll go find a top.

1009
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,920
Otherwise, it's way too flashy.

1010
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,640
Is it too tight?

1011
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
His is super tight.

1012
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,040
Mine's actually a bit sexy, bro.

1013
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,760
Mine might be tight too.

1014
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,040
This one's a bit too sexy.

1015
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,560
This one has a vibe.

1016
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,920
Would this be better?

1017
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,440
Let me see.

1018
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,160
Let me check.

1019
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Pure flashy young man.

1020
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,160
What's up?

1021
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
We look like three lunatics.

1022
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,320
So over the top.

1023
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,120
I think we look awesome.

1024
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,400
How about this one?

1025
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,880
Chen Xingxu.

1026
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,920
Take off your jacket first.

1027
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
Let's stand up together for a group shot.

1028
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,800
Hold on.

1029
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,920
What?

1030
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
Did you expect this effect?

1031
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,640
Guys,

1032
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,000
Wait a second.

1033
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,640
Let me see what's going on.

1034
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,000
Stretch out your arms.

1035
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,600
Seriously, guys,

1036
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,480
we're so over the top.

1037
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm really over the top.

1038
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,120
We're the boldest on this street.

1039
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,760
The coolest guys.

1040
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,720
Should we cover up a bit?

1041
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,200
Trust me.

1042
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,840
No one's bolder than us.

1043
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,360
This really is...

1044
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,000
But can I get a bigger one?

1045
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,600
This one's really too small.

1046
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,000
Really, trust me.

1047
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,880
Trust me.

1048
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,360
Way too over the top.

1049
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,280
Seriously, way too much.

1050
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,000
Let's wrap up this part.

1051
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,360
It's done.

1052
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,000
It's already way too much.

1053
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,720
Seriously, we're way too over the top now.

1054
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,120
Ours is...

1055
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,760
We're all afraid they'll see us too soon.

1056
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,880
They might copy us right away.

1057
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,840
Ran into them.

1058
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,240
Tie-dye style.

1059
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,880
So, do we look cool or not?

1060
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,760
They're going for this colorful style.

1061
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,240
Yeah.

1062
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
We just came up with this on the spot.

1063
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Seeing us like this now,

1064
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,760
are you guys crazy or what?

1065
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,720
Not really.

1066
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,640
It's alright.

1067
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,200
It's okay.

1068
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,960
You have no idea what we just did.

1069
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,000
We picked out some wild stuff.

1070
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
From that era.

1071
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,280
Isn't this kind better?

1072
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,640
Yeah.

1073
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1074
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,000
Disco!

1075
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,040
We're totally different from you guys.

1076
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,400
Our styles are completely different.

1077
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm going to wear a skirt.

1078
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,120
Did you guys just lose instantly?

1079
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,760
We lost.

1080
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,120
If you wear a skirt, I’ll have to wear a swimsuit.

1081
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,120
You want to wear a swimsuit?

1082
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,000
Then you win.

1083
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,880
We're heading out.

1084
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,600
Good luck, guys.

1085
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:08,960
Alright.

1086
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,280
Their team uniforms.

1087
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Let’s add some sequins to ours.

1088
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,680
I think this works.

1089
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
Brother Honglei, pick one for me.

1090
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,200
This one.

1091
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,240
So now we're picking outfits for each other, right?

1092
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,640
Naiwen.

1093
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,840
How about Yu Wen wears this?

1094
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,640
You should wear something underneath.

1095
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,360
Like a tank top or a T-shirt.

1096
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,720
Sure.

1097
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,000
What's this?

1098
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,840
Do you have leather pants?

1099
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,000
Your style should match too.

1100
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,720
This one's for the two of us.

1101
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
This is for women.

1102
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,360
Naiwen and I are going to wear these pants.

1103
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,600
But these are for women.

1104
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,120
Brother Honglei, really?

1105
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,240
This is really throwing all dignity out the window.

1106
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,440
People dressed like this for disco back then.

1107
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,120
Sun Honglei, are you crazy?

1108
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,000
Isn't this retro?

1109
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,600
Aren't you an actor?

1110
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
If you find it for me, I'll wear it.

1111
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,200
Flared pants.

1112
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,680
I'll find them for you right now.

1113
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,480
Not flared pants.

1114
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,040
Spandex pants.

1115
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,080
You don't know about those?

1116
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,280
They're fully covering.

1117
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,160
Super tight, you know?

1118
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,800
Do you know what "super tight" means?

1119
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,080
I know, it's embarrassing.

1120
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
So is this okay?

1121
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,680
Which one?

1122
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,160
This set.

1123
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,960
What kind of taste is this?

1124
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,800
Is this one alright?

1125
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,200
Wait a second.

1126
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,280
I want to find something gold.

1127
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,280
Retro means the uglier, the better.

1128
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,520
Back then, you know this was a stage costume.

1129
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,200
I know.

1130
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,520
Doesn't gold with gold look good?

1131
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,640
This looks nice.

1132
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,200
I picked it because it looks good, bro.

1133
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,080
If you ask me,

1134
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,160
it's unique.

1135
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,680
It has that vintage vibe.

1136
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,720
This one is more distinctive.

1137
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,160
We're just being creative, director.

1138
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,760
Should we follow the style of that era?

1139
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,280
Back then,

1140
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,040
Let me tell you, Yu Wen,

1141
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,480
At our age,

1142
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,000
Back then,

1143
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,240
Anyone who wore this was considered a superstar.

1144
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,960
Like the Heilongjiang Song and Dance Troupe,

1145
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,000
only they could wear sequins.

1146
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,760
Really?

1147
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,400
Yes, really.

1148
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,440
And they wore those high heels too.

1149
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,880
Exactly.

1150
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,440
Brother Honglei, you're not being sincere.

1151
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,200
Right?

1152
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,680
It had to be those high heels.

1153
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,480
Black ones.

1154
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
With a strap here.

1155
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Back then, they came from Guangdong.

1156
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,800
They were called travel shoes.

1157
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,440
White, pure white sneakers.

1158
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,160
Do you remember that song?

1159
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,640
The sun, the sun,

1160
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,520
is like a golden shuttle.

1161
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,920
The moon is like a silver shuttle.

1162
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,640
Handing it to you.

1163
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,680
He even held a scarf.

1164
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,080
Yeah.

1165
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,400
And did tap dancing.

1166
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,920
Just imagine it with your eyes closed.

1167
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,520
That's the vibe.

1168
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:35,720
Right.

1169
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,480
Picture it with your eyes closed.

1170
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,040
And then,

1171
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,000
Clothes like these,

1172
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,800
Yeah, you can feel it.

1173
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,240
Right?

1174
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:40,960
Not bad.

1175
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,280
Right?

1176
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah?

1177
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
What kind of pants?

1178
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,400
Spandex pants, full coverage.

1179
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,280
Body-hugging spandex pants.

1180
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,760
Makes your legs look long, right?

1181
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,640
Yeah, very slender.

1182
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,880
Back then, travel shoes were top-tier.

1183
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,120
It was lucky to even get a pair.

1184
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,440
They were all brought from abroad.

1185
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:53,800
Let me tell you,

1186
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
They were called Hong Kong, China shirts.

1187
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,880
Yeah, Hong Kong, China shirts.

1188
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,320
Right?

1189
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,880
Hong Kong, China shirts.

1190
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,560
And Hong Kong, China shoes.

1191
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,560
We've been through it.

1192
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,120
How about this,

1193
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,320
You guys pick out an outfit first.

1194
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,840
Let me see.

1195
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,360
Alright.

1196
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,840
I can wear this, bro.

1197
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,360
Sure.

1198
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,840
But look, there's none here.

1199
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,120
You guys pick out an outfit first.

1200
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,880
I'll see if our styles match overall.

1201
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,120
Okay.

1202
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,240
These flared pants.

1203
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,440
Yeah, these are good.

1204
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,560
I'll take this one.

1205
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,880
Bro, you take this one.

1206
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,200
Yu Wen.

1207
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,960
How about pairing this with that?

1208
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,920
Actually, it looks pretty good.

1209
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,960
Bro, you should try one.

1210
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,640
This one, the pink one.

1211
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,120
Is this okay?

1212
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
This one's good.

1213
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,680
What about the size?

1214
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,760
The size is about right too.

1215
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,160
Is it okay?

1216
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,560
Yeah.

1217
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,200
This looks nice.

1218
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,240
It's good.

1219
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,960
Add those bright red pants too.

1220
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,080
This seems about right.

1221
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,960
Alright.

1222
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,480
How about a leather skirt like this?

1223
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,640
Sure, I can do a leather skirt.

1224
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,600
Pink leather skirt.

1225
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,080
Pair it with your yellow belt.

1226
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,200
See?

1227
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,680
This works.

1228
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,000
I agree with this outfit.

1229
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,560
Brother Naiwen has great taste.

1230
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:47,920
Right?

1231
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,840
That was the trendiest back then.

1232
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,360
Those Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, China stars,

1233
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,440
We were at the top of the game.

1234
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,200
Alright, the three of us will go try them on.

1235
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,880
Let's change outfits.

1236
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,400
Let's go.

1237
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,000
Time to change.

1238
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,480
This is really nice.

1239
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,160
So trendy.

1240
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,880
Right?

1241
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,760
I have a feeling.

1242
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,960
I'm about to make a dazzling entrance.

1243
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,160
It’s spot on.

1244
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,040
How is it?

1245
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,200
Then we do this dance.

1246
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,000
The two of us, like this.

1247
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,840
Back then, we could've made it onto a calendar.

1248
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,840
We found our crew, the three of us.

1249
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,320
Strike a pose.

1250
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,400
How’s that?

1251
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,000
Is it cool?

1252
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,120
Do we look like Ninja Turtles?

1253
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,600
You have a rat master.

1254
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Yeah, there is one.

1255
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,120
Alright, let’s go with this set.

1256
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,200
I think it’s awesome.

1257
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,440
Let’s shoot a slow-motion shot.

1258
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,360
We need a group shot.

1259
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah.

1260
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,800
Let’s go.

1261
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:09,760
Let’s move.

1262
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,360
So many fans.

1263
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Feels so strange.

1264
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,040
Bro.

1265
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,640
We’re really throwing all dignity out the window this time.

1266
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,960
Why is there a trash can here?

1267
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,480
Let’s go in.

1268
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,320
Heading home.

1269
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,520
Let’s go dance.

1270
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:33,880
Dance.

1271
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,600
I think we look pretty cool.

1272
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,640
So cool.

1273
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,480
Super cool.

1274
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,880
A sight to see.

1275
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,440
Back to the 80s.

1276
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,520
Still this cool.

1277
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,120
You know,

1278
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,080
Is it really about the clothes?

1279
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Is it the styling?

1280
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,480
It’s all about the person.

1281
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,240
It’s the person.

1282
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,000
Let’s go home.

1283
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,240
We’re heading home.

1284
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,280
Come on.

1285
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,760
Start right in the shadows.

1286
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,320
Let’s jump.

1287
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,120
Step out from the shadows.

1288
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,080
Then jump into the sunlight.

1289
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,200
Sounds good.

1290
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,080
Let’s be passionate.

1291
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,720
The 80s had such vibrant energy.

1292
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,320
Are we pulling a rope?

1293
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,080
Or cleaning a window?

1294
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,120
Coming in from both sides.

1295
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,960
Alright.

1296
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,840
Five, six, seven, eight.

1297
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,080
The world is super fun.

1298
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,560
Life’s wrinkles hide sweetness.

1299
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,080
The world is so interesting.

1300
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,120
Time’s scars hide secrets.

1301
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,160
The world is super fun.

1302
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,520
I want to sail to the edge of the universe.

1303
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:39,800
Get ready.

1304
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,120
Five, four, three, two, one.

1305
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,160
So interesting.

1306
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,160
Want to see the ocean floor.

1307
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,720
Alright.

1308
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,840
Stop.

1309
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,320
Okay.

1310
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,720
We synced up without me even calling action.

1311
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,440
Such great teamwork.

1312
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,160
Let’s form a group today.

1313
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,960
We’re a group today.

1314
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,640
Let’s take a look.

1315
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:56,960
Take a look.

1316
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,280
Check it out.

1317
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,960
Director, take a look.

1318
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,200
Alright.

1319
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,480
Looks good.

1320
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,720
Perfect.

1321
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,960
Perfect.

1322
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,440
Perfect.

1323
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,480
Mission accomplished.

1324
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,120
We’re done for the day.

1325
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,520
Work’s over.

1326
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,400
Let’s stop filming for now.

1327
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,560
Bro, does it feel like you’re not wearing clothes?

1328
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,280
Yeah.

1329
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,680
Never felt this vulnerable.

1330
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,000
Our other brothers,

1331
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,880
How did their shots turn out?

1332
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,600
I’m going to shoot a close-up now.

1333
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,360
Just a few close-ups.

1334
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,320
Add the one with three people.

1335
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,440
Just one or two seconds is enough.

1336
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,080
Look, for example,

1337
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,080
You with me here, like this.

1338
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,840
Or with him, over here.

1339
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,200
Then another one does a flip.

1340
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,840
Three is enough.

1341
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,720
Yeah, that works.

1342
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,360
That's enough.

1343
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,240
Okay, your turn, over here.

1344
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,720
That's enough.

1345
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,480
Alright, I'll do the upper body.

1346
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,240
Upper body, right.

1347
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,480
Let me do one.

1348
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,880
Just take two steps and spin around.

1349
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,720
Okay, that's enough.

1350
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,360
That's good, enough.

1351
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,880
Alright, no one here now.

1352
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,600
Quick, get the three people shot.

1353
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,560
Hurry, walk to the center.

1354
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:12,720
Cool or not?

1355
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,200
The coolest way.

1356
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,080
Walk in the wildest way.

1357
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,720
Alright.

1358
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
You can do it your own way.

1359
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,960
Ready, one, two, three, go.

1360
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,720
Just like that.

1361
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,840
For dancing, just march in place.

1362
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,600
Alright, that's good.

1363
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,160
We need a side-by-side walk shot too.

1364
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,000
Okay.

1365
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,080
Lift your head a bit, smile more.

1366
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:54,880
Is that good?

1367
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,120
That's fine.

1368
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,560
That's enough.

1369
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,080
Ice cream.

1370
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,360
Let's buy some ice cream.

1371
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,680
Ice cream.

1372
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Brother, ice cream.

1373
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,720
Why do I feel like I'm with two fools?

1374
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,320
Just now, listen to Chen Xingxu.

1375
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,640
Ice cream.

1376
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,320
Brother.

1377
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,840
Ice cream.

1378
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,720
Come on, let's get ice cream.

1379
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,880
This one.

1380
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,440
In this kind of

1381
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,080
It's pretty nice on this avenue.

1382
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,560
What do you think?

1383
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,240
This is pretty beautiful too.

1384
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,360
Nothing here looks bad.

1385
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,120
We need to bring over a camera.

1386
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,880
You stand in the middle.

1387
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,760
Then, yeah.

1388
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,440
Then start shaking.

1389
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,720
One, two, three.

1390
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:32,720
Spread out.

1391
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:33,720
Alright, that's good.

1392
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,080
Find a spot.

1393
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,600
That chair, bring it over.

1394
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,080
Then here, I can do it.

1395
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,920
Just grab whatever.

1396
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,600
Just eating ice cream.

1397
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,200
Just happily eating ice cream, however you like.

1398
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:47,920
Okay.

1399
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,600
Ridiculous.

1400
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,200
Isn't that ridiculous?

1401
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,600
We've got everything sorted here.

1402
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,120
We can shoot inside here.

1403
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,080
Retiro Park is located

1404
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
in the center of Madrid, Spain.

1405
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,920
It's one of the city's most famous

1406
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,040
and most popular parks.

1407
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,960
It was built in the 17th century.

1408
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,280
Commissioned by King Felipe IV of Spain.

1409
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,960
It served as a royal hunting ground and summer palace.

1410
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,600
Later, it gradually opened to the public.

1411
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,640
Alright, let's do it this way.

1412
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,760
Let me try this.

1413
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,920
I'll try this angle.

1414
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,840
We're filming the running out part.

1415
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,800
Because we need this sunlight.

1416
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,800
I want that backlight.

1417
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,680
So as soon as you hold hands, look at the camera.

1418
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,240
And then...

1419
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,280
When you pull her to run,

1420
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,200
she should also look at the camera.

1421
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,760
Right.

1422
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,920
Yes, that's the audience's perspective.

1423
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
I'll take over and film her. Come on.

1424
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,160
Alright, ready? One, two, three.

1425
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:35,920
Go.

1426
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:36,960
Look at the camera.

1427
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,680
Turn your face.

1428
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,440
Run again, run forward.

1429
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,000
Turn your head over there.

1430
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Great, that's perfect.

1431
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,240
Awesome.

1432
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,280
That's good.

1433
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:51,560
Looks good.

1434
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,920
Nice.

1435
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,480
We want this kind.

1436
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:53,840
Exactly this.

1437
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,280
That's it.

1438
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,000
Next shot.

1439
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,920
Wait a second.

1440
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,160
Hold on.

1441
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,800
Say it.

1442
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,280
We'll go over to him,

1443
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,040
the saxophone is playing there,

1444
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,320
and we'll dance next to him.

1445
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,040
That's the vibe.

1446
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,480
Okay, the big one at the end.

1447
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,160
No, just dance.

1448
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,240
Let's get some footage first.

1449
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,520
Alright.

1450
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:10,840
Okay.

1451
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,200
Alright, teacher.

1452
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,480
You stand right in front.

1453
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Shoot from a fixed position.

1454
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,640
Then the three of us will run into the frame.

1455
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,040
And then like this.

1456
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,240
Okay.

1457
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,000
Thank you.

1458
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,040
Alright, that's good.

1459
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,600
Ready, three, two, one.

1460
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,160
You pull us along.

1461
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,120
I think we should do a group dance.

1462
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:51,800
What's this?

1463
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,080
That's enough.

1464
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,320
Let's go. Set out.

1465
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,160
Okay.

1466
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,640
He did it again.

1467
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,960
Thank you.

1468
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,400
Thanks.

1469
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,360
Take a look.

1470
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,800
Let's take a look.

1471
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,320
Check.

1472
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,520
Awesome.

1473
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,600
You're so cool.

1474
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,600
Beautiful.

1475
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,880
Where did this sunny boy come from?

1476
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,400
Nice, cool.

1477
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,640
Great, let's go.

1478
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,000
Alright.

1479
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,040
Can we shoot some POV shots?

1480
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,720
Yeah.

1481
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,480
Like it's from my perspective.

1482
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,080
But he turns around.

1483
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:26,880
Got it.

1484
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,280
Pull me and smile.

1485
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,400
Right.

1486
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,120
Then put your hand...

1487
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,800
Move your hand here.

1488
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,560
A bit higher.

1489
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,240
Teacher, guide his hand to film us.

1490
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,560
Okay.

1491
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,840
So it's his POV.

1492
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,160
Yeah.

1493
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,040
I'm talking to Jin Jing.

1494
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,320
Lin Yi, leave some space.

1495
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,840
Look a bit forward.

1496
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,320
Alright, awesome.

1497
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,400
This shot like this.

1498
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,800
Let this shot connect to the last one.

1499
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,520
Exit the frame.

1500
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,840
Is this okay?

1501
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,760
This one just now.

1502
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,120
It's fine.

1503
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,080
That's the vibe.

1504
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,760
Good.

1505
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Next, we'll go with this.

1506
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,080
Add a bit of sunlight sometimes.

1507
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,280
Expose some light, yeah.

1508
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,280
We need to add some lip-syncing shots.

1509
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,120
Yeah, just lip-syncing.

1510
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,600
Right.

1511
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,320
So we need that style.

1512
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Like all the lyrics are shown.

1513
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:20,520
Yeah.

1514
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,120
Earth is super fun.

1515
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,520
The world is super fun.

1516
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,320
Life's wrinkles hide sweetness.

1517
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,840
Call you once.

1518
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,640
Then turn around and it's Gong Jun.

1519
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,880
When I turn around, it's like this.

1520
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,480
That's good.

1521
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,840
Interesting.

1522
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,560
That's fine.

1523
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,680
Alright, let me tell you.

1524
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,120
I think ours is the most unique.

1525
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,640
Really.

1526
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,680
Ours is totally a...

1527
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,360
It's already a music video.

1528
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,560
Should we have one like this?

1529
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,680
Feels like we're all in this music video now.

1530
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,400
That's how it is now.

1531
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,120
Your steps aren't in sync with us.

1532
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,360
Why are you spinning?

1533
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,120
Because I'm the center.

1534
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,600
Queen.

1535
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,120
You're the queen.

1536
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:21,960
Alright, next.

1537
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,280
The world is super fun.

1538
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,280
I'll join too.

1539
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,440
Shake it up.

1540
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,080
Is there still sunset now?

1541
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,520
Should we add one?

1542
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
The three of us running forward, from behind.

1543
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,000
Film the back.

1544
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,840
Didn't get the back view.

1545
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,280
Yeah.

1546
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,960
Take that road.

1547
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,160
Let's go.

1548
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,760
This is epic.

1549
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,560
Shoot it.

1550
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,280
That's how it is.

1551
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,200
Us.

1552
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,760
It's up to you, bro.

1553
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,240
Will this shot be on you?

1554
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,520
We won.

1555
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:09,840
Show it off.

1556
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,680
We'll be behind.

1557
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,760
Then walk for a bit.

1558
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,840
Like waving from the back.

1559
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,280
Okay.

1560
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:13,600
Sound good?

1561
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,280
Walk relaxed.

1562
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,720
Very comfortable.

1563
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,040
Maybe show a side profile.

1564
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,360
Sure.

1565
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,560
Wave your hand.

1566
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,080
Let go of your hand.

1567
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,840
Then we suddenly start running.

1568
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,400
How about that?

1569
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,720
Walk, then run.

1570
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,280
We're running.

1571
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,320
Looks great.

1572
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,520
This is a piece—

1573
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,600
This is a painting.

1574
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,240
Yeah.

1575
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,120
So beautiful.

1576
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,600
This is a painting.

1577
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,560
Once we finish filming, let's go have fun.

1578
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,000
We're so in sync.

1579
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,680
Right?

1580
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,440
How is it?

1581
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,960
Shake a bit.

1582
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,280
Just look at me.

1583
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,120
You need to turn around for this.

1584
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,080
Turn all the way around.

1585
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,480
Yes.

1586
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,080
Come here, everyone come over.

1587
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,520
Anyone want to be extras?

1588
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,320
With this background.

1589
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,280
The more people, the better. Come on.

1590
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,920
The more, the merrier.

1591
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,480
Everyone join in.

1592
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,200
It's fine.

1593
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,920
Let's all have fun together.

1594
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,240
Yeah, let's all dance together.

1595
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,080
Right, join in.

1596
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,080
Great, that's awesome.

1597
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,280
Warm winter.

1598
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,200
Amazing.

1599
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,040
Even the sky is helping you.

1600
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,600
Liu Yuning.

1601
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,480
Just a little more and you'd have fallen.

1602
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,720
So romantic.

1603
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,200
Thanks for your hard work.

1604
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,720
Mizone to the rescue

1605
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,560
Lin Yi

1606
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,640
Look at you, sweating so much

1607
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,000
Aren't you bulking up lately?

1608
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,640
How are you tired so quickly?

1609
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,720
I can't handle it, bro

1610
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,640
This blazing sun is too much for me

1611
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,600
Here, I brought you a Mizone lifesaver

1612
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,000
Get energized

1613
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,200
So refreshing, Mizone is back

1614
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,320
Mizone lifesaver, summon this round's

1615
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,600
Stay Energized Challenge

1616
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,560
Mizone comeback challenge

1617
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,440
Everyone stands with a wooden stick

1618
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,680
Quickly swap sticks clockwise

1619
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,280
Succeed and you get

1620
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,320
Mizone comeback supply pack

1621
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:41,600
Go

1622
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,200
Go

1623
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,920
Two, go

1624
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,320
Go

1625
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,200
Still energized

1626
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,960
Go

1627
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,600
Go

1628
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,640
Status lifesaver, please deliver to Lin Yi

1629
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,720
Mizone comeback supply pack

1630
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,600
Together with the status lifesaver

1631
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,000
Fully energized

1632
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,840
Ready for more challenges on the journey

1633
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,480
Thank you

1634
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,560
We caught the sunshine just in time

1635
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,600
Got some nice shots

1636
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,400
Yeah

1637
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,200
Lin Yi

1638
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,520
I edited a super cool one for you

1639
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,120
Lin Yi

1640
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,400
Come check it out

1641
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,480
Honestly, I think in your next show

1642
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,840
You should really recommend

1643
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,840
Jin Jing as your leading lady

1644
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,480
Seriously, look how awesome this is

1645
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,800
You two look alike

1646
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,360
Wedding scene

1647
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,680
Isn't it cool?

1648
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,200
Cool

1649
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,760
This part should be edited in below

1650
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,160
And the wedding outfits we wore

1651
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,120
So ours

1652
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,800
Our duo is called "Yi-Jing All the Way"

1653
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,160
"Yi-Jing All the Way," nice

1654
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,640
Yi-Jing All the Way

1655
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,560
I just got it

1656
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,080
Yeah

1657
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,920
Yi Jing

1658
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,560
You're a bit slow to react, babe

1659
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,080
I thought it was just a simple shoot

1660
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,640
This one-take shot

1661
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,600
Too flashy

1662
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,640
Looks pretty good

1663
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,240
Nice match

1664
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:54,840
Yeah

1665
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,040
The three of us have good taste

1666
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,800
It's all about the people

1667
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,520
Seriously

1668
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,560
These outfits only work because of us

1669
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,800
Right?

1670
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,600
What are you guys?

1671
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,160
What team?

1672
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,280
Property Management Boy Band

1673
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,600
Feels kind of crazy

1674
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,360
And as a boy band

1675
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,440
You have to bring out

1676
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,840
That vibe from Beijing alleyways

1677
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,640
That Property Management Boy Band

1678
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,680
Boy band

1679
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,960
So authentic

1680
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,880
Classic Spain

1681
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,960
Bro, today's track is really wild

1682
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,680
Super wild

1683
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,440
Earth is so interesting

1684
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,280
It takes a bunch of fun souls together, right?

1685
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,720
We're here

1686
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,120
You two

1687
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:04,960
You're too much

1688
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,760
Let me introduce us with great fanfare—

1689
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,960
the Property Management Boy Band.

1690
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,760
So beautiful.

1691
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,720
This looks pretty good.

1692
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,720
Amazing, Spain!

1693
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,960
I don't usually come to this place.

1694
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,040
Yeah, it's yours.

1695
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:31,360
It's a bit out of the way.

1696
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,640
You didn't even know this property existed, did you?

1697
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,840
Mainly, it's just a bit remote.

1698
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,720
It's a little off the beaten path.

1699
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,400
But it's really quiet.

1700
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,680
None of you have been here before, right? This property?

1701
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,160
I've been here.

1702
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,600
But not very often.

1703
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,960
This is also Duke Li's property.

1704
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,600
Never even been here, didn't know about it.

1705
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,120
Are these the clothes you bought?

1706
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,520
Yeah, this one.

1707
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,080
It fits pretty well.

1708
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,720
What do you mean, fits well?

1709
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,040
I was wearing this this afternoon, okay?

1710
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,480
No wonder it fits so well.

1711
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,640
This tastes great.

1712
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,160
It's still warm.

1713
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,840
Is this the tripe you mentioned?

1714
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,400
Isn't it?

1715
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,080
Yeah, that's it.

1716
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:18,680
Try it.

1717
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,400
This is pretty good.

1718
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,520
It's the tomato one, right?

1719
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,560
But this is nice.

1720
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,000
It's pretty mushy.

1721
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,880
It's cooked well.

1722
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,160
Alright, everyone.

1723
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,760
I heard everyone's previous music videos

1724
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,720
turned out great.

1725
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,080
Everyone showed their own style.

1726
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,160
Wait, I have something

1727
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,480
I really want to show you.

1728
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,360
Let me show you.

1729
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,280
I filmed a segment.

1730
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,000
The real "Godly Eight Seconds," here we go.

1731
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,880
Whose "Godly Eight Seconds" is it?

1732
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,720
I filmed it for Lin Yi

1733
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,560
and Jin Jing.

1734
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,400
Take a look.

1735
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,720
Let's appreciate Director Liu's masterpiece.

1736
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,520
This is our "Godly Eight Seconds."

1737
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,880
Wait a second.

1738
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,160
This...

1739
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,520
What is this?

1740
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:23,920
This is wild too.

1741
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,440
No need.

1742
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,200
Let's save it for post-production.

1743
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,080
Look, we're like High School Musical now.

1744
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,360
You guys went overboard.

1745
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,320
Honestly, the final cut will be awesome.

1746
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,200
Yeah, this looks great.

1747
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,400
And this corridor—

1748
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,880
That tunnel vibe is really nice.

1749
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,360
This depth—

1750
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,400
The sense of depth is excellent.

1751
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,440
That's their style.

1752
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,760
Lei Zi.

1753
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,760
Ours is just as good.

1754
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,040
What are we doing?

1755
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,360
What are we doing?

1756
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,440
Can we put this all in one song?

1757
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,600
Are we really going to use everything we shot?

1758
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,720
Two, one—

1759
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,840
Has it started?

1760
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,680
Did they start? Them?

1761
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,440
It's over.

1762
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,160
It's already finished.

1763
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,600
Eight seconds of confusion.

1764
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,560
We haven't shown the real footage yet.

1765
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,280
We're saving it all.

1766
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,000
Today we're taking the train

1767
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,200
to Barcelona.

1768
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,080
Three-character female stars.

1769
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,600
Maggie Cheung.

1770
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,120
Brigitte Lin.

1771
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,640
What's up with them?

1772
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,320
Just these two.

1773
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,800
They won't pull off your wig, right?

1774
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,280
And it's black hair underneath.

1775
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,800
Get off the train and everyone turns into Ge You.

1776
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,400
Five-Finger Church.

1777
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,200
So beautiful.

1778
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,400
I'm almost in tears.

1779
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,360
Today's homestay.

1780
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,480
He Ge, come check out Room 7.

1781
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,400
You'll go all out for this.

1782
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,680
Liu Yuning from Dandong, Liaoning.

1783
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,600
Lin Yi from Shenyang, Liaoning.

1784
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,920
Sis.

1785
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,040
Did you leave your vocal cords at home?

1786
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,000
Eliminate him.

1787
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
There are two "Ham Spirits" among you.

1788
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,400
They're sabotaging the mission.

1789
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,280
One, two.

1790
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,200
This is too close.

1791
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:00,880
This is too close.

1792
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,800
Hold steady.

1793
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,200
Wait, over here.

1794
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,600
Where did it break?

1795
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,120
Ning Ge, did you just make this move?

1796
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,280
My hand was so close to you.

1797
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,600
I was basically walking right next to you.

1798
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,120
I couldn't see your side.

1799
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:13,800
I walked like this.

1800
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,680
People who are "Ham Spirits"

1801
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,080
always stick their butt out like this.

1802
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,800
I swear on my conscience.

1803
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,080
I thought it was him from the start.

1804
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:19,560
Alright, fine.

1805
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,040
Okay, let's vote.

1806
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:20,600
It broke from his side.

1807
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,880
How did the vote end up on me?

1808
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,200
How about this.

1809
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,319
Everyone vote for Chen Xingxu.

1810
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,600
Why?

1811
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,399
I didn't say anything.

1812
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,920
Among the nine members,

1813
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,720
there's a princess and a knight.

1814
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,680
They need to secretly recognize each other with a specific gesture.

1815
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,439
The knight has six minutes

1816
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:40,080
to follow the princess's hints

1817
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,000
and attack three designated dragons.

1818
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,359
Big Dumb Dragon, out.

1819
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,760
Naiwen Li.

1820
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,200
That was a precise strike.

1821
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,000
There's something off with these three.

1822
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,319
So who do you say to "kill"?

1823
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:00,840
Xingxu.

1824
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,760
Attack successful.

1825
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,240
Bro.

1826
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:05,840
Let's do the opposite and vote.

1827
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,800
Because I suspect him.

1828
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,920
So I want to take him out.

1829
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,040
How did it end up like this?

1830
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,319
It's definitely not me.

1831
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,279
Anyway, I pick Uncle Nai.

1832
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,479
It's not me.

1833
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,040
I can't be that much of a failure, right?

1834
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,520
Hurry, you three, come here!

1835
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,359
I want to see.

1836
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,760
You just saw the forest, right?

1837
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,600
Let me show you what real bushes look like.

1838
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,960
Everyone, come over.

1839
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,840
Na Wen, hurry up!

1840
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,680
No.

1841
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,760
No.

1842
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,960
Only you stand in the middle.

1843
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,760
Come on.

1844
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,800
It's nothing, come on.

1845
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,120
Come on.

1846
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,920
Come on.

1847
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,600
Step forward.

1848
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,640
No more talking.

1849
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,600
Actions speak louder than words.

1850
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,520
Come on.

1851
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,280
Here I come.

1852
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,080
It's fine, you can't see our faces in the shadows anyway.

1853
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,760
Do you know what was really funny?

1854
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,080
When he did the leg sweep just now,

1855
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,040
he said,

1856
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,440
"Anyway, you can't see our expressions in the dark."

1857
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,760
Is it dark now?

1858
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,120
Is it dark now?

1859
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,960
It's their kind of darkness.

1860
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,560
Nowhere else in the world is this dark.

1861
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,960
The dark scenes were reshot, okay?

1862
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,480
You have to change clothes for the dark scenes.

1863
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,840
They were wearing suits.

1864
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,040
He Ge has lost his mind.
