00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,080
The task for swapping roles is called

2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,720
Dance

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,920
Dance is my weakest skill.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
Everyone dances to the music.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,360
After getting the prompt,

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,360
use dance moves to describe the prompt.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,920
Everyone at the table

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
can join in guessing and answering.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,320
The first team to guess right gets a point.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,760
The losing team becomes the new challenge givers.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
Let’s try a round first.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,080
Sun Honglei, show us your moves!

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,400
How many words?

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,800
Four words.

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,480
Eagle

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Eagle catches chicks.

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,600
Dragon and lion dance.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,640
Correct!

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
Dragon and lion dance.

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,080
Yes.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,840
Impressive!

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,120
Amazing, Didi!

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,520
Next prompt.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Knock out with one punch.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,160
How many words?

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,880
Are they all four words?

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,240
Five words.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,760
Punch you once.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
An enemy in the past may be a friend in the future.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,760
Say the number of words first.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,400
Four words, okay.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,680
Cut ties completely.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,520
Bullfight.

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,040
How many words? Four words.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,120
Full of bullish energy.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,440
Strike the ox over the mountain.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,960
So impressive!

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,520
No.

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
Why are all the answers from the other team?

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
An enemy in the past may be a friend in the future.

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Strike the ox over the mountain.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,720
No.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
I won a round!

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,880
No, you do that even when they get it right.

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,360
Come on.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,840
Let’s go.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,640
Start dancing!

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Nice.

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,420
They really dance better than us.

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Energetic!

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,140
Okay, give the prompt.

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,740
Alright, ready.

53
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,780
How many words?

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,300
How many words?

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,100
How many words?

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,100
How many words?

57
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,140
How many words?

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,140
How many words?

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,780
Four words.

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,100
Bro.

61
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,700
Sun Honglei eating.

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,860
Bao, security captain.

63
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,580
No, the first two words are right.

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,140
Security.

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,460
Security.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,060
Security.

67
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,700
What’s the last part?

68
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,740
Security what?

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,580
Security patrol.

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,620
Correct.

71
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,140
Security patrol.

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,580
Who said it?

73
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,540
He did.

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,300
Shidi.

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,340
Shidi.

76
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,820
Shidi.

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,700
This really isn’t my strength.

78
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,700
Don’t get too excited.

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:04,980
Okay.

80
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,700
Just a bit.

81
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,580
Calm down a little.

82
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,140
Next one.

83
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,260
Go, Didi.

84
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,860
Jump up!

85
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,060
Three words.

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,540
Straw battle.

87
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,140
Straw king.

88
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,420
How do you guess this?

89
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,300
Five words.

90
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,940
Tiger.

91
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,820
A fox borrowing the tiger’s might.

92
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,580
Eyeing like a tiger.

93
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,540
Tiger roars, dragon sings.

94
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,500
Colosseum, Roman Colosseum

95
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,820
Correct.

96
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,060
What?

97
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,140
Roman Colosseum.

98
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,260
Five characters.

99
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,220
How do you guess five characters from four?

100
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,180
At the beginning,

101
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,860
A fox borrowing the tiger’s might, eyeing like a tiger.

102
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,900
Tiger roars, dragon sings.

103
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,740
How many characters now?

104
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,820
Four characters.

105
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,820
Tarzan.

106
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,220
He goes first.

107
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,580
He said it first.

108
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,980
Then let’s do it this way.

109
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,380
Lead dancer.

110
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,220
Yes, just be cute.

111
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Go dance with them.

112
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,740
Don’t fall for it.

113
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,300
Three characters.

114
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,860
Tai Chi.

115
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,460
It’s this song.

116
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,700
Five characters.

117
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,300
Stewed Chicken with Mushrooms.

118
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,540
The five characters are...

119
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:50,980
No idea.

120
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
How do we do this?

121
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,140
How do you guess this?

122
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,180
Five characters.

123
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,580
Fly.

124
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,260
I want to fly higher.

125
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,820
The last two characters are...

126
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,580
The last two characters.

127
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Swan Lake.

128
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,700
Eagle.

129
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,380
How do you act this out?

130
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,740
You fly.

131
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,700
Titanic.

132
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,380
Titanic.

133
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
The first two characters.

134
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,940
Fishing.

135
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,860
Correct.

136
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,740
The first two characters are fishing.

137
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,340
Definitely not.

138
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,940
He’s just acting randomly, don’t dance.

139
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,140
Don’t look, he’s misleading us.

140
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,580
Can’t see.

141
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,980
This is a song title, right?

142
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,060
You quietly covered my eyes.

143
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,620
Quietly cover your eyes.

144
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,740
Quietly cover my eyes.

145
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,980
Cover his eyes.

146
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,140
Quietly cover.

147
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,780
Cover you.

148
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,340
Pass.

149
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,380
Passed, pass.

150
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,060
What?

151
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,300
Invisible Wings.

152
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,060
How do you act invisible?

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,740
I don’t think so.

154
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,260
It’s not our problem.

155
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,940
I don’t get them.

156
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,740
Invisible Wings means the wings are invisible.

157
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,940
It’s not that you’re blind.

158
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,580
Act invisible.

159
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,380
I’ll do it.

160
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,700
Like this.

161
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:38,980
Come.

162
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,380
Look.

163
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,020
The wings are gone.

164
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,940
Can you guess this?

165
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,940
Can’t guess it.

166
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,860
Seems kind of right.

167
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,460
Invisible is hard to act out.

168
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,700
Everything we ate and drank today

169
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,300
was produced right here in this estate.

170
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,420
Really nice.

171
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,700
So delicious.

172
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,620
Amazing.

173
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,940
After tasting here,

174
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,500
we’ll invite our professor

175
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,940
to say a few words.

176
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,620
Alright, thank you.

177
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,940
Okay, everyone.

178
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,420
Dear teachers,

179
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,180
We’ve arrived at

180
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,100
a very beautiful

181
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,060
Italian town.

182
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,820
Right next to Naples.

183
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Behind us now

184
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,940
the background is

185
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,220
the Bay of Naples.

186
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,020
And right next is the Mediterranean Sea.

187
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,500
In the distance, there's Mount Vesuvius.

188
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,380
Back in the year 79 AD,

189
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,740
it buried Pompeii, Rome's second largest ancient city.

190
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,500
The whole city was engulfed.

191
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,340
Sorrento.

192
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,980
It's also called Sorrento.

193
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,820
Facing Mount Vesuvius,

194
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,020
you realize how small life is.

195
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,820
Nature's power is truly fierce.

196
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,020
It can instantly

197
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,580
swallow an entire civilized city.

198
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,740
Everything gets consumed.

199
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,460
So often Italians feel

200
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,340
they should enjoy the moment.

201
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,220
They want to enjoy this sea.

202
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,300
So I think

203
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,460
this is what Sorrento

204
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,060
gives us—a sense of strength.

205
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,300
So we should stay here

206
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
and enjoy life in the moment.

207
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,180
Amazing.

208
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,460
Wonderful.

209
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,220
Thank you, teacher.

210
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,260
Thank you.

211
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,020
Thank you for your hard work.

212
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,220
A good day starts in the morning.

213
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,940
Mediterranean mornings

214
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,060
often begin with exercise.

215
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,540
It's how they start a great day.

216
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,340
We chose three local

217
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,620
specialty foods

218
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,340
lemon, seafood, and pizza

219
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,780
to design a warm-up routine.

220
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,860
You need to follow our instructions

221
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,180
and do three set movements.

222
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,980
If you hear a repeated command,

223
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,460
then you can't move.

224
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,420
Got it.

225
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,580
If you mess up, you're out.

226
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,140
There are three rounds.

227
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,060
Last one standing each round gets a point.

228
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,900
Highest score wins in the end.

229
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,740
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

230
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,180
No.

231
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,700
Lemon.

232
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,700
Bro, it's like this.

233
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,540
You need to use your foot too, not just your hand.

234
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,180
Lemon.

235
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,820
Left foot.

236
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,100
Seafood.

237
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,540
Then,

238
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,460
then pizza.

239
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,180
Too easy.

240
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,460
Naiwen.

241
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,180
Naiwen, show us.

242
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,940
Way too easy.

243
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,020
Why is it getting easier every day?

244
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
Let me say it once.

245
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,580
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

246
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,820
Impressive.

247
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,820
Alright, go ahead.

248
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,460
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

249
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,140
Lemon, seafood.

250
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,220
Pizza.

251
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,780
Wait a second.

252
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,420
So easy.

253
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,500
Why is it getting easier every day?

254
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,180
Seafood.

255
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,780
Hold on.

256
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,020
Out.

257
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,180
I didn't get the question.

258
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,660
Out.

259
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,220
Uncle Nai is out.

260
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,740
You have to do all the moves.

261
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,180
Go out.

262
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,860
Come on.

263
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,220
Go out.

264
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,420
You're up next round.

265
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,260
Next round.

266
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,260
You're next.

267
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,300
I haven't joined yet.

268
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,060
Next.

269
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,700
Naiwen.

270
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I think Sun Honglei is sneaky enough.

271
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,820
You're even sneakier than him.

272
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,700
That's enough, let's go.

273
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,220
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

274
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

275
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,540
Pizza.

276
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,820
What does this mean?

277
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Look, Naiwen.

278
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,580
If you lose, you step down.

279
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:34,940
I want to play.

280
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,180
Not bad at all.

281
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,780
No struggle.

282
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,420
Worth learning from.

283
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,460
Here we go.

284
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

285
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,220
So fast!

286
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,700
Seafood, pizza.

287
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,380
Seafood, pizza.

288
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,060
Darn it.

289
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,540
That was quick!

290
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,460
Almost got it wrong.

291
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,820
Let's not fight among ourselves.

292
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,420
Three are already trailing, it's fine.

293
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,940
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

294
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,060
Lemon, pizza.

295
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,300
Lemon, pizza.

296
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,700
Seafood.

297
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,540
Seafood.

298
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,180
Pizza.

299
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,300
Lemon, pizza.

300
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,460
Lemon, pizza.

301
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,700
Seafood.

302
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,460
We're basically AI now.

303
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,980
It's too easy, kind of.

304
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,340
Way too easy.

305
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,700
Is it easy?

306
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,060
Let's call it out.

307
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,380
Okay.

308
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,660
You call it.

309
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,300
I'll call.

310
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,540
Go.

311
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,260
Ready, go.

312
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,660
Seafood, pizza, lemon.

313
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,940
Lemon, seafood.

314
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,740
Was that wrong?

315
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,540
Lemon, lemons are together.

316
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,500
No, you said pizza.

317
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,900
You got it wrong, minus another point.

318
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
You still don't get the rules.

319
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,940
Minus another point for you.

320
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,500
Naiwen, we can't even punish this.

321
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,420
Bro, you're totally out.

322
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,180
Totally out.

323
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,980
You call it, go ahead.

324
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,620
I'll call.

325
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,500
I'll do it.

326
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,020
Seafood.

327
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,980
Lemon, pizza, seafood.

328
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,580
Pizza, seafood.

329
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,500
Seafood.

330
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,300
Lemon.

331
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,660
I messed up.

332
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,260
I did this one.

333
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,660
I’m doing this.

334
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,060
You distracted her.

335
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,260
Actually, you distracted her.

336
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:19,900
You did it like this.

337
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,300
Lemon.

338
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620
You can do it like this.

339
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,940
Really.

340
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,020
Makes sense.

341
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,620
That’s really good.

342
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,940
Yeah.

343
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,020
Final round now.

344
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,900
Final round, everyone.

345
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,780
Seafood, pizza, lemon.

346
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,660
Wait, how about this?

347
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,420
Let’s give three of us a point first.

348
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,180
Stop messing around.

349
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,500
Right.

350
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,900
I’m a bit tired.

351
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,140
Why didn’t you say that when I was up?

352
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,740
Say that line.

353
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,380
Four is a bit much.

354
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,100
Shidi, step down.

355
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,380
Basically, only a few left.

356
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,580
We’ve already won.

357
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,180
Yeah, so let’s do this.

358
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,380
Then just three people.

359
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,060
Add one point first.

360
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,620
Add a point.

361
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,300
Yes.

362
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,340
Okay.

363
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,060
Come on.

364
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:46,940
Let’s go.

365
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,660
This is great.

366
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,020
This way is much better.

367
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,340
Look at this family, right?

368
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,900
Get a point and you’re family, huh?

369
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,540
Yeah, family.

370
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,940
Family.

371
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:58,700
Let’s go.

372
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,060
Everyone’s ready to go.

373
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,260
You’re not going to be the first in the center, right?

374
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,780
Three, two, one.

375
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,540
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

376
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,620
Seafood pizza.

377
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,860
Seafood, pizza.

378
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,060
Darn it, I lost.

379
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
I’m out.

380
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,420
It’s all your fault.

381
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,780
How is it my fault? Look.

382
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,740
Let’s do it, come on.

383
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

384
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,860
Seafood, pizza.

385
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,900
Pizza.

386
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,900
Pizza.

387
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,540
You messed up.

388
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,420
He did pizza, pizza.

389
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,900
You’re using a one-on-one strategy.

390
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,300
Let’s go.

391
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,700
Uncle Nai is playing with confidence now.

392
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,780
Come on.

393
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,620
Uncle Nai is confident now.

394
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,780
Three, two, one.

395
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,580
Pizza, lemon, seafood.

396
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Pizza, lemon, seafood.

397
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,180
Bro

398
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,140
Come on, get ready

399
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,940
Three, two, one

400
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,700
Lemon, seafood, pizza

401
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,780
Seafood, pizza

402
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,420
Lemon, pizza

403
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,580
Lemon, pizza

404
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,260
What kind of pizza?

405
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,540
You two are out

406
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,300
You’re out too, no pizza for you

407
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,140
These two get points

408
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,060
Come on, add points

409
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,580
Wait, but there are three left

410
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,020
You all got it wrong just now

411
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,380
Step down

412
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,900
Here comes round three

413
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,100
Only one person can score in the end

414
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,140
Come on

415
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,660
Let’s go

416
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,460
Earth is so hard to adapt to

417
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,020
Earth is super unpredictable

418
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,340
Get ready

419
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,140
Ready, three, two, one

420
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,300
Seafood, lemon, pizza

421
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,260
Lemon, pizza

422
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,100
Lemon, pizza

423
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,140
It’s reversed

424
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,820
Three, two, one

425
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,060
Pizza, lemon, seafood

426
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,020
Lemon, seafood

427
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,220
I got it wrong

428
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,340
So nervous

429
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,060
So nervous

430
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,740
Seafood

431
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,540
Lemon

432
00:15:59,620 --> 00:15:59,940
Lemon

433
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,700
Bro

434
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
What do you mean?

435
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,740
Go down

436
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm exhausted

437
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,700
Let's finally shine, bro

438
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,620
Come on!

439
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,820
So nervous

440
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,340
Three, two, one

441
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,220
Seafood, lemon, pizza

442
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,740
Seafood

443
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,820
Seafood

444
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,860
Bro, this won't work

445
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,460
The quality is too poor

446
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,460
This one can go down

447
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,860
Here we go, the real finals begin

448
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,500
Alright, bro

449
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,740
Come on

450
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,580
Let's go

451
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,700
Must mirror

452
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,620
It's hard for us to mirror like this

453
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,100
You know?

454
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,500
Don't distract each other, I'm telling you

455
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,020
It's tough

456
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,580
Alright, get ready

457
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,340
Three, two, one

458
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,460
Seafood, lemon, pizza

459
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,140
Awesome, Liu Yuning

460
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,210
Nothing more to say

461
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,580
Impressive

462
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,930
Let's congratulate Yuning for this round

463
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,980
Congrats

464
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,740
What's this called?

465
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,060
Seafood Pizza Lemon King

466
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,260
Yeah, rivals the Straw King

467
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,690
Lemon Seafood Pizza King

468
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,980
Do we have anyone with zero points?

469
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:15,980
Yes

470
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,410
I'm proud

471
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,580
You three with no points, do this

472
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
Or decide who's the worst among you

473
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,660
Can we deduct one more point from them?

474
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,020
Okay

475
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,900
Wait, isn't this just a warm-up?

476
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,460
That's it

477
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,660
We're deciding this

478
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,220
Decide who's the worst

479
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,780
This is

480
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,740
The battle of shame

481
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,700
This isn't a battle of glory

482
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,300
This is the last one to advance in the group

483
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,620
Come on

484
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,300
First eliminated gets minus one point

485
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,660
Okay

486
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,540
Alright

487
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,020
Get ready

488
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,940
Three, two, one

489
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,260
Wait

490
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,820
So nervous

491
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,740
A bit scared

492
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,020
You encouraged me

493
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,700
Senior

494
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,580
Come on

495
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,180
Seafood, lemon, pizza

496
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,860
Seafood, pizza

497
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,740
Seafood, pizza

498
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,420
Lemon, pizza

499
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,180
Seafood, lemon, pizza

500
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,180
Lemon, pizza

501
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,780
Lemon, pizza

502
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,460
Lemon, seafood

503
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,660
Lemon, seafood

504
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,460
We won.

505
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,740
So embarrassing.

506
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,700
No, you two can compete for one more spot.

507
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,340
Minus one, the two of us.

508
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,980
Just decide who’s the second worst.

509
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,660
We don’t need to compete.

510
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,260
Two zero scores shouldn’t be a tie.

511
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,860
With so few people, we still have a tie.

512
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,660
I think minus 0.5 points.

513
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,140
Okay.

514
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,540
Let’s do the mirror.

515
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,580
Lemon, seafood, pizza, go.

516
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,780
Get ready.

517
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,420
Three.

518
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,180
Two.

519
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,780
One.

520
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,020
Lemon, seafood, pizza.

521
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,500
Seafood, pizza.

522
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,940
Seafood, pizza.

523
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,900
Lemon, pizza.

524
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Seafood, lemon.

525
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,460
Seafood, lemon.

526
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,100
Lemon.

527
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,580
Bro, you’re out.

528
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,260
What are you doing?

529
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,180
No.

530
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Seafood, lemon.

531
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,780
You should come over.

532
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,740
You’re in the middle, lemon.

533
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,540
This is unacceptable.

534
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,220
Then I win.

535
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,540
Yes, let’s congratulate Junjun.

536
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,020
The best among the worst.

537
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,820
Second to last, not bad.

538
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,500
Third to last.

539
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,700
Still okay.

540
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,780
Before we go diving,

541
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,020
let’s do a quick warm-up.

542
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,340
Who’s the foreign language whiz?

543
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,420
First, split into two teams.

544
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,140
Send one person to express in English.

545
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,020
No acting allowed.

546
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,460
Within the time limit.

547
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,540
The team with the most answers wins.

548
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,060
Let’s do a practice round first.

549
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,220
Three characters.

550
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,460
Is three characters okay?

551
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,500
Three, okay.

552
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,460
It’s a boy.

553
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,260
Another one.

554
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,820
Chen Xingxu.

555
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,260
Great.

556
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,780
My turn.

557
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,500
Darn it.

558
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,700
How many characters?

559
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,260
Rabbit.

560
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,660
Three.

561
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,980
Yours was too hard.

562
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,460
Okay, rabbit spirit.

563
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,700
Spirit.

564
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,540
No.

565
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,060
White rabbit spirit.

566
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,020
White rabbit spirit.

567
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,300
Jade rabbit spirit.

568
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,100
Right.

569
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,180
Quick.

570
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,260
How did you guess that?

571
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,780
Quick.

572
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,420
I might never guess this in my life.

573
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,260
How do you describe this?

574
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,740
How many characters?

575
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,500
Four.

576
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,740
Shoes.

577
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,260
No acting.

578
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,740
Just talk.

579
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,180
You can’t.

580
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,740
No acting.

581
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,340
Just say it.

582
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,540
Take off your shoes and get on the bed.

583
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,900
Red Foot, Red Sole

584
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,020
Red Foot

585
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,620
Name

586
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,140
Another name

587
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,020
Red

588
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,580
