1
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,640
Good morning

2
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,280
Good morning

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,960
Today we'll take the train

4
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,440
to Barcelona

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,960
and continue our journey in Spain

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,640
Spain's high-speed rail is the largest in Europe

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,880
and has one of the longest operating networks

8
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,000
Railway cooperation between Spain and China

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,360
is becoming more frequent

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,640
A notable example

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,560
is the famous Yiwu-Madrid China-Europe Railway Express

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,600
It starts from Yiwu, China

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
passes through several countries

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,920
and finally arrives in Madrid, Spain

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,560
as an international freight railway route

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
This "Iron Camel Team"

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,400
has a major impact on the economy

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,480
diplomacy, and culture between China and Europe

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,160
playing an important role in many areas

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,120
That's a big dog

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,200
Can this dog come in here?

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,520
Yes

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,840
If you can get on the train, why can't it?

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,360
Where are my sunglasses?

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,160
Here.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,560
They're hanging here.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,000
Right here.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,360
They're hanging.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
We can't get very far like this.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,480
I think

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,720
we really can't go far.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Let's go.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,720
You can sit on it.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,680
Then I'll push you.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Let me push you, come on.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
We look like a little couple.

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Romantic, right?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,520
So romantic.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
A romantic trip.

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,680
Jin Jing.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,120
They said this

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,680
train station is

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
the one from Zootopia

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,040
where they filmed the train station scenes.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,760
Really?

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Yeah, really.

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,120
I'll show you.

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,920
Here.

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,680
Right here.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Madrid Atocha Station.

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,000
That's the one.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,720
This morning, Brother Wen

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,400
as soon as the alarm went off,

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,120
I was so sleepy.

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,680
I thought I'd check for anything new.

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
As soon as I opened it,

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,760
it was all WeChat messages.

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
I saw your million-view fancam.

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Why is it called a million-view fancam?

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
What does that mean?

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,120
It means

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
it's a fancam worth a million likes.

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,800
But I have a special skill.

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
You all know it.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
I can cheat.

67
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,240
Cheat how?

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,440
That wasn't me.

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
How many people now?

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,760
Nine.

71
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,840
We're all here.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
All nine of us, no one missing.

73
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,480
As security, our job is to count people.

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,840
Don't get lost.

75
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
Member.

76
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
No need, bro.

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,280
I'm afraid I'll lose it.

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Same as I thought.

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
It's too risky to give it to him.

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
You think giving the suitcase to Brother Naiwen

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,160
means he'll keep it safe?

82
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,400
He can't even protect himself.

83
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
Our "old lady" can do it.

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
The "old lady" is holding her daughter's suitcase.

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
Brother Naiwen, maybe give it back.

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm afraid I'll lose it, here.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
I think it's too easy to lose if you carry it.

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
For real?

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Really.

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
Alright, then you take them all back.

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
Or just keep them all together.

92
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm afraid I'll lose it too.

93
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
No shame at all, seriously.

94
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,840
Chen Xingxu now

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,560
should get on the train.

96
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,200
Let's go.

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,360
Come on!

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,480
Let's go!

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,680
So heavy.

100
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,080
It's so heavy.

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,640
Keep going!

102
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,920
Can the ones below still get up?

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,640
I'll help them get their luggage up.

104
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,960
Okay.

105
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Alright.

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,440
Xiao Chen is pretty sharp.

107
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Old Li is good too.

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,760
Old Li just watched my bag for me.

109
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,720
That's what Old Li should do, you know?

110
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Thanks, bro.

111
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,680
I reserved this carriage for you.

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,280
Are you satisfied with it?

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,120
Yes, we are.

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,520
Great.

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
Li "Duke"

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,560
What year did you buy this car?

117
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Hmm...

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
I really can't remember.

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,200
That's the most honest answer.

120
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Right.

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,680
I truly can't recall.

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,640
That's genuine.

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,960
With so many cars,

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
How can I remember which year I bought each one?

125
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
You expect me to remember such a small detail?

126
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,160
He's totally in character.

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
Let's bet which way this car will go.

128
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
Which side are you betting on?

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,720
That side.

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,600
You bet on this side.

131
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,320
I want to bet on that side.

132
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,920
If you win, I'll give you this car. Deal?

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
If I win, I get this car.

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,920
Looks like you didn't get anything, bro.

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Thanks.

136
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,000
I just want Madrid.

137
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Drive it back.

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
I'll drive it back to China from here.

139
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,120
Drive it back.

140
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll drive it along the Silk Road.

141
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Let's drive.

142
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,040
You guessed right.

143
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,160
You got it wrong, bro.

144
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Darn it, I can't get this carriage now.

145
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,680
It's fine.

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
That's a big loss.

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,000
Still give it to me.

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Still give it to you.

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Take it later, bro.

150
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,280
Pack it up.

151
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
That's why "Duke" made it this far.

152
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,240
Look at that.

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,480
Lin Yi

154
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
You're really being a handsome guy today.

155
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,480
Really?

156
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,040
Let me see.

157
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
So handsome!

158
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,160
It's true.

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's play a game.

160
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,080
How do we play?

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Let's play something simple.

162
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,200
I'll give a question.

163
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Everyone takes turns answering.

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
If everyone succeeds, we get snacks as a reward.

165
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
It can't be too easy.

166
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,280
If it's too easy, I won't do it.

167
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,640
If someone gets it wrong, we'll collect something from them.

168
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,320
If we lose, what do we give them?

169
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's see what we have.

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Our "Duke" has everything.

171
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
"Duke," give them something.

172
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,040
Give him the car.

173
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,760
This high-speed train.

174
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,400
No way, this car is already given to Hehe.

175
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,760
Coherent

176
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,920
The plot is very coherent.

177
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,400
It just keeps going, I'm impressed.

178
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,840
Then give him this railway.

179
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,480
No.

180
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,960
It's a supporting one.

181
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,640
Supporting.

182
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,320
Alright, let's start.

183
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,840
One at a time.

184
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
Let's battle, friends!

185
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
Male celebrities with three characters in their names.

186
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,400
Sun Honglei

187
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,640
Li Naiwen

188
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Chen Xingxu

189
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Alright, I lost.

190
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
Liu Yuning

191
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,960
No.

192
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,160
You can name anyone.

193
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
And then?

194
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Three people.

195
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,880
You have so many friends.

196
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,480
Oh, right.

197
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Dong Sicheng, Zhou Yiran

198
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,400
I forgot.

199
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,000
Yours is too hard.

200
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,680
Then I'll give you

201
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
something very precious to me.

202
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,000
Which is

203
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,600
my sincerity.

204
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Can I give you the chocolate sis just gave me?

205
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
It's important to me.

206
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Snack for snack.

207
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,600
That's fine.

208
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,240
Is that okay?

209
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,600
Works too.

210
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,360
This is my treasure.

211
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,720
Female celebrities with three characters in their names.

212
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,680
Zhang Manyu

213
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,720
Lin Qingxia

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
I wanted to say Lin Qingxia.

215
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Sorry.

216
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
And Wang Yuwen.

217
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,160
What's up with those two?

218
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,920
Just these two.

219
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
I realize I can't get past you guys.

220
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,800
That's nice.

221
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,840
Looks pretty happy too.

222
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
Look how relaxed they are in the back.

223
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
Can't even reach them.

224
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,440
Can we switch seats?

225
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,960
Don't switch.

226
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,640
Don't switch.

227
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Watching me makes you happy.

228
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
He, you guys come to the front.

229
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah, let's switch seats.

230
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,640
I insist on swapping out Li Naiwen.

231
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Today we're the audience.

232
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,000
You are

233
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
You are filming the show.

234
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,080
We're the audience.

235
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,840
It's fun to watch.

236
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,320
Take it out, what is it?

237
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
Bro, I'll pluck a hair for you.

238
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
From me.

239
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm telling you, from me.

240
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,080
Your hair is so thick, it's fine.

241
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
How about I give you the box?

242
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
No one's dumb, right?

243
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,040
Give me a hair.

244
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,840
You won't pull off your wig, right?

245
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,120
Pick one.

246
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,640
A black one.

247
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,400
I only have black or white ones anyway.

248
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll give you my white hair.

249
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,920
I feel you.

250
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Still plucked a black hair.

251
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,040
Brother Naiwen doesn't have many left.

252
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,680
So mean.

253
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,960
So hopeless.

254
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
The production team is so mean.

255
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,480
So mean.

256
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,160
That hurts.

257
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,520
I'm getting older in your group.

258
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,160
It's all your fault, I'm telling you.

259
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,720
Come on.

260
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,160
Come on.

261
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Where do we start?

262
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Start from Lin Yi.

263
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,520
Sports with three characters.

264
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
One, two.

265
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,080
Badminton

266
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,720
Pickleball

267
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Ping pong

268
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,520
Play basketball

269
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,080
Play tennis

270
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
Play billiards

271
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,159
Play soccer

272
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,520
Xingxu

273
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,799
You can't just listen.

274
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,280
Playing basketball is way too intense.

275
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,039
Any kind of ball game is fine.

276
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,280
Play table tennis.

277
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,920
Play billiards.

278
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,880
I'll give you my watch.

279
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,120
That's too valuable.

280
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Or you can pull some hair too.

281
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,400
Pull hair.

282
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,640
I barely have any left.

283
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,680
I'm already balding up here.

284
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,400
It's fine, go ahead, do it.

285
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,920
Pull from the back.

286
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,800
Don't pull the white ones.

287
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,120
No.

288
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,760
Pulling hair again?

289
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,920
Here we go.

290
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,440
Come on.

291
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,400
Go ahead, pull.

292
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,640
Then I'll move.

293
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,880
One, two, three.

294
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,280
Let me tell you,

295
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,040
after this train ride,

296
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
we'll all look like Ge You when we get off.

297
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,640
Xingxu, give it.

298
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
Xingxu, give some leg hair.

299
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,760
We have so much leg hair.

300
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Yeah.

301
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,680
But pulling leg hair really hurts.

302
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,400
It's fine.

303
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,160
I've got plenty of leg hair.

304
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
Xingxu, give them your socks.

305
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,040
The socks are mine.

306
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,120
Mine.

307
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,680
I can lose to you so many times.

308
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,000
Can those behind us use his?

309
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Anyway, if we lose,

310
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,520
we'll go to Xingxu to pull leg hair.

311
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
If it's about pulling leg hair,

312
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,800
Xingxu and I could keep this train

313
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
running all the way to Fujian.

314
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,280
At least,

315
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,040
our leg hair could last

316
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,520
all the way to Fujian, no problem.

317
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,120
Sure.

318
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,080
Come on, keep going.

319
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,080
Let's start from Xingxu.

320
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,720
So, Xingxu,

321
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
if you lose again,

322
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,240
for the next six days,

323
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
you're not allowed to use a razor.

324
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,600
That's a big risk.

325
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Hand over your razor to us.

326
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,720
No way.

327
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,200
No.

328
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
Then I can't film like this.

329
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,880
That's way too ugly.

330
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,120
No, in the end, we'll see

331
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,880
The Old Man and the Sea.

332
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,480
No.

333
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
We're filming a show with "Lu Zhishen".

334
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,200
Xingxu is in the room holding a volleyball.

335
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,440
Friday.

336
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,240
Friday.

337
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,120
No.

338
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Castaway is here.

339
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,000
That's way too harsh.

340
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,600
This won't work.

341
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,320
This really won't work.

342
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,760
Do it again.

343
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,480
Do it again.

344
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
One more.

345
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Three-character role name: Lin Yi.

346
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Gu Weiyi.

347
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,720
Zeng Xiaoxian.

348
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,360
He Shuhuan.

349
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,120
Ning Yuanzhou.

350
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,720
Jiang Shiyan.

351
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
Little Nezha.

352
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
How long have we been playing?

353
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,480
We're almost at the station.

354
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,560
We’ve really arrived in Barcelona.

355
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,520
Take that down first.

356
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,720
Yeah.

357
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Help with that one.

358
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,600
Brother Naiwen and the others took it down.

359
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,680
Let’s help Brother Honglei with that suitcase.

360
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,440
Okay.

361
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,720
No need, you’re a girl.

362
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,160
No need.

363
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,320
Xingxu asked me to get it.

364
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
Who told you?

365
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,040
I was talking to Lin Yi.

366
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
That’s hilarious.

367
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640
He said you should help them with the suitcase.

368
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:37,920
I said,

369
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,440
I said,

370
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
Why would I be the one to get it?

371
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,160
You’re pretty obedient.

372
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,960
You actually came to get it.

373
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
We have so many guys here.

374
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,680
Let’s go.

375
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,520
This suitcase is like Mount Tai.

376
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,560
Let’s go.

377
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:09,880
Go.

378
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,320
Let’s go.

379
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,200
This stop,

380
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,560
the Earth Team has arrived in Barcelona.

381
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Barcelona,

382
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,880
is in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula,

383
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
next to the Mediterranean Sea.

384
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,680
It’s Spain’s second largest city.

385
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
Known as the “Pearl of the Iberian Peninsula.”

386
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,800
This city is also famed as the City of Gaudí.

387
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
The master architect Antoni Gaudí

388
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,120
in this city

389
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,280
created many

390
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,520
amazing architectural masterpieces.

391
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,520
It’s so cool here.

392
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,520
Awesome, Barcelona!

393
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,040
As soon as Xingxu heard about unloading luggage,

394
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,120
he walked so fast, so manly.

395
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,800
Xingxu, I’m not like her.

396
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,120
I care about my brother.

397
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,560
Alright, that’s enough.

398
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,280
Come on, give it a rest.

399
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
Is Xingxu okay?

400
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
The veins on his hand

401
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
are popping, so sexy.

402
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,680
So handsome.

403
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,600
So strong.

404
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,600
Such attentive service.

405
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
Let’s get in and go.

406
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,240
We’re off.

407
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,440
Packed full.

408
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,200
Alright, get in.

409
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Thank you.

410
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,640
We’ll sit in the back.

411
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,080
Okay.

412
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,160
Xingxu, I just saw this, it’s pretty cute.

413
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
He and his childhood self

414
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,520
So cute.

415
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Looks exactly like you as a kid.

416
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,960
Who doesn’t look like their childhood self?

417
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
No, but you look exactly the same.

418
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,560
Look.

419
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,040
So cute.

420
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,960
You started acting so young.

421
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Did you know what you were doing back then?

422
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,120
No.

423
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,360
Then why were you so obedient?

424
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,480
Whatever they told you to do,

425
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,920
you just did as you were taught.

426
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,200
So if they told you to cry, you could do it?

427
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
So that

428
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,120
expression really is

429
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,040
so cute.

430
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,040
That meme of you as a kid,

431
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,840
the one we send to Auntie.

432
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,480
It’s a still image.

433
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,680
The one of you crying as a kid.

434
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,720
Then Auntie said,

435
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
Wait a moment,

436
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
I have a video version.

437
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,840
My mom is really my biggest troll.

438
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,200
She said, “Wait a sec.”

439
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,120
What’s this?

440
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,440
Wait, there’s a video.

441
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You know, moms always think their kids look great.

442
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,320
Right?

443
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah.

444
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,840
This is my eldest son.

445
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,120
So pretty, so handsome.

446
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,480
My eldest cries with such personality.

447
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,040
They’re all like that.

448
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,120
Family, all moms are like this.

449
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,680
My mom’s the same.

450
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
The vibe in Barcelona

451
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
feels a bit different from Madrid.

452
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,760
The architecture here is really beautiful.

453
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,840
You could say

454
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
it's a perfect blend of ancient and modern.

455
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,280
A city like this.

456
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,400
Yeah, the old parts are truly historic.

457
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,440
And the modern areas are

458
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,400
very well designed.

459
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,120
Look at these buildings.

460
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
They're just

461
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
not the same as Madrid.

462
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,120
So beautiful.

463
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,960
Look at the outside here.

464
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
See how it's all in sections.

465
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
And these little details here.

466
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,400
Bit by bit.

467
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,680
Yeah, it's all protruding.

468
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,720
Very three-dimensional.

469
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,360
Barcelona's architecture is stunning.

470
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,880
Yeah.

471
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
All designed by masters.

472
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,160
Right.

473
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,160
Usually, people talk about Gaudí’s Four Masterpieces.

474
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
Sagrada Família,

475
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,040
Park Güell, and Casa Batlló,

476
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
and also Casa Milà.

477
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
Casa Milà.

478
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,200
The Stone House.

479
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,520
Gaudí’s.

480
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,080
The Stone House.

481
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,080
Welcome to the wonders of Gothic architecture.

482
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Sagrada Família is Gothic architecture.

483
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,680
If I’d known, I would’ve worn

484
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,480
something like a vampire outfit.

485
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Just now, Jin Jing told me

486
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,000
a great idea.

487
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Go ahead.

488
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
She said after we enter the church,

489
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,480
play church music in our headphones.

490
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,400
Walk around inside.

491
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,440
That works.

492
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,880
She said it feels totally different.

493
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,440
It's breathtaking.

494
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,080
You'll be amazed.

495
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,560
She's absolutely right.

496
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,600
It's like when we shoot a scene

497
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,640
and add our own background music.

498
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,800
It's immersive.

499
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,440
Why is Disney so immersive?

500
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Because there's always music with you.

501
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,320
Exactly.

502
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,480
Why are our evening parties so immersive?

503
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,440
Because of your two speakers.

504
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
We can sing in the villa.

505
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,760
There are silver arowanas in the pool.

506
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Silver arowanas in the pool.

507
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,320
That's the reason.

508
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Go home for dinner

509
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
Go home

510
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,240
This is really nice

511
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
Security is clearing the way for us

512
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,960
They're doing it for me

513
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,040
They're mentioning someone

514
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,440
Mentioning someone

515
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,599
Talking about Dandong, Liaoning

516
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,560
There's a guy named Liu Yuning

517
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,680
Do you know him?

518
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,720
Yeah, we know him

519
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,839
Give him some respect

520
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,319
He wants to visit

521
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,079
Okay

522
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,400
We'll handle security

523
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,040
Is there enough space behind you?

524
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,560
Yeah, bro

525
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
No problem

526
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,839
How about you long-legged guys?

527
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,240
Forget about Naiwen

528
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,680
What about you?

529
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,359
Yuwen and, you know, Xingxu have long legs

530
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,080
Look, I took this photo of Brother He for you

531
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
Long-legged "Duke"

532
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,680
So majestic

533
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,840
Makes people look so tiny

534
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Brother Honglei

535
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
On your left

536
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,320
Is there a bottle of water above that door?

537
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,960
Do you want it?

538
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,600
That's mine

539
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,360
That's mine

540
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,960
Not giving it

541
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,360
Pay up

542
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
You have to pay

543
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,000
I even let you visit Sagrada Família for free

544
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
That's great, thank you

545
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,560
I just listen to that

546
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Andrea Bocelli is fine too

547
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,360
Duke, your music is always so loud

548
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,480
Does Brother Naiwen play this at home

549
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,440
Every morning when he wakes up, it's this music

550
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,560
As soon as he opens his eyes

551
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,800
It starts playing

552
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,720
Can't help it

553
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,680
That's just family

554
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,480
That's the standard

555
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,080
The curtains slowly open

556
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,720
Several towels on your face

557
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,560
Gently wiping your eyelashes

558
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
No internet

559
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,600
The signal's bad

560
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Duke, you should get some signal towers at home

561
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,440
No way

562
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
The old man won't allow it

563
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,800
Feels like the Great Wall

564
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Doesn't this look like it?

565
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
You mean Huairou, right?

566
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,760
Kind of

567
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,320
This part looks like Yanqing

568
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,800
Right?

569
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,840
The mountains look a bit like Yunnan

570
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,720
Or Guizhou

571
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,120
I think it looks like Zhoushan

572
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,840
Yeah, that one

573
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,360
Spain feels pretty Chinese

574
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,120
We're here

575
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,600
We've arrived

576
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Let's go

577
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,400
It's so cool here

578
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,880
So cool

579
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,880
Basketball hoop

580
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,800
I can't keep

581
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,240
No more air shooting now

582
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,840
We need to get you a basketball

583
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,760
There must be one

584
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,760
No, look at that mountain, bro

585
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,360
Isn't this just like Huairou?

586
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,080
It really is

587
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,880
What's this for?

588
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,160
For grinding coffee beans

589
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,640
No, it's for grinding meat, bro

590
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
Put your hand in

591
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Isn't this

592
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
for grinding meat?

593
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,520
Hamburger

594
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
For making hamburgers

595
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,840
Now we should

596
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,240
make some amazed sounds

597
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,400
Ready, set

598
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,120
This is our living room.

599
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,880
This is a bedroom.

600
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,520
This is the living room.

601
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,360
This room is nice.

602
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll take this room.

603
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,360
So you'll sleep on the sofa, right?

604
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,760
Actually, that's fine.

605
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,520
Let's check out the rooms.

606
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,880
This is our kitchen.

607
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,000
This is the kitchen.

608
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm hungry.

609
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,120
Master Liu.

610
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,480
How about fried noodles, Master Liu?

611
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,880
Sure.

612
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,600
If we're hungry tonight, we'll fry some.

613
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,120
This is Room 8.

614
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,720
Number 8.

615
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,240
Number 8.

616
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,160
It's cozy.

617
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
That's all the space.

618
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,000
It's enough.

619
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,920
This is definitely enough.

620
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,840
Come on, let's see Room 7.

621
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
What?

622
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
The top room.

623
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,440
What?

624
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,000
Emperor Ning

625
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,560
Are you about to use your power?

626
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,760
I think so.

627
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,880
This is the bed.

628
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Such a big terrace.

629
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,600
Room 7 is like this.

630
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,800
A big suite.

631
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
This is Room 7.

632
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,720
Why is there such a big difference between Room 7 and Room 8?

633
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
Up and down, just like the saying.

634
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,200
Is that what it means?

635
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,280
Duke, come check out Room 7.

636
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,840
You always give your all for the game.

637
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,560
Tell me which room has the best Wi-Fi.

638
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Are there mosquitoes here?

639
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,680
There must be.

640
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,000
There's one this big.

641
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Wenzi

642
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,920
You big eggplant!

643
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
Speak properly.

644
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
I'm also called Li Naiwen.

645
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,800
Which one is number six?

646
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
This is six.

647
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
Six, let's check out six.

648
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,720
Six is fine too.

649
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,960
Six works as well.

650
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,680
Six.

651
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,800
There's a duplex too.

652
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,160
Six.

653
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,880
A small attic.

654
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,920
Are these two rooms?

655
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,680
Living together.

656
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,960
Who's being so ambiguous?

657
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,440
Five.

658
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,200
Five isn't small either.

659
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
They're all pretty good.

660
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
They're all quite big.

661
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,680
All pretty spacious.

662
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,920
Five is nice, I like it.

663
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,320
And this...

664
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,040
Surround style.

665
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
This one is really good.

666
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,800
Yeah.

667
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,840
Imagine opening all the windows at night.

668
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,200
Room 5 is good too, bro.

669
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,800
Number four.

670
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,200
It's fine.

671
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,560
A pretty standard one.

672
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,520
It's okay.

673
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,320
Just one room.

674
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,600
This layout...

675
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,400
This layout is nice.

676
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
Number two.

677
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,040
Number two is an attic.

678
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,320
How about we gather here tonight?

679
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,600
It's cozy here.

680
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,640
This place is nice.

681
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
It's perfect for a get-together.

682
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,520
This is...

683
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,040
One.

684
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
I think one is good.

685
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,320
This one is quite refined.

686
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,080
Three is nice too.

687
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,400
Three is good.

688
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Three must be for the youngest daughter.

689
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,280
Look.

690
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
Anna.

691
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,000
This is Anna's room.

692
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,680
Do you want to build a snowman?

693
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,040
Anna is...

694
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,920
Lin Yi.

695
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,040
What are you doing here?

696
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Sis, I can't go on.

697
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,280
Look at how much I'm sweating.

698
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
No way, our team...

699
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
We can't lose a single person.

700
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,920
Next, let me invite...

701
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,120
The state savior.

702
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,040
Hurry, get your energy back.

703
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,720
Thank you.

704
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,320
I'm back in shape.

705
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,280
I found something.

706
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,160
What?

707
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,600
There are so many kinds of vitamins here.

708
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,080
With these,

709
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,240
we don't have to worry about losing energy.

710
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,160
Otherwise...

711
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Let's stock up on more.

712
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,560
For our big brothers.

713
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Let's all refresh together.

714
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
Alright, let's go.

715
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,760
Okay, let's go.

716
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
Let's go eat.

717
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Time to eat.

718
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,760
I can't take it anymore.

719
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,680
If we wait any longer, Duke will lose more weight.

720
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,480
We've been filming a fake flower all this time.

721
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
Haven't you noticed it's been these same flowers since Italy?

722
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,240
The host prepared a welcome for everyone.

723
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Authentic Barcelona specialties are ready.

724
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,440
He hopes everyone can experience

725
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,000
the warmth and flavor of Spain through the food.

726
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,040
This shrimp looks great.

727
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,920
Let’s eat.

728
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Amazing.

729
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,680
So good.

730
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,520
This is really

731
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,080
such a happy feeling.

732
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,680
So happy.

733
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,680
Isn’t it delicious?

734
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,080
This seafood rice is authentic.

735
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,920
Try this beef.

736
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,760
This beef is so tender.

737
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,640
No need for a knife.

738
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,840
You really don’t need a knife.

739
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,480
No knife needed at all.

740
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
A spoon is enough.

741
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
This beef is delicious.

742
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Let me get a spoonful.

743
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,480
I finally understand

744
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,800
what makes Western food tasty.

745
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,280
How would you rate this?

746
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,600
The shrimp gets a 9 out of 10.

747
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,720
This beef

748
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,640
9.5 out of 10.

749
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,680
I rarely use the term “melts in your mouth,”

750
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,880
but this really does.

751
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,400
This beef

752
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,960
doesn’t taste that special to me.

753
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,760
The rice is a bit salty.

754
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,840
Don’t look at me, look at him.

755
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,680
I love eating.

756
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,560
I wasn’t looking at you.

757
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,000
I know.

758
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,640
We can eat together.

759
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,000
Of course.

760
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,360
Do you really think it’s not good?

761
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,000
No.

762
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,720
But I’m not at that level

763
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,040
Add some ham to this

764
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,800
and it’s perfect, really.

765
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,120
Otherwise, how would you eat it?

766
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,680
It’s amazing.

767
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,600
Can you eat both sides in time?

768
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
So good.

769
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,760
What’s the garlic for?

770
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,320
Bread.

771
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,040
It’s my first time having bread with garlic.

772
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,320
Me too.

773
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,120
The garlic is spread on top.

774
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,160
I just eat it together.

775
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
How do you spread it?

776
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,560
Use raw garlic and fresh tomato

777
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,240
and rub them on the bread.

778
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,320
Then drizzle olive oil.

779
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,440
It’s a local tradition.

780
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Rub.

781
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,440
That’s how you get garlic bread.

782
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,680
It’s the same, isn’t it?

783
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
Rub it on your teeth and eat?

784
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,000
That’s a fancy way to eat.

785
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,920
Garlic with bread.

786
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,240
There’s an old Spanish saying,

787
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Eat bread, don’t forget garlic.

788
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Let me try.

789
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,920
I’ll just swipe the bread.

790
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,720
Then I can eat it.

791
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Yuning.

792
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Just swipe your bread like her.

793
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,400
That’s it.

794
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,560
Nice, smell it.

795
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,400
How long did you rub it?

796
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
Just make sure it’s

797
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,840
spread evenly.

798
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,400
I think you’re just going through the motions.

799
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,800
No.

800
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
What do you call it?

801
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
Meaning.

802
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,520
Meaning.

803
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,240
There’s no garlic flavor like this, right?

804
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,920
There is.

805
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,960
Definitely has.

806
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,040
Today our Earth Team has two tasks.

807
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,160
One is to deliver on what we promised before.

808
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,520
Divine 8 Seconds.

809
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
The dance contest champion is

810
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Didi.

811
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Then you need to film it quickly.

812
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:42,960
While there's still daylight.

813
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,360
Okay.

814
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,560
The other task is about today's

815
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
room assignments.

816
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,640
Alright.

817
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,640
Can we have dessert now?

818
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Here, bring out the dessert.

819
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,920
You're worried the daylight will be gone.

820
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,960
And you won't be able to film Divine 8 Seconds.

821
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,800
You're rushing the food now.

822
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,200
You caught me, Brother Ning.

823
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
Then don't eat.

824
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,520
Stop eating.

825
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,080
Go do Divine 8 Seconds quickly.

826
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,680
It's rare for me to win.

827
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,400
Brothers and sisters,

828
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,480
can you let me have this?

829
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,440
Of course.

830
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,520
We'll save dessert for you.

831
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,400
Didi, eat less.

832
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,560
Or when it's time for Divine 8 Seconds,

833
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,360
it won't be so divine.

834
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,920
Right.

835
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Only your head will fit in the shot.

836
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
Because your belly's a bit big.

837
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,480
We'll have to do close-ups, okay?

838
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Divine "Pig" 8 Seconds.

839
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,040
You...

840
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,240
No Divine 8 Seconds.

841
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,160
I just slurred my words.

842
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,920
I slurred just now.

843
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,560
Sorry, no.

844
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,960
Lemon cake.

845
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,520
Here it comes.

846
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,920
Thank you.

847
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,360
This is mousse, right?

848
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,840
Yes.

849
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,080
This dessert is so delicious.

850
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,040
Super tasty.

851
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,720
I think I have to try it.

852
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,680
Or I'll regret it.

853
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,560
Take a bite.

854
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Just one bite.

855
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,920
He makes great desserts.

856
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,240
This one is so good.

857
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,240
Which one?

858
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,760
Right?

859
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,760
I'm shocked, it's so good.

860
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,600
This could score 9.8.

861
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,840
I really want to know

862
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,720
in your recipe book,

863
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
what does a perfect ten look like?

864
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,680
The taste of home.

865
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,400
Think about it.

866
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,640
How do we do Divine 8 Seconds?

867
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
Tonight, everyone listens to you.

868
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,040
Sure, we'll follow your lead.

869
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah, come up with an idea.

870
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Give us a rough plan.

871
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
I think the music video should look good.

872
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,440
Right.

873
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,320
Then put a pop-up in the bottom right corner.

874
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Keep playing those eight seconds.

875
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,920
You...

876
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,880
Yeah, or how about this:

877
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Put our faces in all four corners of the music video.

878
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,200
How about all of them are your avatar?

879
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,440
I'm the watermark.

880
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,520
Like a nail.

881
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,320
Pinning this paper to the wall.

882
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,840
That won't work.

883
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,880
Tencent Video has their own logo.

884
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,720
It might cover yours.

885
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,520
You know?

886
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,080
I actually want everyone in it.

887
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,960
So everyone’s face is shown.

888
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,320
We’ll definitely be in it, Didi.

889
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,960
But we’ll all remove our makeup.

890
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,760
Is that what you mean?

891
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,280
All eight of us have faces.

892
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,440
But we’re taking off our makeup.

893
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,280
If you’re all this willing to cooperate,

894
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,680
I really have no objections.

895
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,440
Honestly, that won’t work.

896
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
After removing the makeup,

897
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,800
We’re kind of stealing the spotlight.

898
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,880
About Didi’s part—

899
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,200
We’re losing daylight soon.

900
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,520
Come on.

901
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,320
Alright, let’s do it.

902
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,200
Let’s go.

903
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,040
It usually means

904
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,560
an eight-second but brilliant

905
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,920
and unforgettable performance.

906
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,640
Just make it as eye-catching as possible.

907
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,960
For example,

908
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,560
This one’s good.

909
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,000
I like this one too.

910
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,440
This one’s cool too.

911
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,320
This works.

912
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,000
This is actually fine.

913
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
This one’s cool.

914
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,200
This one’s really good.

915
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,920
Isn’t it just a close-up?

916
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,960
Isn’t it just a Divine 8 Seconds close-up?

917
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,000
That’s basically what it means.

918
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,360
We all do the “flower” pose.

919
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,840
And Didi stands in the middle, like this.

920
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
Sounds good.

921
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,120
Works for me.

922
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
Say, four of us in front,

923
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,520
and four in the back.

924
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Then they—

925
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,680
We do the “flower” pose like this.

926
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,440
Then she does her solo move.

927
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,200
Alright.

928
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,880
This is cool and funny.

929
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,120
This is good.

930
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,920
Just keep it cool like this.

931
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,320
The camera needs to coordinate.

932
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,680
Push in, pull out.

933
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,760
Director,

934
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,680
When we do the “flower,” give me a big close-up.

935
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,760
Alright?

936
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,120
The formation can be two in front,

937
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
three in the middle,

938
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,040
and four at the back.

939
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,360
Can I have a few handsome guys behind me?

940
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,680
Sure.

941
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,560
Which ones?

942
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,320
You pick.

943
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,440
One, two, three, four, five, six.

944
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,920
Didi,

945
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,240
Pick four handsome guys.

946
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,400
There are six here, pick four.

947
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
I finally get this chance.

948
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,600
I’m so happy.

949
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:22,920
So,

950
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,720
the six guys stand in a row.

951
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,640
Let’s line up first.

952
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,080
When we line up, announce your name.

953
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,120
Liaoning Dandong, Liu Yuning.

954
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,200
This one.

955
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,480
That’s fine.

956
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,080
Alright, let’s go.

957
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,080
Your final highlight

958
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,320
has to impress me.

959
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,080
Go ahead, old couple.

960
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,240
Bro, hurry up.

961
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
Come on, faster.

962
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,600
Hurry up.

963
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,240
Mom, Dad,

964
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
Can you two try a bit harder?

965
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,120
Don’t be like this.

966
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,960
You’re letting Mom join the boy group contest?

967
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,600
Isn’t that a bit inappropriate?

968
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,840
Your mom’s getting older.

969
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,680
Take care of her.

970
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,200
It’s fine.

971
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,080
Go ahead, come on.

972
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,200
It’s my first time meeting you.

973
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,720
You can use that wink I taught you.

974
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:06,960
Let’s go.

975
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,960
Come on, friends.

976
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,680
Let’s do it.

977
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Liaoning Dandong, Liu Yuning.

978
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,840
Come on, our Brother He.

979
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,320
You do that, bro.

980
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,240
Do this one.

981
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,920
Try this.

982
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,080
I can do this.

983
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,600
I quite like this.

984
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,680
Fujian Fuzhou No.2, Chen He.

985
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,360
I want to pick you, bro.

986
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,000
I choose you.

987
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,239
Something got in my eye.

988
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,000
My eye...

989
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,239
Didi, you ate a lot just now.

990
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,880
You eliminate him.

991
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,639
That's not good for your stomach.

992
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
Okay, next.

993
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm looking forward to it.

994
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,800
Lin Yi from Shenyang, Liaoning.

995
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,360
Sis.

996
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,440
Sis.

997
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
Did your vocal cords go home?

998
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,600
Sis.

999
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,800
What is this?

1000
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,840
Eliminate him.

1001
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,440
What is this?

1002
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,160
What does this mean?

1003
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,720
He's here.

1004
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,680
What does that mean?

1005
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,600
I don't get it.

1006
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,080
Greasy.

1007
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,960
What does that mean?

1008
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,800
Sis.

1009
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,360
Sis.

1010
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,840
Sis.

1011
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,240
Sis.

1012
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,240
Yeah, you can't call someone "sis" now.

1013
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Where did that come from?

1014
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,080
It's from the internet.

1015
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Your turn.

1016
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,800
My turn.

1017
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,160
Number four, Shenyang, Liaoning.

1018
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,240
Alright.

1019
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,600
He's still looking at me.

1020
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,640
Alright.

1021
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,360
Brother Naiwen is starting to think.

1022
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
Thinking about his character.

1023
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,120
The movement came out first.

1024
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,760
Number five.

1025
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,160
Contestant number five.

1026
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,360
Number five.

1027
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,320
What's up with contestant number five?

1028
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,000
Tianjin.

1029
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,640
Sis.

1030
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,720
Is it easy for me?

1031
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,040
Sis.

1032
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
Is it easy for me?

1033
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,760
This works.

1034
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,920
Is it easy for me?

1035
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,640
This is fine too.

1036
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,680
Is it easy for me?

1037
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,440
Tianjin specialty.

1038
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,800
This rhythm is pretty good.

1039
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,440
I'll wrap it up then.

1040
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,280
Honglei from Harbin, Heilongjiang.

1041
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,120
This one's got style.

1042
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,480
This one's good.

1043
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,560
I think so too.

1044
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,520
Which number?

1045
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,720
Number six.

1046
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,160
Number six.

1047
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,520
This works.

1048
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,880
I think these two...

1049
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,080
My dad and mom are the least greasy.

1050
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,880
I'll still pick the handsome guys.

1051
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,880
Wait a second.

1052
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,880
Like this.

1053
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,160
How about you two stand with me?

1054
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,640
Okay.

1055
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,280
Right here with me.

1056
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Alright, we'll do as you say.

1057
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,880
Okay, you lead the dance.

1058
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,640
You startled me.

1059
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,200
I’m full now.

1060
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,320
Let’s get two taller ones in the back.

1061
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,160
We’re a bit taller.

1062
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,800
Come on, what’s up?

1063
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,160
Alright.

1064
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,280
Brother Xuxu, you go.

1065
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,560
Like this, you stand here.

1066
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
I’ll stand here.

1067
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,320
You stand right here.

1068
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,640
Okay.

1069
00:37:59,640 --> 00:37:59,920
And then Brother He,

1070
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,680
You stand here.

1071
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,960
Just like that, yes.

1072
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Look, we accidentally ended up in the center.

1073
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,400
We’re in the center spot.

1074
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,320
So that’s how it is.

1075
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,720
Let’s make her shine.

1076
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,640
That’s it.

1077
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,080
Like this.

1078
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,640
We all do this gesture and look at her.

1079
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,800
Surround her.

1080
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,320
Envelop her.

1081
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,200
Then when she turns,

1082
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,560
We all open up and move back.

1083
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,160
Sounds good.

1084
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,000
Like a flower.

1085
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,160
First, we two hold for two seconds.

1086
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,960
Alright.

1087
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,440
We can hold for two seconds too.

1088
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,280
Then flash.

1089
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,520
The starting logic is

1090
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,280
to surround her.

1091
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,560
You face away from us first.

1092
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,280
Then like this.

1093
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,960
Block.

1094
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,560
You two as well.

1095
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
You two turn around too.

1096
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,080
Just like this.

1097
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,640
We’ll turn around too.

1098
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,040
Bro doesn’t show any face at all.

1099
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,960
Bro, at least show a little face.

1100
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,800
Later, we’ll

1101
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,080
No.

1102
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,360
Just like Lin Yi.

1103
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,000
When we open up,

1104
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,440
everyone

1105
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,880
I agree, at the beginning

1106
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,840
let’s add “Brother Lin Yi’s sis.”

1107
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,880
What’s wrong?

1108
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,240
You have to say it.

1109
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,120
The first is “zi.”

1110
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,640
Zi.

1111
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,600
The second is “ze.”

1112
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,280
Zi-ze.

1113
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,920
But you can’t just say “zi-ze.”

1114
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,480
You need to add a bit of a “yue” sound.

1115
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
Zi-ze.

1116
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,720
You really are from Tianjin.

1117
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,280
You say “sis” so well.

1118
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,120
Wait a second.

1119
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,760
He said,

1120
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,280
Awesome.

1121
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,080
That’s the vibe.

1122
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,560
You put feeling into it.

1123
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,800
I know it is.

1124
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,840
Imagine that word in your stomach.

1125
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,560
Let it out with a “yue.”

1126
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,120
Xingxu.

1127
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,960
You have to use your little shuffle step.

1128
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,920
You need to—

1129
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,880
Do the “yue,” right?

1130
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,640
Alright.

1131
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,960
You pouted over.

1132
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,080
Alright, that’s good, it works.

1133
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,680
Let’s just set up the formation, that’s it.

1134
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Stop running away.

1135
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,200
No.

1136
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,920
I already said.

1137
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,920
Hurry.

1138
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
I’ll do this, listen.

1139
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,720
I’ll put my hand here.

1140
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,560
Then you bring your face over.

1141
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,000
Is that okay?

1142
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,760
Come on.

1143
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,680
One, two, three, go!

1144
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
This is so “evil.”

1145
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,240
Try it.

1146
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,920
Go ahead, you turn first.

1147
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,840
Add a bit of “sis” vibe.

1148
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,080
This has a sense of breathing.

1149
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,160
There’s a sense of breathing.

1150
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,600
Three, two, one.

1151
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,360
Don't spit on my face.

1152
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,600
Go back again.

1153
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:07,960
Back.

1154
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,480
Horror movie.

1155
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,040
Horror movie.

1156
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,040
Sis got eaten.

1157
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,480
Take a look.

1158
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,200
It should be fine.

1159
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,160
See if you're satisfied.

1160
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,920
If the effect isn't good,

1161
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,600
just blame the Steadicam movement.

1162
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,840
One take.

1163
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,840
I request.

1164
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,240
I request another take.

1165
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Okay, what do you want to adjust, director?

1166
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,000
I'll adjust.

1167
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,840
It's not your fault.

1168
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,400
Alright.

1169
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:56,920
So, here's the plan.

1170
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,800
Camera director,

1171
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
please do it like this again.

1172
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,760
On my artist's side,

1173
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,680
I have a few adjustments.

1174
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,400
Just add a bit of breathing.

1175
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,000
Push forward a little.

1176
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,560
Pull back a bit more.

1177
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,160
Push again.

1178
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,240
Give her a sense of impact.

1179
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,080
After opening,

1180
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes, after opening.

1181
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,040
Add a bit more.

1182
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,520
After opening.

1183
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,240
When she jumps herself,

1184
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,000
give her some breathing space.

1185
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,840
Pull back, give a little.

1186
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,960
Do we have any on site

1187
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,040
like those tube lights?

1188
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,640
Are there colored ones?

1189
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,360
Like blue and red?

1190
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,520
No.

1191
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,720
I think the previous setup was great.

1192
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,520
Let's not add that.

1193
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,280
Too many agents.

1194
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,120
Agents are too fussy.

1195
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,640
The face was very smooth just now.

1196
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,720
Agents are always picky.

1197
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,400
Sorry.

1198
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,320
Thank you, everyone.

1199
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,800
Thank you all.

1200
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,840
It's my duty.

1201
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,560
Come on.

1202
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
"Lemon Spirit"

1203
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,440
What do you mean?

1204
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,600
Sis, I just forgot.

1205
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,640
Sis.

1206
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,320
Let's just use these eight seconds.

1207
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,760
That's good.

1208
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,440
This one is good.

1209
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,760
These eight seconds are the best.

1210
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,000
Let's go with this one.

1211
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,000
This one.

1212
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,720
Agent, delete it.

1213
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,920
I think this is good too.

1214
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,680
It's fine, it's good.

1215
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I like it too.

1216
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,240
I'm very happy.

1217
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,360
Thank you all.

1218
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,720
Love you all.

1219
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,000
Let's split into rooms.

1220
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,920
Everyone has seen the rooms.

1221
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,760
Yes.

1222
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,040
Everyone just tasted dinner.

1223
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,640
One of Spain's most iconic dishes.

1224
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,320
Ham.

1225
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,000
Spanish ham is made by

1226
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,640
salting and air-drying,

1227
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,960
then aged for a long time.

1228
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,240
It tastes salty and savory,

1229
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,280
with a rich flavor.

1230
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,360
There are many ways to eat it.

1231
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,200
Before,

1232
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,160
we had the "Lemon Phantom" in Italy.

1233
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,800
Now in Spain,

1234
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,760
we need a "Ham Phantom" too.

1235
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,840
The nine of you

1236
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,800
will be wrapped tightly together

1237
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,200
with a long roll of paper.

1238
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,000
If the paper doesn't break,

1239
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,440
you have ninety seconds to go back and forth.

1240
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,880
Best of five, first to three wins.

1241
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,000
The Ham Phantom must hide their identity

1242
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,560
and sabotage the mission.

1243
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,120
If the paper breaks during the game,

1244
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,760
the Ham Phantom wins.

1245
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,960
Otherwise, the other players win.

1246
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,960
Okay.

1247
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,560
Alright.

1248
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,240
Simple.

1249
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,960
Do we know each other's roles?

1250
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,840
No, you don't.

1251
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,720
There's no mutual recognition, don't worry.

1252
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,880
Draw for the Phantom.

1253
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,280
Come on.

1254
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,040
I'll take this one.

1255
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,960
Everyone, close your eyes.

1256
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,800
Ham Phantom No. 1, open your eyes.

1257
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,440
Ham Phantom No.1, close your eyes.

1258
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,160
Ham Phantom No.1, close your eyes.

1259
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,240
Ham Phantom No.1.

1260
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,720
Li Naiwen, what are you doing?

1261
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,160
It must be Uncle Naiwen.

1262
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,880
Who’s being so cheeky?

1263
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,280
Li Naiwen, what are you up to?

1264
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,400
Close your eyes.

1265
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,960
It’s definitely Uncle Naiwen.

1266
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,720
Ham Phantom No.2, open your eyes.

1267
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Ham Phantom No.2, close your eyes.

1268
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,400
Ham Phantom No.2.

1269
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,840
Brother Honglei.

1270
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,040
Who’s so talkative?

1271
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,160
Everyone, open your eyes.

1272
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,720
Honestly,

1273
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,520
No.1 and No.2 are really this clueless.

1274
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,000
Let’s stop playing.

1275
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,480
They can’t even get the open and close eyes part right.

1276
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Maybe we should just give up.

1277
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,720
I think it’s Lin Yi.

1278
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:53,680
Yeah.

1279
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,440
Why?

1280
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,520
Special card, please open your eyes.

1281
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,840
What, is this a secret code?

1282
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,200
Because this open and close eyes thing

1283
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,920
is your weak spot.

1284
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,680
Both opening and closing eyes are your weak spots.

1285
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,240
Lin Yi.

1286
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,520
You were just waiting for your teammate to open their eyes, right?

1287
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
Is there a mutual recognition phase?

1288
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
There isn’t a mutual recognition phase, right?

1289
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,160
There is.

1290
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:19,760
There is.

1291
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,800
There is.

1292
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,720
Let’s do it.

1293
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,560
It’s fine, let’s do this.

1294
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,640
Let’s vote him out in the first round.

1295
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,160
Why?

1296
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,880
Is that okay?

1297
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,400
Why?

1298
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,880
Let’s vote out two or three people

1299
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,920
who we don’t trust.

1300
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,680
Make them stand in the middle.

1301
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,560
So they can’t sabotage.

1302
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,240
Otherwise, it’s easy to break the chain.

1303
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,880
Okay.

1304
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,280
Is that alright?

1305
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,320
You stand in the middle.

1306
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,840
Alright, sure.

1307
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,080
Who’s No.2?

1308
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,560
Still can’t tell?

1309
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Okay.

1310
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,080
It’s you, right?

1311
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,680
You talk so much.

1312
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,480
And so loudly.

1313
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,720
Li Naiwen, what are you doing?

1314
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,960
I know you very well.

1315
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,840
I know you.

1316
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,280
She’s the loudest.

1317
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,720
She’s hiding something.

1318
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,360
She shouted with her eyes open.

1319
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,680
She said Ham Phantom No.1, open your eyes.

1320
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,040
And while her eyes were open, she said

1321
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:11,840
Li Naiwen,

1322
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,800
Why haven’t you closed your eyes yet?

1323
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,080
Like that.

1324
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,840
So why didn’t you close your eyes just now?

1325
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,080
I did close them.

1326
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,120
Second, how about Wang Yuwen?

1327
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,280
Yeah, I also think Sister Yuwen is a bit suspicious.

1328
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,480
No, it’s not Lin Yi.

1329
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,080
Right.

1330
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,400
How about she goes second?

1331
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,120
Who's third?

1332
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,480
Me.

1333
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,280
I'm third.

1334
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,360
Why?

1335
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,680
I'm watching those two.

1336
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,160
You.

1337
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,040
You can't.

1338
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
Li Naiwen.

1339
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,320
I think you're the one not closing your eyes.

1340
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,360
No, I just don't want to get voted out by mistake.

1341
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,360
If something happens, I'm in the middle.

1342
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,880
And I can keep an eye on things.

1343
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,240
Why don't you want to get voted out by mistake?

1344
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,360
Because I think you guys will vote for me.

1345
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,800
Okay, you want to be third.

1346
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,920
Then you can't be third.

1347
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,800
Let Brother Honglei stand in the middle, okay?

1348
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,240
Come on, let's do it.

1349
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,640
Let's go.

1350
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,560
So whoever breaks it,

1351
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,840
is definitely the "Phantom".

1352
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,760
Wang Yuwen.

1353
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,400
The two of us like this.

1354
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,080
Okay.

1355
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,080
You watch Lin Yi.

1356
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,640
If you're a good person.

1357
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,480
Ready.

1358
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,920
March!

1359
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,360
One, two.

1360
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:31,880
Wait a second.

1361
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,440
Hold on.

1362
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,600
That's not right.

1363
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,480
Wait.

1364
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,240
Hold on.

1365
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,240
Hold on.

1366
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,120
Hold on.

1367
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,600
Someone...

1368
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,880
Someone's messing around.

1369
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,160
Wait.

1370
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,960
Hold on.

1371
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,400
Li Naiwen.

1372
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,320
No, it's her.

1373
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,120
Who? Don't touch me.

1374
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,200
Don't touch me.

1375
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,240
You're way too obvious.

1376
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,160
Wang Yuwen.

1377
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,560
You're way too obvious.

1378
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,120
I didn't do anything.

1379
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,480
I'll do it.

1380
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,600
That's how Sis Yuwen did it.

1381
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,840
Reenact the scene.

1382
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,160
Right.

1383
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,680
Reenact the scene.

1384
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,520
Wait.

1385
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It was like this just now.

1386
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,400
I said move forward.

1387
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,080
Then said stop.

1388
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,920
Someone hooked my leg.

1389
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,920
Not even pretending anymore.

1390
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,440
Li Naiwen.

1391
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,600
I'm an old "killer".

1392
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,840
That's how it was just now.

1393
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,920
Guys, that's how it happened.

1394
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,640
I turned around, Wang Yuwen...

1395
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,880
Who touched me?

1396
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,520
Then her foot and Li Naiwen's foot...

1397
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,680
It really wasn't me.

1398
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,920
It was really Li Naiwen who put his foot here.

1399
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,440
Li Naiwen too.

1400
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,360
Really not.

1401
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,800
Really not.

1402
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,760
Really not.

1403
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,440
Why do you seem a bit nervous?

1404
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,560
I definitely feel like it's out of control.

1405
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,680
I've been shouting stop the whole time.

1406
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,760
You were watching from the side, what do you think?

1407
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,760
I was watching.

1408
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
I think he's safe for now.

1409
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,200
He is...

1410
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,120
He's walking forward.

1411
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,680
I'm backing up.

1412
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,160
Why are you backing up?

1413
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,480
Because I'm watching.

1414
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,920
You walk forward.

1415
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,720
You can walk forward.

1416
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,680
Why back up?

1417
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,720
You can walk forward inside.

1418
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,480
Why do you have to back up?

1419
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,200
I'm just asking you.

1420
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,520
Why are your hips twisting like that?

1421
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,400
Yeah, because I saw everything.

1422
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,120
I saw you doing weird moves in the back.

1423
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,440
Weird moves.

1424
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,480
That's how it is now, guys.

1425
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,880
That's how it happened.

1426
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,120
Also, let me say this.

1427
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,600
Even if Brother Naiwen hooks your leg,

1428
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,000
you can do this.

1429
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,040
If your leg is hooked,

1430
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,200
it's not your waist that's hooked.

1431
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,920
When your leg is hooked, your first reaction is

1432
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,640
to do this, right?

1433
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,320
Why did you do that?

1434
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,960
Yeah.

1435
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,480
Stand here, let me show you.

1436
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,680
How he moves—turn your back.

1437
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:26,960
Okay.

1438
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,720
Step back.

1439
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,160
Step back.

1440
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,400
Right.

1441
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,040
Then he—don't move.

1442
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,600
At this point, he's stuck here.

1443
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,600
Let me ask you,

1444
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,720
how did you walk?

1445
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,920
Can you go like this?

1446
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,840
You have to walk like this, right?

1447
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,960
You have to walk like this, right?

1448
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,720
I can really read people.

1449
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,800
Lin Yi.

1450
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,600
It's you.

1451
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,440
Three, two, one, please vote.

1452
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,840
Vote for me.

1453
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:01,840
Any objections?

1454
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,080
Vote for me.

1455
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,040
You voted for him.

1456
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,280
I just wanted to vote.

1457
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,120
Yuwen is eliminated.

1458
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:07,800
Yuwen is

1459
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,920
a regular player.

1460
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,400
So unfair!

1461
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,960
Don't trust Li Naiwen.

1462
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,280
I said she wouldn't do that for no reason.

1463
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,080
Really.

1464
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,720
I just felt something was off.

1465
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,520
Innocent as a lamb.

1466
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,120
Innocent as a lamb.

1467
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,280
So whose foot do you think it was?

1468
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,240
It was Li Naiwen's foot.

1469
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,800
Suddenly, a foot appeared.

1470
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Tripped me.

1471
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,480
Okay.

1472
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
So it was Li Naiwen.

1473
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,320
Then why did you call stop?

1474
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,280
I just realized now,

1475
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,680
it's out of control.

1476
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,480
It's out of control.

1477
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,320
No.

1478
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,600
We can keep going.

1479
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,480
Did the rope break?

1480
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,040
Sun Honglei

1481
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,400
Do you think when things get out of control

1482
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,840
we can still keep moving forward?

1483
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,680
That paper definitely won't break, right?

1484
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,680
Sun Honglei

1485
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,360
Go on, say it again.

1486
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,560
Anyway, I just feel like on my side

1487
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,160
my feet are all tangled up.

1488
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,040
You're on my side.

1489
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,920
Your logic is kind of

1490
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,160
a bit off.

1491
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,200
This round, Uncle Naiwen, you're inside.

1492
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,600
I'm inside, okay.

1493
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,440
Uncle Naiwen and Brother Honglei are inside, right?

1494
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,120
The two of us are inside.

1495
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,440
Lin Yi is still inside.

1496
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,440
I still can't clear my suspicion?

1497
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,800
No.

1498
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,200
Of course not.

1499
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,840
We're face to face.

1500
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,720
We're face to face.

1501
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,200
Face to face, that's so ambiguous.

1502
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,400
No, you have to keep an eye out.

1503
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm watching him.

1504
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,720
Lin Yi, hug your sister.

1505
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:40,880
Sis.

1506
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,720
Big sis.

1507
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,440
Big sis.

1508
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,320
Sis.

1509
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,120
Yu Wen

1510
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Sorry about earlier.

1511
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,800
But this round, help us keep watch.

1512
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,280
Thank you.

1513
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,400
Sorry for the trouble, appreciate it.

1514
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,640
I'm just watching you, Lin Yi.

1515
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,160
I'm innocent.

1516
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,440
Alright, let's go.

1517
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,680
Three, two, one, go.

1518
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,800
One, two.

1519
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,400
Don't step on my shoes.

1520
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,440
Who stepped on your shoes?

1521
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:04,800
You did.

1522
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,120
It's obvious now.

1523
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,960
Li Naiwen

1524
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,480
No.

1525
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,320
It's definitely him.

1526
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,280
It's clearly Li Naiwen.

1527
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,240
Alright, keep going.

1528
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,520
Okay.

1529
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,280
Alright, three, two, one, go.

1530
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,760
Look.

1531
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,320
Brother Honglei

1532
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,480
You can actually turn around and walk.

1533
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,840
Yeah, just turn around and walk, that's it.

1534
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,320
Xiao Wen, keep an eye on him.

1535
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,680
Watch his feet.

1536
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,240
My feet aren't touching anyone.

1537
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,720
Okay.

1538
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,680
I'm even standing on my tiptoes.

1539
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,520
Alright, I'm holding his pant leg.

1540
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,280
We have to go.

1541
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,600
No one's stepping on your feet now.

1542
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,680
Aren't you anxious?

1543
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,720
Yeah, I'm not anxious.

1544
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,240
We're almost at Earth.

1545
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,720
One, two.

1546
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,200
Come back.

1547
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,280
Don't go that way, Lin Yi.

1548
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,360
Don't go that way, Lin Yi.

1549
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,240
Knocked down.

1550
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,600
Broken.

1551
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,200
Come here.

1552
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,360
Broken.

1553
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,880
Broken.

1554
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,760
Broken.

1555
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,400
I didn't move, right?

1556
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,760
I didn't move, right?

1557
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,120
It's all among these three.

1558
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,160
Just these three people.

1559
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,320
They're being way too obvious.

1560
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,200
Uncle Naiwen, Lin Yi, Brother Honglei

1561
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,280
I think

1562
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,720
it's those two.

1563
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,880
Ham partners.

1564
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,480
Where did it break?

1565
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
Right behind your butt.

1566
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah, bro.

1567
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,440
Seriously.

1568
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,200
I don't know why.

1569
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,600
During this game,

1570
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,200
the feet could never be like this.

1571
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,080
No, he keeps saying I step on his heel.

1572
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,600
Ask her.

1573
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,960
Yeah, that's true.

1574
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,840
His heel.

1575
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,080
Old lady.

1576
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:44,880
What's up?

1577
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,120
Look at his heel.

1578
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,360
He really does step on my foot a lot.

1579
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,560
I have to avoid him, right?

1580
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,240
Otherwise, I'll get blamed again

1581
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,960
for stepping on his foot.

1582
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,360
But I think his feet are really weird.

1583
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,000
Because his feet

1584
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,520
always try to go between other people's feet.

1585
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,160
Yeah.

1586
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,760
Me.

1587
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,120
Yeah.

1588
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,240
At that moment, did I

1589
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,200
hold you really tight?

1590
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,000
Be honest.

1591
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,440
Right?

1592
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,360
Was I holding onto you?

1593
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,240
Because I was afraid you'd fall, right?

1594
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,160
Yeah, I almost fell just now.

1595
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:15,840
Exactly.

1596
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,880
I held him really tight.

1597
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,320
My leg was here.

1598
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,760
So, you tell me.

1599
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,120
Yeah.

1600
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,600
And then?

1601
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,640
And then?

1602
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,640
And then?

1603
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,520
And then?

1604
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,160
Are you asking him or me?

1605
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,120
You tell us, go ahead.

1606
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,800
I couldn't pay attention to all that.

1607
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,000
So what was my foot doing just now?

1608
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,080
Tell me.

1609
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,840
Alright, here's the deal.

1610
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,760
I suggest

1611
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,200
we keep Brother Naiwen safe this round.

1612
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,560
Yeah, because his argument was sincere.

1613
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,840
He's already shouting himself hoarse.

1614
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,080
I believe your exhaustion.

1615
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,240
You're totally worn out.

1616
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,160
So let's keep him safe this round.

1617
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,240
I think Lin Yi is suspicious.

1618
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
It's got nothing to do with me.

1619
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,880
Lin Yi never even lifted his foot.

1620
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,440
I got stuck just now.

1621
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,400
I didn't trap you.

1622
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,920
Who trapped you?

1623
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,240
Because I kept pulling him along.

1624
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
He wouldn't move at all.

1625
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,480
You know?

1626
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,200
It was my left foot that got stuck.

1627
00:56:59,200 --> 00:56:59,880
My foot was here.

1628
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,000
But there's another leg here.

1629
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,480
This one.

1630
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,080
Where's the leg?

1631
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,640
Where's the leg?

1632
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,000
I've been here the whole time.

1633
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,120
She was pulling mine.

1634
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,120
My leg wasn't here.

1635
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,000
It was your leg.

1636
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,480
My leg didn't trap him.

1637
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,280
I definitely didn't trap him.

1638
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,520
Three, two, one, please vote.

1639
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,600
Lin Yi's role: regular player.

1640
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,760
This is so weird.

1641
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,800
Two votes and still no one got it right.

1642
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,560
This is kind of...

1643
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,760
This is kind of tough.

1644
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,760
What were we stepping on at the start?

1645
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,000
You stepped on me right here.

1646
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,160
Why did you step on me?

1647
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,200
I don't think it's Brother Naiwen.

1648
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,600
Because I was facing him the whole time.

1649
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,800
He kept walking in tiny steps.

1650
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,680
I didn't even vote.

1651
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,480
Then let's put these two old guys in the middle.

1652
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,440
What do you mean, old guys?

1653
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,320
Just now, we put the old ones in the middle.

1654
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,120
It was something that happened outside.

1655
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,680
Like this.

1656
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,560
Can we do it this round?

1657
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,800
We face them.

1658
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,720
No, like this.

1659
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,400
The easiest way is

1660
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,440
Let these two brothers go in front.

1661
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,280
Because the two of them

1662
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:16,560
No.

1663
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,840
They can walk normally.

1664
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,560
They won't trip anyone up.

1665
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,680
No more confusing stuff.

1666
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,480
Alright, that's fine.

1667
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,480
Can you watch him?

1668
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:23,960
You guard him.

1669
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,320
Just keep an eye on him.

1670
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,560
Honestly, I can't keep him in check.

1671
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:29,680
Come on.

1672
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,520
Let's watch him, come on.

1673
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,360
I'm limited in what I can do.

1674
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,720
What do you mean?

1675
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,360
Come here.

1676
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,560
Just stand here, don't worry about it.

1677
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,120
What do you mean you can't guard me?

1678
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,200
Gift from Room 8, go.

1679
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,520
Did you see who squeezed me?

1680
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,200
It was Brother Naiwen.

1681
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,720
And who else?

1682
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,080
I only saw Brother Naiwen.

1683
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,960
But honestly,

1684
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,520
It didn't feel intentional.

1685
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,520
It wasn't on purpose.

1686
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,040
Yeah.

1687
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,240
Who?

1688
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,760
Right?

1689
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,120
I think both of the old couple are suspicious.

1690
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,600
One is the "Charging Ham."

1691
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,360
One is the "Cautious Ham."

1692
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,000
Two types.

1693
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,400
Because he knows

1694
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,520
If even one person messes around,

1695
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,600
He can just do nothing.

1696
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,520
Aren't you guys not supposed to stand there?

1697
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:15,880
You guys.

1698
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,320
Any analysis?

1699
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,360
Can you walk over here?

1700
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:19,640
Yes.

1701
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,800
Yes.

1702
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,280
Move your feet.

1703
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,400
If anyone dares to put their foot between mine,

1704
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,280
I'll step on it.

1705
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,440
Wait, don't push.

1706
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,920
Go.

1707
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,200
Don't squeeze outwards.

1708
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,200
He told me to move out.

1709
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,760
Who should I listen to?

1710
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,120
Alright, go.

1711
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,360
One, two.

1712
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,320
You can take big steps.

1713
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,320
Brother Honglei, you can take big steps.

1714
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,000
Brother Honglei.

1715
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,560
One, two.

1716
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,440
Brother Naiwen, you can take big steps too.

1717
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,320
Me, look.

1718
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,840
Why are you so nervous?

1719
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,480
Look.

1720
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:51,960
Feet.

1721
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,960
Brother Naiwen's feet, right?

1722
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,280
Yeah.

1723
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,080
You don't need to lift your right foot.

1724
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,680
Why are you doing that with your right foot?

1725
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,440
I'm walking like this.

1726
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,800
You don't have to walk like that.

1727
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,040
Brother Honglei.

1728
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,640
Brother Honglei, no need to walk in a T-step.

1729
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,320
You two don't know how to walk.

1730
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,440
That's too much.

1731
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,200
Look at these feet.

1732
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,400
One, two.

1733
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,760
Go.

1734
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,600
Hurry.

1735
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,760
Go.

1736
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,920
It's stable now.

1737
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,120
Unless someone trips themselves later.

1738
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,640
How much time is left? How many seconds?

1739
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,200
How many seconds left?

1740
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,440
Not moving, he's not moving.

1741
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,520
Walk faster.

1742
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,200
Uncle, walk faster.

1743
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,760
Hurry.

1744
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,280
It's not Li Naiwen.

1745
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,640
He tore it.

1746
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:47,560
Naiwen.

1747
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,400
These two, vote.

1748
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,280
Start voting.

1749
01:00:59,360 --> 01:00:59,720
Me.

1750
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,840
Behind me.

1751
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,760
Two "monsters" behind me.

1752
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,200
Let me tell you.

1753
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,840
Even if I grab their collars, I can't hold them back.

1754
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,120
Why didn't you tear it earlier?

1755
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:15,840
This.

1756
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,840
Inside the circle.

1757
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,200
Just walk normally.

1758
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,000
Once inside the circle, you change like this.

1759
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,840
What's wrong with you?

1760
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,160
Put a paper ring around you.

1761
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:28,920
And you just...

1762
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:29,920
No.

1763
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,720
What's this?

1764
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,160
You don't get it.

1765
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,600
Spanish ham is just like this.

1766
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,480
Brother Honglei is like this.

1767
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,200
Brother Honglei does it like this.

1768
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,680
That's the T-step walk.

1769
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,000
No, it's like this.

1770
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,200
It's like this.

1771
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:43,800
Like this.

1772
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,360
Like this.

1773
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,320
He went forward.

1774
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,720
Can you...

1775
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,240
Li Naiwen, now you...

1776
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:54,800
Go ahead, say it.

1777
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,560
I won't say anything.

1778
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,720
Can you play properly?

1779
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,000
You're still pretending to be a good guy.

1780
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,440
When you reach the finish, you tear it off.

1781
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,920
Of course I have to tear it.

1782
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,640
So you guys won, right?

1783
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,040
Ham Phantom wins this round.

1784
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,560
Let's invite the Ham Phantom.

1785
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,680
Come on, give a round of applause.

1786
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,320
Let's go.

1787
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,480
So, what about me?

1788
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,400
Why aren't the old couple moving?

1789
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,400
Peony.

1790
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,120
How did the two of us get caught together?

1791
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,480
Then Ham Phantom gets one point this round.

1792
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,520
Same, get your roles.

1793
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,240
Come on.

1794
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,400
Play properly.

1795
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,000
Play properly.

1796
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,080
Don't suspect me this round.

1797
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,600
Play properly.

1798
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,080
Play properly.

1799
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,600
Everyone, close your eyes.

1800
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:51,880
Come on.

1801
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,120
Ham Phantom No. 1, open your eyes.

1802
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,640
Ham Phantom No. 1, open your eyes.

1803
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,720
Ham Phantom No. 1, close your eyes.

1804
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,560
Nice, very clever this time.

1805
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,280
Really smart.

1806
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,040
Ham Phantom No. 2, open your eyes.

1807
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,640
Ham Phantom No. 2, close your eyes.

1808
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,480
Brother Ning, you played well.

1809
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,760
Everyone, open your eyes.

1810
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,280
Smart people.

1811
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,520
Naiwen, I suggest you change your shoes.

1812
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,960
You'll be suspected again this round.

1813
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,080
I'll take off my shoes.

1814
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,840
I'm a good guy this round.

1815
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,920
It hurts when everyone steps on it.

1816
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,240
Actually, you don't need to. Let me tell you.

1817
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,240
His leg is fine now.

1818
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,040
I think this round, he...

1819
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:27,880
This round...

1820
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,640
Is your leg better?

1821
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,280
Believe in yourself.

1822
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,760
You'll walk well this round.

1823
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,080
No matter what shoes you wear.

1824
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,240
He really wants to win.

1825
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,040
How did you see that?

1826
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,400
Come on.

1827
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:48,920
Pass the toilet paper.

1828
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:49,880
This round,

1829
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,080
the difficulty goes up.

1830
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,480
The roll will be tighter.

1831
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,280
Ready, go!

1832
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,240
One, two.

1833
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,160
This is too close.

1834
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,160
This is too close.

1835
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,320
But it's fine, this is okay.

1836
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,440
Steady.

1837
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,040
One, two.

1838
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,560
Steady.

1839
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,200
Steady.

1840
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,760
I'll scoot forward.

1841
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,520
Okay.

1842
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,200
One, two.

1843
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,360
What's wrong? What happened?

1844
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,520
It broke on this side.

1845
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,640
It can't be me, right?

1846
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,520
It can't be me.

1847
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,160
Alright, where did it break?

1848
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,240
Not me.

1849
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,080
It was at Jin Jing and Yuning.

1850
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,160
Jin Jing and Yuning.

1851
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,600
It was Sister Jin.

1852
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,120
Not me.

1853
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,360
It was you two.

1854
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,960
It's either Sister Jin or Yuning.

1855
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,040
That's for sure.

1856
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,360
It really wasn't me.

1857
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,520
It was you two.

1858
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,600
I swear on my honor.

1859
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,600
It definitely wasn't me.

1860
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,640
Brother Ning, did you push your hips just now?

1861
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,560
I don't have hips, what hips?

1862
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,240
You think you have hips, huh?

1863
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,080
No, bro.

1864
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,120
You think your legs are long, right?

1865
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,840
You can't think that.

1866
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,320
Brother Ning.

1867
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,680
Did you just do this move?

1868
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,840
My hand was so close to you.

1869
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,600
I was basically walking right next to you.

1870
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,160
But I don't know what your butt was doing.

1871
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,840
I walked like this.

1872
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,960
He was watching me.

1873
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,520
I can't see your butt from here.

1874
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,800
My face isn't that big.

1875
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,720
Whoever is the Ham Phantom

1876
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,120
always sticks their butt out like this.

1877
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,040
Just like the first one you saw.

1878
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,720
Yeah, they're all like that.

1879
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,880
Ham Phantom always does this.

1880
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,560
It feels kind of the same.

1881
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,680
No, listen to me.

1882
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,760
Bro, I couldn't walk like that.

1883
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,400
I couldn't walk like that, right?

1884
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,640
Then why did it break?

1885
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,240
It wasn't me.

1886
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,360
The front pulled it.

1887
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,440
I think that

1888
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,880
Brother Ning can stay for another round.

1889
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,080
But Sister Jin is suspicious.

1890
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,160
It didn't break at my spot.

1891
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,920
It broke at his spot.

1892
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,080
Why is the vote coming to me?

1893
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,080
Why vote for her? I don't know.

1894
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,040
How could it be me?

1895
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,000
How about this:

1896
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,120
Let's all vote for Chen Xingxu.

1897
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,600
Why?

1898
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,840
I didn't say anything.

1899
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,040
I also think it's Chen Xingxu.

1900
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,200
If it's a timid Ham Phantom playing it safe,

1901
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,040
then it's definitely Xingxu.

1902
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,720
I don't even feel involved.

1903
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,720
I'm going out to join now.

1904
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,760
I think it's Xuxu.

1905
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,440
But Lin Yi isn't.

1906
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,560
Because this round he was

1907
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,280
pretty positive.

1908
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,600
Pretty positive.

1909
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,760
Who's not positive?

1910
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,000
Pretty positive.

1911
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,600
Just say who's not positive.

1912
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,560
Maybe because your beard is growing.

1913
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:12,760
You care.

1914
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,040
Three, two, one, please vote.

1915
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,360
How did the vote end up on me?

1916
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,680
What did I even do?

1917
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
A soul-searching question.

1918
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,120
Jin Jing’s role is

1919
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:34,880
Ham Phantom.

1920
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,560
My intuition was right.

1921
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,440
Brother Ning.

1922
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,520
My intuition was right.

1923
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,360
No, I want to ask what you did.

1924
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,920
I didn’t do anything this round.

1925
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,000
Seriously, I did nothing.

1926
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,800
How did you guess that?

1927
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,320
You even got it right by luck.

1928
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,400
How did you guess that?

1929
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,840
And it’s so random.

1930
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,640
It’s all me in this row.

1931
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,320
It’s fate.

1932
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,920
You’re the reason I got picked.

1933
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,160
Because it broke between you two.

1934
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,360
That’s the most obvious reason.

1935
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,280
We...

1936
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,000
Just now...

1937
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,360
Yuning almost slipped up earlier.

1938
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,080
We...

1939
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,280
He wanted to say we don’t know each other’s roles.

1940
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,360
Right.

1941
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,520
Should we play right now?

1942
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,560
Bro, you go first.

1943
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,560
Don’t lead the rhythm.

1944
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,080
Your rhythm is really off, bro.

1945
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,680
Let’s go.

1946
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,080
Lin Yi, who do you think it is?

1947
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,720
I don’t think it’s me.

1948
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,000
It’s not me either.

1949
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,040
We played our roles well.

1950
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,200
Then it must be Chen Xingxu.

1951
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,240
SpongeBob.

1952
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,440
Come on.

1953
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,520
Is it okay if I walk like this?

1954
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,200
Sure.

1955
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,080
You watch him, I’ll watch this side.

1956
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:43,920
Naiwen.

1957
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,600
Okay.

1958
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,840
Three, two, one, go.

1959
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,120
One, two.

1960
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:50,800
Take bigger steps.

1961
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,040
One, two.

1962
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,000
Hands.

1963
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,080
One, two.

1964
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,320
Wait a second.

1965
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,800
Where did it break?

1966
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,120
Here.

1967
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:06,960
It broke on my side.

1968
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,320
Here.

1969
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,160
Lin Yi, you...

1970
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:12,840
No.

1971
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,920
Bro, this round...

1972
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,720
You can vouch for my honesty now, right?

1973
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,120
Did anyone bump into your butt?

1974
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,600
No.

1975
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,080
No.

1976
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:19,880
No.

1977
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,439
I was next to Lin Yi.

1978
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:22,600
He didn’t do anything.

1979
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,880
He didn’t.

1980
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,560
It broke on me.

1981
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,359
I didn’t.

1982
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,399
I was in the middle, I didn’t move.

1983
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:29,359
He was holding onto me.

1984
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,960
I think it’s Yuning.

1985
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,120
Yeah, one hundred percent.

1986
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,640
If you kept your arm up earlier,

1987
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,319
I kept mine down, resting on my right hand.

1988
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,479
When I put it down,

1989
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:41,560
The rhythm was already messed up then.

1990
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,319
Everyone’s rhythm was off.

1991
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,000
My arm.

1992
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,840
My arm could mess up your footwork.

1993
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,000
The rhythm starts with you.

1994
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,279
My inner rhythm got messed up.

1995
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,439
I raised both hands, then one hand.

1996
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:58,760
Your inner rhythm can get thrown off, Brother Naiwen.

1997
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,840
No, look.

1998
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,640
When I call out "one two, one two,"

1999
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,120
the rhythm is steady.

2000
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,600
But if I suddenly say,

2001
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:06,439
"one two, one two,"

2002
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:07,319
and tell you to raise your arms,

2003
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:09,240
it gets messed up, you know?

2004
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,120
Seriously.

2005
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,800
That's you getting confused, bro.

2006
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,080
If you didn't raise your arms, I wouldn't get confused.

2007
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,600
Bro, it's really not me.

2008
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,760
No, think about this carefully.

2009
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,319
It's kind of scary.

2010
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:20,960
Just think about it.

2011
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,520
The part that breaks at Lin Yi's hip,

2012
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,560
is it always the same hip?

2013
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,680
If you follow the result,

2014
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,120
and trace it back,

2015
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,720
why does his hip have tension?

2016
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,160
There's only one spot that could have tension.

2017
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,479
The same hip as his.

2018
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:33,960
That's right.

2019
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,920
It breaks at the same spot.

2020
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,479
I've figured it out.

2021
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,680
That last round was purely

2022
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:40,880
an accident.

2023
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,680
Just an accident.

2024
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,160
A sudden force.

2025
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:43,560
Yeah.

2026
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,359
But I think

2027
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,040
Brother Ning.

2028
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,120
Even if it broke by accident, I get blamed.

2029
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:47,399
Right.

2030
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,560
Okay, so

2031
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,080
let's all vote for Xingxu.

2032
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,960
He's still not saying anything.

2033
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

2034
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,800
I don't know who it is.

2035
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,640
The whole time,

2036
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,320
I honestly didn't feel anything.

2037
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,520
I really don't know.

2038
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,000
Alright then,

2039
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,320
vote for Yuning.

2040
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,120
Let's vote out the most suspicious person first.

2041
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,400
Why me?

2042
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,040
Why am I the most suspicious?

2043
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,120
Just give me one reason.

2044
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,560
You can vote for me today.

2045
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,120
But I want to say,

2046
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,800
it's because you're too handsome, okay?

2047
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,240
Just accept it.

2048
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,760
I accept it.

2049
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,600
This one I can accept, bro.

2050
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:28,320
Darn it.

2051
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,360
Just admit it, okay?

2052
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,000
You almost want to vote for yourself, right?

2053
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,280
Sincerity is the most touching.

2054
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,400
Three, two, one, please vote.

2055
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,800
Why are you pointing at me?

2056
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,480
Am I more handsome than you?

2057
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,960
We're evenly matched.

2058
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,080
So Yuning's role is

2059
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,680
Ham Phantom No. 2.

2060
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,360
I want to say something, guys.

2061
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,040
I didn't do anything.

2062
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,440
I did nothing.

2063
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,040
Bro, same here.

2064
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,680
So sneaky.

2065
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,640
Mainly because it stopped at you.

2066
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,760
I just wanted it to succeed.

2067
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,560
Anyway, I have a card.

2068
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,840
I just hope everyone succeeds.

2069
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,760
Because both were voted out.

2070
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,800
So all civilians just got one point.

2071
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,280
Let me say something first, everyone.

2072
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,000
I'm definitely staying in Room 7.

2073
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,800
Okay, sure.

2074
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,600
Don't think I'm offending you later.

2075
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,880
You can pick any room except 7.

2076
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,680
Brothers, sisters, everyone,

2077
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,120
Just don't consider Room 7.

2078
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,320
Yeah, don't pick Room 7.

2079
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,920
If you think too much, you might end up in Room 8.

2080
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,560
I'm fine with anything.

2081
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,000
So, do you want Room 8?

2082
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,760
I'm not taking Room 8.

2083
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,720
Then what do you mean by "anything's fine"?

2084
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,240
What do you mean?

2085
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,000
Five.

2086
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,560
What was Room 1 again?

2087
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,200
They're all about the same, actually all pretty good.

2088
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,080
Then I'll take Room 1.

2089
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,480
Two.

2090
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,240
I'll take Room 4.

2091
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,280
I'm Room 3.

2092
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,680
Seven can't be picked.

2093
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:01,960
It's fine.

2094
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,200
Bro, let me tell you.

2095
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,480
You pick Room 7.

2096
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,360
You can pick 7, he didn't pick 7.

2097
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,000
He didn't pick 7.

2098
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:07,520
After you pick,

2099
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,280
If he uses that card again, we'll talk.

2100
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:10,960
Then you pick again.

2101
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,240
That's a loud whisper.

2102
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,720
Actually, I like Room 8.

2103
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,080
You pick 8.

2104
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,080
I like 8.

2105
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,200
He likes 8.

2106
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,040
You pick 8, I'll stay in Room 6 with Xingxu.

2107
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,280
Does that make sense?

2108
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,200
Wen.

2109
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,280
How about we both take Room 6?

2110
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,200
Sure.

2111
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,160
Then I'll take 4.

2112
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,200
I want 3.

2113
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,000
Then I'll take 7.

2114
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,280
I'll take 7.

2115
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,000
Then no card used.

2116
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,040
I still have a card, guys.

2117
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,120
Sorry, everyone.

2118
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,800
I used it in Xi'an, guys.

2119
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,360
I'll treat everyone to spicy soup.

2120
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,560
So satisfying.

2121
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,280
Who's in Room 8?

2122
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,080
Come on, Lin Yi.

2123
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,120
Take the toilet paper from your room.

2124
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:48,600
Got it.

2125
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,800
We'll use this for the next few days.

2126
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,200
Nice.

2127
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:50,480
Alright.

2128
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,440
No wasting.

2129
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,320
Of course.

2130
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,680
Yuwen, you have work tomorrow.

2131
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,760
Yeah, I'll be back in a couple of days.

2132
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,320
Duke, why aren't you sleeping yet?

2133
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,680
I never sleep early anyway.

2134
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,600
Plus, today was exhausting.

2135
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,000
We played so many games just now.

2136
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,600
It was draining.

2137
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,080
I'm really hungry.

2138
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,200
Let me see what I have here.

2139
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,600
Master Kong's Chicken Soup Noodles.

2140
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,400
It smells amazing.

2141
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,400
Let me make another one for myself.

2142
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,080
Its soup packet uses patented freshness-lock technology.

2143
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,280
It keeps the chicken noodle soup's natural, fresh taste.

2144
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:27,800
This feels amazing.

2145
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,400
You know what?

2146
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,480
You can buy the same one at the Tmall flagship store.

2147
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,400
That's great.

2148
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:31,800
Come on.

2149
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,360
Cheers.

2150
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,000
Cheers.

2151
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,240
Dialogue tapas.

2152
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,360
This is a bit too easy.

2153
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,640
I killed your son.

2154
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,480
Son, right?

2155
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,800
Killed your headphones.

2156
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,480
One more pair of shoes.

2157
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,040
You just asked me.

2158
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,400
If I speak Cantonese.

2159
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,200
Now let me ask you.

2160
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,280
Do you speak Cantonese?

2161
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,240
The whole world.

2162
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,400
The whole world.

2163
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,040
Of the whole world.

2164
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,360
What language is it?

2165
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,160
All the burgers in the world.

2166
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,600
Beat them all.

2167
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,680
Is this a cartoon?

2168
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,040
Two-person initial performance.

2169
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,560
Hug you.

2170
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,320
Sis.

2171
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,400
Sis.

2172
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,440
Are you sure?

2173
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,960
Xingxu.

2174
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,040
So heavy.

2175
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,040
This area is huge.

2176
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,480
Swamp.

2177
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:30,960
Are you sure?

2178
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,760
Sure, let's go.

2179
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,040
The brave enjoy the world first.

2180
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:35,840
How is it?

2181
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,760
Let us out.

2182
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,520
Help!

2183
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,200
Brother Ning, why aren't you talking?

2184
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,840
Is Brother Ning okay?

2185
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,600
Let us down, help!

2186
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,520
Don't move.

2187
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,800
Move however you want, it's fine.

2188
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,440
Li Naiwen, when I get down, I'm "gonna get you."

2189
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,520
The bottom three members.

2190
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,880
Will be chosen by spinning the wheel.

2191
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,680
To pick a breakfast chef.

2192
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,240
Let's go.

2193
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:54,880
High.

2194
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,320
High, really high.

2195
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,080
Couldn't even guess the Chinese.

2196
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,440
Now let others guess English.

2197
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,680
Money.

2198
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:10,600
Butt.

2199
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,200
Stick out.

2200
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,000
Right.

2201
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,960
What the heck?

2202
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,440
Don't move, keep it up.

2203
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,040
Are you messing with me?

2204
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,720
Is it a person's name?

2205
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,480
This game is called "Guess the Name."

2206
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,200
I don't want to compete with players like this.

2207
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:23,840
Okay?

2208
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,920
Winning isn't even fun.

2209
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,040
It's definitely Brother Honglei.

2210
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,920
We're going head-to-head with them.

2211
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:35,840
Awesome.
