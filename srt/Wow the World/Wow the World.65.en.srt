1
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,640
Today

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,800
is the last day of the Super Fresh Earth journey.

3
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,760
We've arrived at the foot of the Qinling Mountains,

4
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,880
in Chang'an Tang Village.

5
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
formerly known as Nanbao Zhai Village.

6
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,120
This place was founded in the Jiaqing era of the Qing dynasty.

7
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
Led by the government's rural revitalization project,

8
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,240
it has become a cultural brand.

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,480
Next, the Earth Team will begin

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,320
their fresh exploration here.

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,960
Morning.

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,080
Go bite him!

13
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,720
Go bite him!

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,560
I feel like I've gotten tanned.

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,640
Compared to you, I look paler.

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Did you get tanned?

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm totally dark.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not just tanned.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
Do you know there's a menthol candy?

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,720
No idea.

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
I tried it. It's okay.

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Have you had that one?

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
Is it like those weird-flavored beans?

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,880
Yeah, that really...

25
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,160
I've tried it.

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
The one with all sorts of "booger" flavors.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,880
I've had it.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,360
Those beans.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,320
You've eaten boogers?

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
They mean beans that taste like boogers.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,880
The people who make those things

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
must've tasted them, right?

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,080
Everyone,

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,280
we are now in Chang'an Tang Village.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,240
I hope you all, during the tasks,

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,360
can deeply explore

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
this unique ancient village.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,560
This game is called "Who is the Impostor?"

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,880
Among the nine of you,

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
two will be randomly chosen as impostors.

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
If the good guys complete each round's task,

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,800
they win.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560
The impostors' job

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
is to stop the good guys from finishing.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
Impostors attack using a specific action.

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,320
After each successful attack,

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
they must wait three minutes

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,800
before attacking again.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
That's the cooldown period.

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,680
The attacked player is eliminated immediately.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,280
Mute your mic.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,960
No more hints to others.

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
No hints at all.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,040
Right, you can call it a day.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
When the number of good guys

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,840
equals the number of impostors left,

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
the impostors win.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,320
You can call a meeting anytime each round.

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,440
After a meeting is called,

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
you may vote to eliminate someone.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
For example,

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
I "eliminate" Junshao,

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
and you see it happen.

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
You shout, "Come here!"

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,120
"Ning just 'killed' someone!"

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,240
I say, "You did it, not me!"

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
I can't defend myself at all.

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
I saw you do it.

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,600
That's how it goes.

70
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
We face off.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Got it.

72
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,800
We're doomed.

73
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,360
So hard.

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,440
Can you lie?

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
You even got "face tagged."

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,200
Face tagged.

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Darn it.

78
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Losers can't join next season.

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
That's a bit too intense.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
I suspect Naiwen.

81
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,320
I think it's Naiwen.

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
We haven't drawn yet.

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,720
Just vote him out.

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,840
He won't be in next season.

85
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,480
Goodbye.

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,080
Xingxu is out.

87
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
Don't drag me in.

88
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,480
What if I win?

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
What if we both win?

90
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Getting cocky.

91
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,200
It's fine, Lin Yi's still here. There's suspense.

92
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,440
I've already proved myself.

93
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
Come on.

94
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,320
Come on.

95
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,280
Seriously.

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,080
"Impostor"

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,720
I saw the word.

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,360
I can still see it now.

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,120
No way, I can still see it.

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,560
I can still see it.

101
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,120
Still visible.

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
No.

103
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
You don't want to see it.

104
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
He definitely can't see it.

105
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,640
There are many ways to see it if you want.

106
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,400
You can always see it.

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,720
Don't look at me.

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,040
Everyone has drawn their roles.

109
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,840
This round, the good guys' task

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
is to eat lychees.

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
There are ten task spots with lychees.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
Each good guy must eat at least one lychee.

113
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,160
And put the leftover lychee pit

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
in the empty plate nearby.

115
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,640
When eight plates on the field

116
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,720
all have lychee pits at once,

117
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,080
the good guys complete their task.

118
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,000
But during the process,

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
the impostors may

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,600
remove lychee pits from plates

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,720
to sabotage the good guys' mission.

122
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Okay.

123
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,600
Next,

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,400
everyone will go to their starting points.

125
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,080
Can I return to my starting point?

126
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,960
Does that count as a respawn?

127
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,960
Back to the crystal, right?

128
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Can I buy a revive shield?

129
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
What is that?

130
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,200
Nothing.

131
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,440
Check the comments.

132
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's go.

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Honestly, I kind of hope to draw the "bad guy" role.

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,800
Everywhere.

135
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,480
You are the impostor this round.

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,800
Your attack method is

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,760
cover their mouth and say "Gotcha!"

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,560
Cover their mouth and say "Gotcha!"

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,960
Lin Yi is here.

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,520
Lin Yi.

141
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,800
Hi, Lin Yi.

142
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,320
The good thing is

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
either

144
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,560
you win

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,240
and it feels great,

146
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,440
or you lose really fast.

147
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,800
I knew earlier that Naiwen was tricky.

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Luckily, I figured him out.

149
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
I've stared at those words for so long.

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,960
So I skimmed through it really fast.

151
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,760
I didn't even see what was written on it.

152
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,080
I just saw the first two words: Impostor.

153
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,040
Then I quickly put it back.

154
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,280
Luckily, no one was watching me.

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
My heart was just pounding.

156
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,160
Almost two hundred beats per minute.

157
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,720
Strategy.

158
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,520
Pretend to be a good guy.

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,520
Hold a lychee pit and act innocent.

160
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's go eat some lychees.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,760
Number seven is set.

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,240
Honglei bro.

163
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Did you find the task spot?

164
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,600
That's one.

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,360
Which one is it?

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,040
I saw it.

167
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
This is one.

168
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,920
Help!

169
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Help!

170
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,280
What was that sound?

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080
Help!

172
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Help!

173
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
Help!

174
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,280
Help!

175
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm ignoring the cries for help.

176
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,640
I'll finish this task first.

177
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,160
What's going on?

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Help!

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
Who yelled for help?

180
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,440
Who shouted "help"?

181
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Was it you?

182
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,320
I didn't shout.

183
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
You already made a move? So fast.

184
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't play tricks with me.

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,760
Was it you?

186
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,560
Linyi, what are you doing?

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,120
What's happening?

188
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,200
Help!

189
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Help!

190
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,480
No.

191
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
It's fine.

192
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,240
Crying wolf, huh?

193
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,840
I've already finished one task.

194
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,320
Really?

195
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
Task completed.

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
I sabotaged his task.

197
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,880
Bro, who do you think it is?

198
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
There are still several people missing.

199
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Linyi seems pretty suspicious to me.

200
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
He's been jumping around like a flea.

201
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,600
He startled me.

202
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,200
Is this it?

203
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,360
No.

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,280
Just now Xingxu said—

205
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,880
Xingxu said he finished his task.

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,480
Let's go this way.

207
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,159
Come with me.

208
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,120
Why should I go with you?

209
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,880
You're going to "kill" me.

210
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,480
Yeah, let's go.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,280
No, let's just walk together.

212
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,520
If you "die," they'll blame me.

213
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,280
Everyone saw it.

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,560
Don't pull me.

215
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
Don't "kill" me right now.

216
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,080
There's nothing here.

217
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,360
Nothing here, it's the restaurant's.

218
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,960
He "killed" me.

219
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,840
Help!

220
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,960
Help!

221
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,880
I didn't "kill" you.

222
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,120
I was tricking you.

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,880
Help!

224
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,760
But your reaction felt so real.

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
Feels like you're not the Impostor.

226
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
Of course I'm not.

227
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
No, he wouldn't shout for help.

228
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,120
If he's "dead," he can't talk.

229
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,960
He can speak before "dying."

230
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Yuwen, you're really suspicious.

231
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,040
Stay away.

232
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,560
I think Linyi is suspicious.

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
Didi, task complete—look.

234
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,240
So many people.

235
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,520
What are you trying to do?

236
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
Keep your distance.

237
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,880
It's fine, there are lots of people.

238
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,520
This isn't it.

239
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,480
This isn't it.

240
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,280
I think that one is too.

241
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,920
There's one there too.

242
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,880
Did you find it?

243
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I didn't find any.

244
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,880
The attack method is—

245
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,000
Cover their mouth and say "Gotcha!"

246
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,080
Gotcha!

247
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,760
What?

248
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,360
It's done.

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm an Impostor, you know.

250
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
Gotcha!

251
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm out.

252
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,680
That was fast.

253
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Hide.

254
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
Why bother hiding?

255
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,800
Where to hide?

256
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,280
Let's hide here.

257
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,800
I "died" as soon as I got here.

258
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,680
Good night.

259
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,560
Ugh, I "died" right away.

260
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm speechless.

261
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
It's called—

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Life on Earth.

263
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,000
Stay calm.

264
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
Everyone must be anxious now.

265
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,880
Stay calm.

266
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,640
Think carefully.

267
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,880
That's how you'll find the secret.

268
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,000
Yuwen.

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,880
We need to check the pits we just ate.

270
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,160
I checked.

271
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,640
Those two spots over there—

272
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,280
They're still there, right?

273
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,880
They're still there.

274
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,120
So the Impostor hasn't done much.

275
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,120
Gotcha!

276
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Hurry, let's go.

277
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,280
Just hide here.

278
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,000
Quick!

279
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,240
Quick!

280
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,280
Here's a stool for you.

281
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,000
Just now.

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Because of that...

283
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,920
Yi Ge suddenly tapped me from behind.

284
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,800
It startled me.

285
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,640
I even yelped.

286
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,720
Luckily, no one noticed.

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,640
Why is there no tray here?

288
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Where's the tray?

289
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Why can't I find the lychee?

290
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,680
Where are lychees usually hidden?

291
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,640
Lin Yi.

292
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,440
Lin Yi.

293
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,640
How are you doing?

294
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,320
When you eat a lychee, you need to...

295
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,360
Put it in that container.

296
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,240
I put it in.

297
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,160
Then why are you holding one?

298
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,040
So many lychees.

299
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Just eat one.

300
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Of course, just one.

301
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Once you find one, put it in right away.

302
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
Just put one inside.

303
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,600
When you find it, put it in immediately.

304
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,520
You still need to bite it later.

305
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
What's going on?

306
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll go back and check mine now.

307
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,960
See if it's still there.

308
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,840
Hello.

309
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Is mine still here?

310
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,280
Is this yours?

311
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,080
Mine's gone.

312
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,720
Mine's gone.

313
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,840
Gotcha!

314
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,440
You hid it there.

315
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,840
Bad move.

316
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
That's what happens when you go solo.

317
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,240
So Uncle Nai and Lin Yi

318
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,720
are the Impostors this round.

319
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,640
This...

320
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,280
I found one.

321
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,080
Eat one.

322
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:57,920
Number four.

323
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,080
Done.

324
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,040
Let's go.

325
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Let me see who...

326
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,320
Who is it?

327
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,320
Are you here to take me out?

328
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,080
I'm not.

329
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,640
I just finished my task.

330
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,840
Why are you alone?

331
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,360
Because I wanted to

332
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,920
sort out my feelings here.

333
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,560
Where are you from, friend?

334
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm from Wuhan, Hubei.

335
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,320
Have a seat.

336
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,640
Hello.

337
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,160
These two.

338
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,080
Any other guests?

339
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,600
This is my cameraman and my...

340
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:31,960
director.

341
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,160
No one touched the cups.

342
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,320
The tea was just poured.

343
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
You're not going to "eliminate" me, are you?

344
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:36,880
Of course not.

345
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,640
Of course not.

346
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,200
I won't eliminate you.

347
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,040
Why is there no tray here?

348
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,800
Was it discovered?

349
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,600
Where did number five see it?

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,360
Is there?

351
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,800
What are you doing?

352
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,760
What are you doing?

353
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,680
He's done, can't talk anymore.

354
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,440
Okay.

355
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,240
So Lin Yi is...

356
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,360
Meeting.

357
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,440
Hurry, I'll knock.

358
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Then Lin Yi must be the one.

359
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,200
Meeting time.

360
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,760
Meeting time.

361
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,120
Come on, Lin Yi, it's meeting time.

362
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,400
Meeting time.

363
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,320
Meeting time.

364
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,840
Meeting time.

365
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,400
Meeting time.

366
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,920
So fast.

367
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
Where did you do your task?

368
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,440
There's a task spot here.

369
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
There's actually a task spot here.

370
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm going to eat one later.

371
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,520
What's wrong?

372
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,880
What happened?

373
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,280
That...

374
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,960
Xingxu is "out."

375
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,120
Lin Yi "eliminated" him.

376
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
Do you have proof, Honglei?

377
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,760
All three of us saw you in the room.

378
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,040
I went in and bumped into Chen Xingxu.

379
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,760
Then I came out.

380
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,680
I don't think so.

381
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,280
Three have been eliminated.

382
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,200
Did Didi get eliminated too?

383
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,520
I'm speechless.

384
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,360
Was Didi eliminated too?

385
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,480
Everyone I suspected got eliminated.

386
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Who else do you suspect?

387
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,640
What were you doing just now?

388
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,520
I want to ask.

389
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,880
I was looking for a task spot.

390
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,840
And then?

391
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,280
That's it.

392
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Can you retrace your whole route?

393
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,160
Okay.

394
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,080
I started from this...

395
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
task spot over there.

396
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,240
Revived.

397
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
There was a task spot where I revived.

398
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
Then I ate a lychee.

399
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay, which task spot number was yours?

400
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,400
Number one.

401
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,200
Who did you see on the way?

402
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
First, I saw Honglei.

403
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
Then who did you run into?

404
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,720
Yuning.

405
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,360
Then I ran into Xingxu.

406
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,120
Xingxu was already standing in the corner.

407
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,400
Like this.

408
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,000
Look.

409
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,080
Before he met Xingxu,

410
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,480
he was with Didi.

411
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,040
He didn't say.

412
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,640
Didi is "out."

413
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,720
Xingxu is "out."

414
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,960
That's two.

415
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,600
The person who interacted with him most is

416
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Lin Yi.

417
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,520
The one with the most overlap.

418
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,880
I saw Xingxu's expression.

419
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,800
He looked really upset.

420
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,359
You know?

421
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,000
Standing next to an empty lychee tray.

422
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,640
And then Honglei...

423
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,359
What's wrong with you?

424
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Let me ask something.

425
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,880
Let me say something.

426
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,359
In this plate,

427
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,600
we're supposed to put the lychee pit

428
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
in the plate after eating, right?

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,360
Right.

430
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,080
Let me describe what happened.

431
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,080
I was chilling in a tea room the whole time.

432
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
And I chatted with this friend

433
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,240
Ms. Wang

434
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
about where she's from.

435
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,160
We had a cup of tea.

436
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,840
But

437
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
when everyone banged the gong, I asked,

438
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
"What were you doing just now?"

439
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,720
She said she was doing her task.

440
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,520
But when I walked out,

441
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,360
I glanced out of the corner of my eye,

442
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,160
and in that plate,

443
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,400
there was no pit.

444
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
But in that little courtyard,

445
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,840
there were only the two of us.

446
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,960
Bro, then it must be you.

447
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,720
Bro, why didn't you eat the pit?

448
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,000
Why didn't you eat the pit? Why not?

449
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,720
I never saw He just now.

450
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
I never saw you at all.

451
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,880
If you want to vote for me,

452
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,800
I don't mind.

453
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,520
Because I don't care about winning.

454
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,160
No.

455
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,520
First, my spot was number four.

456
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,600
I didn't know He was inside.

457
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,360
After I went in,

458
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,920
I obediently took a lychee.

459
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,120
I peeled it, ate it, and put it there.

460
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,840
So where's the pit?

461
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,960
You're making things up.

462
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,120
If I were the Impostor,

463
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,400
I wouldn't tell you

464
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,120
I was doing my task there.

465
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,760
That's all I'll say.

466
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
I'll quickly run five meters over there.

467
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,640
Everyone stay here, okay?

468
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,000
Alright?

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,520
Don't move.

470
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,960
What does that mean?

471
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,400
He's going to check if the pit is still there.

472
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,800
Get a close-up shot.

473
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,520
No pit.

474
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
No pit.

475
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,840
Vote for her.

476
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,800
It's not there, right?

477
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
No pit?

478
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,800
How could there be no pit?

479
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,320
Even waiting by the tree can catch someone.

480
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,760
I just want to play one round.

481
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,800
Didn't expect that.

482
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,480
The Impostor walked right into our trap.

483
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,320
He, let me tell you—

484
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
Watch the main episode.

485
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,520
Watch the main episode.

486
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,480
You'll know if you watch the main episode.

487
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,360
I like this part.

488
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,200
Is it possible while we were talking,

489
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,720
someone went and threw away the pit?

490
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Then we'd look so clueless.

491
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,840
It's only two meters away.

492
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,880
And we couldn't see anyone.

493
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
Makes sense.

494
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,760
Watch the main episode.

495
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,440
If it wasn't her,

496
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
I'll eat this.

497
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,600
Learned this from Yuning.

498
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,760
Whatever there is, I'll eat it.

499
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,160
Go to Room Six.

500
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm just here to see He eat this.

501
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,640
I think you can vote for me too.

502
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,240
Okay.

503
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,240
Sure.

504
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,560
Sure.

505
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:51,800
Sure.

506
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,600
Just vote for me.

507
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,160
This way,

508
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,040
if I get voted out this round,

509
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,240
and I'm a good guy,

510
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
then next round, you must stick with He.

511
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,520
Alright?

512
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,040
Definitely.

513
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,280
Of course.

514
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,800
Definitely.

515
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,240
Alright.

516
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,280
If I eat this, I won't last long either.

517
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,040
Naiwen, who do you think it is?

518
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,960
No, right now I'm thinking Lin Yi.

519
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm basically locking in my choice.

520
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm a bit...

521
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
These two.

522
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,160
Trust me.

523
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,640
Alright, I trust you.

524
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,840
I trust Chen He.

525
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,240
Let's raise hands for who we vote for.

526
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,320
One, two, three.

527
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,720
Yuwen is eliminated.

528
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,880
Reveal the identity.

529
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,320
Good guy.

530
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,800
Watch the main episode.

531
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,760
If it wasn't her,

532
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I'll eat this.

533
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,360
How do I eat it?

534
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
Bro.

535
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,040
I've given you so many hints.

536
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,360
Why won't you let it go?

537
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
Where's the pit?

538
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
Maybe someone went and took it away.

539
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
Come, I'll roast it for you.

540
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Got a fire?

541
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,720
I'll roast it so you can eat it.

542
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,640
Trust me.

543
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,800
The pit is gone.

544
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,680
No pit.

545
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,720
She ate it.

546
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,360
Where's the pit?

547
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,720
No one went into the yard.

548
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Where's her pit?

549
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,480
What about this one?

550
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This one's still unknown.

551
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,840
Me.

552
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,680
Super good guy.

553
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
I made a mistake.

554
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm leaving.

555
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Go ahead.

556
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,880
I need to calm myself down.

557
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,760
Who got voted out?

558
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,520
Wang Yuwen got voted out.

559
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,280
She'll come find you soon.

560
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,960
Awesome.

561
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,720
Why?

562
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,440
She's the only one voted out.

563
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,080
Why?

564
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Compared to us,

565
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,240
I feel she has even less dignity.

566
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah, I think we're okay.

567
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,520
Because we were just "killed."

568
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
She was voted out directly.

569
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,960
So pitiful.

570
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,160
She never even tried to argue.

571
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,880
Yeah.

572
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,320
One more "kill" and we win.

573
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,080
He, Liu Yuning,

574
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
and add Honglei.

575
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,800
That's odd.

576
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
There was clearly no pit.

577
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,240
Look, where's the pit?

578
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,720
Let's be honest.

579
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
Where's the pit?

580
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,440
Where is it?

581
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640
How could there be a pit?

582
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,600
Wasn't it put on the plate?

583
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,840
She threw it in the bucket.

584
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,600
Does that make sense?

585
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,400
I want to go home.

586
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,560
See that?

587
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
Keeps running.

588
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,840
He runs like that—

589
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,160
Gave me a fright.

590
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,120
Didn't you say you were in the yard?

591
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,880
I had to come out and check.

592
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
Gave me a fright.

593
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,080
He'er.

594
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,560
Can you not be alone?

595
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,680
You're way too suspicious when alone.

596
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,080
Look at that one.

597
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,440
Alone from start to finish.

598
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,440
Really?

599
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,320
Why did you come back just now?

600
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,800
Sun Honglei.

601
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,160
What are you up to?

602
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Sun Honglei.

603
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,320
Gotcha!

604
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,560
Gotcha!

605
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,160
I'm just guarding this bell spot.

606
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
As long as he doesn't ring the bell,

607
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
he can't stop me from "killing."

608
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
I'll use He's technique.

609
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Wait for the prey to come to me.

610
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,840
Anyone going to report to the authorities?

611
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,560
Gotcha!

612
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,480
We won.

613
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,280
We won.

614
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,120
No.

615
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
That was way too easy to win.

616
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,800
You played really well.

617
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,600
Is it over?

618
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,680
It's over.

619
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,560
You got "eliminated" worse than us.

620
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,400
With even less dignity.

621
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,920
Is it two to two now?

622
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,480
I got myself "out" for being dumb.

623
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,800
Congrats to the Impostor and Mini Impostor.

624
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,600
Big thanks to my two awesome teammates.

625
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,160
Yeah.

626
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,600
Thanks.

627
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,920
Divine assist.

628
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Honglei just accused me.

629
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,360
I had no idea how to defend myself.

630
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,160
Suddenly, it was like divine help.

631
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,040
Chen He’s eyes were shining.

632
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,800
He looked at me.

633
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,480
He trusted me.

634
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,240
You trust me.

635
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,200
I was thinking,

636
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Of course I trust you.

637
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
He got a bit carried away.

638
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,120
Come on, let’s do another round.

639
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,080
Let’s go.

640
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,000
This time, let’s switch to roujiamo.

641
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,120
The good guys need to assemble
the roujiamo toy.

642
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,000
Put it together.

643
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,040
Put the meat inside the bun.

644
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,840
Stuff it into the bun.

645
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,280
Go ahead.

646
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,920
Go ahead.

647
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,200
I trust you.

648
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,800
You’re definitely not the one.

649
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,400
I’m definitely not.

650
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,440
Are you sure you’re not?

651
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,320
I really am not.

652
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Me neither.

653
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,160
Heaven and earth as my witness.

654
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
Not shaking.

655
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,400
Scared me to death.

656
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,480
Heaven and earth as my witness.

657
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,160
Heaven and earth as my witness.

658
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,120
We were both Impostor and Mini Impostor before.

659
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,880
Old teammates.

660
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
For the sake of our old partnership,

661
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,560
Definitely not.

662
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,080
Definitely not.

663
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,400
Okay.

664
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,720
Okay.

665
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,160
Okay.

666
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,480
Okay.

667
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay.

668
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,200
Let’s go.

669
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,840
Really.

670
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,280
Really.

671
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,520
Do you not trust me?

672
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Honestly, it’s hard to believe.

673
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,160
Let’s go, find someone first.

674
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,360
Pretend we’re moving as a group.

675
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,360
Here they come.

676
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,920
Number ten.

677
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Found a roujiamo.

678
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,760
Stuffed inside.

679
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
That should do it, right?

680
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,440
Done.

681
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,680
Number two, done.

682
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay.

683
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,520
Put the lid back on.

684
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,280
Didn’t you already look here?

685
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,000
Who already looked?

686
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,160
I haven’t been here.

687
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,920
Ignore me.

688
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,400
What are you doing? What do you want?

689
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,320
Something happened.

690
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,080
What do you want?

691
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,320
You scared me.

692
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,720
Why are you walking alone?

693
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,760
Ning.

694
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,400
What are you doing?

695
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,440
What are you doing?

696
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,000
Just messing with you.

697
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,040
Then let’s go find roujiamo.

698
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,240
Let’s go together.

699
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,120
Let’s go together.

700
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,600
At least keep three or four people together.

701
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
Otherwise, we’ll have no clues.

702
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,840
Why is Xingxu walking alone again?

703
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,560
I see it.

704
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,440
Number three.

705
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,280
It’s inside.

706
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,600
Hide it.

707
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,840
Two.

708
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,520
Number four.

709
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,600
Why are you following me?

710
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,520
I know you’re definitely not the one.

711
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,080
Go away.

712
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,440
I finished number two’s task.

713
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,560
I know you’re definitely not the one.

714
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,920
Watch out for Lin Yi.

715
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,680
I just said I trust you.

716
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,840
And you said watch out for Lin Yi.

717
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
You don’t even vouch for anyone.

718
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,680
Number one is done.

719
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,200
Number one is done, where?

720
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,680
Wait a moment.

721
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,400
Where’s Chen Xingxu?

722
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,640
Next to you.

723
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,600
He went that way.

724
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,560
What?

725
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,080
Go that way.

726
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,520
Go that way.

727
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:46,920
What does that mean?

728
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,840
Where is it?

729
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,280
There’s a problem.

730
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,400
It’s her.

731
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,400
Where’s number one?

732
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,000
Is it inside?

733
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,280
Where is it?

734
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,120
Where did you finish it?

735
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,440
This.

736
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,720
Chen Xingxu, you’re really suspicious.

737
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
You’re acting strange, Chen Xingxu.

738
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
Wait, I need someone.

739
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,680
There’s someone.

740
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
He’s suspicious.

741
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,680
Just now, he...

742
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
He said he placed that roujiamo.

743
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,200
But I checked, and it wasn’t there.

744
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,800
When I turned around, he was waiting at the door.

745
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,440
Which number?

746
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,960
Number one.

747
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,320
No, he...

748
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,800
I saw him place number three too.

749
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,920
I said I put number one.

750
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,200
I was inside.

751
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,920
He saw me.

752
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,160
Why did you say I didn’t put it?

753
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,680
You’re just...

754
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:42,920
No.

755
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,800
You did put it just now.

756
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,720
But you went back and took it apart.

757
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,560
We’re starting the meeting without even banging the gong.

758
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,520
There’s no one here now.

759
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,280
Bang the gong.

760
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,520
Quick, bang the gong!

761
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,720
Bang the gong.

762
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,440
No, don’t bang it.

763
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Don’t bang it.

764
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,120
No one has left yet.

765
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Fine, we won’t ring the bell.

766
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,440
Let’s go look again, okay?

767
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,000
We’ll go back in a bit.

768
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,320
Then we’ll ring the bell.

769
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,240
Alright, no problem.

770
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,040
Didi.

771
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Didi went to check.

772
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Come on, sis, follow me.

773
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,000
Did you find which number roujiamo?

774
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Number ten.

775
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
Number ten was found by Honglei.

776
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,480
Really?

777
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,640
Gotcha!

778
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,720
We already searched here once, nothing.

779
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,160
I checked outside.

780
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,040
I’ll go find Didi.

781
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,400
She said she just came and didn’t see it.

782
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
How could she not see it?

783
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,040
Yeah, anyway...

784
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,880
It’s so obvious.

785
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
She left calmly anyway.

786
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,440
She said she was here earlier.

787
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,920
Didn’t see it.

788
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Right, then she said...

789
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,760
It’s inside here.

790
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
How could she miss it?

791
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,040
It’s Wang Yuwen.

792
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,120
Hold on.

793
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,760
Me and Didi.

794
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,160
Didi.

795
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,920
Didi got “eliminated.”

796
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,360
Didi.

797
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,320
What?

798
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,240
Bang the gong.

799
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,440
Bang the gong.

800
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,400
Here we go!

801
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,840
Court in session.

802
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,920
I have a question.

803
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,160
Who was “born” at number five roujiamo?

804
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
What are you doing? What’s up?

805
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,800
Because I just went to number five.

806
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,240
I was with Naiwen and Wen.

807
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,040
But that roujiamo...

808
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,960
It was right on the table.

809
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,840
Then Wen came in and said...

810
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,040
I was here just now.

811
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,680
She didn’t see it.

812
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,720
But that spot is super obvious.

813
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,160
No.

814
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,920
That spot is definitely not obvious.

815
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,520
It’s way inside, in the innermost part.

816
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,400
I checked around the outer hall.

817
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Then I left.

818
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,200
Anyway, I think it’s super obvious.

819
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
I got to that side first.

820
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,000
I went to search.

821
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
Then I found number one.

822
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,440
Wen.

823
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,320
She said I didn’t put it on.

824
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,640
Then she put it on.

825
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,720
Because Xingxu told me he put it on.

826
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,960
Then he ran over there.

827
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,440
Then I asked, did Lin Yi put it on?

828
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,040
Lin Yi said...

829
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,080
It’s on.

830
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,560
Then I said okay.

831
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,600
I’ll go check again.

832
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,840
Then I went back to check.

833
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Right after I checked...

834
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,960
Xingxu followed me back.

835
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
So why did you say I didn’t put it on?

836
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,760
Right?

837
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,720
Me...

838
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
Why did you say I didn’t put it on?

839
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,840
Then you put it on.

840
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,840
Yuwen.

841
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,320
Yuwen.

842
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,080
Alright.

843
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,720
It could be me.

844
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
But now what I have to do is...

845
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Protect my teammate.

846
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,880
Who’s the other Impostor?

847
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,320
Wang Yuwen.

848
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,040
That’s great.

849
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Yes, I’m revealed now.

850
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,200
It’s me and Naiwen.

851
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
It’s me and Naiwen.

852
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,520
You and who?

853
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,120
Me and you.

854
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
Can’t get past this, right?

855
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,600
Today, I...

856
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I revealed myself.

857
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,000
I can reveal myself.

858
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,800
But that...

859
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,240
My teammate is Naiwen.

860
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,640
How am I supposed to play now?

861
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,480
Who do you think it is?

862
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,400
Look at the movement path.

863
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,160
Can’t rule out...

864
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,360
Uncle Nai and...

865
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,200
Lin Yi.

866
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,520
Actually, Hege can’t be ruled out either.

867
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,320
He could come through this little passage.

868
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
I can’t do anything bad now.

869
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,080
Just vote me out.

870
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,880
Alright, everyone.

871
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,480
Please vote.

872
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,120
No way I’m wrongly accused this round.

873
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,200
I revealed myself directly.

874
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,840
Yes, Yuwen is the Impostor.

875
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,120
Everyone, keep playing.

876
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,880
I played super well today.

877
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,480
I was really smart today.

878
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,520
I can’t hide it.

879
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,000
Go quickly.

880
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,080
Go for it, teammate!

881
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,560
Hurry up!

882
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,760
Come on.

883
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,320
So we have to sabotage the roujiamo.

884
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,600
Here it is.

885
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,120
The sixth one.

886
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,520
It's here.

887
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,600
Number six.

888
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,720
Did you find a new one?

889
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,040
Found number six.

890
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,680
Number six is done.

891
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,240
There are two left.

892
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:26,840
Okay.

893
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,840
Awesome.

894
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,040
Let's start, Super Mario.

895
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,040
Naiwen.

896
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Gong Jun.

897
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,520
I thought so too.

898
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,040
Gong Jun.

899
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,040
He looks a bit nervous to me.

900
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Yuning.

901
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,200
What's up? Go ahead.

902
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,680
No, the three of us—

903
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,440
Let's try a strategy, just us three.

904
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,120
Sure, go ahead.

905
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,360
I think it's Gong Jun now.

906
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,400
So who goes with him alone, right?

907
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:50,880
Yeah.

908
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,880
That's what I mean, okay?

909
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,800
Jun.

910
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Come on, let's discuss.

911
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,040
Let's pair up this time.

912
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,680
Alright, I agree.

913
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,400
Let's try it.

914
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,160
Okay.

915
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Let's listen to Honglei.

916
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,120
Alright.

917
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,520
Okay.

918
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,280
So, what now?

919
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,400
So, what now?

920
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,560
Pick one of us three.

921
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,440
He'll definitely pick me.

922
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,840
Let's go.

923
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,280
Let's go, just us two.

924
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,600
Best buddies together.

925
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Alright, I'll go with you.

926
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm going.

927
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,600
You go observe from the shadows.

928
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:15,880
Is that okay?

929
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,200
Sure.

930
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,520
Did you search here?

931
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,960
All three have been found.

932
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
All three have been found.

933
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,760
All three have been found.

934
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,720
Already found earlier.

935
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,520
We just need to walk two meters apart.

936
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Stay a bit farther from me.

937
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,320
Sorry, I made a move.

938
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,520
What?

939
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,640
No one.

940
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,120
What are you doing?

941
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
You scared me.

942
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,280
You scared me to death.

943
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,960
No one was here, I made a move and you "died."

944
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,640
Because no one was here.

945
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,120
Keep searching, bro.

946
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,280
Search.

947
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,320
Keep your distance.

948
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
I can stand behind you.

949
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,680
I can stand behind you.

950
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,240
I've had two chances to take you out.

951
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,920
But I didn't do it.

952
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,640
That means I'm a good guy.

953
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,280
I don't believe you.

954
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,920
It's fine.

955
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Isn't that Chen Xingxu?

956
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
As soon as I called you, you—

957
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,520
You did it on purpose.

958
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,040
You searched, right?

959
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,200
There's nothing on my side.

960
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,760
He searched.

961
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,159
He's been searching like Super Mario.

962
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,080
Very, very hard.

963
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,880
What are you doing?

964
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,760
You scared me to death.

965
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
You keep getting scared.

966
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,639
In this environment just now—

967
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,199
I was going to "kill" you.

968
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:24,719
No one knows, right?

969
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,040
That's true.

970
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,880
You go in first.

971
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,719
You go in first.

972
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,960
I think I'm safe now.

973
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm not sure about your role now.

974
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,040
I was just testing you.

975
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,960
There's one here now.

976
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,600
This one's already done.

977
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,679
Let's go.

978
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,639
Go ahead, you go first.

979
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
You go first.

980
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,440
Hurry.

981
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,840
I've tested you so many times.

982
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,880
You would've been out long ago.

983
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
I've already gone for the second one.

984
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,360
Gotcha!

985
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,639
Come here, hurry up.

986
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,080
Go in.

987
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,080
Go in.

988
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,720
Get in there.

989
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,480
Squat down.

990
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,640
Get in there.

991
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,320
Gotcha!

992
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,440
Gotcha!

993
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,640
Come here.

994
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,320
I actually saw it with my own eyes.

995
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,920
Mission accomplished.

996
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,680
No.

997
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,960
I saw it myself.

998
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Gong Jun took out—

999
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,680
Gong Jun took out Yuning.

1000
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,720
But he didn't see me.

1001
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,600
So it's time to hit the gong.

1002
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,600
Pretend you don't know.

1003
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,240
Act like you don't know.

1004
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,640
I saw it myself.

1005
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,400
Gong Jun took out Yuning from far away.

1006
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,320
After that, he did this—

1007
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,400
Then Gong Jun did this—

1008
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,160
Grabbed and ran off quickly.

1009
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,000
Pretend not to know.

1010
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,920
Let's just act clueless.

1011
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,680
No idea.

1012
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,720
Come on, let's split up.

1013
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,920
Split up.

1014
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
So everyone knows now.

1015
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,960
It's been figured out.

1016
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Figured out right away.

1017
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,480
Yuning was used as bait and sacrificed.

1018
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,680
That was a clever move.

1019
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,200
So clever.

1020
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,720
Saw the bait and took it.

1021
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,880
Got hooked instantly.

1022
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,400
Should be in that direction.

1023
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,960
Come over and see.

1024
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,640
I'll just pretend to go around.

1025
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,920
How is it?

1026
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,680
What's going on?

1027
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,440
Where's Yuning?

1028
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,240
He split up with me.

1029
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,360
He went over there to search.

1030
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,720
Where's Yuning?

1031
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,520
Someone "died."

1032
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,520
Who?

1033
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,240
Someone's bluffing.

1034
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,640
Yuning is out.

1035
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,440
Strike the gong.

1036
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,120
Strike the gong.

1037
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,240
Strike the gong.

1038
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,920
What's going on? So hard to guess.

1039
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,360
What's happening?

1040
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,840
Darn it, Yuning's been eliminated.

1041
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,400
Yuning is out.

1042
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,920
Strike the gong.

1043
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,240
Who?

1044
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,840
Who just walked by?

1045
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,080
No idea, a bunch of people passed by.

1046
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,200
I saw Gong Jun take out Yuning myself.

1047
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,920
I told everyone.

1048
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,160
He still doesn't know.

1049
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,360
Then just pretend not to know.

1050
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,600
Yeah.

1051
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,720
Who was closest just now?

1052
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,400
Darn it.

1053
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,440
I was over there, bro.

1054
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,400
Weren't you with Junjun just now?

1055
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
We split up.

1056
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
Split up.

1057
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,680
Didn't you two split up too?

1058
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,080
Yeah.

1059
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,840
When did you split up?

1060
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
They said only three minutes left.

1061
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,920
Just two people, can't explain.

1062
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,680
Liu Yuning.

1063
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
So who's the "big bad" here?

1064
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,680
No, it's like this.

1065
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,560
Only three minutes left.

1066
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,400
The director mentioned it earlier.

1067
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,080
Then he said we should split up to search.

1068
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,160
But that's impossible.

1069
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,560
No Impostor would be that dumb.

1070
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,840
Just "kill" when two are together?

1071
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,560
The key is, who was closest to him?

1072
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,840
This is way too hard to guess.

1073
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,160
It's really hard to guess.

1074
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,440
And there are no clues this round.

1075
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,400
Lin Yi was closest to that person just now.

1076
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,960
It could be Lin Yi.

1077
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,400
Why?

1078
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,640
It could be either of you.

1079
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,160
I've always suspected Lin Yi.

1080
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
It can't be me.

1081
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
You were really close, right?

1082
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,960
You walked by just now.

1083
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,920
Yeah, he was super close.

1084
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
I was the first to notice.

1085
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,200
How could it be me?

1086
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,680
But I've been doing tasks the whole time.

1087
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,960
Xingxu, you've been doing tasks alone.

1088
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,760
I've been doing tasks alone.

1089
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,080
Xingxu could be the one too.

1090
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,520
What you need to know now is

1091
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
the two people who were closest.

1092
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,200
Makes sense.

1093
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I want to hear what the two closest say.

1094
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,760
I'll go first.

1095
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,000
As for me,

1096
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,480
because in this round

1097
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,800
I wanted to find all eight.

1098
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,120
So I kept moving alone.

1099
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,200
When I finished at number one and came back,

1100
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,960
I saw Gong Jun there.

1101
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,800
He was hiding from me.

1102
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,960
At that time,

1103
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,240
Ning-ge was already gone.

1104
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,640
So Ning-ge wasn't there at that moment.

1105
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,240
When you two were talking, Ning-ge wasn't there.

1106
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,680
He wasn't.

1107
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,040
Then I think Junjun

1108
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,120
Then I think Junjun

1109
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,040
is cleared now.

1110
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,120
So sneaky.

1111
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,840
Why would I run toward where Ning-ge

1112
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,720
was "killed"?

1113
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,360
Then how did you know he was "killed"?

1114
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,520
Yeah.

1115
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,040
I only knew after you rang the bell.

1116
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,280
Why did you run toward where Ning-ge

1117
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
was "killed"?

1118
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,560
How did you know ahead of time

1119
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
that Ning-ge was "killed"?

1120
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,040
After listening for so long,

1121
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,520
I'm leaning more toward him.

1122
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,560
Because he explained in detail.

1123
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:45,960
Jun.

1124
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,200
Are you a good guy?

1125
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,040
I'm one hundred percent a good guy.

1126
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,520
No more talking.

1127
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,920
Since everyone's logic is a mess,

1128
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,040
let's vote blindly.

1129
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,840
Vote for whoever you feel.

1130
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,760
Okay.

1131
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,320
Let's do it.

1132
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,040
Whoever, doesn't matter.

1133
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,640
Whoever, doesn't matter.

1134
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,200
It's fate.

1135
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,840
It's fate.

1136
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,600
Variety show gods.

1137
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,520
Whoever gets picked, that's it.

1138
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,320
Let's vote then.

1139
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,040
This round, go.

1140
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,760
Three, two, one.

1141
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,800
Not only did we lose,

1142
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,520
we lost with no dignity.

1143
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,720
Why?

1144
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,120
No idea.

1145
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,120
I was wandering around.

1146
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,640
There was a tiny path.

1147
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,560
I thought, this place

1148
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,680
has a temple next door, probably can't enter.

1149
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,040
So I went this way.

1150
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,160
Someone was "attacking" in the distance.

1151
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,880
Far away.

1152
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,600
After the "attack," they dragged Liu Yuning

1153
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,720
into a room.

1154
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,320
Got spotted.

1155
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm here, and they're all acting for me.

1156
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,200
The thing is, just now

1157
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,760
I asked if you were a good guy.

1158
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,400
Are you a good guy?

1159
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Honglei-ge.

1160
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,480
I swear I am.

1161
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,320
I don't even dare

1162
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,080
to let you touch my hand like this.

1163
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,560
I only dare let you tap it.

1164
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,040
My hand's never had this kind of workout.

1165
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
It's fine.

1166
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,120
If I lose, I lose.

1167
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,080
What I enjoyed was

1168
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,320
my bro Liu

1169
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,200
kept scaring me this round.

1170
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,960
Scaring you.

1171
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,880
Just wanted to spook you.

1172
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,400
Then cover me for a bit.

1173
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Then mess with me for a bit.

1174
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
But in the end, you got

1175
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,360
taken out by me.

1176
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,560
As long as you're happy.

1177
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,840
As long as you're happy.

1178
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,840
Friends,

1179
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,760
happy times are always short.

1180
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,200
Someone

1181
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,000
can't join us for dinner tonight.

1182
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,400
Let's have Lin Yi

1183
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
go catch the flight first

1184
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,720
and scout the location for us.

1185
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,520
Okay.

1186
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,720
I'll go scout the location for everyone.

1187
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,680
Safe travels.

1188
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,640
Safe travels.

1189
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,360
Let's take one last selfie.

1190
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,720
Sure.

1191
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,200
Right.

1192
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,400
Okay.

1193
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,040
Lin Yi, come here.

1194
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,880
Lin Yi, you take the photo.

1195
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,440
Lin Yi, take it.

1196
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,720
Come on.

1197
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,280
Alright.

1198
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,040
Goodbye.

1199
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,760
Thanks for your hard work.

1200
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,320
Goodbye.

1201
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,880
See you later.

1202
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,640
Goodbye.

1203
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,080
Thanks for your effort.

1204
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,320
Thanks.

1205
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,960
Goodbye.

1206
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,480
Goodbye.

1207
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,240
I'm heading out first.

1208
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,200
Goodbye.

1209
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,920
Let's go eat.

1210
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Let's go.

1211
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,040
Time to eat.

1212
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,400
My heart aches.

1213
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,360
Mizone, save me.

1214
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,880
Xu,

1215
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,800
you're still practicing in this heat? Aren't you tired?

1216
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,320
Didn't you all give me this task?

1217
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,200
I have to do it well.

1218
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,280
Today is our final stop.

1219
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,480
How about we go big this time?

1220
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,280
Stop messing with me.

1221
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,920
Bro, give me a break.

1222
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Nope, I'm going for it.

1223
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,000
Then let me take a sip of Mizone first.

1224
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,880
Thanks.

1225
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,720
Gotta be in top form to take this on.

1226
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,280
Stay in peak condition.

1227
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,480
Let's Mizone Comeback together.

1228
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,080
Is your energy back?

1229
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,480
It's back.

1230
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,000
Really back.

1231
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,600
Really back.

1232
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,080
The hope of the whole global village is on you.

1233
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,600
Go big.

1234
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,000
Come on.

1235
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,600
Bring the plate.

1236
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,080
One, two, three, go!

1237
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,360
I bet it's definitely the biggest.

1238
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,560
Three.

1239
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,160
Mizone Comeback Challenge.

1240
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,400
Hold Mizone, stand the bottle behind your back.

1241
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,520
Toss Mizone and make it stand.

1242
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
That's how you get your energy back.

1243
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,160
Challenge complete.

1244
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,080
Naiwen already won.

1245
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,200
Then Xingxu can't lose.

1246
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,200
Two, three.

1247
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,720
Mizone's back.

1248
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,800
We did it.

1249
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,080
Congrats to Xingxu for completing the challenge.

1250
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,880
Mizone Comeback.

1251
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,960
Bro, the final task is done.

1252
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,920
No wonder Mizone has been with us all the way.

1253
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,960
With our energy savior here,

1254
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,000
we can really Mizone Comeback anytime.

1255
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,200
Today's preparations are really great.

1256
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Such a big sheep's head.

1257
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,280
So big.

1258
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,720
Can we cook it all?

1259
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,000
Two pots.

1260
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,200
That's two pots, right?

1261
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,440
This huge sheep's head.

1262
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,840
The soup needs to simmer and stew.

1263
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,760
Let me get mine ready.

1264
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,520
What are you making?

1265
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,480
This one's super fast.

1266
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,680
Just making

1267
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,560
a quick stir-fried pork.

1268
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,520
It'll be done in a few minutes.

1269
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,120
A real elephant and a fake elephant are together.

1270
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,560
And then?

1271
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,280
How can you

1272
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,600
tell which is real and which is fake?

1273
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,320
Is this an idiom?

1274
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,720
It's a cold joke, right?

1275
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,120
A brain teaser.

1276
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,840
When it comes to brain teasers,

1277
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,280
I really don't get them.

1278
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Throw it into the water.

1279
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,240
And then?

1280
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,480
Because

1281
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,120
only the "real elephant" will surface.

1282
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,480
Take Uncle Nai away.

1283
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,200
In the end, the real elephant died.

1284
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:30,720
It died.

1285
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,760
After the real elephant died,

1286
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,960
the truth died with it.

1287
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,040
The elephant went extinct. Why?

1288
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
Because the real elephant is white.

1289
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
Because there's only one "truth."

1290
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,600
Because there's only one "truth."

1291
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,800
Lame joke.

1292
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,040
So lame.

1293
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,560
But it's unexpectedly lame.

1294
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,680
That's terrifying.

1295
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,040
Let me tell you another one.

1296
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,240
There are so many more.

1297
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,440
If you run into a big tiger,

1298
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,880
and you don't want to get eaten,

1299
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,600
what should you do?

1300
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,840
Because...

1301
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,720
Quick, kneel and call it "Dad."

1302
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,840
Why?

1303
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,000
Because...

1304
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,280
Even a vicious tiger won't eat its own cubs.

1305
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,560
Even a vicious tiger won't eat its own cubs.

1306
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,120
Let me ask you.

1307
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,000
A white balloon.

1308
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,400
A confession balloon.

1309
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,960
Goodbye.

1310
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,160
What do you usually do?

1311
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,560
Done talking.

1312
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,600
No, after you finish, you say it.

1313
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,320
After saying the question.

1314
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,680
Pretend.

1315
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,800
Pretend to guess.

1316
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,280
After saying the question.

1317
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,200
If you say the answer, why pretend?

1318
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,320
Just say it.

1319
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,200
I want to know the answer.

1320
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,600
We don't know the riddle.

1321
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,360
Two balloons, one black, one white.

1322
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,040
And then?

1323
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,600
The white balloon hit the black balloon.

1324
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,440
What should the black balloon do?

1325
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,280
Confession balloon.

1326
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,680
Insulted twice.

1327
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,360
What are you doing, Yuning?

1328
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,120
So focused.

1329
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,960
Bro.

1330
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,440
Let me check what local food Xi'an has.

1331
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,280
We can't come here for nothing.

1332
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,440
I'll be back for the concert later.

1333
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,920
Just scroll on your phone.

1334
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,160
Shouldn't you ask the locals?

1335
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,040
No need.

1336
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,840
Just use the amazing Idle Fish app.

1337
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,720
You can find local guides there,

1338
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
and foodie buddies too.

1339
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,200
Check this out.

1340
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,040
Whose food is the best.

1341
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,320
Even the owner's temper.

1342
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,640
You know it all.

1343
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,440
Now I use Idle Fish for everything.

1344
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,040
I use Idle Fish to explore the world.

1345
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,440
Then teach me.

1346
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,520
Sure, open Idle Fish here.

1347
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,800
Nice, you got skills.

1348
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,040
Look how he slices the scallions.

1349
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,480
He cuts them so well.

1350
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,680
Look at how he slices the scallions.

1351
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,040
Are you mixing the dipping sauce?

1352
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,440
Yeah.

1353
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,160
It's super tasty.

1354
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,760
Gotta have a bowl today.

1355
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,360
Definitely today.

1356
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:26,640
No matter what, gotta have it.

1357
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,120
Have a few more bowls.

1358
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,800
Have a few more bowls.

1359
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,880
Bro, want me to help you slice this?

1360
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,080
I'll slice it for you here.

1361
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,720
I'm worried if you cut it.

1362
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,560
Sure, I'm just afraid you'll cut your hand.

1363
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,080
I won't.

1364
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Okay, then cut slowly.

1365
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,560
Cut less like this.

1366
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,720
Hold your hand like this, see?

1367
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,160
Like this.

1368
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
Yeah, lift the top part.

1369
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Then press it down.

1370
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,320
The knife can't go past this edge.

1371
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,560
If it does, you'll cut your hand.

1372
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,000
Got it.

1373
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,560
So you can go slower like this.

1374
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,200
Slice slowly like this.

1375
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,480
Slower.

1376
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,040
No rush.

1377
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,280
Like this.

1378
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,600
Yeah.

1379
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,720
Like that.

1380
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,440
A bit slower.

1381
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,520
One slice at a time.

1382
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,440
Great job.

1383
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,520
This plate was sliced really well.

1384
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:02,880
Thanks.

1385
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,840
Exactly.

1386
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,480
Restaurant level.

1387
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,360
Ning, you're so good at praising.

1388
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,520
I think you'd make a great teacher.

1389
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,240
You're especially patient.

1390
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,520
Yeah.

1391
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,880
Bro, eel!

1392
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,880
Whether it works depends on our luck.

1393
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,080
He Ge, make a Jiuzhuan.

1394
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,960
Jiuzhuan.

1395
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,840
Jiuzhuan Dachang, a spiralized pork intestine dish from Shandong cuisine.

1396
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,400
Jiuzhuan Dachang, a spiralized pork intestine dish from Shandong cuisine.

1397
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,640
Jiuzhuan Dachang, a spiralized pork intestine dish from Shandong cuisine.

1398
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,800
Jiuzhuan eel.

1399
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,800
I've been looking forward to this.

1400
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,840
Yeah, it's already stewing.

1401
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,560
How do you think it compares to Spain's today?

1402
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,600
I think it'll be better.

1403
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,840
Because we have all the ingredients today.

1404
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,400
Nice.

1405
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,600
Smells so good.

1406
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,600
Jun, your knife skills are great.

1407
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,320
Not bad.

1408
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,000
Slice it thinner, it's tastier.

1409
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,600
How about I make you some home-style potato slices?

1410
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,080
One for each of you.

1411
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,960
I'll make a pancake.

1412
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,200
Feels like honey would be great on it.

1413
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,880
These stir-fried potatoes are amazing too.

1414
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,560
Cooking wine?

1415
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,840
Not cooking wine, it's Huadiao.

1416
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,480
Huadiao, got it.

1417
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,880
Can't use cooking wine for this.

1418
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,040
What did I just see?

1419
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,440
What are you doing?

1420
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,160
It's a bit excited today.

1421
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,400
That aroma.

1422
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,880
Fry the egg first, right?

1423
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,800
Yeah, fry the egg.

1424
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,000
Missed egg in the pan.

1425
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,480
That's an expert.

1426
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
This one really knows food.

1427
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,200
Fried egg.

1428
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,200
Move aside a bit.

1429
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,640
No, it's my first try.

1430
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,080
I learned a new one online.

1431
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,720
I've had it, it's super tasty.

1432
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,480
The aroma is dizzying.

1433
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,040
Sure.

1434
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,960
You look like you're not wearing anything.

1435
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,120
Wearing an apron, cooking steak.

1436
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,520
Sleeveless.

1437
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,880
You wore sleeveless on purpose today, right?

1438
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,000
No.

1439
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,520
You knew we'd be cooking steak today.

1440
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,520
No.

1441
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,360
Did you, before coming here...

1442
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,840
...get pumped up like this?

1443
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,000
Did you get pumped up?

1444
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,840
Do you know about that sheep head?

1445
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,720
How was it brought over?

1446
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,720
It was carried and lifted the whole way.

1447
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,560
Okay.

1448
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,000
Awesome.

1449
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,480
Nice.

1450
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:52,960
Looking forward to it.

1451
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,920
Smells so good.

1452
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,560
Hot—blow on it.

1453
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,400
It's been ages since I had braised pork.

1454
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,160
Can you handle this?

1455
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,320
Totally can.

1456
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,760
Is it that bad?

1457
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,640
Mom would be so sad watching this show.

1458
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,760
She could cry.

1459
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
She'd feel so sorry for her kid.

1460
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,440
How long since you had braised pork?

1461
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
Mom said,

1462
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,440
He doesn't eat it either.

1463
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,520
Make it for him, he won't eat.

1464
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,440
But on the show, he asks for it—is that it?

1465
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,080
Even the accent is so similar.

1466
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,840
Alright.

1467
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,000
Beautiful.

1468
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:30,960
Really great.

1469
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,720
I'm done here.

1470
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,200
Just right.

1471
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,760
Watch your step.

1472
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,160
It's fine.

1473
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,360
Such a big pot.

1474
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,800
In no time, it's a full banquet.

1475
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,240
This aroma...

1476
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,120
The potatoes are amazing.

1477
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,080
So good.

1478
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,240
That's an expert's touch.

1479
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,280
Smells wonderful.

1480
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,320
I want to try it, Chef Liu.

1481
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,840
So tasty.

1482
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,280
How is it?

1483
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,840
Delicious.

1484
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,440
Reviving.

1485
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,640
Chef Liu.

1486
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,760
Your soup is incredible, really.

1487
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,200
Chef Liu.

1488
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,280
So good—this soup is amazing.

1489
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
The lamb soup is delicious.

1490
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,720
This way of cooking eel...

1491
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,920
It's my first time trying it.

1492
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,840
Mine too, first time.

1493
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,920
Maybe it's a Fujian recipe.

1494
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,760
This stir-fried pork is tasty.

1495
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,600
It goes so well with rice.

1496
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,480
Perfect with rice.

1497
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,040
Delicious.

1498
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
Finally back home.

1499
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,960
Today's meal...

1500
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,520
I'm about to show everyone a Super Fresh Earth surprise.

1501
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,720
Cooking up a taste of nostalgia.

1502
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,600
I've prepared my favorite for everyone.

1503
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,280
Sinen Jumbo Shrimp Dumplings.

1504
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,480
There are twenty dumplings inside.

1505
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,360
Twenty shrimp.

1506
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,240
The shrimp inside is so plump and springy.

1507
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:52,760
And also—

1508
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,160
Sinen shrimp dumplings are the top seller nationwide.

1509
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,520
You can't go wrong eating these.

1510
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,760
Here, let me add a plate for everyone.

1511
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,640
Super Fresh Earth Sinen Jumbo Shrimp Dumplings.

1512
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,800
Really good.

1513
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,720
Come on, try it.

1514
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,960
Tasty, Wen-jie.

1515
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,160
Mix it yourself.

1516
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,160
I'll do it myself.

1517
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,600
Thanks, bro.

1518
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,840
I'll eat this fatty meat for you.

1519
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,520
Bro, one bite.

1520
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,400
Haven't eaten like this in ages.

1521
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,400
I think it's delicious.

1522
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,360
Xingxu.

1523
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,640
Are you eating by yourself?

1524
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,600
Doing surgery on the lamb.

1525
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
Did you scoop out the lamb's eye?

1526
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,520
It's really hot.

1527
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,240
It's burning me up.

1528
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,440
Super hot.

1529
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,120
We're eating some wild stuff.

1530
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,280
It's a bit weird, honestly.

1531
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,440
This sheep's head is pretty fatty.

1532
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,320
Really fatty.

1533
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,920
In the very first episode,

1534
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,600
we tested how well everyone knew each other.

1535
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,240
After spending a whole season together,

1536
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,760
at the end of the show,

1537
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,920
we use a "choose one of two" challenge

1538
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,240
to test our chemistry again.

1539
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,360
Each person draws a question.

1540
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,720
The others, based on their choices,

1541
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,480
pick between two members present.

1542
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,920
Then guess what the question is.

1543
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,880
Let's go.

1544
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,080
Didi, you go.

1545
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,400
Okay.

1546
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,880
Go ahead.

1547
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,800
Between Honglei and Naiwen, who do you pick?

1548
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,120
I pick Honglei.

1549
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,200
Nice.

1550
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,440
Between Honglei and Yuning, who do you pick?

1551
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
I pick Yuning.

1552
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,800
Between Yuning and Xingxu?

1553
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,600
Yuning.

1554
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,400
Between Yuning and me?

1555
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,360
Hesitating.

1556
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,520
Both are pretty handsome.

1557
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Looks.

1558
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,400
Why aren't you in the options?

1559
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,080
I don't know.

1560
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,520
I was kicked out long ago.

1561
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,280
It's fine.

1562
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,880
I'll still pick Ning.

1563
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:55,800
Okay.

1564
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,160
I don't know what the question is.

1565
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,400
But I feel happy.

1566
00:53:59,480 --> 00:53:59,840
Wait a second.

1567
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,040
Between Ning and He?

1568
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,280
I pick He.

1569
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,720
See?

1570
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,600
Between Sister Wang and He, pick one.

1571
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,160
Sister Wang.

1572
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,960
Sister Wang.

1573
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,360
Sorry, bro.

1574
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:14,720
No worries.

1575
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,800
My status is still a bit higher.

1576
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,600
It's fine.

1577
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,600
So in Didi's contest,

1578
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,560
I'm number one.

1579
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,240
He is second.

1580
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,040
Ning is third.

1581
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,360
Now let's guess

1582
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,560
what the question was.

1583
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,440
It's not about feelings.

1584
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,480
If you only had one can of chocolate,

1585
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,440
who would you share it with?

1586
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,920
She'd definitely share with him.

1587
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,920
Shouldn't that be Honglei?

1588
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,920
It's about chocolate.

1589
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,360
There must be only one answer.

1590
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,320
A bit deeper.

1591
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,560
Something deeper.

1592
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,320
Go watch a movie together.

1593
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,560
Visit the library together.

1594
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,000
Stroll in Chaoyang Park together.

1595
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,160
No.

1596
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
Build a museum together.

1597
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,600
Bro.

1598
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,800
Start a business together.

1599
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,400
Very close.

1600
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,560
Go together

1601
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,040
to start a business.

1602
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,720
I think He's answer is also close.

1603
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,560
I'm already touched.

1604
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,080
Would you split your money with me?

1605
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,240
Turns out, in her heart,

1606
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,640
you're just a business partner.

1607
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,560
She's willing to give her

1608
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,600
most important part to me.

1609
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,800
Why are you laughing?

1610
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,240
What?

1611
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:18,880
Why are you laughing?

1612
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,680
Pick someone to work with you.

1613
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,680
Earn your first pot of gold.

1614
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,480
Who would you choose?

1615
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,040
I think usually, for your first job,

1616
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,240
it's with your college friends.

1617
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,280
Start a business and make money together.

1618
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,240
I'm happy too.

1619
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,480
Because Didi thinks

1620
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,680
I'm the reliable, trustworthy partner.

1621
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:35,600
Yes.

1622
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,440
He and Ning.

1623
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,680
Mainly because I think they're smart.

1624
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,440
What?

1625
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,160
Seems like someone got left out again.

1626
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,720
I was tossed out first.

1627
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,840
Why is that?

1628
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,800
You can't just have strength for work.

1629
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,920
Muscle alone isn't enough.

1630
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:55,920
Come on.

1631
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,360
Gong Jun goes first.

1632
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,800
Gong Jun, your turn.

1633
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,600
This is a wild question.

1634
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,880
Their reactions are explosive.

1635
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,600
Is it that wild?

1636
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,480
I'll ask the first one.

1637
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,440
Between Honglei and Ning, who do you pick?

1638
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,560
Liu Yuning.

1639
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,360
Okay.

1640
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,200
Keep going.

1641
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,120
Between Liu Yuning and Chen Xingxu, who do you pick?

1642
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,240
Me and Chen Xingxu.

1643
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,320
What's the question?

1644
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,160
Is this a tricky question?

1645
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,000
Is it that hard to answer?

1646
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,920
Go ahead.

1647
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,280
Pick one of us.

1648
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,880
Us two.

1649
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,000
Liu Yuning.

1650
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,280
Between Liu Yuning and Chen He.

1651
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,720
Then He.

1652
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,360
He.

1653
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,360
He and Yuwen.

1654
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,560
He.

1655
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,880
He and Naiwen.

1656
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,120
He.

1657
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,960
He.

1658
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,440
He and Didi.

1659
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,240
He and Didi.

1660
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,960
He.

1661
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,520
So the final answer to this question

1662
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,680
is He.

1663
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:35,960
Come on, guess.

1664
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,760
Who's the variety show god in your heart?

1665
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,360
Wrong.

1666
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,520
You answered so carelessly.

1667
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,560
Who's the manliest person in your eyes?

1668
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,360
Man.

1669
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,320
Is that even in doubt?

1670
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,120
You just bleated.

1671
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,800
This is about a relationship.

1672
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,560
Relationship.

1673
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,160
If you could act as a duo with someone,

1674
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
who would you choose?

1675
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,960
That's the direction.

1676
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,640
Let's act out

1677
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,080
an unforgettable

1678
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,040
love story.

1679
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,720
Very close.

1680
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,480
This question is about choosing your rival in love.

1681
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,960
Then, Honglei, you go ahead.

1682
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,360
Pick one for this round.

1683
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,480
This one's even tougher than yours.

1684
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,960
That's terrifying.

1685
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,880
This one's really intense.

1686
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,560
Go ahead.

1687
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,840
Which one, Didi or Yuwen?

1688
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,160
Wow, you took them out in one move.

1689
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,360
It's definitely an emotional one.

1690
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,360
Come on, hurry up.

1691
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,840
Who do I pick, me or Didi?

1692
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,320
Wang Yuwen.

1693
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,320
He barely hesitated.

1694
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:12,880
Didi.

1695
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,480
Didi.

1696
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,080
It doesn't matter.

1697
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,640
Let's wait for the question first.

1698
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,600
No problem.

1699
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,600
So, Wang Yuwen or Liu Yuning?

1700
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,160
Liu Yuning.

1701
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,160
Liu Yuning or Li Naiwen?

1702
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:35,920
Liu Yuning.

1703
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,800
You didn't even pause on him.

1704
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,120
It's like you weren't even playing. Go.

1705
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,600
Liu Yuning and...

1706
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,080
Who do you pick, Xingxu or him?

1707
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,520
I need to think about this one.

1708
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
You're taking so long to decide.

1709
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,280
Liu Yuning.

1710
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,400
Liu Yuning or Gong Jun?

1711
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:05,920
Yuning.

1712
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,520
No hesitation at all.

1713
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,600
Yuning or Chen He?

1714
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,520
My head hurts, let me think.

1715
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,440
Brother Ning or Brother He?

1716
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,400
Now you have a headache.

1717
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,520
Now you're starting to hesitate.

1718
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,200
Brother He made it to the finals again.

1719
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,920
You're so popular.

1720
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,520
Yuning.

1721
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,560
He wins!

1722
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,760
Brother Ning wins completely.

1723
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,000
The one with the highest EQ.

1724
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
In your mind.

1725
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,000
Wrong.

1726
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,080
Is it the sweet romance kind?

1727
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:54,720
It can be.

1728
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,880
Sweet romance, him.

1729
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,200
He picked Brother Ning.

1730
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,960
Pick Brother Ning.

1731
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,240
He likes the bossy type.

1732
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,960
He likes the bossy type.

1733
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,440
No.

1734
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,600
I'm not the bossy type.

1735
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,800
I'm just a softie.

1736
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,120
What?

1737
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,840
He said he's just a softie.

1738
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,360
If you could go back to your school days,

1739
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,480
and have a sweet romance,

1740
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,360
who would you choose?

1741
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,240
That's close.

1742
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,840
This question is about—

1743
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,200
Your first relationship.

1744
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,520
Who would you bring home?

1745
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,440
Your family would be happy.

1746
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,120
Why Liu Yuning?

1747
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,120
Why?

1748
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,760
My mom said,

1749
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,280
"Son,"

1750
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,480
"Find someone tall in the future."

1751
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,600
Sounds just like something Mom would say.

1752
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,600
Yeah, that's really how it is.

1753
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,120
He's way too tall though.

1754
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,000
Honglei.

1755
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,160
She didn't say find someone taller than you.

1756
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,640
That's a different thing.

1757
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,360
He's almost one ninety.

1758
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,040
I win on height.

1759
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
Your turn, Wen'er.

1760
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:09,880
What?

1761
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,880
I don't dare answer this. What's going on?

1762
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,480
Is this an emotional one?

1763
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,800
I don't think so.

1764
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,360
This doesn't count as emotional.

1765
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,440
Brother He or me?

1766
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,600
Yeah, the two of us.

1767
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:24,800
Yuning.

1768
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,320
Okay.

1769
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,200
Oh, come on, hurry up.

1770
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,520
Yuning or Honglei?

1771
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,480
This one's tricky.

1772
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,280
We thought about it for a bit.

1773
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,520
Pretending to think.

1774
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,640
Yuning.

1775
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,840
I've already knocked out two people.

1776
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,160
What about Xingxu and Yuning?

1777
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,880
Xingxu.

1778
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,360
Where are Xingxu and Gong Jun?

1779
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,520
Xingxu.

1780
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,960
Xingxu and Didi.

1781
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,200
Xingxu.

1782
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,760
Xingxu and me.

1783
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,120
This is so hard.

1784
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,120
What's wrong?

1785
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,040
If you were him...

1786
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,480
None of us accept losing.

1787
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,480
Maybe Xingxu.

1788
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,360
Pick me.

1789
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,400
You weren't thinking tactically just now, right?

1790
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,320
Really, I wasn't.

1791
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,680
I'm afraid of offending people.

1792
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,520
So you're not afraid to offend me, huh?

1793
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,520
This one's a bit easier to offend.

1794
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,680
Who do you think is the easiest to fool on this show?

1795
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,680
Something like that.

1796
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,600
No.

1797
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,520
State the premise first.

1798
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,320
When acting...

1799
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,520
If it's in this play...

1800
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,680
If you're acting in a play...

1801
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,000
Who could do a kissing scene with you?

1802
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,960
Absolutely can't do a kissing scene.

1803
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,840
No.

1804
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,920
It's not about romance.

1805
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,000
It's not about romance.

1806
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,680
Who would be good at playing your elder?

1807
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,240
No.

1808
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,360
Xingxu would suit playing her elder.

1809
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,320
She just said she's afraid to offend us.

1810
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Then I can just pick the elder.

1811
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,480
I got it.

1812
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,440
Who, in this play...

1813
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,000
Like, he washes her feet.

1814
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,520
That's so specific.

1815
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,040
If it's in a play...

1816
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,840
You have to kill him.

1817
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,440
Who would you kill?

1818
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:16,840
Getting close.

1819
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,240
Who do you most want to harm?

1820
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,800
As soon as I pick...

1821
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,200
If you pick Xingxu, that's the vibe.

1822
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,160
Who do you want to harm?

1823
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,200
Who do you want to take out?

1824
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,240
Go reveal the answer.

1825
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
What is it?

1826
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,240
Can't guess it.

1827
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,240
Way too hard to guess.

1828
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,280
It's too hard.

1829
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:35,680
I know now.

1830
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,400
You saw it, of course you know.

1831
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm not.

1832
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:41,720
No.

1833
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:42,520
No.

1834
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,240
Then say it.

1835
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,480
Pick someone to faint in their arms—who would you choose?

1836
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,800
I'd never guess in my whole life.

1837
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,760
To be honest...

1838
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,400
Even if I were reborn, I couldn't guess.

1839
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,320
I'm really curious.

1840
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:53,840
Let me try one.

1841
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,320
Go ahead.

1842
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,840
Honestly, every question is tough.

1843
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,320
This one.

1844
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,680
Come on.

1845
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,920
Alright, I'll ask.

1846
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,440
Me and Gong Jun.

1847
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,320
What are you doing?

1848
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,280
Sit down, bro.

1849
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,680
You and Gong Jun.

1850
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,800
Think carefully.

1851
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,440
It's so hard.

1852
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,320
I'm stuck.

1853
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,080
Is it really this hard?

1854
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,040
Why is this so hard?

1855
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,880
I'm stuck.

1856
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:32,960
Are you still there?

1857
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,040
Wait a second.

1858
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,520
Ask this question later.

1859
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:36,880
Okay.

1860
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,680
Change it.

1861
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,320
Honglei and Chen Xingxu.

1862
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,040
That's hard too.

1863
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,000
Yuwen and Didi.

1864
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,760
Didi

1865
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,040
Okay

1866
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,800
Okay

1867
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,000
Come on, Didi, He-ge

1868
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,360
Didi and He-ge

1869
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,400
Three

1870
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,040
So hard to choose

1871
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:11,560
Two

1872
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:12,680
One

1873
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,040
Choose

1874
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,400
He-ge

1875
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:15,880
He-ge

1876
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,920
He-ge

1877
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,280
He-ge and Honglei-ge

1878
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:21,960
He-ge

1879
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,400
He-ge

1880
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,040
You're in luck tonight, bro

1881
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,960
You're lucky today

1882
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,960
He-ge and Xingxu

1883
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,640
He-ge

1884
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,240
He-ge

1885
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,320
He-ge and Liu Yuning

1886
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:37,720
He-ge

1887
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:38,800
He

1888
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,800
He-ge is the last one

1889
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,880
He-ge and me

1890
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,240
Three

1891
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,200
Two

1892
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,440
One

1893
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,200
Let's go

1894
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:46,480
He-ge

1895
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,800
Nice, awesome

1896
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,120
This is really hard to pick

1897
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,720
Once you know the question

1898
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,680
You'll see, it's really tough to choose

1899
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,880
Is it an IQ question?

1900
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,840
It's a creative one

1901
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,960
A creative one

1902
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,880
If you get abducted by aliens

1903
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,360
You were taken by aliens

1904
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,960
Pick someone to swap for you, who do you choose?

1905
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,160
No

1906
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,360
Travel back to ancient times together

1907
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,760
Who would you take with you?

1908
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,000
Make it a bit more complicated

1909
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,120
To ancient times

1910
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,960
Take this person with you

1911
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,200
Succession

1912
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,320
Very close

1913
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,880
You need to help them become emperor

1914
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,600
Emperor

1915
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,120
Emperor

1916
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,080
Empress

1917
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,560
Right

1918
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,160
Emperor what?

1919
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:38,960
Emperor

1920
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,640
Empress

1921
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,400
If you had to help someone

1922
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,760
Become the empress

1923
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,080
Who would you choose?

1924
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,280
This question

1925
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,400
Doesn't matter if you win

1926
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,960
What's the point of winning?

1927
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,840
Didi and Yuwen

1928
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,800
I choose

1929
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,280
Didi

1930
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,120
Didi

1931
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,080
Because when Yuwen talks

1932
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,880
She could get her whole clan executed

1933
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,000
When I speak, it's a clan-level disaster, bro

1934
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,680
Honglei-ge and Yuning

1935
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,359
The emperor loves beauty too

1936
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,600
No

1937
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,240
Damn, he also said to find someone tall

1938
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,800
The emperor likes tall ones too

1939
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,760
The emperor likes tall ones too

1940
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,279
Yuning and Xingxu

1941
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,479
Both are good-looking

1942
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,399
But you need someone smart, right?

1943
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,840
Are you saying someone's not smart?

1944
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,399
What about me?

1945
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:41,439
I guessed it

1946
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:42,840
Right?

1947
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,520
I guessed it, bro

1948
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:44,680
I guessed it, bro

1949
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,920
Naiwen-ge said you're just a pretty face

1950
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,640
He said you're just a pretty face

1951
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,439
Totally just a pretty face

1952
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:49,040
Pretty face

1953
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,279
And then

1954
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:52,760
He

1955
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,600
He can live a long time

1956
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,720
So I definitely choose

1957
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,960
Can survive till the end

1958
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,279
Yeah, the one who lasts

1959
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:01,960
Bestie

1960
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,279
Yes

1961
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,800
Definitely picking He-er

1962
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,520
It's all about survival

1963
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,680
I'm with the emperor now

1964
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,920
I'd "take you out" first

1965
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:13,920
Why?

1966
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,760
You know too much

1967
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,720
Come on, give Yuning a tricky one

1968
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,800
Okay

1969
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,560
Is it abstract?

1970
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,840
Very abstract

1971
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,520
I'll ask first

1972
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,000
Ask

1973
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,640
Between me and He-ge, who do you pick?

1974
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,520
I pick you

1975
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,439
Looks like a brainless question

1976
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,600
Me and Gong Jun

1977
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,160
Who do you pick?

1978
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,280
Watch out

1979
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,560
Hesitated

1980
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,120
Xingxu, I guess, Xingxu

1981
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,160
Still the least brainy one

1982
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,800
Okay

1983
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,080
Me

1984
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:16,640
Me

1985
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,440
So, me and

1986
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,400
Xingxu's making it hard for himself

1987
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,080
Wait a sec

1988
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,160
I'll eliminate myself first

1989
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,360
Honglei-ge and Naiwen-ge

1990
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,360
I've never won before.

1991
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,800
I pick Brother Honglei.

1992
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,400
Still didn't win.

1993
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,680
Didi and Yuwen.

1994
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,000
Yuwen.

1995
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,280
Me and Wen'er.

1996
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,120
Pick you.

1997
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:53,840
Picked me again.

1998
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,080
So it must be about IQ.

1999
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,120
I think so.

2000
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,920
If I vote for you, it's IQ.

2001
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,520
Me and Brother Honglei.

2002
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,040
You and Brother Honglei.

2003
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,520
Pick you.

2004
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,240
So it's him then.

2005
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,120
So it's me then.

2006
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,960
So I'm first.

2007
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
What kind of...

2008
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:13,960
Imagination.

2009
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,600
Imagination.

2010
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,360
Big imagination.

2011
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,160
Big imagination.

2012
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:16,960
Related to "Journey to the West."

2013
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,720
Related to "Journey to the West."

2014
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:22,960
I'm the White Dragon Horse.

2015
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,520
Right?

2016
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,520
He plays the White Dragon Horse.

2017
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,680
Who do I ride, right?

2018
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,040
No.

2019
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,560
How is that possible?

2020
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,080
Not that.

2021
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,000
No.

2022
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,160
He said he'd play the White Dragon Horse that day, right.

2023
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,040
If you were Sun Wukong...

2024
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,320
You...

2025
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,320
Who would you see as a monster?

2026
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,080
Who would you hit first?

2027
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,360
The White Bone Demon, that's him.

2028
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,840
That's close.

2029
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,840
Getting closer.

2030
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,960
So you're basically a monster.

2031
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,400
If you were a spirit...

2032
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,480
Who would you ask to help catch Tang Seng?

2033
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,560
Guessed right.

2034
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,080
Almost correct.

2035
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,000
My certificate.

2036
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,160
Come on, you present it to me.

2037
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,440
You're the muscle.

2038
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,320
Pick someone to train and become a spirit with.

2039
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,320
Go catch Tang Seng.

2040
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,280
Like him and Brother He.

2041
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,240
I think Brother He is...

2042
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,800
He eats a lot.

2043
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,040
He'd go with me to catch Tang Seng.

2044
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,160
Maybe I'd eat less.

2045
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,440
He'd eat all of yours.

2046
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:32,840
Right.

2047
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,240
But I eat less.

2048
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,280
You always get leaked.

2049
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,040
I'm afraid our plan to catch Tang Seng would get leaked.

2050
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,880
None of these questions are easy.

2051
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:54,480
Come on.

2052
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,200
Didi and Yuwen.

2053
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,080
Xingxu, what's with your face?

2054
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,600
Why do you look so serious?

2055
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,960
Me, Yuwen.

2056
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,880
Yuwen.

2057
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,280
Okay.

2058
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,160
Yuwen and Brother Honglei.

2059
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,280
Brother Honglei.

2060
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,000
Me and Brother Honglei.

2061
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,120
He's so serious.

2062
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,080
Such a serious question.

2063
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:19,880
Look at him.

2064
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,280
He looks like he's solving an equation.

2065
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,120
Look at his serious face.

2066
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,080
Brother Naiwen.

2067
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,240
My first time.

2068
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,240
Your first time.

2069
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:35,880
My first time.

2070
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,040
You won for the first time.

2071
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,640
Won a round.

2072
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,400
Won once in a one-on-one.

2073
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,040
A small win.

2074
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,440
A small win.

2075
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,200
Me and Brother Naiwen.

2076
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:49,800
Brother Naiwen.

2077
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:52,560
Like this.

2078
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,040
Liu Yuning and Brother Naiwen.

2079
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:55,760
Brother Naiwen.

2080
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,320
Gong Jun and Brother Naiwen.

2081
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,200
Brother Naiwen.

2082
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,120
Is it about emotions?

2083
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,400
Relationship type.

2084
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,440
Relationship type.

2085
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,000
Who do you want as your boss?

2086
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,600
No.

2087
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,760
Who do you want as your father?

2088
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,320
No.

2089
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
Second uncle.

2090
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,840
Second grandpa.

2091
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,240
No.

2092
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,120
Then grandparents, right?

2093
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:19,960
No.

2094
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,720
Sister-in-law.

2095
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:23,920
No.

2096
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,640
Aunt.

2097
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,400
Father-in-law.

2098
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,320
Father-in-law.

2099
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,000
Very close.

2100
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,040
Mother-in-law.

2101
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,200
Father-in-law.

2102
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,920
Father-in-law.

2103
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:35,800
No.

2104
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,240
Father-in-law.

2105
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:37,720
Father-in-law.

2106
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,600
Father-in-law?

2107
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,840
Mother-in-law.

2108
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,200
Yes.

2109
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,640
Mother-in-law.

2110
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,520
Why pick you as mother-in-law?

2111
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,240
Brother Naiwen was so happy just now.

2112
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,720
Took forever to choose.

2113
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,320
You want to be mother-in-law.

2114
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,720
Then I can lose.

2115
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:00,920
Mother-in-law.

2116
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,560
Because you know...

2117
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,040
Because if Brother Honglei...

2118
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,240
When he gets serious, I get scared.

2119
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:08,760
Still scared.

2120
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,360
When he gets serious...

2121
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:10,920
You're not scared?

2122
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,520
Look.

2123
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,320
He wants to laugh.

2124
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,840
Come on, ask a question.

2125
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,160
Go ahead.

2126
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,480
Yuwen and Didi

2127
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,440
Yuwen

2128
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,880
Yuwen and Xingxu

2129
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,000
Xingxu

2130
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,400
Xingxu and Naiwen

2131
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:31,640
Xingxu

2132
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,600
Xingxu and Brother Honglei

2133
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,440
Xingxu

2134
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,360
Xingxu and me

2135
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:40,720
You

2136
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,480
Jun and Ning

2137
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:48,880
Jun

2138
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,400
Wait a second.

2139
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,880
Naiwen and Honglei

2140
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,040
Just have to compete with you.

2141
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,800
Naiwen and Honglei

2142
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:04,920
Brother Honglei

2143
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:07,880
Stop asking.

2144
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,160
You're asking for it.

2145
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,080
Stop asking.

2146
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,080
You're asking for it.

2147
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,520
So in the end, he actually chose

2148
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,120
Gong Jun

2149
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,480
The question is,

2150
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,280
If you went back to the Stone Age

2151
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,880
and became a caveman,

2152
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,480
who would you pick to share a cave with?

2153
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,240
Who would you choose?

2154
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,480
Let me explain Naiwen's question first.

2155
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:30,920
Is that okay?

2156
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,520
He can't do anything.

2157
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,320
Why would I bring him?

2158
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,800
Am I supposed to serve him?

2159
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,120
So what about me and Brother Honglei?

2160
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,280
Brother Honglei actually

2161
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,520
cooked a dish just now.

2162
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,040
Didn't I chop the ginger?

2163
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,880
Didn't I ladle the soup?

2164
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Let me tell you something.

2165
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,400
Chopping ginger and all that—

2166
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,440
That was all work for you.

2167
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,760
You sat here the whole time.

2168
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,960
The food still got made.

2169
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,480
Now, with Junjun,

2170
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,560
Junjun just came back in.

2171
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,640
He had work to do.

2172
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,240
So for your last question,

2173
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,560
you picked a "servant."

2174
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,200
Someone to do chores for you.

2175
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:20,760
No.

2176
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,840
A sensible "servant."

2177
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,040
Makes sense.

2178
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,600
Come on.

2179
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,240
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

2180
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,400
You all worked hard.

2181
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,200
You worked hard too.

2182
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,320
A toast to freedom.

2183
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,600
A toast to freedom.

2184
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,160
The first toast is to myself.

2185
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,360
First time I cried on the show.

2186
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,160
No problem, I'll drink.

2187
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,120
So fast, the trip is ending.

2188
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,640
I really didn't expect

2189
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,600
Even though everyone

2190
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,800
is so different in age,

2191
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,080
we're still so close.

2192
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,720
It's just like

2193
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,680
being with my family,

2194
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,760
playing together.

2195
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,840
Still a little

2196
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,040
socially anxious.

2197
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,120
I can only call you "Master Didi."

2198
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,040
Jump up!

2199
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,040
You guys make things so hard.

2200
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,960
Be careful later, I'm warning you.

2201
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,800
It's so relaxing together.

2202
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,880
You can do or say whatever you want.

2203
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,240
That's when we're at our best.

2204
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:22,680
Yeah.

2205
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,840
Very happy.

2206
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,240
I'm glad I got the chance

2207
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,520
to be with so many brothers and sisters.

2208
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,720
And I learned so much from them.

2209
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,160
Actually,

2210
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,520
I've always been afraid of saying goodbye

2211
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,280
or facing those

2212
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,360
farewell moments.

2213
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,200
But today, I feel okay.

2214
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,560
Why is that?

2215
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,440
First,

2216
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,040
I managed to do this on the show—

2217
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,520
neither respect elders nor care for the young.

2218
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,640
I'm not getting up.

2219
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,440
He is

2220
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,680
ugly-cool, ugly-cool.

2221
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,040
Well said.

2222
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,160
Yuwen, little brother.

2223
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,440
Aunt Huang Lei

2224
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,040
You two are so fake, I'm telling you.

2225
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,240
That's so cool.

2226
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,240
Feels like a boss strutting out.

2227
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,960
Such deep eyes.

2228
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,440
How is your nose so high?

2229
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,760
I'm speechless now.

2230
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,000
His looks are the least of his strengths.

2231
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,480
Every word hits right in the heart.

2232
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,240
Really nice.

2233
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:21,920
Because I know

2234
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,760
our group chat will never stop.

2235
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,880
Because I know we're

2236
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,440
all over the place,

2237
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,400
including Ning's concerts,

2238
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,640
we'll keep meeting up.

2239
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,960
We won't let this bond fade.

2240
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,440
So I'm not afraid to say goodbye.

2241
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,440
Because we'll see each other again.

2242
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,360
What you said makes sense.

2243
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,040
Everyone's saying today

2244
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,280
that I've become more outgoing.

2245
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,080
From introvert to extrovert.

2246
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,320
But what I want to say is,

2247
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,360
I've never changed.

2248
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,080
I'm still the same.

2249
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,280
I still am—

2250
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:48,680
Yeah.

2251
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,040
I'm still like this elsewhere.

2252
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,080
I'm still this person.

2253
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,120
Just like when you first met me.

2254
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,800
It's only because I have you all with me

2255
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,600
that I don't have to overthink anymore.

2256
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,760
Brother Honglei, stop messing with me.

2257
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,240
I'm begging you.

2258
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,000
After last time, I'm scared now.

2259
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,760
I've never lost.

2260
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,480
I'm the "king" of bottle standing.

2261
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:08,960
Alright.

2262
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,160
Never lost.

2263
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,800
I'm Li Naiwen.

2264
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,080
This is my aunt.

2265
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,760
So,

2266
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,880
wherever we go in the future,

2267
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,360
I'll be just like I am now.

2268
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,600
Maybe even more outgoing than now.

2269
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,600
The way I am now

2270
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,000
is something only you all get to see.

2271
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,800
I'm off to eat Tang Seng.

2272
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,480
Don't worry.

2273
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,280
With "Grandma" here, you don't need to be afraid.

2274
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,520
To be honest,

2275
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,000
every day filming Super Fresh Earth,

2276
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,840
I was truly happy.

2277
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,080
I felt so much joy.

2278
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,120
Because I could leave all my worries behind.

2279
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:55,600
It's been two months since we met.

2280
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,280
Two months apart.

2281
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,560
I feel like I'm finally home.

2282
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,040
I'm so happy right now.

2283
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,760
Friends walk together for life.

2284
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,240
Mr. Gong, you go first. Mr. Gong.

2285
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,160
Teacher, pull up your pants. What's going on?

2286
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,720
Your pants are falling down.

2287
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,880
Kissing a shark.

2288
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,400
I've seen deserts.

2289
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,120
Heavy rain pouring down.

2290
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,640
I've seen the ocean, kissed a shark.

2291
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,160
A cup also stands for a lifetime.

2292
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:22,840
Right?

2293
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,880
I hope you're happy.

2294
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,840
So when I came to film

2295
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,520
the final episode of Super Fresh Earth,

2296
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,120
then

2297
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,280
I said, "I'm home."

2298
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,240
I was keeping it from you.

2299
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,600
In that group chat,

2300
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,040
I didn't dare send a single message.

2301
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,480
And then

2302
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,680
You guys are just too clever.

2303
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,400
I really can't fool you at all.

2304
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,800
Because you wanted to surprise us.

2305
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,400
We were always waiting for you.

2306
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:51,680
Yeah.

2307
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,080
We've been thinking about it all along.

2308
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,520
We're waiting for that surprise.

2309
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,120
Right.

2310
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,360
It's mutual effort.

2311
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,400
I'm truly happy from the bottom of my heart.

2312
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,200
Yes.

2313
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,040
You can feel it.

2314
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:03,440
That's awesome.

2315
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,120
Living together in a foreign land,

2316
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,040
it's easy to form deep bonds.

2317
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,880
Like a family eating at one table.

2318
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,000
Every morning, I see these same people.

2319
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,240
And after work, it's still these people.

2320
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,800
If it's you,

2321
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,560
you go to Room Six.

2322
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,440
If it's not you,

2323
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,120
then I go to Room Six.

2324
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,600
Are you in or not?

2325
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,440
Just hold hands and look at the camera.

2326
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,200
The saxophone is playing over there.

2327
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,480
We're dancing on the side.

2328
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,160
The two of them are here.

2329
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,480
Sure.

2330
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,360
I think Yuning

2331
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,680
With him around, you feel reassured.

2332
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,640
Master Liu.

2333
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,440
Can you make an egg tonight?

2334
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,200
And maybe some noodles too?

2335
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,240
Of course, no problem.

2336
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,640
It's my honor.

2337
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,320
No worries, I'll do it soon.

2338
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,240
I'll figure out how to make it.

2339
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,520
Ning is such a man.

2340
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,360
I'll bring the eggs over.

2341
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,880
He said the three manliest words.

2342
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,640
Let me think.

2343
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,240
Did you notice?

2344
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,920
Yuning has that parental look.

2345
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,120
You can tell he's learned that move.

2346
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,880
Yuning, you're really handsome.

2347
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,560
Yuning, we can't do without you.

2348
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,040
Alright.

2349
01:22:59,360 --> 01:22:59,960
Really, bro?

2350
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,960
Careful.

2351
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,680
It's so big.

2352
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,760
Why did you give me this one?

2353
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:08,960
Because I care about you.

2354
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,720
Thanks, bro.

2355
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,040
Yuning is scared.

2356
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,480
Ning, come down and walk around.

2357
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,320
Okay.

2358
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,360
So brave.

2359
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,480
I'm really awesome.

2360
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,280
Awesome.

2361
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,400
Because I never went to college,

2362
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,080
I really long for this kind of dorm life.

2363
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,000
I truly yearn for it.

2364
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,760
It feels like a different kind of bond.

2365
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,000
And I think

2366
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,840
the biggest gain from this show is

2367
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,040
what He told me.

2368
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,920
It's being able to bring joy to others.

2369
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,000
That's truly a great thing.

2370
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,680
So I also feel

2371
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,760
what I've done is meaningful.

2372
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,680
I'm very happy.

2373
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,280
This...

2374
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,280
In two months, I'll be forty.

2375
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,440
Even now, I still feel

2376
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,760
like I'm eighteen.

2377
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,120
He's giving us a hint.

2378
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,520
I remember.

2379
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,280
Me too.

2380
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:05,880
Two months later.

2381
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,680
I never thought

2382
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,960
about turning forty.

2383
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,560
As we grow older,

2384
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,520
we have fewer and fewer friends.

2385
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,560
That's for sure.

2386
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,680
It's not that we

2387
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,480
aren't likable,

2388
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,720
or that others become annoying.

2389
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,640
That's not it.

2390
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,640
It's just our energy is limited.

2391
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,200
But it's hard to imagine at this age

2392
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,360
having the same buddies for so many years.

2393
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,560
Just a few people by your side.

2394
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,120
The old gang.

2395
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,160
And still gaining more brothers and sisters.

2396
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,880
That's really rare.

2397
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,800
Is this even related to the question, bro?

2398
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,680
Bro.

2399
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,240
What?

2400
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,280
Watch the main episode.

2401
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,480
Just watch the main episode.

2402
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,720
Watch the main episode.

2403
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:48,640
Slurp ten times.

2404
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,520
Got it.

2405
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,240
You buy it.

2406
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,280
Yeah.

2407
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,720
What are you doing?

2408
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,440
Come on.

2409
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,360
What is this?

2410
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,280
He sings

2411
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,600
not as well as you.

2412
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,840
You won.

2413
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,200
You want no points deducted for this?

2414
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,120
Unless you really promise

2415
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,760
like, in the future, you see fans here—

2416
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:10,720
Hello.

2417
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:12,960
Just walk normally.

2418
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:13,840
But in the circle, you change like this.

2419
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,600
What's up with you?

2420
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,480
Ice cream.

2421
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,080
Ice cream.

2422
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,240
Bro, ice cream.

2423
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,800
Chen He, Chen He, you're impossible to handle.

2424
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,840
Time moves slowly

2425
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,080
but also passes quickly.

2426
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,080
To all the viewers who made it here,

2427
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,720
I hope you feel quite happy.

2428
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,080
Yes.

2429
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,760
Thank you all for watching till now.

2430
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:43,960
So save some time

2431
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,240
for your own lives.

2432
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,200
Go enjoy your life,

2433
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,880
and experience growth in your journey.

2434
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,760
Life is a mix of flavors, joys and sorrows.

2435
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,960
Happiness and pain—

2436
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,320
I think that's the best kind of life.

2437
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,280
Hope we bring you even more joy.

2438
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,520
See you next year.

2439
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,480
Yes, see you next year.

2440
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:01,800
See you next year.

2441
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,720
For us,

2442
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,920
Super Fresh Earth is my first regular show.

2443
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,240
What does blinking mean?

2444
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,120
What does that mean?

2445
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,000
What are you talking about?

2446
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,880
And then?

2447
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,480
Do you want me to translate for you now?

2448
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,760
Yes.

2449
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:16,600
Hello, uncle.

2450
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,440
Socks.

2451
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,640
Your new nickname is "Socks" now.

2452
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,560
Li Nai "Sock".

2453
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,600
You'll be "Uncle Sock" from now on.

2454
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,360
Do you remember this building?

2455
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,720
Li "Duke".

2456
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,320
I need to ask the butler.

2457
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,280
Duke Li, when did you buy this car?

2458
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,960
That, I really can't remember.

2459
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,120
Is that polite of you?

2460
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,760
Mic?

2461
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,440
Mic?

2462
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,520
How would I know you gave a hint if I didn't hear?

2463
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,600
Bro, this is your biggest

2464
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,840
contribution to our team.

2465
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,600
Surprised by what, lost what?

2466
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,480
Guess the idiom.

2467
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,440
For example, what?

2468
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,080
Right?

2469
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,080
Mine is called

2470
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,480
Li "Lai" Wen.

2471
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,440
Really.

2472
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,080
I'm coming!

2473
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,440
I can't wait to miss you all.

2474
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,720
I think this is strength.

2475
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,160
Because all of us

2476
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,000
put our strength together.

2477
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,040
And we share it with everyone.

2478
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,600
As for the rest of me,

2479
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,240
Brother.

2480
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:40,760
Why are you crying?

2481
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,480
It's all your fault.

2482
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,440
You cried too.

2483
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,320
The one playing "mother-in-law" is a bit fragile.

2484
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,560
Alright, although—

2485
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,560
Give him a close-up.

2486
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,440
Jun is about to cry.

2487
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,320
I didn't cry.

2488
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:51,800
Almost.

2489
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,240
Why cry? I didn't cry.

2490
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,040
I won't cry.

2491
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,040
Even though next season is next year,

2492
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,480
all of us

2493
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,800
I'm already starting to miss you.

2494
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,000
What are you doing, brother?

2495
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,800
Because I understand Naiwen best.

2496
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,080
He was outstanding even back in school,

2497
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,840
a serious performer.

2498
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,800
Serious.

2499
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,240
Artist type.

2500
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,640
Naiwen is a true artist.

2501
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,240
How do you see me as serious?

2502
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,160
The two of us actually

2503
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,200
can be here together.

2504
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:40,640
Yes.

2505
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,240
Ningning got it right.

2506
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,400
My wish at the wishing pool was

2507
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,680
to always be with Sun Honglei.

2508
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,760
"Yuwen".

2509
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,480
Still talking about math?

2510
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,120
What does that mean?

2511
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,720
Can you stop syncing with me?

2512
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,600
Why do I feel like the two of us

2513
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,360
are taking kids out to eat?

2514
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,440
A couple.

2515
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,760
Didi.

2516
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,560
Brother grilling for us is awesome.

2517
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,480
So great, thanks bro!

2518
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,600
This can be a screensaver too.

2519
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,240
That expression.

2520
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,800
Who wants to eat this?

2521
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,720
I will.

2522
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,160
Thank you.

2523
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,120
Yuning.

2524
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,440
Thanks, bro.

2525
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,400
So nice, bro.

2526
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,720
We have to be tied together.

2527
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,240
What is this thing?

2528
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,160
Anti-theft rope.

2529
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,640
Child anti-theft rope.

2530
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,040
You can't run away now.

2531
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:24,680
Right?

2532
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,240
That's kind of weird.

2533
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,440
One of a kind in the world.

2534
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,080
Only this one.

2535
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,520
I hope you never lose it.

2536
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,480
Not even when you move.

2537
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,080
Alright?

2538
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:32,720
Okay.

2539
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:33,600
Alright.

2540
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,160
What kind of taste is this?

2541
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,000
Is this okay?

2542
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,400
Birds of a feather flock together.

2543
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,480
People group by kind.

2544
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,600
That's why we quickly built

2545
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,640
such a strong bond.

2546
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,920
See you next year.

2547
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,760
Thank you all for sharing.

2548
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,680
It's an honor to be with you all

2549
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,680
and experience this perfect

2550
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:11,320
40°N Ultra-Fresh Global Journey.

2551
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,880
We started from Beijing,

2552
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,240
headed for Rome, the end of the ancient Silk Road,

2553
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,200
then returned to its origin, Xi'an.

2554
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,440
In these short two months of travel,

2555
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,240
we kept meeting new people,

2556
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,600
crossing paths and reuniting in time and space.

2557
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,920
And as time flowed,

2558
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,600
we created irreplaceable memories.

2559
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,760
One day,

2560
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,520
those who travel with us may leave.

2561
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,440
But the warmth and companionship we shared

2562
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,840
will move from the real world

2563
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,880
into our hearts and minds.

2564
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,000
Even if we're not together anymore,

2565
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,920
Through longing,

2566
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,680
we still have a warm place to go.

2567
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,480
A destination we can reach.

2568
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,800
Let’s embrace what’s real.

2569
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,920
Cherish life.

2570
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,760
Seize every moment in our lives.

2571
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,040
Build a palace of memories of our own.

2572
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,680
Finally, let’s shout our slogan one more time.

2573
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,960
Super Fresh Earth

2574
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,760
The world is right before us.

2575
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,440
Happy wrap!

2576
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,360
Naiwen.

2577
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,960
Love you all.

2578
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,360
Xiao Yuwen.

2579
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,480
Mizone, save me next year too!

2580
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,840
Mizone, help me!

2581
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,880
Come on, everyone.

2582
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,520
See you next year.

2583
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,440
See you next year.

2584
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,600
Help!

2585
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,720
What are you doing? Who?

2586
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,920
What are you up to?

2587
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,960
He’s definitely suspicious.

2588
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,440
What are you doing?

2589
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,080
Lin Yi.

2590
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,720
Run!

2591
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,320
Run, hurry!

2592
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,480
You’re doomed.

2593
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,120
You’re done for.

2594
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,040
You’re highly suspicious.

2595
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:11,960
You’re reckless.

2596
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,240
You played this round recklessly.

2597
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,120
At least one of you four is guilty.

2598
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,240
You two, stop blaming each other.

2599
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,240
That’s scary.

2600
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,640
Forget it, go with your gut.

2601
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,560
I know who it is.

2602
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:23,920
Please vote.

2603
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:25,840
Bro.

2604
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,520
You spin him around.

2605
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,040
Pull that side, I’ll pull this end.

2606
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,440
Okay.

2607
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,320
I’ll handle his belly.

2608
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,600
The meat fell out.

2609
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,520
Meat’s coming out.

2610
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,160
Spin.

2611
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,840
Why are you all in such a rush?

2612
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,560
I didn’t even get to spin.

2613
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,200
Alright.

2614
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,200
Spin, spin him.

2615
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,520
Let’s spin.

2616
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,160
Don’t.

2617
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,120
I’m still inside.

2618
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,000
I’m still inside.

2619
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,840
Let’s play a table Impostor game.

2620
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,560
After one round of dining,

2621
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,360
everyone reviews the round.

2622
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,200
Find the two who didn’t eat.

2623
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,800
What did you eat?

2624
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,960
Why would I tell you so much?

2625
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,080
Blame it on the moon.

2626
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,080
Seems a bit fake.

2627
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,600
I think so too.

2628
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,720
This is sung with a tongue in the mouth.

2629
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,360
Even if fate is full of hardship,

2630
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,760
Even if fate is full of twists and turns,

2631
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,880
Doesn’t this sound like singing with your tongue bitten?

2632
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,880
Not quite right.

2633
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,080
Stop, come back.

2634
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,000
It must be you two.

2635
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,480
What if it’s not us?

2636
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,560
Yuning and you.

2637
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,040
Exactly the same.

2638
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,200
I thought the same.

2639
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,480
I have a different idea.

2640
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,800
Alright, now this game is interesting.

2641
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,560
It’s really fun.
