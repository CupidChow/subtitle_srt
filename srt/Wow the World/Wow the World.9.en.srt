1
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,640
Here we go.

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,720
I'm Didi.

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,200
Hello.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,880
Hello to all the friends of "Earth Super Fresh".

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm singer and actor Liu Yuning.

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,360
This time, my trip

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,040
is to Italy.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
I've also gotten ready

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,040
some things for the journey.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,320
So today, I'll show you all

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,880
what I've prepared

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,400
for this trip.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,680
This suitcase has everything.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,080
Snacks, tasty potato chips,

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,360
rice crackers, things like that.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
Because honestly, I haven't really

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,280
traveled abroad before.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,800
The only time I went

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
was to the UK

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,600
to shoot a commercial.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,840
But I was only there for three days.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,880
And it was pretty closed off.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,480
I didn't get to walk around

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,080
or anything.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,120
So this time,

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,160
it's a completely new journey.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm really looking forward to it.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
But back then,

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,120
my biggest experience abroad was

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,880
actually not being used to the local food.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,920
At that time, we were looking everywhere

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,320
Find that Chinatown and get some jianbing guozi to eat.

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,240
So that memory

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,560
has always stayed in my mind.

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,360
So this time, I made thorough preparations.

38
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,960
I bought a lot of these snacks.

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,120
Including some of these,

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
some chili sauces we prepared,

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,960
and I hope that when the time comes,

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
if I can't get used to the food,

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,960
in my suitcase

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I can satisfy all my

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,120
food cravings.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Of course, I can also share them with

47
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,760
the friends going with me.

48
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,480
Besides these snacks,

49
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,000
I also prepared some small gifts.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,560
Like a little panda plush toy.

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
If I meet some cute kids,

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
I can give it to them.

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,880
There's also a little zongzi on it.

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,680
It's really cool.

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
Yeah, give the little panda to them.

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,360
This is a gesture of friendship.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,560
So

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,080
this box is filled with small gifts.

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,200
And some snacks as well.

60
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,320
I believe that for this trip, even though it's ten days,

61
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,240
the food for this trip

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
shouldn't be a problem.

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,760
And finally,

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
this suitcase

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,480
is actually my personal one.

66
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,760
This is my own suitcase.

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,320
It's packed with things I use daily.

68
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Inside here at the top is

69
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,160
sunglasses.

70
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
Because I have a bit of astigmatism,

71
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,240
my eyesight isn't great, I have astigmatism.

72
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,200
So when I go out,

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,520
I might wear sunglasses and such.

74
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
It makes my eyes look a bit bigger.

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Something I always bring on every trip

76
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
is definitely

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,040
a speaker.

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,520
And I always bring two.

79
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,840
I want to have that stereo sound experience.

80
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,320
So whether I'm putting on makeup

81
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
or in any kind of environment,

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,200
I always need

83
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,160
the company of a great musical atmosphere.

84
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,440
And this bag is for medicine.

85
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,520
There are some for the throat,

86
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,920
some for reducing internal heat,

87
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,040
some for colds, anti-inflammatory, and pain relief.

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
I'm pretty well prepared with all of them.

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,720
But actually, there's one thing

90
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
that I must bring every time I go out.

91
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,200
It's this little bag.

92
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
I can leave anything else behind,

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
but I have to bring this bag.

94
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,320
If I don't bring it, I get really anxious.

95
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,880
I feel very insecure.

96
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,240
That's right.

97
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,160
Inside here, I keep a lot of my

98
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,840
Beads, right?

99
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,720
This string is exactly this one.

100
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,200
Of course.

101
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,160
Actually, I wanted to prepare some gifts this time too.

102
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Things like these bead bracelets.

103
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,920
To give to my friends.

104
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,400
This one.

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
This is a star and moon bodhi bead.

106
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
And this walnut.

107
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,000
This is a toad head.

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
And this carved one.

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
I brought a pair of each.

110
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
And then there's this.

111
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,000
This really cool one.

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
This is a small gourd.

113
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
Yeah, you can tie it to your bag later.

114
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,880
So when I go out, I have to bring this bag of things.

115
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,640
I absolutely have to take it.

116
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
Otherwise, I will

117
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,760
I will get really anxious.

118
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,520
I must have this.

119
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,280
Something to hold in my hand.

120
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
To help myself relax.

121
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah.

122
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
This is for our new show.

123
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,080
I got my nails done again.

124
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Look.

125
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,200
This is a globe.

126
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,080
And here’s a lemon.

127
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,920
Pizza, ice cream.

128
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,760
And our manicurist

129
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
spent too long making a broken heart.

130
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
And this is

131
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,560
I think when I get there,

132
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,120
I hope every day will be sunny with white clouds.

133
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,279
And like a sailboat on the sea.

134
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
And the beach.

135
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,760
And the broken heart the manicurist spent a long time on.

136
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,880
Right?

137
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
"Earth Super Fresh," right?

138
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
There’s delicious food on Earth.

139
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
And beautiful scenery.

140
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,760
I think it’s about doing something for yourself,

141
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
to put yourself in a good mood.

142
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,280
When you see your nails,

143
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,360
you’ll think of our show.

144
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
It’ll remind you of our show.

145
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,680
That’s basically

146
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
the kind of happiness we want to bring everyone.

147
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,360
Freshness, happiness, sunshine, warmth.

148
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,440
Beaches and good food.

149
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,000
And then there are things like

150
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,600
shorts and T-shirts.

151
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,320
I think it’s just

152
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,600
besides what we just picked,

153
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,520
the clothes we wear on the show,

154
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,760
in daily life,

155
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,280
when I go back to my room, I wear comfortable clothes.

156
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Like regular shorts,

157
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,960
some plain white T-shirts, things like that.

158
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Just the clothes I wear at home every day.

159
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
And also,

160
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,080
everyone knows this about me—

161
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,840
must-have items.

162
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Things I always bring.

163
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
Like our

164
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,920
laptop,

165
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,440
my clothes,

166
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
and my toiletry bag.

167
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,600
That’s basically all I need.

168
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,320
So what else do we need to bring this time?

169
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,000
Because we're going abroad,

170
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
and we're filming a show, right?

171
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,920
I think it's not just for foreign friends,

172
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,560
maybe also for local Chinese people and such.

173
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
Some of our friends are there.

174
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
We can give them a small figurine as a gift.

175
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,040
This one is Jasmine.

176
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,400
And then,

177
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,720
and our

178
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,680
version of this

179
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,200
is also really cute.

180
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,520
This is

181
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,320
Nezha.

182
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,840
Because this one

183
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,880
really represents Chinese style.

184
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,160
So I hope this time

185
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,800
we can finish filming the show smoothly

186
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,240
and then enjoy

187
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
the beautiful scenery over there and everything.

188
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Hello, everyone.

189
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm Didi.

190
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,120
Today we're going to pack

191
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,920
and get ready to go to Italy

192
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,000
for "Earth Super Fresh."

193
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
I already have with me

194
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,280
some small things I always carry.

195
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,040
Let me pick three first

196
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,120
that I think are the most important,

197
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,160
the ones I absolutely can't be without.

198
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,440
If I don't bring them, I might

199
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
First and most important is my phone.

200
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,800
This is my phone.

201
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,160
My pink phone is here again.

202
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
It's very girly, right?

203
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,240
My earphones.

204
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,160
If I don't have them,

205
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,320
I would really feel a bit...

206
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
No.

207
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
And then there's these headphones.

208
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,760
This is my sleeping companion.

209
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,160
I also got it a floral pouch.

210
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
It goes with me everywhere.

211
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,680
First, there's my blanket.

212
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,480
Just smelling it helps me fall asleep happily.

213
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
It's this blanket.

214
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,160
These are

215
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,600
my travel essentials.

216
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Mainly, I also have some of my little camera bags.

217
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,080
They're my little tools for photography.

218
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,600
They help create a better atmosphere for everyone.

219
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,480
And I can take photos for my friends.

220
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,640
Because I've been writing songs lately,

221
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
writing lyrics and such.

222
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,520
I feel that writing on my phone

223
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,080
is a bit boring.

224
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
So sometimes I still need

225
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
the charm of writing by hand.

226
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,840
Let me show you a little.

227
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,040
This is my

228
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,920
very first

229
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,280
handwritten song lyrics.

230
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,320
But I won't show you.

231
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,960
And there's this adapter.

232
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,480
This was prepared by my dear staff.

233
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,240
They got it for me.

234
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,320
They told me I must mention

235
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,960
that he bought it especially for me.

236
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,040
This universal adapter.

237
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,080
So I have to talk about it.

238
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,520
Look,

239
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,880
each part is different.

240
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,720
Anyway, it works for everything.

241
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
I think it's really convenient.

242
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,120
It also has

243
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,720
a Type-C port

244
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
and a USB port.

245
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Impressive.

246
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,240
Not bad.

247
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,320
I'm going to do some crafts.

248
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,640
For some friends I'll meet in Italy.

249
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,400
So they can learn more about Chinese culture.

250
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,040
So I decided

251
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,840
to use these strings

252
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,800
to make some small Chinese knot pendants for them.

253
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,480
Okay.

254
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
I'll finish braiding it now.

255
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,840
Then I tied a snake knot here.

256
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
Finally, I made two phoenix tail knots.

257
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Then cut it off.

258
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
After that,

259
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,880
this edge

260
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,240
we'll use a lighter to burn it a bit.

261
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,680
It's a very cute little pendant.

262
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,840
All done.

263
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll make a few more in different colors.

264
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,560
I'll make them in bulk then.

265
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
Let's make ten.

266
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,600
All right.

267
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,039
Today

268
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,840
is the day before leaving for Italy.

269
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,799
These are the outfits I've already matched.

270
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,880
They're organized by my daily outfits.

271
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,760
They're all packed.

272
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,400
Since I'll be gone for ten days,

273
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
the amount is really a bit much.

274
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
And the dog isn't going.

275
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,640
It glanced at me sideways.

276
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Cotton.

277
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,920
Come here.

278
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,120
Are you going?

279
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,880
So you're not going?

280
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,680
You can stay home and play ball this time while we go abroad.

281
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,200
And then this one,

282
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,360
deserves a special introduction.

283
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,160
It's something I prepared for our trip

284
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
for some Italian friends we might meet.

285
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,200
It's a gift I prepared.

286
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,080
They all represent China quite well,

287
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,360
and some are small cultural items from Hubei.

288
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
Let me introduce this one first.

289
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
It's a gift from the Forbidden City.

290
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,320
This is very beautiful.

291
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a hairpin like this.

292
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
If we meet

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,560
an Italian lady who loves Chinese culture,

294
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
we can help her style her hair with it.

295
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
I think this one looks great.

296
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
This one is made of bamboo weaving.

297
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,560
A very delicate little phone charm.

298
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,480
Or you can hang it somewhere else.

299
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,200
You can hang it on your bag too.

300
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,920
A little bell.

301
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
This is a goldfish.

302
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,720
A little goldfish.

303
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,000
A little horse.

304
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,480
Earrings.

305
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
Bamboo-woven earrings.

306
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,000
A butterfly.

307
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,680
I think a fashionable country like Italy

308
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,200
would probably like these.

309
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Things with a touch of traditional culture.

310
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,320
And that can represent our China.

311
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,400
Artworks.

312
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,680
This box is bamboo weaving.

313
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,080
There are two more sets like this.

314
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
This is from the Hubei Provincial Museum.

315
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,160
This is a painted bronze mirror with a phoenix pattern.

316
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,600
From the Warring States period.

317
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,960
I really want to tell some Italian friends

318
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
about our China’s

319
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
long, profound, and ancient history.

320
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,760
This is from the Warring States period.

321
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
I don’t know if they understand

322
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,280
which year the Warring States period was.

323
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,840
I think I can use a translation app

324
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,560
to explain it to them.

325
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
I’ll prepare the information in advance.

326
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,760
It’s very beautiful.

327
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
It’s a

328
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,080
with the Hubei Provincial Museum’s logo on it.

329
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,200
A very beautiful mirror.

330
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,040
Isn’t it pretty?

331
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
And it also comes with a little comb.

332
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,440
Why does it look so good?

333
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,520
What do you want to eat?

334
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,120
Let's order.

335
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Oden.

336
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
Shredded pork with garlic sauce.

337
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,200
What else?

338
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
Braised pork.

339
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,120
Mapo tofu.

340
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,600
I think like this,

341
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
we just...

342
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
This one is definitely a favorite.

343
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,040
Let's get two of these.

344
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,400
Sichuan spicy style.

345
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,880
This one is good.

346
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,240
For making twice-cooked pork.

347
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,600
We can also get some braised pork.

348
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,400
Marinated seafood snacks

349
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
Oden

350
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
Kimchi soup

351
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,920
I believe this will be very popular.

352
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
Hot pot base

353
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,320
They're all semi-finished products.

354
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
Ready-made seasonings

355
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
The flavor packets are satisfying.

356
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,880
Bring some Wuhan hot dry noodles

357
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,080
for my Italian friends.

358
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,520
Buy Italian meat sauce pasta

359
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,800
and make semi-finished products in Italy.

360
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,040
Forget it.

361
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
That would be an insult to good food.

362
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
I want to try something fresh.

363
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,520
This won't work.

364
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
Because it's refrigerated,

365
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,760
I can't bring it.

366
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,040
Sorry, guys, you won't get to taste it.

367
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,840
I can only bring you

368
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
this hot pot.

369
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
I've prepared the hot pot sesame sauce for you.

370
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,160
Alright.

371
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,160
Let's leave it at that.

372
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,520
I think I'm being pretty sincere, right?

373
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,640
So you'll make hot dry noodles for everyone, right?

374
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
No, I won't.

375
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,880
Alright.

376
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,760
All done.

377
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,520
Shopping is finished.

378
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,240
Packing up.

379
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,960
What are these two big suitcases for?

380
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,120
Of course, they're for our upcoming departure.

381
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
For the filming of "Earth Super Fresh."

382
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,920
This suitcase has my clothes in it.

383
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
Inside this suitcase

384
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,960
there are lots of secrets.

385
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,800
I'll open it and show everyone.

386
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,680
Let's open this one first.

387
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,040
What's on this side?

388
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,120
This side has my pajamas and hats.

389
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
And all my clothes are in this suitcase.

390
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
There are things like face masks and skincare products.

391
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,200
And also this.

392
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,960
This is a scented sachet for foreign friends.

393
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,160
It's a traditional Chinese gift.

394
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm planning to bring it along.

395
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
This side

396
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
This side is a bit more special.

397
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,880
Why is that?

398
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,960
Because what's on this side is...

399
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,720
Half a box of snacks

400
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Everything I brought is from Sichuan and Chongqing

401
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Some snacks with Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan specialties

402
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
There are chili peppers

403
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,880
These are the potato chips I loved as a child

404
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
I brought a few bags

405
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Why bring potato chips

406
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,480
It's because

407
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,360
I couldn't fill this side

408
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,960
So I used potato chips to fill the space

409
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,360
And this is

410
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,000
This is from my parents

411
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
Beef they sent me from Chengdu

412
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Beef tallow

413
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,200
No, that's not right

414
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
Beef tallow hot pot base

415
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,040
It's especially delicious

416
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,200
And very fragrant

417
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
If we go to Italy

418
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,560
If you guys aren't used to the food

419
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,920
We can use this to make hot pot

420
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,960
And there are also some dried tofu snacks

421
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,440
This is Sichuan-style dried tofu

422
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
This is also dried tofu

423
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,080
Dried tofu

424
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Some side dishes to go with rice

425
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the side dish I used to eat as a kid

426
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Both of these are good with rice

427
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,360
What do you think

428
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,480
Half a box full of snacks

429
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
This should be enough, right

430
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
Going to Italy to film for ten days

431
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,160
This is definitely enough

432
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,680
I really prepared a lot

433
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,920
It's very thorough

434
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,000
First of all

435
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,160
Let me show you this.

436
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,440
These are socks.

437
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
Going for ten days.

438
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,880
So I prepared ten pairs of socks.

439
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,280
Because last time,

440
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,920
didn't we lose the game?

441
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,560
After we lost,

442
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,840
I had to wash their socks.

443
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,800
I ended up washing everyone's socks.

444
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,240
So the time I spent washing their socks

445
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,440
took up all my time.

446
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
As for my own socks,

447
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
I decided I definitely wouldn't wash them.

448
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,840
But

449
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
I need to learn to use

450
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,680
tools.

451
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,080
This is a sock-washing machine.

452
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,200
I promised to wash their socks for them.

453
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,280
But I never said what I had to use to wash them.

454
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,080
Right?

455
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
A sock-washing machine is really important.

456
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm so clever.

457
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,080
These

458
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
are some things I brought

459
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,520
as small gifts representing intangible cultural heritage.

460
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,680
Let me show you.

461
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,680
What are they?

462
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,640
Before,

463
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,960
I was always touring with Tang Xu from our class, performing "Night Walker".

464
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,120
One of its signature elements

465
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,680
is the lion dance.

466
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,520
So for my Italian friends,

467
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,240
I brought

468
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,960
our traditional Southern-style lion.

469
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,800
It's pretty nice, right?

470
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Peking opera masks.

471
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,480
Even if these masks look a bit strange to you,

472
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,760
let me tell you,

473
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,320
they're completely handmade.

474
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,920
They're also made by Zhao Miao, the director of "Night Walker,"

475
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,120
whose father collected stones from all over the world

476
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,560
and then painted them himself.

477
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,240
Impressive, right?

478
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,560
You can't buy these anywhere.

479
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,520
They're one of a kind.

480
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,480
I brought two boxes.

481
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,440
They're for the lucky Italian friends.

482
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,680
Let me tell you,

483
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,080
I

484
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,920
really take care of every little detail.

485
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,280
Is it easy being the big brother?

486
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,400
If you travel with me,

487
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,280
you'll definitely benefit.

488
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
I have the typical mindset of an old-fashioned dad.

489
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,920
When my daughter grows up and goes out in the future,

490
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,840
what should I do?

491
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,520
She'll need this whole set too.

492
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
Basically, I thought it through.

493
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
This is an anti-theft phone strap.

494
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,120
This thing prevents

495
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,240
accidentally dropping your phone in the toilet sometimes.

496
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,080
It's easy to drop it in a squat toilet.

497
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,480
If the hole is a bit bigger,

498
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,720
the phone will fall in and you can't get it back.

499
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,760
This prevents that.

500
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,200
You can fish it out.

501
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Just wash it and you can still use it.

502
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,560
Many phones are waterproof now.

503
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
This is an anti-theft vest.

504
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,240
I've looked into it.

505
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,480
The main thing is, it has lots of pockets.

506
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
I suggest to everyone,

507
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,280
if you go out, wear it inside out.

508
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,360
Doesn't it look pretty good?

509
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,680
It's okay, right?

510
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,480
Yeah, it's fine.

511
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,200
Wear it inside out.

512
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Then put your passport inside.

513
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
And just a little cash.

514
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Like a few dozen yuan.

515
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
Just enough to spend.

516
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
The main thing is the passport.

517
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,720
You can't lose your passport.

518
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,120
You can't lose your phone.

519
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,760
If you lose your phone and passport, you can't go anywhere.

520
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,240
This is the really useful part.

521
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,920
Let me tell you,

522
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,280
this has never failed me.

523
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm fine.

524
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,079
Back when I didn't have kids,

525
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,960
I used to travel all the time.

526
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
When I was in a new place,

527
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,760
I'd use my bank card to rent a bike.

528
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,359
Just rent one.

529
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
One of those shared bikes on the street.

530
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
I'd carry a black plastic bag like this.

531
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,119
With a green onion inside.

532
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,200
Letting the tip stick out a bit.

533
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,400
So it looked like I was grocery shopping.

534
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,720
But it was just a single green onion.

535
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,800
This one's a bit thick.

536
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,079
I think just one

537
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,560
or one and a half is enough.

538
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,120
Because it's a bit heavy to carry.

539
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,880
Right?

540
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,960
And the smell is pretty strong, isn't it?

541
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,560
As for the rest, take a look.

542
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I put things in here like

543
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,000
for example, my passport.

544
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,520
Right?

545
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,320
I put my passport inside.

546
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,440
And my phone.

547
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,960
Miscellaneous items

548
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
Cash

549
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
Put the cash in this small bag

550
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,880
This is still a bit see-through

551
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,000
If it's see-through, use two plastic bags

552
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,280
Double layers

553
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,560
Then no one will know what's inside

554
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,680
People usually assume it's paired with green onions

555
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,640
A single green onion

556
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,640
Or things like tomatoes, potatoes

557
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
And so on

558
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,880
When you carry it

559
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,840
No one will think you're a tourist

560
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,280
They'll definitely think you're a local Chinese resident

561
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
I think this suits Wang Yuwen better

562
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
And also Gong Jun, these two kids

563
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
These two kids usually like to look good

564
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,720
Let's talk when we meet

565
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,040
Anyway, everything is arranged for them

566
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,760
In my heart

567
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,680
I'm worried

568
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,720
There's another approach that's second best

569
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,840
Just put the green onion here

570
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,680
Cloth bag

571
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
But I think it's a bit much for a guy to carry a cloth bag like this

572
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
It's a bit pretentious

573
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,760
Usually girls

574
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
Yuwen can do it

575
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
When you open it

576
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,280
Put this in

577
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Just put it inside

578
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,000
Still let two green onions show

579
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
It's just green onions

580
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,760
Right?

581
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
Put some coins here

582
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,960
Then sling it over your shoulder

583
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,040
You look good.

584
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,440
Even with such a shabby bag,

585
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,480
you still look great.

586
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
There's just nothing I can say.

587
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,360
Top-level thinking.

588
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,800
Second-tier thinking.

589
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,000
Men's and women's styles.

590
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,800
Alright, that's the end of the introduction.

591
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,240
So this time, it's also

592
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,120
my first time traveling so far away.

593
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,240
And for such a long time.

594
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm embracing all the unknowns.

595
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,880
Not speaking the language,

596
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
and being unfamiliar with the place.

597
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,480
But with a group of familiar friends,

598
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
going to a new place,

599
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,680
I want to experience what it's like.

600
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,760
So this ten-day trip

601
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,240
is something I'm really looking forward to.

602
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,760
Of course, I hope you all

603
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,120
can join us from our perspective

604
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,920
and feel it together.

605
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,840
This incredibly fresh place on Earth.

606
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,520
Alright?

607
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay.

608
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Then I'll pack up.

609
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,120
And we'll head out.

610
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,000
That's it.

611
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Off to Italy!

612
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,480
Bye!

613
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,320
We're heading to Italy now.

614
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,080
See you in Italy.

615
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,680
We're about to go abroad and have fun!
