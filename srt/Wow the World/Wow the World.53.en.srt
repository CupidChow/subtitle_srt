1
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,120
Barcelona's food markets

2
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,720
are much more than places to buy groceries.

3
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,760
They are deeply woven into the fabric of the city.

4
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,120
They have become

5
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,320
iconic cultural symbols here.

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,920
They serve locals' daily shopping needs,

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,200
and also attract tourists

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,640
who want to experience the lively local atmosphere.

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,960
They're must-visit spots.

10
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,160
You look great today.

11
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
I'm just wearing the show’s T-shirt.

12
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,800
You think I look good?

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,200
Yeah.

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,720
Black suits you.

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,360
You look classy.

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,000
Jing, you look good today.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,280
Your style has improved these days.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Those slippers of yours,

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,480
they're something else.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,400
Why did you come in slippers?

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
I just came down from upstairs.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
I was too lazy to change shoes.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,640
To let everyone experience Barcelona’s market culture,

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
tomorrow’s breakfast will be made by everyone.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
You have to go out and buy the ingredients yourselves.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
But this market

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,080
is only open from 7 to 10 in the morning.

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Morning market.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Seven o’clock.

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,520
Might as well skip breakfast.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,520
Seven in the morning.

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
We’ll have to get up around six.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,400
Right.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
For each round today, we’ll pick one person.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,840
You don’t have to.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,400
You don’t have to.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,920
No need to look.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I’ll assign someone from the group.

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,080
No need to say anything.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,560
Not necessarily.

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,000
Not necessarily.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,360
Let’s go.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,600
First task.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,560
Everyone will split into groups of three.

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,520
In each team,

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
the first person uses words

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,960
to direct the second person’s movements.

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
to act out the motions.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,560
The second person

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
must use the poses

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,520
to guess the answer.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,760
Then pass the guessed answer

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,920
to the third person.

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,680
You can only use words during this process.

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
No gestures allowed.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,200
Each turn is limited to 100 seconds.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
No acting out.

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Wait, my bro’s about to hold a concert!

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,880
Go back.

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah.

61
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
Just shouting.

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,680
Remember,

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,400
our questions are all

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
combinations of a person and an event.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,640
So, it’s about who is doing what.

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,520
Okay.

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,360
Based on the number of correct words,

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,040
we’ll rank the three teams.

69
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,200
The three members of the last team

70
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
will spin the wheel

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
to decide who will be the breakfast chef.

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
This is tough.

73
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,080
Whatever.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
No more explanations.

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,520
Let’s start right away.

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,920
You don’t even need headphones.

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,000
Just speak Cantonese.

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
You’re about the same.

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,240
Physical encryption.

80
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,400
Right.

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,840
Yuning too.

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Yuning’s about the same.

83
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
No.

84
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
I’ll post one when I get back.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
A Cantonese mini album.

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Let's split into groups freely.

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
Can I pick Jin Jing?

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,600
Sure.

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,520
Xingxu, the three of us, okay?

90
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,880
Okay.

91
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,440
Lin Yi, let's be a team.

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Alright.

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,040
You pick someone.

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,400
Xuxu.

95
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,600
Take a look.

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,640
Look.

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
He hasn't put on his headphones yet.

98
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,240
He can't hear what others are saying.

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,000
What did they say?

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
We picked Xuxu.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
You guys can fight over it.

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
So who's left?

103
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,640
Didi.

104
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright.

105
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm sitting next to you.

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,000
You're the strongest.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
You're the strongest.

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
Are my shoes not shiny enough?

109
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Or what?

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,080
Who am I teamed up with?

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,840
With me.

112
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,080
Let the next person decide.

113
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,800
Okay, I'll team up with Yu Ning.

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,560
Let's go.

115
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,680
Alright, you guys go first.

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
You guess the second one, okay?

117
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
I'll guess the second one.

118
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,640
Are you sure?

119
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,399
Bro.

120
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,280
Alright.

121
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
Let Jin Jing arrange it.

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
Jin Jing is smart.

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,840
Okay, go ahead.

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,720
This is hard.

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,080
Okay.

126
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,320
Done.

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,160
Alright.

128
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
Seven characters.

129
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,200
One, two, three.

130
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,760
Four, five, six, seven.

131
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Seven characters.

132
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,240
Seven characters.

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,160
One, two, three.

134
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,840
One, two, three.

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
Yes, the first three characters.

136
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
The first three characters.

137
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Right.

138
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
Squat down.

139
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,360
Squat down.

140
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,720
Yes.

141
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,760
Walk.

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,640
Walk.

143
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,080
Correct.

144
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
Guess, three characters.

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,120
Three characters.

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Try again.

147
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
Which three characters are these?

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Three characters.

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
Three characters.

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes.

151
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,240
Three.

152
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Squat and walk.

153
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
Right, what is it?

154
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,640
Dog?

155
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,320
Tall.

156
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,280
Really tall.

157
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,440
What kind of dog?

158
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,440
No.

159
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,640
It's a person.

160
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,040
No.

161
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,800
It's you.

162
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,880
Me.

163
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,320
Yes.

164
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Squat and walk.

165
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,200
I squat and walk.

166
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Yes.

167
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,400
What is it?

168
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,160
When I squat and walk, it's...

169
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,240
I squat down.

170
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
What does it mean when I squat and walk?

171
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,680
Okay, stand up.

172
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,840
Stand up.

173
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Stand up.

174
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Stand up.

175
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,320
Tall.

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Tall.

177
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,960
Tall.

178
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,440
Tall.

179
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Yes.

180
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,800
Squat down.

181
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,320
Squat down.

182
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
Squatting down is...

183
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,640
Low.

184
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,920
Short

185
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,600
Yes

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Yes

187
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Short

188
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,600
Yes

189
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
Third character

190
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,040
Third character

191
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,800
You are a

192
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,040
You are a

193
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,080
Stand straight

194
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,880
What are you

195
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm a person

196
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes

197
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,480

Correct.

319
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
Yes, seven characters, correct.

320
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
This isn't seven characters either.

321
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,280
Seven characters.

322
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,280
Big fly bird.

323
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
There's one more character.

324
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
I couldn't guess it.

325
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Can't guess anymore.

326
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
I didn't get it.

327
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,680
Didn't get it.

328
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah, I think that's enough.

329
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,240
I think that's enough.

330
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,160
We'll definitely score points.

331
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,520

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,280
Li Naiwen.

339
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,240
How did the guessing end up on me?

340
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
No, I'm just lip-reading.

341
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,120
Nice, that's awesome.

342
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,360

347
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,560
I don't know the last character.

348
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,640
It even rhymes.

349
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
Our team is definitely going to win.

350
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,800
I think so.

351
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,720
If we had more time,

352
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,160
I could've guessed the rest.

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,640
Come on.

358
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,880
These heels are way too high.

359
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,760

360
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,880
Speak Cantonese.

361
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,440
Maybe that's better.

368
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,560
Rong Mama lies down.

369
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
You can't say "Rong Mama."

370
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
Just let him act it out.

371
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,680
Okay.

372
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,280

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,440
Are you teaching him or is he teaching you?

380
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,040

381
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,240
Raise your hand.

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,040
Raise your hand.

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,200
Me.

390
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,240
Didn't even guess the Chinese right.

391
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,920
Let others guess in English.

392
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Money.

393
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,080
Money gesture.

394
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Money gesture.

395
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,120
Finger.

396
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,840
Okay.

397
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,240
Okay, yes.

398
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,160
Keep that gesture.

399
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,680
My finger.

400
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,800
Down.

401
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,280
Shake it.

402
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,280
Stab downward.

403
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,680
Not up and down.

404
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,520
It's forward and backward.

405
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,760
Stab.

406
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,080
Stab.

407
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,160
That's it.

408
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,600
Not the top one.

409
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,320
Neck up.

410
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
Put that hand down.

411
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,880
Put it down.

412
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,760
This hand.

413
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,440
Stab downward.

414
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Stab downward.

415
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Look forward.

416
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,320
Down.

417
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
Down.

418
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
Forward and up.

419
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,440
Down.

420
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,720
Down.

421
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,240
Down.

422
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,360
Down.

423
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Right.

424
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Squat down.

425
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,600
Squat down.

426
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,240
Squat down.

427
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,120
Poke.

428
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,560
Poke.

429
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,960
Poke.

430
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
That's right.

431
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,840
Okay.

432
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,720
Poke back and forth.

433
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,440
Poke back and forth.

434
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,880
What's wrong?

435
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,520
Let's leave it at that.

436
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,160
The last four characters.

437
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
The last four characters.

438
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,440
The last four characters.

439
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,080
The first three characters.

440
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,000
The first three characters.

441
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,600
That's enough.

442
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
Hurry, we're out of time.

443
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,960
No time left.

444
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,480
Say it.

445
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,200
First three.

446
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,840
The first part is fine.

447
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
Don't say the first three characters yet.

448
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,640
That's enough.

449
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,840
The first three characters.

450
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,040
Finished.

451
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
The first three characters are already fine.

452
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,280
The first three characters are fine.

453
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,600
Right.

454
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,480
The last four words

455
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,800
Sleep

456
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Sleep

457
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,360
Sleep, you sleep

458
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Sleep

459
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,920
Now

460
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,480
Sleep

461
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,200
Now

462
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,040
Lie down and sleep

463
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,600
Lie down and sleep

464
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,080
Sleep

465
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,480
What does "spread out" mean?

466
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,840
Sleep

467
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,520
Stand up, upright

468
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,760
Wait a moment

469
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,720
Hurry

470
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,320
Stop bothering the veteran artist, seriously

471
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
Lie down

472
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Lie down

473
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,720
Lie down

474
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,560
Quick, lie down

475
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,120
No time left

476
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,520
Wait a moment

477
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
Sleep

478
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,000
Sleep, right?

479
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,960
Lie flat

480
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,920
Lie flat

481
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Lie flat

482
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Impossible

483
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,400
Impossible

484
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
Lie flat

485
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Lie flat

486
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,040
Lie flat

487
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,320
Sit up

488
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,800
Sit up

489
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,000
Zombie

490
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,560
Lie down

491
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,560
Lie down

492
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,040
Lie down

493
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,440
Sit up

494
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Sit-up

495
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,440
Yes

496
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,040
Right?

497
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,680
Okay

498
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,800
No

499
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,520
The first three words

500
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,520
That's enough

501
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,480
Time's up

502
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,200
Time's up

503
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,440
That's enough

504
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,440
It's a person

505
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,400
Who is this?

506
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Didi knows

507
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Didi knows

508
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,080
She knows

509
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,280
She knows

510
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,160
She definitely knows

511
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,120
Just do the actions

512
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,520
Okay, go ahead, Didi

513
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,400
Seven words

514
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,120
Seven words

515
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
One, two, three

516
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,320
One, two, three

517
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,520
Four, five, six, seven

518
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
Four, five, six, seven

519
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,640
Sit-up

520
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
Sunny zodiac

521
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,680
Sunny zodiac

522
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,640
Sit-up

523
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,760
A very sunny zodiac

524
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,520
Leo

525
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,480
Sit-up

526
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,520
Makes my heart flutter

527
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,760
Lie down

528
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,320
Squat down

529
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,360
Up

530
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,320
Sit-up

531
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,720
The first three words

532
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,760
Squat down

533
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,440
Squat down

534
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,160
Stretch out your hand

535
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,320
Stretch out your hand

536
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,200
One finger

537
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,960
One finger

538
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,840
One finger

539
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,000
This is

540
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,440
This is the most classic

541
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,160
Finger

542
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,520
Finger

543
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,000
Poke

544
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,760
Poke

545
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,400
Head

546
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,560
Poke

547
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,040
Spit

548
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,800
Finger

549
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,280
Finger

550
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,640
Poke

551
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,320
Jab

552
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,920
Jab

553
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,560
Who is this?

554
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Who is this? Who are you?

555
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,280
He doesn't know

556
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,720
Think, just think

557
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Try to guess who this is

558
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,000
Leave the question to her

559
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,599
Who is this?

560
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,520
Stand up

561
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,200
Who?

562
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
Who?

563
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,240
Is it one person?

564
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,800
Who's doing sit-ups?

565
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,640
Is that right?

566
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,280
What did you say?

567
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,960
It's just someone doing sit-ups

568
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,079
Yes

569
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,800
Poke

570
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,760
Stab

571
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,120
Who

572
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
Think about it, is that okay?

573
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,680
Do I know who she is?

574
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,320
Do I know this person?

575
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
I don't know who it is

576
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
You don't know who it is

577
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,760
Okay

578
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,440
Time's up

579
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Please give your answer

580
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,200
Li Naiwen doesn't know who it is either

581
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,600
This is really hard

582
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,560
Actually, this is really hard

583
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,880
Sun Honglei doing sit-ups

584
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
How did you think of Sun Honglei?

585
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,520
Because Leo is a sunny sign

586
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,080
I thought Sun Honglei is a Leo

587
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,000
Rong Mama doing sit-ups

588
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,920
Rong Mama is hard to guess

589
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
That's impressive, really impressive

590
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,000
That's really good

591
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,400
This one is really tough

592
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,280
Rong Mama

593
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm third

594
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,720
You're third, I'm second

595
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay

596
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
Who do you want as the third person?

597
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,920
The third one

598
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,240
Okay, I'll do it

599
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you want to switch someone?

600
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,640
We can't let Jin Jing, Jin Jing is our

601
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,360
main force

602
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,240
Lin Yi, go up

603
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,400
Lin Yi

604
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,040
Doesn't seem like a good thing

605
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,560
I trust you

606
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,760
Trust me, it's fine

607
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,040
It's okay

608
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,400
The two of us

609
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Let's work together well

610
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,840
It was just us two yesterday

611
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,760
who lost

612
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,920
Don't worry, leave it to me

613
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,880
It's fine

614
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,560
Is it hard?

615
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,280
But also simple

616
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,080
Okay

617
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,040

Seven characters, okay

622
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
Are the first three characters a name?

623
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,760
First one, two, three, four, five

624
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,600
Five-character name, okay

Stop

637
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,480

647
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,320
All your moves look like "murder"

648
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,920

Louder

667
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
Open your mouth wider

668
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,320

672
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120

That's it

680
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
Blow some air at him

681
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,920
Here comes the wind

682
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,880
Who are you?

683
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,360
There's wind

684
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,080
There's wind

685
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,600

There's wind

688
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,720
What do you mean by "there's wind"?

689
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,240
There's wind

690
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,040

There's wind

695
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,400
What's this for?

696
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,120
How would I know what I'm doing?

697
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,320
What's going on?

698
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,840
Stick out

Don't move

712
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,480
Stick it out, hold it

713
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,080
Are you messing with me?

714
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,720
You're messing with me

715
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,840
No

716
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,640
Really, that's it

717
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
I want to switch partners

718
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm not

719
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
I have no idea

720
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,960
That's it, let's go with this

721
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,480
Let's go with this

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,040
Who is this?

723
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,600
Think about it, just think

724
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,040
Think about it

725
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,400
I feel so proud when I see Lin Yi

726
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,720
Send them the address

727
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,960

Okay

733
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,960
That's so unprincipled

734
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,240
Easy to negotiate

735
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,400
Make a fist

736
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640

Thrust at him, poke him

743
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,360
We already said that

744
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,920
Open your hand

745
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,520
Hold it

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Okay, that's good

757
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,440
Xiao Yi

758
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,680
My description was pretty accurate, right?

759
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,600
Very accurate

760
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,160
Think about it

761
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,400
That's right

762
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,840
Think about it

763
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,320
Something like someone fencing

764
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,800
Right?

765
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,960
Right leg

801
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,760
Mudskipper

802
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,320
Right leg

803
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,560
The one on the beach

804
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,160
Right leg

805
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,120
Stretch it out

806
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,000
Stretch it out

807
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,560
Right leg

808
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,640
Leg

809
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,680
Stretch out

810
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,080
Stretch out

811
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,480
Stretch out

812
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:02,920
Stretch

813
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
Yes

814
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,400
Okay

815
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,040
Hold it

816
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,440
Okay

817
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,960
Hold it

818
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,320
This is getting abstract

819
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,960
Blowing wind, right?

820
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,200
Yes, wind

821
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,760
Yes

822
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,800
Wind, there's wind

823
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,360
Name

824
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,760
Yes

825
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,240
Wind

826
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,760
Who is this person?

827
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,560
Rukawa Kaede

828
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,360
Rukawa Kaede

829
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,920
One, two, three, four, five

830
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,360
Five characters with "wind"

831
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,120
Do you know?

832
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,080
I don't know either

833
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
You don't know either

834
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
But the action is correct

835
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,520
The action is right

836
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,200
Are you messing with me?

837
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,200
He doesn't know

838
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,360
Okay

839
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,400
You can't say okay

840
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay

841
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,240
Six, seven

842
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,000
Six, seven

843
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,960
Hand

844
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,360
Hand

845
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,760
Hand

846
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,120
Grip tightly

847
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,040
Just say the answer

848
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,120
He can't hear

849
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,600
Stab

850
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,520
Madame Rong

851
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,680
Fencing

852
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,840
Stab, fencing

853
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,360
Fencing

854
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:07,920
Strike

855
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,040
Happy fencing

856
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Intense fencing

857
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,080
Okay

858
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,920
Six, seven, fencing

859
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,320
Yes

860
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,440
And the ones before are

861
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,600
One, two, three, four, five

862
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,520
Five

863
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,880
Five

864
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,840
Time's up

865
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,200
Okay

866
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,040
He Ge, please give the answer

867
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
First, there's a

868
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,600
A guy fencing

869
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:32,920
Right?

870
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,280
And blowing wind

871
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,360
Blowing wind

872
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,280
There's wind

873
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,000
Marilyn Monroe

874
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,520
Amazing

875
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
I still haven't figured it out

876
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,720
You're awesome

877
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,240
You made a comeback

878
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,320
How are you so good?

879
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
They got the highest score

880
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
This was brilliant

881
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,080
He Ge's group has seven characters

882
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,760
He Ge's group has seven characters

883
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Honglei Ge's group has four characters

884
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
Naiwen Ge's group has four characters

885
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,040
Second place

886
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,280
So there's no third place?

887
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,440
Let's play rock-paper-scissors

888
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
Just that

889
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,760
Jingjing and Didi

890
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,040
Rock-paper-scissors

891
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,240
Paper

892
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
So it's our group, right?

893
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:46,800
Yes

894
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
I already used my "nuclear weapon"

895
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,200
I had Lin Yi come up

896
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,800
I don't want green.

897
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,360
Okay.

898
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,880
How about yellow for you?

899
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,240
Alright.

900
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,960
Let's see who can escape this fate.

901
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,960
Let's find out.

902
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,880
Wake up at 4 a.m. tomorrow.

903
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
Now it's changed from 4 a.m.

904
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
Wake up at 5 a.m.

905
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,200
Who has to wake up at 5 a.m.?

906
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,040
Bro, don't let it land on me.

907
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,320
Here we go!

908
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,280
Li Naiwen.

909
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,000
Li Naiwen.

910
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,040
Let's congratulate Li Naiwen.

911
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,640
He'll wake up at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

912
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
And buy groceries and cook for everyone.

913
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,560
Thanks, bro.

914
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,600
Thanks, bro.

915
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,640
Thank you, bro. Thanks.

916
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,280
Thanks to Uncle Naiwen, Yi and I dodged a bullet.

917
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,360
Thank you, Wen.

918
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,120
King of service.

919
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
Seriously, it's fate.

920
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
Let's take a short break.

921
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,360
Let's take a short break.

922
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,040
Next, we'll pick the second lucky person.

923
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Let's eat.

924
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,240
Smells delicious.

925
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,480
I want to lose some weight today.

926
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,160
You should eat less.

927
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
You're going back for a concert.

928
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,800
Yeah.

929
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,200
Then skip the carbs.

930
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,560
Have some protein.

931
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,080
Okay.

932
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,960
Then I'll have some pasta.

933
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,960
I really want to try it.

934
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,560
After all that, you just say—

935
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,320
Have a bite of pasta.

936
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,720
Is it good?

937
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,120
It's good.

938
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,720
Will you lose weight doing concerts?

939
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,960
I don't know.

940
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,440
I haven't done a concert in six years.

941
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,440
I've been acting these past few years.

942
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,040
I'll go back after I achieve something as an actor.

943
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,880
Then I'll return.

944
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,760
You're amazing.

945
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,840
I was waiting for you to praise me.

946
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
Xiao Yi is really great.

947
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,360
Send me a few clips.

948
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,760
Of the shows you acted in.

949
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,480
The ones you think you did well in.

950
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,400
Sorry.

951
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,360
No need to be shy.

952
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,240
Alright.

953
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,520
Most of my roles are—

954
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,640
Mostly romantic ones.

955
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,080
TV dramas.

956
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,640
Really?

957
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,200
I used to play students.

958
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,040
How old are you?

959
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,960
Twenty-six.

960
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,080
Do you really love acting?

961
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes.

962
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,920
I was shy as a kid.

963
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,120
Much more introverted than now.

964
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,920
Then I took acting classes in college.

965
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,720
They had me read a passage—

966
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
Lines from a play.

967
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,160
An angry scene.

968
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,080
You have a nice voice.

969
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,680
Not really.

970
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,080
It felt great after performing.

971
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,680
That kind of emotion.

972
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,440
I never had the chance as a kid.

973
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,040
To express it.

974
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,200
That's when I started to love it.

975
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,520
I get it.

976
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,560
The burp comes before the person.

977
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,080
Here he comes.

978
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,400
He Ge is here.

979
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,000
Let's try something different today.

980
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,800
We'll have a healthy meal.

981
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,480
Don't worry.

982
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
Tomorrow morning will be healthy too.

983
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,520
Will tomorrow's breakfast be too healthy?

984
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,160
Nothing else to eat.

985
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,080
Only healthy food.

986
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,480
Thinking about something.

987
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
What should we order later?

988
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,520
If you dare let me cook,

989
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,640
I'll do it.

990
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,080
Should I cook?

991
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,680
Go ahead.

992
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
Why wouldn't we dare?

993
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:00,960
Exactly.

994
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,680
After eating his breakfast tomorrow,

995
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,080
we'll have to book tickets home in the afternoon.

996
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,080
Maybe we won't even make it back.

997
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,800
Once Yuwen returns,

998
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,640
only Li Naiwen will be left.

999
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,800
I'll be standing at the door.

1000
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,440
You're back.

1001
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,400
Come on, let's eat.

1002
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,120
Time to eat.

1003
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,280
I'll have something light.

1004
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Chicken soup with clams.

1005
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,880
With whom?

1006
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,240
Chicken soup with clams.

1007
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,400
It's a famous dish from Fuzhou.

1008
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,440
It's called Xishi Tongue.

1009
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,960
I want Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

1010
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
I'll make it for you.

1011
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,920
Manchu-Han Imperial Feast

1012
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,920
You mentioned the Manchu-Han Imperial Feast.

1013
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,280
You’re like this,

1014
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,040
You’re the Manchu-Han Imperial Feast.

1015
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,240
Name twenty dishes for me.

1016
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,880
Then I’ll cook them for you.

1017
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,360
Li Naiwen can do that, right?

1018
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,640
He can list the dishes from the Manchu-Han Imperial Feast, right?

1019
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,760
I forgot too.

1020
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,120
Look,

1021
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,040
Steamed lamb

1022
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,720
Steamed bear paw

1023
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,400
Steamed bear paw

1024
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,920
This one,

1025
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,320
Steamed deer tail, roasted duck

1026
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,120
Roasted duck, roasted goose

1027
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Braised pork, braised duck, soy sauce chicken, cured meat

1028
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
Preserved egg with pork belly, soy sauce pork, cured meat, sausage

1029
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,960
Did you memorize this before?

1030
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,480
Yes, I did.

1031
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
How was Xingxu’s lines at school?

1032
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,240
He was probably pretty good.

1033
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
He was fine at school.

1034
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,320
Because we practiced early in the morning.

1035
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,560
But people from Shenyang,

1036
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,720
I think it’s hard for them to change their Mandarin accent.

1037
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,680
Look at Wang Jinpeng in your class,

1038
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,520
His whole life,

1039
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,040
Like Wang Qianyuan,

1040
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,560
Just like Wang Qianyuan,

1041
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,400
He can’t change it his whole life.

1042
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,680
Still has that Shenyang accent.

1043
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
But he thinks

1044
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,520
his Mandarin is very standard.

1045
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,240
Just like Liu Yuning,

1046
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,680
He thinks

1047
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,120
his Cantonese is perfect.

1048
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,000
Not at all.

1049
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,560
Now I get it.

1050
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,800
Actually, it’s hard for southerners to speak Mandarin.

1051
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,760
Yeah, because we mix up front and back nasal sounds.

1052
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,360
Front and back nasal sounds.

1053
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,800
And then,

1054
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,760
For Northeasterners, the hardest is distinguishing flat and raised tongue sounds.

1055
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,960
That “who’s framing whom” line,

1056
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,200
Right.

1057
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
Who’s framing whom?

1058
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,440
There’s a line before that.

1059
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
Who’s really the gangster?

1060
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,280
Who’s framing, who’s setting up?

1061
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
Who’s really the gangster?

1062
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,840
Who’s framing, who’s setting up?

1063
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,000
That’s good.

1064
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,000
No problem.

1065
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,240
Taxi driver

1066
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,080
Can any of you say it?

1067
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,800
No.

1068
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,120
Bro, I just want fried eggs tomorrow, nothing else.

1069
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,840
Fried eggs.

1070
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,880
I don’t want them fully cooked.

1071
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,200
You mean runny yolk, right?

1072
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,920
The runny yolk kind.

1073
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,560
Fried eggs.

1074
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,840
I’ll eat them.

1075
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,440
Eight fried eggs.

1076
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,560
Li Naiwen

1077
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,440
I really want to eat eggplant.

1078
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,240
Lin Yi wants some too.

1079
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,840
First choice is roasted eggplant.

1080
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,199
Roasted eggplant.

1081
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,280
Second,

1082
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,520
If you can’t make roasted eggplant,

1083
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
Just stir-fry some eggplant.

1084
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,280
Stir-fried eggplant.

1085
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,040
With some rice.

1086
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,239
Bro,

1087
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:15,760
Perfect match.

1088
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,480
Eggplant is what I dislike the most.

1089
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,520
Didn’t you say that yesterday?

1090
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,280
I was afraid if I said

1091
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,080
I dislike eggplant the most,

1092
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,280
they’d make me an eggplant feast.

1093
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,520
We’re almost done eating, right?

1094
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,719
Let’s move on to the second task.

1095
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,199
Okay.

1096
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,480
Come on.

1097
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,800
Sit down.

1098
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,400
I just discussed with Liu Yuning.

1099
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,880
He said he wants to make Yangtang, lamb soup.

1100
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,560
That's great.

1101
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,360
Is it okay to have lamb soup?

1102
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,000
Sure.

1103
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,880
I think that's awesome.

1104
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,120
Let's buy it.

1105
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,280
But the thing is,

1106
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,080
Does Spain have lamb heads?

1107
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,920
I'll go with Li Naiwen tomorrow.

1108
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Is that okay?

1109
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,520
It's fine, bro.

1110
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,960
You'll probably get your turn soon.

1111
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,639
No need to volunteer now.

1112
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,320
What do you mean?

1113
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,440
It just looks better to volunteer now.

1114
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,800
Finally won a day.

1115
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,000
What's this?

1116
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Dessert.

1117
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Anyone want dessert?

1118
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,880
Two desserts.

1119
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,560
The one always talking about dieting.

1120
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,680
Eating now is fine for me.

1121
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,600
Thanks.

1122
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,920
Pineapple.

1123
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,360
I'll take a piece too.

1124
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,800
Three servings.

1125
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,120
What is this?

1126
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,800
It doesn't look tasty.

1127
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,760
Li Naiwen.

1128
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,440
Have a piece.

1129
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,520
No, thanks.

1130
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,080
Thank you.

1131
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,480
No.

1132
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm really not into sweets.

1133
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,440
Great.

1134
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,240
Grilled.

1135
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,360
Grilled pineapple.

1136
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,560
Grilled pineapple.

1137
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,880
I'll try one.

1138
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,040
Give it a taste.

1139
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,440
Move aside.

1140
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,160
You just said next to me

1141
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,400
you have no interest in dessert.

1142
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
Now you're reaching for it.

1143
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,560
It doesn't look good.

1144
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I'm really not interested.

1145
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,120
Grilled pineapple.

1146
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,000
Let me have a bite.

1147
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,440
Try a bite.

1148
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,000
Never had grilled before.

1149
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,360
Five seconds ago you said next to me

1150
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
you have no interest in dessert.

1151
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Then you reached for my dessert.

1152
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,000
Do you still want some?

1153
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Get one for Jin Jing.

1154
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,560
Thanks for the effort.

1155
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,360
Do you want some?

1156
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Let's eat together.

1157
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,560
Okay, you go first.

1158
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,080
Want to eat together?

1159
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,120
I'll eat one right now.

1160
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,720
Alright, go ahead.

1161
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Let's split into two groups by seats.

1162
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,880
We'll do a brain challenge.

1163
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Explain it to us.

1164
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,000
A thinking game.

1165
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,360
Darn it.

1166
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,000
That's your strength.

1167
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,920
I have no brains.

1168
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm just a big dummy.

1169
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,160
Strong body, simple mind.

1170
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,840
This task

1171
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,000
is called "Who is the One?"

1172
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,000
You two teams

1173
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,640
will take turns as the questioning team and the observing team.

1174
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,360
The questioning team gets four cards each time.

1175
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,920
Only one card has a name as the answer.

1176
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,440
The observing team guesses by watching.

1177
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,160
Who in the questioning team got the name card.

1178
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,920
The questioning team

1179
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,280
gets a point if they guess the name within fifteen questions.

1180
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,240
They earn one point.

1181
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,600
The observing team

1182
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,680
gets a point for guessing who has the name card.

1183
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
They also get one point.

1184
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,600
The team that uses fewer questions each round

1185
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,240
gets an extra point.

1186
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,280
The losing team

1187
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
must send one member

1188
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,960
to be the breakfast chef.

1189
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Let's try it ourselves.

1190
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,400
Let's give it a go.

1191
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,720
Let's start right away.

1192
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,560
When two armies meet, the brave wins.

1193
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,720
Bro, if it's your turn again this round,

1194
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,200
you'll be making breakfast two mornings in a row.

1195
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,160
We won't lose.

1196
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,160
We only play when we're at a disadvantage.

1197
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,320
Let's go all out against them.

1198
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,680
Are you afraid of them?

1199
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,200
Come on.

1200
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,040
Let's go.

1201
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,680
Just charge in.

1202
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
We're not scared of them.

1203
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,120
Bring it on.

1204
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,120
Don't worry.

1205
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,600
You are

1206
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
the big winner.

1207
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,120
Wearing this outfit,

1208
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,560
you're the big winner.

1209
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,840
You win big, everything's great.

1210
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,040
Big win.

1211
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,160
All good.

1212
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,440
All good.

1213
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:03,760
All good.

1214
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,040
No, it's not.

1215
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,280
Yes.

1216
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,160
Mine is

1217
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
this one.

1218
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,960
Your group,

1219
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
after everyone draws a card,

1220
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,120
this is

1221
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,840
so united.

1222
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,080
Listen to me.

1223
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,240
Listen up.

1224
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,080
The four of us are a team.

1225
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,480
Only one of us

1226
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,560
has a word on their card.

1227
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
The person with the word

1228
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,320
has to pretend they don't have it.

1229
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,840
Basically, they have to fool us.

1230
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,680
Then we ask them questions.

1231
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,440
They answer yes or no.

1232
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:47,840
In the end,

1233
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,120
after we guess what it is,

1234
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,440
the other four have to guess

1235
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,440
which one of us had the word.

1236
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,840
See?

1237
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,160
You're awesome.

1238
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,000
Go ahead.

1239
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,040
Excuse me,

1240
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,280
is it a person's name?

1241
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,200
This game is about

1242
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,840
guessing names.

1243
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,080
Yeah.

1244
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,280
That's right.

1245
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,480
That's one question. Okay.

1246
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,200
Bro,

1247
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,680
you spent ages explaining the rules,

1248
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
but your cleverness only lasts three seconds.

1249
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,680
He definitely has the word.

1250
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,280
I'd say there's a sixty percent chance, in my opinion.

1251
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
How many characters is it?

1252
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,800
Is it three characters?

1253
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,680
What's the name?

1254
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,800
We all have to know this person.

1255
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,640
Yes.

1256
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,280
Next question.

1257
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,400
No, I'm not the question mark.

1258
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,160
I don't want to compete with players at this level.

1259
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,680
Okay?

1260
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,040
Winning wouldn't even be fun.

1261
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,800
Is it a celebrity?

1262
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,280
Yes.

1263
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,080
Is it a woman?

1264
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,520
No.

1265
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,440
Is it a male celebrity with two characters or less in his name?

1266
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,360
No.

1267
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,160
Then it must be three characters.

1268
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,840
Xingxu, are you practicing your lines?

1269
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,160
You keep moving.

1270
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,040
No, I'm just thinking.

1271
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,760
It probably isn't Xingxu, right?

1272
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,520
Xingxu.

1273
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,400
Xingxu looks like a blank slate this round.

1274
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,840
His face has gone pale.

1275
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,680
He's already...

1276
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,360
Is he famous for acting?

1277
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,120
Yes.

1278
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,520
Yes.

1279
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,280
Is he from mainland China?

1280
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,400
Yes.

1281
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,280
Yes.

1282
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Is he from the north?

1283
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,760
Yes.

1284
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,160
Is he from Northeast China?

1285
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,080
No.

1286
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,320
Or maybe...

1287
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,240
Is he...

1288
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Is he from Shaanxi?

1289
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,200
No.

1290
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,880
We could ask about northern Shaanxi.

1291
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,360
Is he an artist from east of Beijing?

1292
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,800
What?

1293
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,160
East of Beijing?

1294
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,840
Are we trying to reveal this artist's...

1295
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,160
...home address now?

1296
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
Is he from that certain neighborhood?

1297
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,760
Is he from Beijing?

1298
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,320
No.

1299
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,080
You have two questions left.

1300
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,800
If anyone knows, just say the name.

1301
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,360
No.

1302
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,280
Does anyone here know this person's name?

1303
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,800
Someone does.

1304
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,120
I can't tell at all.

1305
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,680
That's exactly right.

1306
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,160
So who is it?

1307
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,000
We need to figure this out.

1308
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,160
Don't hide it completely.

1309
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,480
Don't make it too hard to guess.

1310
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,320
Your team feels like...

1311
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,720
...a bunch of blank slates.

1312
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,840
Was he born in the 1980s?

1313
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,160
Yes.

1314
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,080
Yes.

1315
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,240
Alright, that's settled.

1316
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,600
Now we've narrowed it down.

1317
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,920
But that's still a lot of people.

1318
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,280
You have to guess this person's name.

1319
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,800
Honestly, I have to say...

1320
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,320
Those four are hiding it pretty well.

1321
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,840
To be honest...

1322
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,360
It's just this game.

1323
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,440
The four of you who know the answer...

1324
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,760
It's not about hiding yourselves.

1325
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,880
You need to let your teammates know who you have.

1326
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Everyone say a name.

1327
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,680
Then we'll pick the one we think is right.

1328
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,000
In the end, I'll say which one.

1329
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,120
Who did you say?

1330
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,200
You have to say it.

1331
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,400
At least you'll get one point.

1332
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,000
Wang Baoqiang.

1333
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,720
Otherwise, you get no points.

1334
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,800
Xuxu said Wang Baoqiang.

1335
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,240
Wang Baoqiang.

1336
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,240
Yes.

1337
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,400
Come on.

1338
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,040
One, two, three.

1339
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,880
Go.

1340
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,760
It's Xuxu.

1341
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,240
Because he mentioned Wang Baoqiang.

1342
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,200
Yes.

1343
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,480
Xingxu was overloaded just now.

1344
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,080
Right?

1345
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,360
I couldn't help it.

1346
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,280
If it were you...

1347
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,520
How would you guide them?

1348
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,280
Tell me.

1349
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,120
Is it a man?

1350
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,760
Yes.

1351
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,400
Is he a friend of one of us?

1352
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,520
Yes.

1353
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I have a lot of friends.

1354
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,160
Is it a celebrity with three characters in their name?

1355
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,120
No.

1356
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,320
Then it must be two characters.

1357
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Two or four characters.

1358
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:56,640
Deng Chao

1359
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:56,880
Deng Chao

1360
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,200
Li Chen

1361
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,120
Lu Han

1362
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,640
Deng Chao

1363
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,000
Lu Han

1364
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,360
Li Chen

1365
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,960
How do you know it's a celebrity?

1366
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,440
Is he a friend of one of us?

1367
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,120
Wang Mian

1368
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,840
A friend doesn't have to be a celebrity.

1369
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,840
He even knows our regular friends.

1370
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,080
It's possible.

1371
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,640
My neighbor's second aunt

1372
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,480
He even knows her name.

1373
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,240
Is it He Ge's friend?

1374
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,520
Yes.

1375
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,800
Basically, yes.

1376
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,560
This makes us look silly.

1377
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,560
Narrow it down more, ask again.

1378
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,240
Is he married?

1379
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,680
You can ask if he's married.

1380
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,280
Is he married?

1381
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,720
Is he married with kids?

1382
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,040
Yes.

1383
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,160
They're so smart over there.

1384
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,880
Is he married?

1385
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,000
That's a great question.

1386
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,400
Is he married?

1387
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,920
Does he have kids?

1388
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,640
Is he from "Wu Ha"?

1389
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,120
Yes.

1390
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,200
Two characters, has kids.

1391
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,840
Just say it.

1392
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,320
Go ahead.

1393
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,720
Let's ask together.

1394
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,680
One, two, three.

1395
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,320
Is it Deng Chao?

1396
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:57,920
Yes.

1397
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,240
I guessed it.

1398
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,600
Let's guess who's famous.

1399
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,320
Forgot. Darn it.

1400
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,240
Is he a friend of one of us?

1401
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,120
Is it someone from "Wu Ha"?

1402
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,120
Jin Jing

1403
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,880
Then it's Jin Jing.

1404
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:13,760
Jin Jing

1405
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,760
Just a gut feeling.

1406
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,520
Have you all decided?

1407
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,160
Yes.

1408
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,360
No.

1409
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,080
Who is it?

1410
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,880
Who is it?

1411
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,360
He hid so well.

1412
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
He, that's Chen He.

1413
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,800
Chen He

1414
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,240
Chen He

1415
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:31,880
Yes.

1416
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,480
The moment I said Deng Chao

1417
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,080
Was everyone...

1418
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,360
So happy.

1419
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,480
Deng Chao

1420
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
We're awesome.

1421
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,480
We need to stay calm this round.

1422
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,680
We must stay calm.

1423
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,080
Relax.

1424
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,400
Stay calm.

1425
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,440
Relax.

1426
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,840
You were too relaxed just now.

1427
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,640
I think...

1428
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,240
Amazing. Is it a person's name?

1429
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,440
Male or female?

1430
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,080
Male.

1431
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,160
Is he married?

1432
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Not married.

1433
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,560
Single.

1434
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,800
Male, single celebrity.

1435
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,760
Male, single celebrity.

1436
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,400
There are many.

1437
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,160
Yes.

1438
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,800
Is he from our Earth Team?

1439
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,080
Yes.

1440
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,000
A single male artist from the Earth Team.

1441
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,480
Alright, then...

1442
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,520
Then...

1443
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,080
We can guess it in less than ten tries.

1444
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,080
Can I guess?

1445
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,960
It's just Lin Yi, Chen Xingxu, and Liu Yuning.

1446
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,760
As of now...

1447
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,360
There's also Gong Jun.

1448
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,240
Is it a three-character name?

1449
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,080
No.

1450
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,720
Two characters.

1451
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,080
Gong Jun and Lin Yi, just these two.

1452
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,960
Gong Jun, it's Gong Jun.

1453
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,720
Let me ask.

1454
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,480
Is it Gong Jun?

1455
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,120
Yes.

1456
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,360
How many questions was that?

1457
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,640
No.

1458
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,320
That's not right.

1459
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Doesn't the first team get to ask more questions?

1460
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:01,880
Yes.

1461
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:04,760
Liu Yuning.

1462
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,600
Are you sure?

1463
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:06,960
I'm sure.

1464
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,240
No.

1465
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,400
Chen He.

1466
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:16,840
Yes.

1467
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,320
I thought you were amazing just now.

1468
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,400
If it was you...

1469
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,160
You're so bold.

1470
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,640
No.

1471
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,160
So bold.

1472
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,440
We just have good chemistry.

1473
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,320
Didi is incredible.

1474
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,800
The Earth Team just got smaller.

1475
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,800
How can we win?

1476
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,440
Answered in four questions.

1477
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,160
No, I think the way you played this round...

1478
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,920
It's called the "dignity round."

1479
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,160
Even if you lose, you lose with style.

1480
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,080
You've already fired them up.

1481
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,640
What questions should we ask?

1482
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,840
Anyway, ask how many characters in the name.

1483
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,920
Now it's obvious.

1484
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,280
I'm telling you, it's definitely an artist, right?

1485
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,080
And then?

1486
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,160
Ask about gender.

1487
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,320
Ask about occupation.

1488
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
Let's make a bet.

1489
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,920
We have to make a comeback.

1490
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,160
Comeback.

1491
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,160
Come on.

1492
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Let's go, comeback!

1493
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,000
Comeback!

1494
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,240
Comeback!

1495
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,760
Go all out.

1496
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,120
Is it a man?

1497
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes.

1498
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,520
They really...

1499
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,000
I thought...

1500
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,720
They'd ask something clever.

1501
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,600
Is it a three-character name?

1502
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:29,840
No.

1503
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,960
Two characters.

1504
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,000
Now, occupation.

1505
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
After I ask about occupation, you guess right away.

1506
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,880
Okay.

1507
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,720
Is it "World Stopped"?

1508
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,880
Yes.

1509
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,400
Is it a variety show?

1510
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,120
Yes.

1511
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,480
Who is it?

1512
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,160
Can I say He Jiong?

1513
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,120
Yes.

1514
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,240
Yes.

1515
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,880
You can say it.

1516
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,240
Yes.

1517
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,240
He Jiong.

1518
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,440
Yes.

1519
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,080
This...

1520
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,800
That's Honglei.

1521
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,880
What's there to say about this?

1522
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,960
I finally made a comeback, awesome!

1523
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,440
Then I think it's Honglei.

1524
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,160
Then it's Honglei.

1525
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,160
It's definitely Honglei.

1526
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,840
Based on these clues...

1527
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,560
It's only Honglei.

1528
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,120
No.

1529
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,120
I suggest we split into teams like this from now on.

1530
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,320
Let’s always divide this way.

1531
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,200
We’re going head-to-head with them.

1532
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,880
Feels great.

1533
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,800
This is the real “God’s eight seconds.”

1534
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,920
“God’s four seconds.”

1535
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,080
Then I think it’s Li Naiwen.

1536
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,120
Li Naiwen.

1537
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,080
Li Naiwen.

1538
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,280
Yes, it’s Li Naiwen.

1539
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,360
It’s the variety show Li Naiwen asked about.

1540
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes.

1541
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,360
That’s definitely me.

1542
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,000
It must be me.

1543
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,160
That was epic.

1544
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,520
We’ve already blown up the planet.

1545
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,400
Let’s play another round.

1546
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,880
Let’s do a hell-level challenge, okay?

1547
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,640
Let’s go.

1548
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,600
This is what we’re competing on.

1549
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,120
Okay.

1550
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,760
The strongest minds.

1551
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,320
Compete.

1552
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,600
Come on, not convinced.

1553
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,080
It’s not about being unconvinced now.

1554
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,160
Crush them.

1555
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,720
Let’s play rock-paper-scissors.

1556
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,920
To decide who goes first, okay?

1557
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,040
Lin Yi, go.

1558
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

1559
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,200
Rock, paper, scissors.

1560
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

1561
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,760
Do you want to go first or second?

1562
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,400
We’ll go second.

1563
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,560
Second but better.

1564
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,120
I’ll ask first.

1565
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,400
Is it male?

1566
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:58,840
No.

1567
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,440
I’ll ask about the number of characters.

1568
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,120
That hell-level challenge.

1569
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,320
Could it be four characters?

1570
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,320
I don’t know, guess.

1571
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,320
It’s possible.

1572
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,520
Is it four or more characters?

1573
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,240
Yes.

1574
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,680
Dilraba, Gulinazha.

1575
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,160
Wait.

1576
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,120
Dilraba isn’t four characters.

1577
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,600
I think it is.

1578
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,640
Siqin Gaowa.

1579
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,400
Hell-level.

1580
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,760
Could it be someone who’s not Chinese?

1581
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,280
Like someone foreign.

1582
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,800
No, don’t think about foreigners yet.

1583
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,560
Think of Chinese first.

1584
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,880
Is it someone from Xinjiang?

1585
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,840
Could be.

1586
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,480
Is it from Xinjiang?

1587
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,080
Is it from Xinjiang?

1588
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,160
Yes and no.

1589
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,200
That makes it a bit tricky.

1590
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,800
Could it be not an entertainer?

1591
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,360
Not an entertainer.

1592
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,600
Is it a historical figure or character?

1593
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,600
Immortal.

1594
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,840
Yes, immortal.

1595
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,720
Like the Queen Mother of the West.

1596
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,320
Is it a real person?

1597
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,040
No.

1598
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,360
Immortal.

1599
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,680
Princess Iron Fan.

1600
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,720
Who?

1601
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,520
Princess Iron Fan.

1602
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,280
Great Sage Equal to Heaven.

1603
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,880
Female.

1604
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,600
Female.

1605
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Princess Iron Fan.

1606
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,360
So where is Flaming Mountain?

1607
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,560
Just ask directly.

1608
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,160
Okay, is it Princess Iron Fan?

1609
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,200
Yes.

1610
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,240
It’s not you, right?

1611
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,200
Let’s point to someone.

1612
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:30,920
Jing Jing.

1613
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,280
Sister Jing.

1614
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:31,760
Jing Jing.

1615
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,960
I advise you to think carefully.

1616
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,480
No need to think.

1617
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,560
Seriously, think carefully.

1618
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,200
No need to think.

1619
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,440
Your actions gave you away.

1620
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:40,400
No.

1621
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,880
No.

1622
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,240
That feels great.

1623
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,560
Wait a second.

1624
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,200
Give them another chance.

1625
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,840
Come on.

1626
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,800
Guess again.

1627
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,160
Liu Yuning

1628
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:57,600
Yes.

1629
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,040
Go ahead.

1630
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,800
No, what are they laughing at?

1631
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,600
What are you all so happy about?

1632
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,000
No idea.

1633
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,280
No, what are they happy about?

1634
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,920
We admit defeat.

1635
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,480
We're amazing.

1636
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,080
I think we should get ready to face

1637
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
some hell-level questions now.

1638
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,160
Let's do it.

1639
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,160
Lin Yi is getting a bit nervous. Lin Yi,

1640
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,280
Lin Yi is really nervous now.

1641
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,880
Lin Yi is a little nervous.

1642
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,520
Is it a man?

1643
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:39,800
Yes.

1644
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,240
Is it a real person?

1645
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:43,640
No.

1646
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,800
Qitian Dasheng

1647
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,480
Princess Iron Fan versus Qitian Dasheng

1648
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,520
Those two could have a fight.

1649
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,360
It's Qitian Dasheng, trust me.

1650
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,120
It really is Qitian Dasheng.

1651
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,560
Is it three characters?

1652
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,440
Yes.

1653
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,000
No.

1654
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,840
Is it from the Four Great Classics?

1655
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,200
Male.

1656
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,960
Is it from the Four Great Classics?

1657
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,720
Okay.

1658
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,200
Is it a character from the Four Great Classics?

1659
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,600
Yes.

1660
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,240
Then it's

1661
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,200
from Journey to the West.

1662
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,680
The Four Great Classics.

1663
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,080
Right?

1664
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,480
There are three more in the Four Great Classics.

1665
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,360
Three.

1666
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,680
One is Water Margin.

1667
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,640
One is Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1668
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,680
One is Dream of the Red Chamber.

1669
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,200
So basically,

1670
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,600
Maybe you younger ones don't know much about them.

1671
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,200
It's basically Journey to the West.

1672
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,880
Journey to the West is really popular.

1673
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,240
Yeah, so let's guess Journey to the West.

1674
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,160
Journey to the West.

1675
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,840
This analysis is

1676
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,280
totally correct.

1677
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,680
Dunce.

1678
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,280
Dunce.

1679
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:41,760
Journey to the West.

1680
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,120
The most iconic is Sun Wukong.

1681
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,360
Right?

1682
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:43,960
Sun Wukong.

1683
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,240
Then there's Bull Demon King.

1684
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,320
Zhu Bajie.

1685
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,000
Zhu Bajie.

1686
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,680
Sha Monk.

1687
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,160
Related to Princess Iron Fan.

1688
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,680
Connected to Princess Iron Fan.

1689
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,480
That's Bull Demon King.

1690
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,760
Bull Demon King.

1691
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,880
Want to take a guess?

1692
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,200
Sure.

1693
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,880
Who do you think it is?

1694
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,360
Is that okay, Lin Yi?

1695
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,560
Everyone's asking you.

1696
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,280
Is Bull Demon King okay?

1697
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,560
The other three all say Bull Demon King.

1698
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,240
Just listen to them.

1699
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,680
Don't ask about Bull Demon King.

1700
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,200
Then let's not ask about Bull Demon King.

1701
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,400
It's definitely not Romance of the Three Kingdoms, right?

1702
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,440
Not Journey to the West.

1703
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,320
Water Margin.

1704
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,480
Dream of the Red Chamber.

1705
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,040
I've never read Dream of the Red Chamber.

1706
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,400
Then it's Water Margin.

1707
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,200
Alright, Lin Yi, stand up.

1708
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,720
See, it's three characters.

1709
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,880
What's his profession?

1710
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,640
Like Wu Dalang.

1711
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,360
Wu Dalang.

1712
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,320
Wu Dalang.

1713
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,080
Let's take a wild guess.

1714
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,920
Let's make a guess.

1715
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,520
We...

1716
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,680
Wu Dalang

1717
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,240
Yes.

1718
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,520
How did you guess that? No way.

1719
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,240
Really?

1720
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,560
Seriously?

1721
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,240
It really is Wu Dalang.

1722
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:06,840
It's Wu Dalang.

1723
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,960
You're amazing.

1724
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,560
Who do you think it is?

1725
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,520
Let's guess the least likely one.

1726
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,000
Pick the least likely.

1727
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,200
Lin Yi

1728
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:12,760
Guess Lin Yi.

1729
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,640
Yes.

1730
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,560
The score is now 4 to 6.

1731
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,640
That's normal.

1732
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,840
Lin Yi has done really well.

1733
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,280
But...

1734
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,800
And we didn't cheat.

1735
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,160
We're almost hurting inside.

1736
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,320
How did I even think of Wu Dalang just now?

1737
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,080
Seriously, even I can't believe I thought of Wu Dalang.

1738
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,080
It's mainly because of you.

1739
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,840
You guessed it right away.

1740
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,920
I couldn't even make something up.

1741
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,560
No, I saw your eyes light up.

1742
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,360
I said Wu Dalang.

1743
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,320
Come on, spin the wheel.

1744
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,240
So, who spins?

1745
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,720
You spin.

1746
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,000
If I spin, it won't land on me.

1747
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,280
Spin it like this.

1748
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,240
Li Naiwen

1749
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,440
Li Naiwen

1750
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,520
Li Naiwen

1751
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,680
Li Naiwen

1752
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,760
Li Naiwen

1753
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,920
Li Naiwen

1754
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,760
Li Naiwen

1755
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,640
Quick, someone take a photo for the memory.

1756
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,160
This is too much.

1757
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,760
Take a photo for me as a keepsake.

1758
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,160
Come on.

1759
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,160
Uncle Nai, go over there.

1760
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,760
Why do I need a photo here?

1761
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,760
What are you doing?

1762
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,640
Why do you need a keepsake?

1763
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,680
Just a photo.

1764
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,120
We're like a family of three.

1765
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
The daughter squats here.

1766
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,160
Yeah, the two of us stand.

1767
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,320
That's ridiculous.

1768
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,160
Is it really this ridiculous?

1769
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,040
Naiwen

1770
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,200
Around 6:30

1771
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,400
Let's head to the market.

1772
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,480
Mizone, save me.

1773
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
Naiwen, it's fine if you lost.

1774
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,840
Just go grocery shopping in the morning.

1775
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,600
Can you handle it or not?

1776
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,880
I'm not in shape right now.

1777
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,800
Don't be so negative.

1778
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,880
Let Mizone help you get your energy back.

1779
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,200
So refreshing.

1780
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,400
Let me try.

1781
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,600
I really feel recharged.

1782
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Mizone is back.

1783
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,080
Let's try a harder challenge this time.

1784
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,640
Mizone returns for the challenge.

1785
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,040
Stand on one leg.

1786
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,840
Toss the Mizone bottle under your leg.

1787
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,000
Keep your leg up and balance the Mizone.

1788
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,360
Succeed and win a Mizone supply pack.

1789
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,560
Stand up.

1790
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,800
The variety show gods are with me.

1791
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,240
Let me try.

1792
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,360
Here we go.

1793
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,840
Second try.

1794
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,280
Go.

1795
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,000
So close.

1796
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,680
Still going strong.

1797
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,440
Let me try again.

1798
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,440
Let the energy star help Li Naiwen.

1799
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,520
Give him a Mizone supply pack.

1800
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,600
Stay energized with the energy star.

1801
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,800
Get ready for more challenges on the journey.

1802
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,840
Hug.

1803
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,400
It's him.

1804
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,160
It's him.

1805
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,160
That's him.

1806
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,880
Our friend, Li Naiwen.

1807
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,200
Morning sunlight

1808
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,120
I'm not alone

1809
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,800
You're not alone

1810
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,720
You have me, right?

1811
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,000
I can help carry things

1812
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,880
I can't cook

1813
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,560
But I can carry stuff

1814
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,080
Xingxu

1815
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Through this

1816
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,640
I realized

1817
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,880
Seriously

1818
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,560
No comparison, no disappointment

1819
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,840
Such a good kid

1820
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,120
Maybe you should go yourself

1821
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,520
Such a good uncle

1822
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,040
No comparison, no disappointment

1823
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,720
Really

1824
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,880
Italian breakfast

1825
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,160
Is it rich?

1826
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,600
Aren't we in Spain, bro?

1827
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,960
I'm just so sleepy, really

1828
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,560
My soul is still in bed

1829
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,160
Have you decided what to buy?

1830
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,440
No idea

1831
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,480
Lamb head

1832
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,320
Wait, let me write it down

1833
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,800
Lamb chops

1834
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,160
Pork

1835
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,440
Honglei wants roasted eggplant too

1836
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,040
Eggplant

1837
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,120
Green pepper

1838
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,920
Scallion

1839
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,680
Garlic

1840
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,760
Eggs

1841
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,960
Let's get these first

1842
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,680
What do we have at the homestay?

1843
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,280
There are a few pigs at the homestay

1844
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,040
They're sleeping

1845
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,360
Let's go home

1846
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,080
Hello

1847
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,800
Coriander

1848
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,360
Chili

1849
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,040
Add some green pepper

1850
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,200
Nice, this one's good

1851
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,160
This scallion is great, it's good

1852
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,760
Looks good

1853
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,240
Lamb soup is super energizing

1854
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,480
I'm passing the baton, bro

1855
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,680
I have no clue about cooking

1856
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,480
It's fine

1857
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,480
Before making the Yangtang, take this first.

1858
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,000
Sauté the meat a little.

1859
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,360
Fry it in its own fat.

1860
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,360
Once the lamb fat comes out,

1861
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,520
the soup will turn out whiter.

1862
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,480
Why does it smell so good?

1863
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,760
So handsome.

1864
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,880
There you go again.

1865
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,360
Liu Yuning.

1866
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,760
How can you be like a "god" sometimes,

1867
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,760
and so homely at other times?

1868
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,600
How can a man be this perfect?

1869
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,360
Thank you.

1870
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,880
How do you make it smell so good?

1871
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,560
Liu Yuning, is there anything you can't do?

1872
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,440
Tell me.

1873
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,720
This is all I know.

1874
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,520
How do you look so good even in an apron?

1875
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,440
The stove is so low.

1876
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,160
Doesn't your back hurt, bro?

1877
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,440
Smells amazing.

1878
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,320
Did you start stewing the lamb head?

1879
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,560
This Yangtang smells incredible.

1880
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,080
He was just frying the lamb.

1881
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,040
Do we have a frying pan?

1882
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,440
Yes.

1883
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,160
You want to fry eggs, right?

1884
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,080
Fry eggplant.

1885
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,720
Frying eggplant? Yes.

1886
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,800
Let me help.

1887
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,320
Morning.

1888
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,160
A strong helper is here.

1889
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,200
Here, let me do it.

1890
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:38,800
The strong helper has arrived.

1891
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Come on, let's work.

1892
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,040
Eggplant.

1893
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,320
What's wrong?

1894
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,160
You look like you're facing a big enemy when you see eggplant.

1895
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,960
Like facing a big enemy.

1896
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,200
Do you hate eggplant?

1897
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,440
Peel it.

1898
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,440
Okay.

1899
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,280
There's still the Yangtang and the eggplant to handle.

1900
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,360
Still need to deal with the Yangtang and eggplant.

1901
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:51,840
Right.

1902
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,720
We put eggplant in every dish.

1903
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,360
I don't eat eggplant.

1904
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,720
But you must've tried it at least once to know.

1905
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,600
You don't eat it, right?

1906
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,360
No.

1907
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,840
I was just born hating it.

1908
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,360
Just born that way.

1909
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,640
When I was little, my sister thought I was faking it.

1910
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,360
She wanted to see what would happen if I ate eggplant.

1911
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:11,880
And then?

1912
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
She made dumplings with eggplant filling.

1913
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,040
She told me it wasn't.

1914
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,120
I tasted it right away.

1915
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:16,960
Didn't taste it.

1916
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,720
Because there was meat inside.

1917
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,600
She didn't put much in.

1918
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,600
But I still ate some.

1919
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,960
She just wanted to know if I

1920
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,200
would react if I ate it.

1921
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,240
Alright.

1922
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,520
Do you usually cook at home?

1923
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,760
Yes.

1924
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,680
You cook too, right?

1925
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,320
But what I make is just

1926
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,800
as long as it's edible.

1927
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,400
I usually just boil chicken breast.

1928
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,600
So there's not much skill involved.

1929
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,840
Fitness meals, right?

1930
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,400
Yeah.

1931
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,800
Is the Yangtang ready?

1932
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,080
It's ready.

1933
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,120
Now it needs to stew.

1934
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:43,840
How long?

1935
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,960
About an hour.

1936
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,000
Save a bowl for Wen.

1937
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,440
When she arrives tomorrow,

1938
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,240
just heat it up for her.

1939
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,040
Okay.

1940
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,360
It's already got that aroma.

1941
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:56,960
Smells great.

1942
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
To be honest,

1943
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,320
it's already delicious.

1944
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,200
It's ready to eat.

1945
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,840
Tasty.

1946
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,160
So good!

1947
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,160
Will the three of us

1948
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,880
finish this whole pot?

1949
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,680
How much did you spend today?

1950
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,520
Sixty or seventy euros.

1951
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,520
How much is that in RMB?

1952
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,600
Not sure, let's calculate.

1953
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,880
I'm really good at this.

1954
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,760
Found a great feature.

1955
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,160
Look, it converts directly.

1956
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,720
Just converts instantly.

1957
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,040
Let's say sixty-eight euros.

1958
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,960
Sixty-eight.

1959
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,720
Done, no need to do anything else.

1960
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,800
Five hundred sixty-nine point eighty-five RMB.

1961
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,160
That's reliable.

1962
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,800
That's reliable.

1963
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,600
This Yangtang is going to be a big success today.

1964
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,800
I'm telling you, this will definitely work.

1965
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,320
It's getting dark.

1966
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,080
The monster is coming.

1967
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,960
The fog is here.

1968
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,600
It's about to fall.

1969
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,320
It's about to fall.

1970
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,440
Let's go make eggplant for them.

1971
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:04,960
Let's try.

1972
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,400
Honglei wants to make roasted eggplant.

1973
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,480
I'll try making one for him.

1974
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:24,840
I'll give it a shot.

1975
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,040
Because I even specially

1976
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,440
asked my grandma for advice.

1977
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,960
She told me how to stir-fry eggplant.

1978
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,040
Then, change the way you cut it.

1979
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,680
Actually, stir-frying eggplant

1980
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,600
is the most troublesome part.

1981
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,560
Once that's done,

1982
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,360
the final stir-fry

1983
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,240
is the easiest part.

1984
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,880
Eggplant really soaks up oil.

1985
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,160
What are you doing?

1986
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,160
Do you have to film the burnt part?

1987
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,480
Destroy the evidence.

1988
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,560
My most capable assistant.

1989
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,080
I'm just helping him cut the meat.

1990
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,160
It's none of your business.

1991
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:47,840
It's none of my business.

1992
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,200
I've only been here for thirty seconds.

1993
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,440
But you seem like

1994
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,480
you've been working for half a year.

1995
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:51,840
Feels like it.

1996
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,920
So hardworking.

1997
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,760
Feels like hearing outside

1998
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,000
it's our own

1999
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,040
kids playing.

2000
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,600
Jingjing and Didi and the others.

2001
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,920
So you have a mole here.

2002
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,240
Yeah.

2003
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,000
So charming.

2004
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,640
I think your bone structure is really outstanding.

2005
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,120
Thank you.

2006
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,760
Feels like listening to kids at home

2007
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,440
playing outside.

2008
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah.

2009
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,600
Feels like the adults are cooking.

2010
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
No.

2011
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,320
Master.

2012
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,160
Like us old servants.

2013
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,440
We're all family servants.

2014
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,120
Yes, servants.

2015
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,920
Don't say that, I'm here too.

2016
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,880
Aren't you the master?

2017
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,600
Yeah, I'm here too.

2018
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,520
Down-to-earth.

2019
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,800
Down-to-earth.

2020
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,720
Hege, I never knew you were

2021
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,080
so good at cooking.

2022
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:39,720
Not really.

2023
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,960
Turns out you're the domestic type.

2024
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,600
I'm the knife guy.

2025
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,280
You cut this?

2026
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,440
Da Ning.

2027
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,960
I really don't want to repeat that line.

2028
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,240
If you marry, marry Liu Yuning.

2029
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,240
This is cut so well, Chef Liu.

2030
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,000
Really.

2031
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,520
Thank you.

2032
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,120
I'm telling you,

2033
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,560
If you keep praising me, I'll end up cutting my hand.

2034
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:04,960
Seriously.

2035
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,920
That's just how people are.

2036
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,520
The more you praise,

2037
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,800
the faster the knife goes.

2038
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,400
Bro, do you still cook at home now?

2039
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,080
No.

2040
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,920
Only cook on shows.

2041
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,040
Because no one praises me at home.

2042
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,240
Lao Liu, Lao Liu, you're amazing.

2043
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,600
Naiwen, Naiwen.

2044
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,279
He's a good person.

2045
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,680
Xingxu, Xingxu.

2046
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,120
Don't.

2047
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
I am.

2048
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,359
I'm interested.

2049
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,560
Lin Yi, Lin Yi.

2050
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,880
Unbelievably handsome.

2051
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,160
Alright.

2052
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,720
Done.

2053
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,920
Yuning, this kid.

2054
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,399
Did it really well.

2055
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,720
Smells amazing.

2056
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,240
Tastes so good.

2057
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,479
It's ready, everyone.

2058
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,240
Awesome.

2059
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,600
Come on.

2060
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,840
Make way for others.

2061
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,120
Do you want this?

2062
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,080
Yes, that's perfect, that one.

2063
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,080
But there's only a small one.

2064
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:08,560
That's enough, it's fine.

2065
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,520
This is more than enough.

2066
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,479
Hege needs to help me fry the meat.

2067
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,640
This "Duke" here.

2068
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,760
Why is someone else cooking your meat?

2069
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,840
Too many assistants.

2070
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,720
Okay.

2071
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,680
Alright, Chef.

2072
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,960
Go ahead, go ladle the soup.

2073
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,880
Grab a bowl, everyone.

2074
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,120
Get a bowl, go.

2075
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,000
Get a bowl, get a spoon.

2076
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,720
Authentic Dandong Lamb Soup.

2077
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,080
Look at this presentation.

2078
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,120
It looks beautiful.

2079
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,000
Bro, come try a bite.

2080
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,399
Come have a taste.

2081
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:33,720
Come on.

2082
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,600
We're waiting for you to try it.

2083
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:39,840
Amazing, Yuning.

2084
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:40,800
Really?

2085
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,960
It's fantastic.

2086
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:43,560
This is the best I've ever had.

2087
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,760
The most delicious lamb soup.

2088
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,520
Oh my bro.

2089
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,240
Thank you.

2090
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,720
Eagerly waiting.

2091
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,800
If you think it's bland,

2092
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,479
just add some salt.

2093
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,640
So good.

2094
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,680
Thanks, bro.

2095
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,480
It's so tasty.

2096
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,600
Yuning.

2097
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,480
It's a total success.

2098
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,200
So fragrant.

2099
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:14,840
So fragrant.

2100
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,640
How is it so flavorful?

2101
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,080
I really want to soak bread in it.

2102
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,280
Yeah.

2103
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,920
Missing some carbs.

2104
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,440
Should we use light soy sauce for color

2105
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,640
or dark soy sauce?

2106
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,200
That's a good point.

2107
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
That's a great question.

2108
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,200
I really like questions like this.

2109
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,320
Light soy sauce for color?

2110
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,760
Or dark soy sauce?

2111
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,000
Actually, it doesn't matter.

2112
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,920
Whatever the "Duke" says for color.

2113
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,960
Just use whatever.

2114
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,560
Alright.

2115
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,880
My emotional intelligence is still lacking.

2116
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,800
I need to cook this for you, right?

2117
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,440
Just cook it through.

2118
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,760
Just add salt and MSG.

2119
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,680
When you eat that eggplant,

2120
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,520
it usually looks like this.

2121
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,200
Mashed.

2122
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:57,960
Mashed up.

2123
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,760
Why not just now

2124
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,280
pour it straight in?

2125
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:00,800
What do you think?

2126
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,520
Sounds good.

2127
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,040
Is that okay?

2128
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,640
Nice.

2129
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:03,920
Then I'll do it, alright?

2130
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,160
Okay.

2131
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:04,800
Come on.

2132
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,080
Mashed up, right?

2133
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,800
Yeah.

2134
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,960
Alright, got it.

2135
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,920
You did a great job with this.

2136
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,040
Come on, camera, get this.

2137
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,120
No, move aside.

2138
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:33,480
Give it to me.

2139
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,640
Just two more times.

2140
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,480
Come on, shake it up.

2141
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,280
Shake it up, shake me.

2142
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:39,720
Shake it to me.

2143
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,640
Alright, it's ready.

2144
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,000
What's wrong?

2145
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:49,880
Nice!

2146
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,120
Good luck.

2147
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,280
This one's good.

2148
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,920
Chen He, come out and try the eggplant.

2149
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,160
They want me to try the eggplant.

2150
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,720
Who made this eggplant?

2151
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,560
It's done, try the eggplant.

2152
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,600
Did you make this too?

2153
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,680
He cooked it, right?

2154
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,600
It must be Chen He who cooked it.

2155
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,200
After "the Duke" asked me a question,

2156
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,720
I decided not to let him cook.

2157
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,120
He said,

2158
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,120
Does dark soy sauce or light soy sauce add color?

2159
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,080
Tasty.

2160
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,960
Good, right?

2161
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:38,160
Delicious.

2162
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,680
Really delicious.

2163
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,480
This eggplant is amazing.

2164
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,680
There's pork inside, do you want some?

2165
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,560
It doesn't taste like eggplant.

2166
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,480
Let me try.

2167
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,960
Don't you not eat eggplant?

2168
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,920
I'll just have some meat.

2169
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:57,400
Lin Yi.

2170
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,160
Will you eat the eyeball?

2171
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,680
I don't dare, you eat it.

2172
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,280
Give it to me, I'll do it.

2173
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:02,480
Bro, give it to me.

2174
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,200
Really?

2175
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,560
Xingxu and I will each eat one.

2176
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,280
We'll eat one together.

2177
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:05,960
Okay.

2178
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,440
From now on, we're sheep eye brothers.

2179
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,160
You two are a sight for sore eyes.

2180
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:11,600
Very pleasing to the eye.

2181
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,080
Really nice to look at.

2182
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:12,480
Come on.

2183
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,040
Cheers!

2184
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:13,840
Come on, bottoms up!

2185
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,800
Sheep eye brothers.

2186
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,240
Awesome.

2187
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,960
Let's open a shop, Old Liu.

2188
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,720
I miss Sister Wen.

2189
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,320
Next, we'll play the upgraded version of "Wu Dong Youth."

2190
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,840
Let's start with solo performances.

2191
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,320
Are you itchy?

2192
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,000
A real man needs dignity.

2193
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,400
My chest.

2194
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,000
What's wrong with your chest?

2195
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,600
Someone needs to cover my chest.

2196
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,360
It's tough for Yi.

2197
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,880
You're not much better than us.

2198
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,640
You don't have anything on your chest.

2199
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,160
You're covering the wrong spot.

2200
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,000
You're off on both sides.

2201
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,280
Who's my acting partner?

2202
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,240
Is this enough?

2203
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,080
I don't think it's enough.

2204
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,680
Maybe we should split up quickly.

2205
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,080
Who else could it be but you?

2206
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,840
I think the beginning was off.

2207
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,680
I might suspect him.

2208
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,880
You two must be innocent.

2209
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,920
No one believes in me.

2210
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,920
But I'm the funniest.

2211
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,480
Please vote.

2212
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,920
We're now at Casa Batlló.

2213
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,600
Unbelievable.

2214
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,360
Sister Wang is back.

2215
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,920
We're eating at home again today.

2216
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,840
Do we need this much oil?

2217
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:33,880
I'm flattered.

2218
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,640
Smells amazing.

2219
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,800
Boss, please!

2220
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,960
Start your performance!

2221
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,080
It's showtime.

2222
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,200
Now I'm the director.

2223
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,160
No, you're the king.

2224
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,760
If you can guess this line,

2225
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,840
He said the keyword.

2226
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,200
I'll say something.

2227
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,960
They don't have Lin Yi over there.

2228
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,320
I think it's a bit unfair.

2229
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,240
Don't stop dancing.

2230
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,240
Wait a second.

2231
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,640
Is it done?

2232
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,080
Say something to describe it.

2233
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,440
Describe it.

2234
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,560
Let's choreograph a dance to our theme song.

2235
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,840
As the closing ceremony for our Spain stop.

2236
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,320
Whisper Relay

2237
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,920
I think the best at lines here

2238
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,520
is definitely Yi Ge.

2239
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,600
This is so hard.

2240
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,200
Don't fall for me.

2241
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,680
Even though I'm friendly and naturally beautiful,

2242
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,840
how could a pheasant match a phoenix?

2243
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,320
I...

2244
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,000
I... What comes next?

2245
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,520
Me, as a person...

2246
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,680
I'm actually pretty good at imitating.

2247
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,640
I'll make sure to copy it perfectly for you.

2248
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,280
He can guess it.

2249
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:38,680
He can do it.

2250
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,200
What's this?

2251
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,560
Is this the Wang Zuxian part?

2252
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,120
Rabbit head isn't that good.

2253
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,200
Raise your right hand.

2254
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,200
Raise.

2255
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,600
Spider-Man.

2256
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,920
Spider.

2257
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,280
Spider-Man.

2258
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,280
Spider what?

2259
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,240
I'm so nervous, I'm sweating.

2260
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,800
Michael.

2261
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,320
Dad.

2262
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,080
Good thing Xingxu is guarding the door.

2263
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:10,960
Yeah.
