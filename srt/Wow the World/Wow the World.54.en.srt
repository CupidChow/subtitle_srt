1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,600
Next up,

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,400
let's try a game of "Whispered Lines".

3
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,640
We've picked a few

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,600
classic scenes from movies and TV.

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,760
The first person

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,320
will get a movie clip.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,640
Everyone else puts on noise-cancelling headphones.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,040
The first person acts it out

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
and passes the lines to the second person.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,960
And so on.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,080
The last member needs to

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,400
repeat the lines.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Who goes first?

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,160
I think the best with lines here

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,720
is First Brother.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
You take the first turn.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,520
Potato, dirt pile, calf muscle.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Let's warm up first.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,800
Let First Brother do it.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,160
First Brother, go ahead.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, First Brother, go ahead.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
First Brother's got it in his bones.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,280
Okay.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,720
Put headphones on the others.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,760
Let me tell you,

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,720
these are super noise-cancelling.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,920
I've never worn these before.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,840
Why are you staring at me?

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,720
Don't fall for me.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,600
Even though I'm friendly and naturally beautiful,

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,040
a pheasant can't match a phoenix.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,240
Just a humble waiter,

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,080
why would I notice you?

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,680
I want to—

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,440
Even thinking about it is wrong.

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,080
Thinking is a crime.

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,760
Don't think

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,920
I don't know what's on your mind.

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,280
That's so long.

40
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,480
You want me to stay at this inn,

41
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,640
then you'd have a chance.

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:30,920
No.

43
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,600
That's way too long.

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,160
There's no chance at all.

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
Why aren't you looking at me?

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm afraid you'll scold me.

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
You're fine, why would I scold you?

48
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,960
You won't look at me.

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,080
Clearly, you have bad intentions.

50
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,960
This is too hard.

51
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
I'll start from here.

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,080
Are you calling me?

53
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,440
Stand here.

54
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
I might be two people,

55
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
or maybe five.

56
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,320
Got it?

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,680
Okay.

58
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm starting.

59
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
Why are you staring at me?

60
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,800
I—I—I...

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,960
Don't fall for me.

62
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
Even though I'm friendly and naturally beautiful,

63
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,440
how can a pheasant match a phoenix?

64
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
Just a humble waiter,

65
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,960
why would I notice you?

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,600
I—I—I want to—

67
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
Even thinking about it is wrong.

68
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,080
Thinking is a crime.

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't think

70
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,320
I don't know what's on your mind.

71
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
You think I'll stay

72
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,080
at this inn.

73
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,040
Then you'd have a chance.

74
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,680
No.

75
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,600
There's no chance at all.

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,160
I...

77
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,720
Why won't you look at me?

78
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,720
I—I'm afraid you'll scold me.

79
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
You're fine, why would I scold you?

80
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,800
You won't look at me.

81
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,960
Clearly, you have bad intentions.

82
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,440
This is too hard.

83
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,240
Time's up.

84
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
Okay, third turn.

85
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,960
Bro, take it off.

86
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
Hurry, I forgot.

87
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,880
I already forgot.

88
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,440
Bro, quick.

89
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,600
I can barely remember anything.

90
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Don't get discouraged yet.

91
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,640
What's impossible? Just say it.

92
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,440
No, it's too long.

93
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,880
Bro.

94
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,160
It could be two people.

95
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Or maybe five people.

96
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,880
I don't know either.

97
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,320
Why are you staring at me?

98
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,440
And then this.

99
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
I... I...

100
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,320
And then over here, that.

101
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't think you've turned from a pheasant into a phoenix.

102
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So you can just do whatever.

103
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
Here, here, it's still me, me.

104
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,600
And then what was next?

105
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,720
This is too hard, way too hard.

106
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Me.

107
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,440
Me.

108
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,760
Me.

109
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,720
I've forgotten everything.

110
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,600
Alright, that's it.

111
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,040
No, bro.

112
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
So it's over, right?

113
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
This is all I remember.

114
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,320
Talking about the staring part.

115
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,040
It must be a girl.

116
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
Why are you staring at me?

117
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't think you've turned from a pheasant into a phoenix.

118
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,760
You, something about a waiter.

119
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,840
Wait, how did it become a waiter again?

120
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Wasn't it a pheasant?

121
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,640
It should be a waiter.

122
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Probably a period costume.

123
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,440
Have you seen this play?

124
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
Alright, time's up.

125
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,320
Is time up?

126
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,880
Time's up.

127
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,880
Okay, next.

128
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Didi, come here.

129
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,120
You're a junior at the film academy now, right?

130
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,120
Teacher.

131
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,720
We're counting on you, Didi.

132
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,040
Okay.

133
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll do the original version.

134
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Alright.

135
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,680
Two to five people.

136
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
A woman points at a man and says,

137
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,600
Why are you staring at me?

138
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,560
There are two interpretations.

139
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,120
One is,

140
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
Don't think that...

141
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,760
You're just a waiter.

142
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,440
The second interpretation,

143
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Don't think you've turned from a pheasant into a phoenix.

144
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
So you think you're something now.

145
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,880
Original version complete.

146
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,440
He gave me two versions.

147
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,720
Alright.

148
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,160
The first version is,

149
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
Why are you staring?

150
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,840
Then the guy does this.

151
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,720
No.

152
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,000
No.

153
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
Next, the girl says,

154
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,440
Don't think just because you're a waiter...

155
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
There's nothing after that.

156
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,040
That's one version.

157
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,880
Is it over already?

158
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
That's so abstract.

159
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,600
It's really abstract.

160
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
What's the next version?

161
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
The woman says to the man again,

162
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,960
Don't think you've turned from a pheasant into a phoenix.

163
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,520
So what?

164
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,720
When it comes to acting,

165
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,880
my imitation skills are pretty strong.

166
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
I’ll definitely give you a perfect recreation.

167
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,960
Let’s say you’re the guy,

168
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
and I’m the girl.

169
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,160
So the girl does this.

170
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,760
She comes over.

171
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
Don’t stare at me like that.

172
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
You think your eyes are big?

173
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,040
Who do you think you are?

174
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,760
You’re nothing.

175
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,440
Absolutely nothing.

176
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,040
Then the guy does this.

177
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
No lines here.

178
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
The guy doesn’t have any lines?

179
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,920
The guy.

180
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,080
Then the girl goes like this.

181
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,880
Don’t think you’re cool just because you’re a waiter.

182
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,120
And then—

183
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
That’s the first version.

184
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Second version.

185
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
You’re a pheasant.

186
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,960
A barnyard chicken.

187
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,960
A free-range chicken.

188
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,840
That’s it.

189
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
I totally recreated it.

190
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,440
I really did.

191
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,160
Come on.

192
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,520
I can’t do a perfect recreation.

193
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,400
Then why are you here?

194
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,200
But—

195
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,280
I believe in you.

196
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,760
What good is your belief?

197
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,520
You’ll be able to guess.

198
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,400
I can guess, okay.

199
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,840
Look.

200
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,040
The first scene goes like this.

201
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,120
There’s a guy.

202
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,080
There’s a guy.

203
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,640
Standing there.

204
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:49,960
Just standing there.

205
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,760
No idea.

206
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,400
No idea.

207
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
And there’s a girl over here.

208
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
Another girl comes in.

209
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Then—

210
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
The girl just walks right over.

211
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,400
What are you looking at?

212
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,760
Why are your eyes so wide?

213
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,720
I’m beautiful.

214
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,960
Because I look so good.

215
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
So you just—

216
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,080
You just keep staring at me?

217
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,520
And the guy’s just standing there.

218
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,440
That woman spoke again.

219
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
You think you're the waiter?

220
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,640
So you just...

221
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,040
Waiter.

222
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,400
Right.

223
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,160
Waiter.

224
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
The second scene.

225
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,040
It might still be in this setting.

226
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
The woman said something.

227
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,440
Pheasant.

228
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Pheasant.

229
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,520
Free-range chicken.

230
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,280
Free-range chicken.

231
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,080
Pheasant, free-range chicken.

232
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,400
Yes.

233
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
It's a Hong Kong movie.

234
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,640
Hong Kong movie.

235
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
It's by Stephen Chow.

236
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,400
I haven't seen it.

237
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
He can guess it.

238
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,640
He can.

239
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,400
You can.

240
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
I think he can guess it.

241
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Really.

242
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,960
He can guess it.

243
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,200
He heard it.

244
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,600
He can guess it.

245
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,280
Go ahead.

246
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,760
What are you looking at?

247
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,280
What are you looking at?

248
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,200
Haven't you seen a beauty before?

249
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,880
Staring at me with such big eyes.

250
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,280
Wouldn't I be scared?

251
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,280
What's this?

252
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,720
Darn it.

253
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Then that person said,

254
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,280
Me.

255
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Why?

256
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,040
Then the woman said,

257
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,520
Stop staring, waiter.

258
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Hurry up and serve the food.

259
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
I want to eat all the chicken in your restaurant.

260
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Pheasant.

261
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,640
Pheasant, wild chicken, free-range chicken.

262
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
Give me one of each.

263
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,600
That's the info I got.

264
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,520
I added a bit myself.

265
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,640
What are you looking at?

266
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,160
What are you looking at?

267
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,200
Stop staring, waiter.

268
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
Staring at me with such big eyes.

269
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Is that the Wang Zuxian scene?

270
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,960
Seriously?

271
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
What are you doing with your eyes?

272
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,160
Why are you staring at me with your eyes wide open?

273
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
Don't think you can...

274
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
You can like me.

275
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,760
The waiter said, "Me?"

276
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

277
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,520
How could a pheasant match with a phoenix?

278
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,760
Don't even think about it.

279
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,520
Even thinking about it is a crime.

280
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,840
Then this is correct.

281
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,520
Which movie is this?

282
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
It's "The Eagle Shooting Heroes."

283
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
Right.

284
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,679
"The Eagle Shooting Heroes."

285
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,760
The one with Wang Zuxian.

286
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,520
That scared me.

287
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
Brother Ning, you're literally my idol.

288
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,440
See, you scared them all.

289
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,440
That's all I could think of.

290
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,760
That's pretty good.

291
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
I think it's great.

292
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,840
And he could guess "The Eagle Shooting Heroes."

293
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,000
That's already amazing.

294
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,520
So impressive.

295
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,040
Awesome.

296
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,360
Let's try the word-passing game first.

297
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,280
Everyone needs to form groups of three.

298
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
In each team,

299
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,280
one person receives the prompt.

300
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,480
The other two wear noise-canceling headphones.

301
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,400
Each round is limited to 100 seconds.

302
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
The first person uses words

303
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
to direct the second person's movements.

304
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
to act out the motions.

305
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,480
The second person

306
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
needs to use the performed actions

307
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
to guess the answer.

308
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,640
Then pass the guessed answer

309
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
to the third person.

310
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,520
You can only use spoken words during this process.

311
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,480
No gestures allowed.

312
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,160
Form groups freely.

313
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Let's do a practice round first.

314
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,280
Okay.

315
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,360
Alright, let's go.

316
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,880
You guys go first.

317
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
This is too abstract.

318
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,400
Like, if it's Spider-Man, you can guess it.

319
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,760
Spider-Man eating a big watermelon.

320
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,480
How do you guess that?

321
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,280
Even Spider-Man might not get it, bro.

322
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,040
Bro, if you can make her guess Spider-Man,

323
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,960
I think you're awesome.

324
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

325
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,280
Seven characters.

326
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,400
First three characters.

327
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Pickled vegetables.

328
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,520
One, two, three.

329
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
One, two, three.

330
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,760
First three characters.

331
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
First three.

332
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Characters.

333
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,560
Extend your hand.

334
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,280
Hand.

335
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,400
Right hand.

336
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,040
Raise it.

337
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,400
Stretch it out.

338
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
Turn it around.

339
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,560
No.

340
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Reach forward.

341
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,760
Put it in your pocket.

342
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,240
Reach forward.

343
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,920
Reach forward.

344
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,160
Palm facing up.

345
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
Palm facing up.

346
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
Middle finger.

347
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,120
Finger.

348
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,560
Middle.

349
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,280
Middle finger.

350
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Don't move.

351
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Don't move.

352
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,680
Middle finger.

353
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,560
Middle finger.

354
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,560
Put it back.

355
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
What is this?

356
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,800
The middle finger.

357
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,160
Put it back.

358
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,400
Turn around.

359
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,400
Turn around.

360
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,920
Spider-Man.

361
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay.

362
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,000
Is that right?

363
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Then,

364
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,880
Spider-Man.

365
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,520
Shoot webs.

366
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,160
No.

367
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,520
Spider-Man, remember.

368
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,280
Remember him.

369
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,000
Remember him.

370
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
The last four words.

371
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,640
Four, five, six, seven.

372
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,760
Both hands.

373
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,520
Both hands.

374
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,800
Two hands.

375
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,560
The other hand.

376
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,480
Two hands.

377
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Shoot webs.

378
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,520
Don't rush.

379
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,520
Two hands.

380
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,520
Put them in front of your mouth.

381
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:29,880
Mouth.

382
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,520
Mouth.

383
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,520
Mouth.

384
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,040

00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,200
Spider-Man bites his finger.

398
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,800
How do you describe this big watermelon?

399
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
You can do it.

400
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,320
Spider-Man bites his finger.

401
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,920
No.

402
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,440
Two hands.

403
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,280
Two hands.

404
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Put them together.

405
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,800
Open.

406
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
This is small.

407
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,080
Small.

408
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,680
Open.

409
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,080
Big.

410
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,800
Spider-Man goes big.

411
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,920
Spider-Man uses his ultimate move.

412
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,960
Spider-Man used his ultimate move.

413
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,800
Time's up.

414
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm here.

415
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,560
Okay.

416
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
That's it.

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,760
Spider-Man bites, big and small.

418
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,080
Okay.

419
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
These four words are enough.

420
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

421
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
Seven words.

422
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,840
Spider-Man.

423
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,600
Spider-Man.

424
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
Spider.

425
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,320
Spider-Man.

426
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,920
Spider.

427
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
Spider-Man.

428
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
Spider what?

429
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,720
Spider-Man.

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,960
Spider-Man goes big and bites.

434
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,960
Spider-Man is too awesome.

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,320
Small.

440
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,720
Spider-Man

Bite

449
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,720
Spider-Man is too noisy

450
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,480
Bite

451
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,480
Person

452
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,760
Bite

453
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,000
What is this?

454
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
Which word sounds like this?

455
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,640
Bite

456
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,160

Bite

460
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,640

461
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,320

462
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,800
Bite

463
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,400
Bite

464
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,880
Spider-Man

465
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,040
Loves to bite people

466
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
That's right

467
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,680
Spider-Man

468
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,640
Too

469
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,400
Loves to bite people

470
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,800
Is that right?

471
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,280
Okay, time's up

472
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,920
Okay

473
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,400
Yes

474
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,560
Pretty impressive

475
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,440
But why does Spider-Man love to bite people?

476
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,160
It's because you made a fuss eating watermelon

477
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,160
Spider-Man is too noisy

478
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Or loves to bite people

479
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,320
How would you describe this watermelon?

480
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,680
How do you describe this?

481
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,560
But we got Spider-Man right

482
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
The first three words are correct

483
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,320
That's not easy

484
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,840
Not easy

485
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
Impressive

486
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,560
Not easy

487
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,280
Next group, let's go

488
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,040
Let's go

489
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,640
It's our turn

490
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,680
How do we split up?

491
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,560
Bro, I'll go last

492
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,040
Then who's first?

493
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,280
You try going first

494
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,160
I'll do it then

495
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,000
Just do your best

496
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
You actually taught them

497
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,400
Okay, let's go

498
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,920
Make it easier

499
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,680
I'm begging you

500
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,560
Make it easier

501
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,760
Ten characters

502
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,680
This is pretty good

503
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,400
Once you guess this name

504
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,760
Got five right

505
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,040
Six characters

506
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Six characters

507
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,520
If you guess this person, it's six characters

508
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,320
Brother Honglei

509
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,400
As long as you guess this person

510
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,120
It's six characters

511
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,880
Very simple

512
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,520
Okay, sure

513
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,040
Ten characters

514
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,800
It's a "xi"

515
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
Ten characters

516
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,040
It's a "chi"

517
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,680
How does he talk without moving his lips?

518
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,640
Ten characters

519
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,160

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,280
Five

Ten characters

538
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,680
I'm begging you

539
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,520
Make it simpler

540
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,360
How many characters for "person"?

541
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,000
Six

542
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
A person with six characters

543
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,320
No, none of those are right. Okay.

544
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,440
Baoma Xiaoli

545
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,680

546
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,120

551
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Now it's an action

552
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,200
Now it's a Chinese person

553
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Let me do the action

554
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,520
Okay

555
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,800

His mouth is always like this

563
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,160
His mouth shape never changes

564
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,040

On the stomach

576
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,000
Six words: put it on the stomach

Made it.

920
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
Put it on the face.

921
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,120
Put it on the face.

922
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,560
What is this?

Flower, blossom

929
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Seems correct

930
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,560
Ultraman blossomed

931
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,440

Correct

933
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,640
The last two words

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,720
The last two words

935
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,760
How do you say this?

936
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,320
Just say the word directly

937
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,320
He can't hear

938
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,880
Feet apart

939
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,240

Slide

943
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,720
Ultraman is dancing disco

944
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,560
That's right

945
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,280
Is that correct?

946
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Not dancing

947
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,960
Slide

948
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,960

951
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,720
Ice skating

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,040
Me

953
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,720
Ice, right?

954
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,520
Ice

955
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520

956
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,280
Skating

957
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,600

958
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Ultraman something something skating

959
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,760
Happy skating

960
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,960
Start skating

961
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,520

I can't hear, but

964
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,160
Figure skating

965
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,400
Put it under your chin

966
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Ultraman blossom skating

967
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,080
Figure skating

968
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,440
This doesn't make sense

969
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,800
That's right

970
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,880
Figure skating

971
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,400
You two actually got the answer right

972
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
Ultraman figure skating

973
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,000
Missed one

974
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,240
They just said ice skating

975
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,720
You insisted on saying skating

976
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,160
See?

977
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
It was ice skating just now

978
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,520
Sorry

979
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,360
No

980
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
This is unbeatable

981
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,520
This is awesome

982
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,560
So cool

983
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,200
This is too hard

984
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,240
Excellent
