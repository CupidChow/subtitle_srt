1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,120
Yesterday, we originally planned

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,640
to join a grand Castells (Human Towers) festival.

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,600
Unfortunately, a sudden downpour canceled it.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Today, so everyone can still experience

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,640
this unmissable cultural tradition,

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,480
we specially invited a Castells team

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,640
to give a live demonstration.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
This way, we can feel

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,720
the spirit from Catalonia

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,080
and the charm of this tradition.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,600
Recently,

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,920
a centuries-old folk festival

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,400
has set the whole city abuzz.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,120
It’s the Castells, symbolizing courage and teamwork.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,600
It’s not just a stacking of strength,

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,120
but the ultimate display of trust and unity.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
People from different communities,

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,800
schools, and workplaces

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
come together for one shared goal,

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,320
willing to be each other's solid foundation.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,520
They build towers

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,640
that reach for the clouds.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,400
Today,

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
we’ll witness this power of unity up close.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,680
Come, let’s invite

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
the Castells instructors.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,360
Everyone,

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,920
this is our unique European tradition,

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,760
Castells (Human Towers).

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,040
Let’s experience it.

31
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,120
Let’s feel it.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
This belt is for protecting their waists.

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
Everyone needs to wear this waist support.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
Here they come.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
They’re stacking up!

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,800
What did she say?

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,360
What did she say?

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,800
She said, “Come on!”

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,600
I’m steady now.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,640
Is that our flag?

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,280
So steady!

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,560
Perfect.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,280
So light!

44
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Feels like they’re floating.

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
Yes, amazing!

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,400
Awesome!

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,840
We are a university Castells team.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,080
So we’re all adults, all from universities.

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,960
From the University of Barcelona

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Our team name is

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Arraplads University Team (a student Castells team).

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
We can build towers

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,440
up to seven or eight levels high.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,920
Thank you to the instructors for the great show.

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,800
We’ll definitely visit the festival in person

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
to feel the Castells atmosphere.

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
Thank you.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,079
Thanks.

60
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,959
Thank you.

61
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
Perfect.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,760
Thank you.

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,000
Bye-bye.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
Everyone, let’s move indoors

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,440
and do a challenge.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,880
Quick!

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,840
Alright.

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,640
Let’s go.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,400
During Castells building,

70
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,960
the performers’ waists bear a lot of weight.

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
So participants wrap their waists

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,240
with long cloth strips

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,680
to prevent waist injuries.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
So next, we’ll do

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
the Waist Cinch Challenge.

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
We’ve already

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,440
collected everyone’s waist measurements.

78
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
All members will wrap the cloth once around.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,040
The total waist length of all members

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
must be reduced by 50 centimeters.

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
That means the challenge is a success.

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,440
I’ll try to make my waist as slim as possible.

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Right.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,960
Your total waist size is

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,920
643.5 centimeters.

86
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
You just need to cut 50 centimeters.

87
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,800
Fifty centimeters.

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,960
Half a meter.

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,920
Ten centimeters per person.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,960
How about this?

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Since I was little, my family, for some reason,

92
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
taught me this way.

93
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
They said the waist is here.

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,680
In my family, the waist is here.

95
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,000
Look.

96
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
This is also the waist.

97
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,440
Then, if you do it this way,

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,400
with the belt, can we count you as twenty?

99
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,760
Okay.

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Come on, let’s start, guys!

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
Let’s do it, come on!

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,840
Let’s go.

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,800
Come.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
Bro, when you lift it up,

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
I think we might lose.

106
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,640
Why is it so puffy?

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,200
No problem.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
I’ll go first, okay?

109
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,320
You go first.

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,080
Let’s start.

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
Why does this feel like tug-of-war?

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
I feel like, just me alone,

113
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
maybe we don’t need so many people.

114
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
You turn yourself first.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Spin yourself first.

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
Help her with her hair.

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Hold it.

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Do you feel

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
like a princess

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
changing clothes?

121
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
Everyone’s standing around you.

122
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Come.

123
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Breathe in.

124
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,400
Wrap.

125
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
A bit tighter.

126
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,920
Breathe in again.

127
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,920
Okay.

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
Alright, more wrapping will make it thick.

129
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,800
Bring the ruler.

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,360
Come.

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,600
I’ll do it.

132
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
Yours, I’ll turn.

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,200
I’ll start turning.

134
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,520
I think it can be even tighter.

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,720
Suck in your stomach a bit more.

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,160
Breathe in again.

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Sixty-eight.

138
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,480
It’s one centimeter bigger than before.

139
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,560
Wait a second.

140
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
This isn’t right.

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
This is definitely not right.

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
No.

143
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,480
I think only Hehe needs to be wrapped.

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,600
Give it a try, He.

145
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,080
I think you should try it.

146
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Okay.

147
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,920
Come on.

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,960
Here, take this.

149
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Come.

150
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,240
Bro, you can call it out now.

151
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Ninety-four.

152
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,920
Alright, let's wrap it.

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,600
Like this.

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,080
This way, you can lift it up.

155
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,160
I'll just lift it up.

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay, go ahead.

157
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,280
I'll pull for him, come.

158
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,640
Hold tight.

159
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
Bro, you push him to turn.

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Push him to turn.

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
I'll pull that side.

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,480
I'll pull that end.

163
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
I'll pull to the end.

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,880
Come on, Xingxu, we're strong.

165
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
Turn counterclockwise.

166
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay.

167
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,880
I'll handle his belly.

168
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,400
The flesh is coming out.

169
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,040
The flesh is coming out.

170
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait a second.

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,880
No.

172
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,160
Where are you going?

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,840
What are you doing?

174
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm pushing him.

175
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,320
You pull.

176
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,200
I'll pull.

177
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,160
You guys.

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,280
Let me spin comfortably, okay?

179
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,760
Okay.

180
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,200
Bro, like this.

181
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,360
Give me a bit here.

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,960
Give me a bit here.

183
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,760
Make sure my lower belly doesn't show.

184
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,720
Alright?

185
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,640
Okay, that's secured.

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,200
Turn.

187
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,200
Why are you all in a rush?

188
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
I haven't even started spinning.

189
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,320
Turn.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
Why are you pushing me?

191
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,520
Turn.

192
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,880
Turn.

193
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Rope, turn.

194
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Let it spin.

195
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,320
Let's turn.

196
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,760
Let's turn.

197
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,680
Stop.

198
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm still inside.

199
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm still inside.

200
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,840
No.

201
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,480
No.

202
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,880
No.

203
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,000
Naiwen (bro).

204
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Is this right?

205
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Is it?

206
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,040
Like this.

207
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Make him stand still.

208
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
We just need to wrap him.

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Let's hold him steady.

210
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Then one person pulls and wraps like this.

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,840
Right.

212
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,200
I'll do it.

213
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,240
I'll turn.

214
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,919
I'll handle the belly.

215
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,600
Support him.

216
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,360
Here, I'll support him.

217
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,440
Bro, you hold him.

218
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,360
You hold him.

219
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,200
Come.

220
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,880
Don't move.

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,559
Okay.

222
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,560
Eighty-nine.

223
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,920
It's eighty-nine now.

224
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,000
Eighty-nine, okay.

225
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,360
Can we let him rest now?

226
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,760
Quick, let him go.

227
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,360
Hurry, save him.

228
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,440
Let go quickly.

229
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,040
He can't breathe.

230
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
His face is pale.

231
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Feels so good.

232
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,040
Who else has space?

233
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,880
Naiwen Li.

234
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
I'll go.

235
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,640
Come, you do it.

236
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
Mine...

237
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,840
What's my official (number)?

238
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
Normally, it's eighty-two.

239
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,760
Right.

240
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
I think Uncle Nai can do it.

241
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,000
So skinny.

242
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,520
Okay.

243
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,400
Come.

244
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
Smooth it out here.

245
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
That's good.

246
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
That's good.

247
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,480
Let go for me.

248
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,160
Jin Jing, let go.

249
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,600
Come, go past him.

250
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,640
Okay, you can measure now.

251
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,360
You can measure now.

252
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,800
How much?

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,320
Wait a moment.

254
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,680
Right away.

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,640
Measure quickly.

256
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,320
Quick.

257
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,680
Okay.

258
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,040
How much?

259
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,400
Okay.

260
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Seventy-seven.

261
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Seventy-seven.

262
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,320
I think so.

263
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,400
Did you guys figure it out?

264
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,520
Come.

265
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Lin Yi gave us eighty-one.

266
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,840
Secure the front first.

267
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,760
The waist is so high, guys.

268
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,480
Use force.

269
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
Wait, it's not tight enough.

270
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,880
Wait a moment.

271
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,800
Let me suck in first.

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,520
After I suck in, you hurry.

273
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,560
Okay, got it.

274
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,600
One, two, three, suck in.

275
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,480
Alright, that's good.

276
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Okay, let's measure.

277
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:02,880
That's fine.

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
I'll do this. Yes, that's fine.

279
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
Seventy-one.

280
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,200
Seventy-one.

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Down by ten.

282
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Ten.

283
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,960
Ten centimeters.

284
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
That makes it easy to win.

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,280
We're here now, right?

286
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,360
Nineteen, just one short.

287
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,760
Just one short.

288
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,200
Come on, bro.

289
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,720
Come on, just one more.

290
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,160
Let's do it.

291
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,600
Let's measure the original data first.

292
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,640
How much?

293
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,120
Seventy-six.

294
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,080
So slim.

295
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,960
What's the official number?

296
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,720
Seventy-four.

297
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,760
Gained weight.

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,720
Ate well these past two days.

299
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:36,920
Come on.

300
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,240
That's fine.

301
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,760
My hand here.

302
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,480
At first, it's still okay (even slimmer).

303
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
Just don't pinch me.

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
Okay, let's measure.

305
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Hurry, measure.

306
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,120
Okay, let's measure.

307
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,360
Hurry, measure.

308
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,600
Quick.

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,920
This.

310
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,320
Seventy-three.

311
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,960
How much?

312
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,400
Seventy-three.

313
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,640
I think there's more to measure.

314
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
That's it, bro. We're good.

315
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,440
Right.

316
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,680
Congratulations, everyone.

317
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
We've completed our challenge.

318
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,800
The sky's clear now.

319
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
Let's go grill some barbecue.

320
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,400
You can grill steak too?

321
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,920
What's there not to know?

322
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,160
As long as you have hands.

323
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Tasty, Yuning. Let's do it this way.

324
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,440
Yuning is really skilled.

325
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,320
This is amazing.

326
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,000
Ning-ge.

327
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
Just looking at it, it's perfect in color, aroma, and taste.

328
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,560
So good.

329
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,960
Yuning.

330
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,320
That's fine.

331
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,400
Delicious, so good.

332
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
Ning-ge, this is really delicious.

333
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
And every slice of eggplant is cooked just right.

334
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
All perfectly consistent.

335
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,080
Yes.

336
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,680
Michelin "Eight-Star".

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
"Liu-chelin".

338
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,040
Let's call him "Nine-Star Liu".

339
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,000
Because he's one meter ninety.

340
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,920
"Nine-Star Liu".

341
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,960
Yuning, you deserve praise.

342
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,520
The more you praise him, the more he does.

343
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
Just keep praising him.

344
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
He won't leave the kitchen today.

345
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,160
This grilled eggplant is truly amazing.

346
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,800
So delicious.

347
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,520
So delicious, bro.

348
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,560
Really tasty.

349
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,400
Make some more.

350
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,680
Here it comes.

351
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,680
This is the best I've ever had.

352
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,320
This grilled eggplant.

353
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,160
Really.

354
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,280
How are you so awesome?

355
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,920
Right?

356
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Really good.

357
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,560
Amazing.

358
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,920
Right away.

359
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,280
Grill it.

360
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,400
So, Ning-ge, what about the eggs?

361
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,920
Grill them.

362
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Grill an egg too.

363
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,680
Can you crack it on top?

364
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,440
It's fine, I'll handle it soon.

365
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
I'll think about how to do it in a bit.

366
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,200
It can be done.

367
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,560
It should work too.

368
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Ning-ge is so manly.

369
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,080
I'll bring the eggs over.

370
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,520
He said the three manliest words.

371
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,040
Let me think.

372
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,440
Did you notice?

373
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,040
Yuning has that parent look.

374
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,600
I think Yuning looks great today.

375
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,720
Beautiful inside and out.

376
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,920
Tomorrow we'll have fish soup.

377
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,920
The day after, chicken soup.

378
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,680
That's fine.

379
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,160
Let's do one tomorrow.

380
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,800
Okay, let's go.

381
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
Xingxu, I think you've grown up instantly.

382
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,800
Joining this crew.

383
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
Compared to the first time meeting him.

384
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,000
Completely different.

385
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
He said he liked me this morning.

386
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,760
Who?

387
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,360
Xu-ge.

388
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,840
First of all, it's like this.

389
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,640
Mainly because Yuwen returns tomorrow.

390
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,440
I said let Wen stay in my room.

391
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,360
Then I'll stay with him.

392
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,960
That's not your tone.

393
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,840
It is.

394
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
I sent the message.

395
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:11,840
He.

396
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,920
What tone?

397
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,480
His words are super manly.

398
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,320
Just the words.

399
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,480
You stay with me.

400
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,520
You two are called

401
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,600
"Xing-ergy".

402
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,320
"Xing-ergy"

403
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
"Xing-ergy"

404
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,600
This team is formed, Naiwen.

405
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
We have this team now.

406
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,920
Next,

407
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,840
let's play a table undercover game.

408
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,680
Everyone will draw lots

409
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,080
to pick two members who dislike steak.

410
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,080
The rest are steak lovers.

411
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
After "eyes closed in the dark,"

412
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
we'll call each member to open their eyes.

413
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,000
Go to the steak area to eat.

414
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Steak lovers must eat.

415
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,080
Those who dislike steak can't eat.

416
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,840
Meanwhile,

417
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,960
everyone can freely

418
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,480
talk to those in the steak area.

419
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,320
After one round of eating,

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
everyone reviews the round.

421
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,560
Find the two who didn't eat.

422
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,600
The winning side

423
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,720
can punish the losers as they wish.

424
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Come on, start with Yuning here.

425
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Everyone draws one card.

426
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,240
Go ahead.

427
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Whoever draws "dislikes steak"

428
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,560
is our undercover.

429
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,320
Let's do it.

430
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,320
Hope I'm the one who dislikes steak.

431
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,320
Don't like it.

432
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm not hungry.

433
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
Really don't like it.

434
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
Getting a bit nervous.

435
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,800
Do you like steak?

436
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,840
I love steak, eat it every day.

437
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,680
Do you like it?

438
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,560
Me?

439
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,960
Not telling you.

440
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,080
Pretending to dislike steak

441
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
or pretending to like steak?

442
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,320
Bro,

443
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,960
I've explained three times.

444
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,600
Explain.

445
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,480
Stop, just stop.

446
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,000
Keep it down.

447
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
These two buddies today

448
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
I think they've really grown.

449
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Now,

450
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,080
Eyes closed, it's dark.

451
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,760
Those who dislike steak, open your eyes.

452
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,440
Eyes closed, it's dark.

453
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,480
Then say this.

454
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,320
He actually said "eyes closed, it's dark."

455
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,080
He actually said

456
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,080
Okay, now open your eyes.

457
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,480
Let's start from Yuning's side.

458
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:23,720
Okay.

459
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
Alright, everyone close your eyes.

460
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
Yuning, let us know when you eat.

461
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Alright?

462
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,480
Okay.

463
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,080
How is it?

464
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,480
Yuning.

465
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Did you eat?

466
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,840
I did.

467
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,720
Say it.

468
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,360
Liu Yuning is the most handsome in the world.

469
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
Liu Yuning is the most handsome in the world.

470
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,480
That sounds a bit fake.

471
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,600
Is it that big a piece?

472
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,320
How big was your piece, Ning?

473
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,640
Very long.

474
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,480
A long piece.

475
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
A long piece.

476
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:49,720
Right.

477
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
Sing a song, Yuning.

478
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,000
Sing your best love song.

479
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,160
What's the best love song?

480
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
Your favorite.

481
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,080
Okay.

482
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,560
I'll sing "Long Time No See," here.

483
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,240
This one works.

484
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
That line sounds a bit like it.

485
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,840
I came to your city.

486
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,200
Doesn't sound like it.

487
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,680
This doesn't sound like it.

488
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,080
Really doesn't sound like it.

489
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,600
Walked the road you came by.

490
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,720
Something feels off.

491
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,200
Say it while chewing.

492
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
When you chew, it's not really...

493
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,920
Fake.

494
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,720
I think it's fake too.

495
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,000
Definitely fake.

496
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,600
Not right.

497
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,080
I didn't hear him swallow.

498
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,480
Alright.

499
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,000
Come back.

500
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
Okay, Yuning can come back.

501
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,800
Alright.

502
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,680
Darn it.

503
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:29,920
Yeah.

504
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Did Uncle Nai eat?

505
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,600
I didn't eat.

506
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,480
Not yet.

507
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,320
You eat.

508
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
This piece is a bit big.

509
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,240
Already started eating, right?

510
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,800
That's natural.

511
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,120
Naiwen, sing a song.

512
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
Feels like he's really eating.

513
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,200
He seems real.

514
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,960
This seems real too.

515
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,240
Alright.

516
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,960
Next one, I think.

517
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,400
Look at the oil on my lips.

518
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,280
On your lips.

519
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,680
You just smeared beef fat, right?

520
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
Alright, close your eyes, I'm coming.

521
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,160
Jin Jing.

522
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,640
Let us know when you eat.

523
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:07,920
Okay.

524
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,040
I'm eating now.

525
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,200
How is it?

526
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,040
No idea.

527
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,960
I can't describe this feeling.

528
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,520
Did you put the whole piece in?

529
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,040
Yeah, I just cut a small piece.

530
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,599
How much is there?

531
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,640
How well is it cooked?

532
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,079
It's a bit tough.

533
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,560
But not that tough.

534
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,920
That's a bit tough.

535
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
How did you cut it so fast?

536
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,760
It's already cut.

537
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,400
Not cut well.

538
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,840
I don't eat beef.

539
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,040
I'm eating the stuff on the side.

540
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,600
Are you eating the sides now?

541
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah.

542
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm having the side dishes.

543
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
You're eating sides, right?

544
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,520
This is really...

545
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,840
Okay, swallowed it.

546
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,320
Alright.

547
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,520
What did you eat?

548
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,760
Why should I tell you so much?

549
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,400
Carrot.

550
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,400
Carrot.

551
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,600
Now only Yun Ning is unclear.

552
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
"Yu" is still a mystery.

553
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,400
He-ge.

554
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
Let us know when you eat.

555
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,160
Is that okay?

556
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,320
Sure, no problem.

557
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,640
Give it a review.

558
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,040
Give it a score.

559
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,080
He, sing a song.

560
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
He-ge, where did you go?

561
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,840
Are you still here?

562
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,600
Hello.

563
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,800
I admit, it's all the moon's fault.

564
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,320
That's a bit pretentious.

565
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,320
Are you singing with your tongue in your mouth?

566
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
Are you eating beef tongue?

567
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,560
I'm really not holding it in.

568
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,120
I bit my tongue while eating.

569
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
I seriously ate a piece.

570
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,240
And it was a pretty big piece.

571
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
Is the steak cold now?

572
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,240
It's cold.

573
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,920
Is it icy cold?

574
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:30,800
Icy cold.

575
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,640
Like your heart, right, He?

576
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,080
If it's out of ten...

577
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,680
It's only a two now.

578
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,560
About one and a half warm.

579
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,280
Okay.

580
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,640
Alright.

581
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,040
I ate a big piece.

582
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,920
That piece is still there.

583
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,880
Honglei-ge can see it.

584
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,080
Did I eat a big piece?

585
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,360
It's my turn.

586
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,320
Here I am.

587
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,320
How is it, Honglei-ge?

588
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,320
Was He-ge right just now?

589
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,080
Are you cutting now?

590
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,760
Just a tiny bit for me.

591
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,600
Does that small piece still need cutting, bro?

592
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,800
Sing a song, Honglei-ge.

593
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,840
Doesn't this sound like singing with your tongue bitten?

594
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,160
Not quite right.

595
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,040
This doesn't seem quite right.

596
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,280
The first bite was pretty close.

597
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,840
After that...

598
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,640
Not like mine just now.

599
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,560
Yours just now was pretty real.

600
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,160
Yours just now was very similar.

601
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Yours was really convincing.

602
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,400
Yeah.

603
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
Stop, come back.

604
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,360
That's about enough.

605
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,280
Come back.

606
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,600
Save some steak.

607
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
Save some steak.

608
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,360
The "Duke" is so stingy.

609
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,560
Won't even let us eat more steak.

610
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
Bro, help me prove it.

611
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,000
Did I eat a big piece?

612
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,640
Do you have one over there...

613
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,560
A really small piece?

614
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,600
I can't prove anything for you, He.

615
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,080
You want me to prove this?

616
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
That's already suspicious.

617
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,080
True.

618
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
When have you ever asked someone to prove themselves?

619
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
I was afraid you'd misunderstand just now.

620
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,120
Haven't you been misunderstood enough?

621
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,600
I'll eat an egg to calm down.

622
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,160
You're still eating.

623
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Tasty.

624
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,760
This one's convincing.

625
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Didi, you can go now.

626
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,880
Didi's gone.

627
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,840
Didi, say a tongue twister.

628
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,520
The monk brings soup up the tower

629
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,840
The tower slips, soup spills, soup scalds the tower

630
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,560
This looks like it

631
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,360
It even has a saliva-like texture

632
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,920
You can really taste the saliva now, Jin Jing

633
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,600
It's not saliva

634
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,360
It's the juice from the meat

635
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,760
This feels pretty real

636
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,520
Let's go, bro

637
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:27,800
It's my turn

638
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,360
Didi's in that group

639
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,800
Can I open my eyes?

640
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,120
You can go with your eyes closed

641
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,760
Did you eat?

642
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,160
Not yet

643
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
No need to cut at all

644
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,840
No need to cut at all

645
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,400
Well done

646
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,080
Well done

647
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,360
Say a few words in Cantonese

648
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,480
What are you saying?

649
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
You learned a bit yesterday, right?

650
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,800
I did

651
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,320
I can speak it, but can't understand

652
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,360
I can speak it, but can't understand

653
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,040
We all can speak, but none can understand

654
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,480
His lip-smacking sounds a bit fake

655
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,080
I think so

656
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,040
Lin Yi, is it salty?

657
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,840
Not salty

658
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,800
I don't think it's salty either

659
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,280
Not salty

660
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,320
Xingxu

661
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,000
My turn

662
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Xingxu, go

663
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,320
Say your word ending with "gui"

664
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,520
Did you eat?

665
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,560
I did

666
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,160
Say a passage

667
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,600
Master tones and rhymes, distinguish the four tones

668
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,920
Yin and yang, rising and falling, must be clear

669
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,160
Find the right position and method

670
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,560
Open, even, close, round—mouth shapes

671
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,160
Xingxu's lines are awesome

672
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,480
Seems to have a bit of it

673
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Sing a slow song, up to you

674
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
Love isn't something you can just sell

675
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
You can't sell it just because you want to

676
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,800
Still feels pretty real

677
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,360
I think it's pretty real too

678
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,320
Really

679
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,560
No problem

680
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,160
Who has a problem, He-ge?

681
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,560
You have a problem

682
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,080
I have a problem

683
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,400
You're more likely to have a problem

684
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,520
I feel

685
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,120
Yuning

686
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,240
you

687
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,160
can open your eyes now

688
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,880
open your eyes

689
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,080
When you were singing

690
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,400
did you shove the fork in your mouth?

691
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,320
You could even hear that?

692
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,840
I heard the fork hit your teeth

693
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,360
Are your teeth that loud?

694
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,040
Clang

695
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,360
Make that clang for me, bro

696
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
I want to hear the clang

697
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,320
You really ate it

698
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,280
These are porcelain (teeth)

699
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Really ate it

700
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,600
Porcelain

701
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,080
Usually when you talk while eating

702
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,920
the meat should be on this side

703
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,040
But the sound you made just now

704
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,360
felt like the meat was in the middle

705
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,080
Meat in the middle

706
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,280
Yeah, the way you spoke

707
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,120
sounded like the meat was in the middle

708
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,440
Why did they make you chew while eating

709
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,200
Chewing while eating

710
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,840
Right, how could it be in the middle when chewing

711
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,800
That's it

712
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,320
That's it

713
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah

714
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,320
That's the sound

715
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,600
I really ate it

716
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,160
Really ate it

717
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
So who do you think it is

718
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,000
I think Honglei bro is a bit suspicious

719
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,640
And

720
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,840
Do you think He looks like it

721
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,520
I forgot

722
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,040
Actually, I

723
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,520
I really forgot who went before you guys

724
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,920
You know

725
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,000
Is it the one who doesn't like eating

726
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,120
We all know each other

727
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,520
Yeah

728
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,360
No wonder

729
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,360
So who do you think the two are

730
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,080
You two

731
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,000
Just selling him out like that

732
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,920
He was defending you

733
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,960
He helped me

734
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
It must be you two

735
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,000
What if it's not us

736
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,960
It's not

737
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,800
I'll eat all of this

738
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,720
Really

739
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,240
You said it

740
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Okay

741
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,080
There are two people

742
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,960
You say

743
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
See if I think the same as you

744
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,320
Yuning bro and you

745
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040
Exactly the same

746
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,520
Me

747
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
I thought the same

748
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,760
I thought so too

749
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,320
Is it exactly what you thought

750
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,480
Okay, now this game is interesting

751
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,960
Let me tell you

752
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,760
It's really fun

753
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,840
I have a different idea

754
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Go ahead, tell us, bro

755
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,720
Big bro, go ahead

756
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,520
Which two did you just say

757
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
You didn't even hear which two we said

758
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,520
How do you have a different idea

759
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,360
Can I use my hands?

760
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
I don't even want to curse anymore

761
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,720
Then I heard wrong

762
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Then I'm the same as you guys

763
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,360
What if we lose

764
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,760
Castells (Human Towers)

765
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Castells (Human Towers)

766
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,680
Do you stack with yourself?

767
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,960
Just two people stacking

768
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,200
I am

769
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,000
I revealed it before you said it

770
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,280
Doesn't count

771
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,480
I am

772
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,240
How about it

773
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,120
It should be like this

774
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
Slice a piece of garlic

775
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,680
After two people chew, they breathe at each other

776
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,360
I think the one who ate the garlic

777
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,280
must be one of us

778
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,520
Yeah

779
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,040
Yeah

780
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,200
Come on, let's find out

781
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,800
Which two is it, really

782
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,680
Let's vote

783
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,560
Raise your hand if you vote for Yuning

784
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,800
Following the vote again

785
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,200
Raise your hand if you think it's Naiwen bro

786
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Okay, one vote

787
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
Raise your hand if you think it's Jinjing

788
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,760
Okay

789
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,720
Raise your hand if you think it's He bro

790
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,960
Thought you were chatting with me

791
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,080
So I'd miss raising my hand

792
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,760
Should I turn around?

793
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,280
Don't turn

794
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,440
Don't turn

795
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,320
Everyone raised their hand

796
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,240
It's really spicy

797
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,960
This garlic is spicy

798
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,560
No

799
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,040
Who's punishing whom here

800
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
This is so spicy

801
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,960
These two, raise your hands

802
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,520
Alright

803
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,280
Come on, raise your hand

804
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,520
Stop pretending

805
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,480
Honglei bro, raise your hand

806
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,440
I'm not playing along for the show

807
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
It really is you two

808
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,760
Alright, I

809
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay, I'll try Naiwen bro's

810
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,800
Did Honglei bro just eat garlic?

811
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,600
Xingxu ate it

812
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,880
You mean us two

813
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,800
Already fed

814
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,920
Hold it in

815
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,080
That's terrifying

816
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,600
Horror movie

817
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,840
So spicy

818
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,280
Come on

819
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,960
One person is enough

820
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,800
What are you two doing

821
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,800
No, someone has to hold you down

822
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,440
Yuning

823
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,880
Yuning

824
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,680
It's really uncomfortable, Yuning

825
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,040
It'll be very uncomfortable

826
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
What's this?

827
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,640
What's this?

828
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,040
Okay.

829
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,480
One round of this is enough, right?

830
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,160
You think it's easy for us?

831
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
Just to mess with them.

832
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,360
Come on.

833
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,040
After this, let's play an upgraded round.

834
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,560
Here's how we do it.

835
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,320
Split into two teams, sit in the gaps.

836
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,680
Guessing team and eating team.

837
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,840
Pick a food to eat.

838
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
Among the four in the eating team,

839
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
choose one as the undercover.

840
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
Only the undercover eats.

841
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
The rest cooperate.

842
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,920
Help the undercover finish the food.

843
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,360
Guessing team closes eyes and asks questions.

844
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,280
By listening,

845
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,800
try to guess who the undercover is.

846
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,360
Okay.

847
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,720
I think it's still us four.

848
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
Our original group.

849
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I think we're unbeatable.

850
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,640
Sure.

851
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,320
Just us.

852
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,440
You scared me.

853
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,920
Come on, fill the seats.

854
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
You two just swap, that's it.

855
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,560
You swap with me.

856
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,120
Okay.

857
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Then I think you guys lost.

858
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,080
Naiwen, your team open your eyes first.

859
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,880
You decide what their team eats.

860
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
It's that instant noodles.

861
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,200
Yeah, these instant noodles.

862
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,640
Right.

863
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,280
Instant noodles.

864
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,920
It's hard to swallow.

865
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,720
If you eat it dry.

866
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,760
But let me tell you,

867
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,680
if you add hot water,

868
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,600
it softens instantly.

869
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,680
Then you lose the crunch.

870
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,560
No hot water, bro.

871
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,320
Bro, you want to cook it longer?

872
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,560
Add an egg for you too?

873
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,360
Come on.

874
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,920
Guessing team, please close your eyes.

875
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,880
Okay, you four discuss

876
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,760
who will be the undercover.

877
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,120
Jin Jing, you can't eat.

878
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,040
Or I can eat.

879
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,840
Is it okay if I eat?

880
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,280
If you say you'll eat,

881
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,560
then it's definitely not you.

882
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:37,920
You do it.

883
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,040
Then He will eat.

884
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,600
Let He eat.

885
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,360
He eats, okay.

886
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,160
Alright, He will eat.

887
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Then I'll...

888
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,040
...eat.

889
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,840
Can He eat?

890
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,040
Yes.

891
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,320
It's fine.

892
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Alright.

893
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,680
Let's go.

894
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,320
Can we ask them questions?

895
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,840
Of course you can.

896
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay.

897
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,920
Come on, give it to me.

898
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Here you go.

899
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,360
Give me a bit more.

900
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,600
Wait a second.

901
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,360
Who's eating now?

902
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,320
There's some noise.

903
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,600
There's noise here too.

904
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,560
Jin Jing.

905
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,000
What?

906
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,600
Why are you all so funny?

907
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,040
Chew a bit.

908
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,360
He.

909
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,560
He.

910
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,840
Say something.

911
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,760
What's the flavor?

912
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,760
Okay.

913
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,200
Didi.

914
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,200
Didi.

915
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,920
Sing a song.

916
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,200
Why isn't Jin Jing talking?

917
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,560
Jin Jing.

918
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,080
Jin Jing, are you still there?

919
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,840
I'm here.

920
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm here.

921
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,760
Finished eating?

922
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm here.

923
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,280
How much is left?

924
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,840
Ning.

925
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,240
Say something.

926
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,200
Say what?

927
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
You ate, right?

928
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,320
Yes.

929
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,080
Sing while you eat.

930
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
I've been eating the whole time.

931
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,560
I've eaten a lot.

932
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,120
Sing a song.

933
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,760
Three parts fate.

934
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
Seven parts hard work.

935
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,720
Only those who strive will win.

936
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
He, do you know this song?

937
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,800
"Only Those Who Strive Will Win"

938
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,080
Yes.

939
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,920
Go ahead, sing.

940
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,440
Three parts fate.

941
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,320
Seven parts hard work.

942
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Only those who strive will win.

943
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,320
Jing.

944
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,600
Jin Jing, seriously.

945
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,320
Drink some water.

946
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,280
It's pretty dry.

947
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,560
Let Jin Jing drink some water.

948
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,320
Choked.

949
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,040
Really choked while eating.

950
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,440
Wait a second.

951
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Jin Jing, let me tell you,

952
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
when you eat,

953
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,960
the noise is hard to control sometimes.

954
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,520
Doesn't matter.

955
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,840
Don't drop crumbs on the plate.

956
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,600
You know?

957
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,600
Pretty dry, right?

958
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,200
Can we open our eyes now?

959
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,240
Is it done?

960
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,560
So, is it okay now?

961
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,960
Alright, open your eyes.

962
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Okay, come on.

963
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
The flatbread in front of you

964
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,080
has already been secretly eaten.

965
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,000
It's all gone.

966
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,360
Didi, I see yours

967
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
has none left.

968
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,120
Not a single piece left.

969
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
That's way too suspicious.

970
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,320
Look, they all have some.

971
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,280
They do.

972
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,200
If there's some,

973
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,600
it means they didn't eat.

974
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,800
If there's some, they didn't eat.

975
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,520
Who else is over there?

976
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,520
Yuning, right?

977
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,840
Ningning, take a look.

978
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,920
Yuning definitely didn't eat.

979
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,600
I definitely didn't eat.

980
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,040
Because the way he spoke just now

981
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,040
was just like when he secretly ate steak

982
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,080
or pretended not to eat steak before.

983
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,200
Alright.

984
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,800
I vote for that one.

985
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,760
I vote for Didi.

986
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,600
I also think it's Didi.

987
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,080
Me too.

988
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,360
I think it's Jin Jing.

989
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,760
Vote, just vote.

990
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,080
Wait a second.

991
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:19,920
How about this, bro—

992
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,760
Can we only win if we vote for the right person?

993
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,600
Is that okay?

994
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,960
That works.

995
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,320
Right?

996
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,040
If you vote wrong, you lose.

997
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,640
Vote wrong, you lose.

998
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,120
Yes.

999
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,320
Go ahead, Naiwen.

1000
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,520
I vote for Jin Jing.

1001
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,920
Alright, Honglei.

1002
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,760
Didi.

1003
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,240
Okay.

1004
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,520
Alright, Xingxu.

1005
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,520
Okay.

1006
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,720
The undercover this round

1007
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,760
is Didi.

1008
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,440
The undercover this round

1009
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
is Didi.

1010
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,680
You're the smart one.

1011
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,280
Otherwise, Naiwen would have blended in and won.

1012
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,040
That's right.

1013
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,920
Gotta drag someone down with you.

1014
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,960
Pull one in if you can, right?

1015
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,760
Pull one in if you can.

1016
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,280
Gotta get at least one, right?

1017
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
We miscalculated.

1018
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
Should've left some here.

1019
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,240
I ate too cleanly.

1020
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,960
Alright, next group.

1021
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,560
Next group eats that big piece.

1022
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,960
Their brains react too fast.

1023
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
These people are super sneaky.

1024
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,360
These people—

1025
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,800
Eat this piece.

1026
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,280
This one?

1027
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,440
Mine was just this big.

1028
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,040
Yeah, this piece.

1029
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
So you all have to eat one this big too.

1030
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
You guys eat this piece.

1031
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,960
You have to eat this.

1032
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,800
Alright.

1033
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:16,920
Come on.

1034
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,520
Come on.

1035
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,240
Three, two, one—close your eyes.

1036
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,960
Come on, the four of us over here.

1037
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,280
Let's split up, okay?

1038
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,360
Why are they going out to split up?

1039
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,480
Who's the undercover among us?

1040
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,720
Who is it?

1041
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,320
It's you.

1042
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:30,960
They're pointing.

1043
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,080
Should we pick the undercover?

1044
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,720
Yeah.

1045
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,360
You.

1046
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,440
Then—

1047
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,760
This one.

1048
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,560
I think—

1049
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Alright, I'll do it.

1050
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,280
Then you do it.

1051
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,600
I'll do it.

1052
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,120
They're pointing at him, right?

1053
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,240
I'll go get the instant noodles.

1054
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
Come on, let's gather together.

1055
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,360
Gather up, come on.

1056
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
Gather up, come on.

1057
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
Don't leave the table.

1058
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,440
We won't leave the table.

1059
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,240
Don't worry.

1060
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,520
You all have to eat too.

1061
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,840
Save me some.

1062
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,760
Don't snatch.

1063
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,040
Why are you snatching?

1064
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,320
If you fight for it

1065
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,480
you'll win.

1066
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,480
You have to come back and eat for it to count.

1067
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,800
Who's this one on my side?

1068
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,960
I have no idea who this is.

1069
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,160
Naiwen, it's definitely Naiwen.

1070
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,120
Definitely Naiwen.

1071
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,600
Chen Xingxu, say something.

1072
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,480
Say something.

1073
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,720
Yeah, you should speak now.

1074
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,760
He's here.

1075
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,320
He's right here.

1076
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,600
He's here.

1077
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:36,760
Xingxu.

1078
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,200
Tell us, what did you eat, Xingxu?

1079
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,280
Noodles.

1080
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,280
So do you have instant noodles in your mouth?

1081
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,840
No.

1082
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,760
Then eat two more bites.

1083
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,680
It's him.

1084
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,200
I think it might be him.

1085
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,200
Have a couple more bites.

1086
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,560
It's definitely him.

1087
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,200
Where's Lin Yi?

1088
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:54,880
Lin Yi's here.

1089
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,400
But I don't think he ate.

1090
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,560
He didn't eat, he's next to me.

1091
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,040
I didn't eat.

1092
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
He's fiddling with the noodles next to me.

1093
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,240
The left side is full.

1094
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Honglei.

1095
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,520
Are you eating?

1096
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,960
Choked, right?

1097
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,840
I'm already done eating.

1098
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,880
Think about it.

1099
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,280
Am I still eating now?

1100
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,719
You definitely didn't eat.

1101
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
Honglei definitely didn't eat.

1102
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,040
You should've rinsed with hot water.

1103
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,920
Here, "old lady."

1104
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,960
Here's a cup of hot water for you.

1105
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,239
Thank you.

1106
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,760
Take a sip.

1107
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,159
That's nice.

1108
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,679
Did you all finish eating or not?

1109
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,560
Are you done eating?

1110
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,480
Finished.

1111
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,520
Finished, Xuxu.

1112
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,840
Okay, open your eyes.

1113
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,040
Is it you?

1114
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,920
His mouth is really clean.

1115
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,480
It's not him.

1116
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,600
He, who do you think it is?

1117
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,080
Lin Yi's mouth is clean.

1118
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,199
It shouldn't be Lin Yi.

1119
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,000
Open your mouth.

1120
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
Show your porcelain teeth.

1121
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,600
Serves you right.

1122
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,440
Give us a smile.

1123
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,320
No, you have to show your teeth.

1124
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,240
He won't show me his front teeth.

1125
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,240
Eat some ham.

1126
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,560
Xuxu, come here.

1127
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,440
Take a bite.

1128
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Why won't you open your mouth, bro?

1129
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,920
No, that's not allowed.

1130
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,680
You can't eat ham right now.

1131
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,080
Just take a bite.

1132
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Wait, if you eat ham now—

1133
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,560
Then his mouth will have ham in it.

1134
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,480
No, it has to be the noodles.

1135
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,000
It's definitely Xuxu.

1136
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,520
Take a bite.

1137
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,480
Just one bite, that's it.

1138
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,840
You won't even open your mouth.

1139
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,880
He won't open his mouth either.

1140
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,720
Does he have nothing in his hand?

1141
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
Not a bit.

1142
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,760
What about the floor?

1143
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,720
On his pants?

1144
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,080
Didn't see anything there either.

1145
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,320
Only the one who ate

1146
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,240
would be this clean.

1147
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,120
True, I think it's possible.

1148
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,760
Let's go with that.

1149
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,880
I'll pick Xuxu.

1150
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,280
Then I'll guess Xuxu.

1151
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,320
Then it's him.

1152
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,920
It's him.

1153
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,320
I'll pick him too.

1154
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,400
I think it might be him.

1155
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Congratulations.

1156
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,720
Congrats to the undercover.

1157
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,040
Total victory.

1158
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,440
Who is it?

1159
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,360
No idea.

1160
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,520
We lost.

1161
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,120
It's Honglei.

1162
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
So it's you.

1163
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,120
He really used chocolate sauce.

1164
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,680
Guess again, everyone.

1165
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,320
Naiwen, it's definitely Naiwen.

1166
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,280
Turns out it really is me.

1167
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,200
Isn't that hiding your skills?

1168
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Isn't that true generosity?

1169
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,240
Gave away all my smarts.

1170
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,280
Yeah, earlier we—

1171
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,960
That's true.

1172
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,200
How did you eat it?

1173
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,720
Teach me how.

1174
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,960
Let it melt.

1175
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Melt it raw.

1176
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,880
No, I get it now.

1177
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
We won with brains.

1178
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,440
They won with action.

1179
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
"World's 50 Best Restaurants"

1180
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,480
This tastes great.

1181
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,840
Fried is the best, folks.

1182
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,000
I've never tasted this texture or flavor.

1183
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,880
This show is amazing.

1184
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,560
First challenge is a tongue twister.

1185
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,320
Red carp and Li carp.

1186
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,880
And the donkey.

1187
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,320
Wrong.

1188
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
And the donkey—isn't that right?

1189
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Loves homemade milk.

1190
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,320
Mainstay.

1191
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,960
Wrong.

1192
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,920
Wrong again.

1193
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,960
All wrong.

1194
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,280
I've got a strategy too.

1195
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,920
When it's my turn—

1196
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,680
After I say it once,

1197
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,080
You guys repeat it word by word.

1198
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,760
Come on, friends.

1199
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,960
No more practice, let's go for it.

1200
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,280
Look with your eyes open.

1201
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,000
Grab with your eyes closed.

1202
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,680
I'm looking for male and female.

1203
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Yuning is big.

1204
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's move back.

1205
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Back up.

1206
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,840
Back up.

1207
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,160
Wait a second.

1208
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,440
Where are you guys?

1209
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,360
Who hit me?

1210
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,200
Dimples and long lashes.

1211
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,160
Who are you?

1212
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,480
Who's this?

1213
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,040
Not running, not running.
