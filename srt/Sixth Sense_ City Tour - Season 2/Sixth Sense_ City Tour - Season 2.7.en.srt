1
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,139
You left your hair down today. It looks beautiful.

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,439
Yes, it looks pretty.

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,410
Mimi, your youth is lovely.

4
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,840
- I'm getting old too.
- Right.

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,550
Seok Jin, you aren't wearing a jacket today either.

6
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,519
No, I'm not.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
(These two aren't wearing jackets.)

8
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,350
I have a lot of body heat.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,689
- I seriously do.
- Me too.

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,989
- Right? I don't get cold.
- Yes.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,460
It's because you're wearing thermal underwear.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,890
Hey, I'm not wearing any thermal underwear.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,729
You're wearing layers of clothes underneath.

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,259
No, I'm only wearing a white T-shirt.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,629
- It must be thermal wear.
- Thermal wear.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,969
(No, I'm wearing a regular white T-shirt.)

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,299
Today's City Tour will take place in Paju.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,000
- Paju.
- When it comes to Paju...

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,370
(The 7th city on Sixth Sense: City Tour 2 is Paju.)

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,079
(Embracing the Imjin River)

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,579
(In the northernmost point of Gyeonggi Province)

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,749
(Natural attractions)

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,119
(Heyri Art Village)

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,380
(The only publishing complex in the country)

25
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,150
(Paju, where knowledge and culture come together)

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,990
(The one and only fake in Paju that will shock everyone)

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,930
(Unbelievable)

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,400
(On an unprecedented scale)

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,340
(It left everyone in shock.)

30
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,070
(What is today's fake hidden in Paju?)

31
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,579
Do you know what kind of place Heyri is?

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,739
Of course I do.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,349
- Originally, it was built...
- You know it well.

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,850
as a cultural village for artists.

35
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,479
- You can find architects here.
- Right.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,820
People in music and art all gathered here.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,120
It originally started as an artists' village.

38
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,119
(Different exhibitions...)

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,829
(and performance take place in Heyri Art Village.)

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,229
The scenery is different.

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,059
There are many places to visit.

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,229
- Right.
- Yes.

43
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,529
- Don't you get cold easily?
- This place is nice.

44
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,930
The air is different here.

45
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,140
- How is it different?
- It's very different.

46
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,599
- Can't you feel it?
- Tell us more specifically.

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,069
- We're curious.
- Can't you tell by the smell?

48
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,909
- Really?
- It's because...

49
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,639
he has a wide nose.

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,810
He has a keen sense of smell.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,579
Among everyone in their 60s,

52
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,049
Seok Jin is someone Mimi is at ease the most.

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,449
- Mimi.
- I feel comfortable around him.

54
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,519
- Aren't I like your friend?
- Yes.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,449
- Call me Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

56
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,189
(Seok Jin...)

57
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,449
She doesn't hesitate. She does it right away.

58
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,690
- She goes beyond the generation.
- Seok Jin.

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,959
- Seriously, Mimi...
- Right.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,889
- She doesn't go back.
- She doesn't.

61
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,029
- I only go forward.
- That's good.

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,359
Here's the map for this week.

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay.

64
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,100
"Drama City Paju."

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,229
What's this?

66
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,440
- "Drama City Paju?" - Yes.

67
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,070
(The 7th theme, Drama City in Paju)

68
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,470
"Reply 1988?"

69
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,910
"Six Flying Dragons?"

70
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,110
"Secret Garden."

71
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,949
("Reply 1988")

72
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,350
(Sun Woo, let's eat.)

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,850
(The entire neighborhood shared food.)

74
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,120
(Back when we gathered to share homemade meals together)

75
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,290
(Nostalgic homemade food?)

76
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,629
(Or like when the amount of food was the measure of one's heart)

77
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,670
(A restaurant that competes with quantity?)

78
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,200
(What is Reply 1988?)

79
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,500
("Six Flying Dragons")

80
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,870
(Six dragons woke up.)

81
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,980
(6 chefs born in the Year of the Dragon appeared?)

82
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,150
(Or a restaurant created by 6 stars born in the Year of the Dragon?)

83
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,290
(What is Six Flying Dragons?)

84
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,620
("Secret Garden")

85
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,790
(Do you remember the secret restaurant in "Secret Garden?")

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,000
(A mysterious restaurant in an unexpected spot like in a drama?)

87
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,999
(Or like a foam kiss in a famous scene...)

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,870
(that made everyone's heart flutter)

89
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,110
(A restaurant that uses foam?)

90
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,010
(Among today's drama themes, which is fake?)

91
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,950
"Reply 1988."

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,849
- It's related to you.
- Kyung Pyo.

93
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,019
Were you in "Reply 1994?"

94
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,920
He just said "Reply 1988."

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,789
(Please understand him.)

96
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,389
- He doesn't listen to others.
- I know.

97
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,620
Look how my ears are attached.

98
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,059
Remember what Min Kyung said?

99
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,460
- I'll bring some tape.
- No, it's okay.

100
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,599
(I'll bring some tape to raise the ears.)

101
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,799
It's okay. I prefer them like this.

102
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,829
(It's okay. I like my ears.)

103
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,439
In "Six Flying Dragons" soundtrack,

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,840
didn't Taeyeon sing one of the songs?

105
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,210
(I don't know.)

106
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,280
Didn't Taeyeon sing the theme song?

107
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,079
- Did Taeyeon sing for that drama?
- Wasn't that...

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,350
"Beethoven Virus?"

109
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,549
- Just ignore it.
- Am I wrong?

110
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,119
- Forget it. I'm sure I'm right.
- I think both of you are wrong.

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,019
You know that famous song in "Six Flying Dragons?"

112
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
It's by Taeyeon.

113
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,989
Did Taeyeon sing the soundtrack of "Six Flying Dragons?"

114
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,060
(He ends up bringing out the AI.)

115
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,029
(Taeyeon didn't participate in the soundtrack of "Six Flying Dragons.")

116
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,130
Thank you.

117
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,260
- That was simple.
- You were wrong.

118
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,469
It was nice and simple.

119
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,029
- Why did I think that?
- It made itself clear.

120
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,799
I have a lot of wrong information. Besides, it's a historical drama.

121
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,040
- You were close.
- You wasted our time.

122
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,510
I was just trying to break the ice.

123
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,710
You punk.

124
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,210
We should warm up our tongues.

125
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,649
Why would we need an icebreaker among us?

126
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,880
I was trying to break the ice.

127
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,649
- Shall we get going?
- Let's go.

128
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,750
- We'll go to meet the guests.
- Okay.

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,920
- Coffee sounds delicious today.
- It will be warm.

130
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,390
- That sounds perfect.
- I'll have some hot chocolate.

131
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,289
Autumn passed by so fast.

132
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,829
This is it. I've only heard about it.

133
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,629
- What is it?
- It belongs to Hwang In Yong.

134
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,630
Is this the place?

135
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,770
(Hwang In Yong's classical music listening room)

136
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,299
Do you know who Hwang In Yong is?

137
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
- No.
- I don't know.

138
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:33,269
- You don't know him?
- He's someone famous.

139
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,179
He started as an announcer, and he was a deejay for a long time.

140
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,639
- He was also a deejay.
- A deejay?

141
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,980
He has a great voice.

142
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,079
(What is this place that he built?)

143
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,590
(While listening to classical music,)

144
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,019
(you can also enjoy coffee.)

145
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,160
(A cafe and a music listening room)

146
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,289
Director Park Chan Wook comes here very often.

147
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,960
(A place where Director Park Chan Wook likes to visit)

148
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,600
(A popular place that's visited by many even during the week)

149
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
There's a great vibe here.

150
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,939
Look how everything is artistic and unique.

151
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,570
- I feel like we're abroad.
- Nothing looks the same.

152
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,810
- This place feels exotic.
- It's an artists' village.

153
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,009
There are also many adorable accessory shops.

154
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,880
- Right.
- It's fun being here.

155
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,310
I'll be going on a shopping spree today.

156
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,419
Mimi is speaking her language again.

157
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,719
- You mean you'll be shopping?
- Yes, a shopping spree.

158
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
This must be it.

159
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,220
- Isn't someone here?
- Someone is here.

160
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
Where?

161
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,930
They must be cold over there.

162
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,060
- Where?
- They're sitting outside.

163
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,129
They're pretending not to know. Where are they?

164
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,700
(The guests are waiting while pretending not to know.)

165
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,070
- They're sitting down.
- Where?

166
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,399
- There are two.
- Here?

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,540
- They're men.
- There are two.

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
They look quite young.

169
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
(You can tell that they're young.)

170
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,010
- They're young people.
- Who are they? From the back...

171
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,379
- Hello.
- Hello.

172
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,439
It's you.

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,580
(The 7th guest, DAY6)

174
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,350
- Hello.
- Gosh.

175
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,189
(DAY6, the Force Behind the Band Boom...)

176
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,520
(Ranks 1st in the Increase of Number of Views in Korea)

177
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,659
(A talented band where all members write and compose songs)

178
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,229
(An audience of 80,000 at Goyang Stadium)

179
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,499
(The first domestic band to perform at Gocheok Sky Dome)

180
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,800
(Whenever they hold a concert, tickets are sold out.)

181
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,969
(DAY6, a band you can trust and listen to)

182
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,839
(Bass, voice, rap by Young K, keyboard and voice by Wonpil)

183
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,579
- Isn't it our first time meeting?
- Nice to meet you.

184
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,849
This is DAY6.

185
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,909
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

186
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,149
- Hello.
- Hello.

187
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,349
- It's been such a long time.
- I know.

188
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,389
You must know each other.

189
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,450
- Of course.
- We were in a group together.

190
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,619
We've worked in a group together.

191
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,689
(Members of a group called One Top)

192
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,029
Let's sit somewhere.

193
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,089
I'll go inside.

194
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,189
Okay.

195
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,199
(The entire group for City Tour in Paju is here.)

196
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,930
- Young K.
- Yes?

197
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,899
- You're Young K, right?
- Right.

198
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,599
I'm Old J.

199
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,469
(Nice to meet you. I'm Old J.)

200
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,339
- Remember Haha's song?
- Right.

201
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,569
Young K didn't have time to sing the beginning part of Haha's song,

202
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,570
so I sang it instead.

203
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:51,079
- I see.
- Thank you for singing my part.

204
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I enjoyed watching it.

205
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
- Did you watch it?
- Yes.

206
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,479
I sang it in a lower key by half.

207
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,949
DAY6 is good at singing everything.

208
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,579
- Right. All their songs are good.
- Thank you.

209
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,850
- They're really nice.
- I agree.

210
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,589
Let's have a drink.

211
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,119
That sounds great. I'd love to.

212
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,190
You're saying it like we're about to drink alcohol.

213
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,359
- I've wanted to drink something.
- This place has a vibe.

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,129
I know. It's really amazing here.

215
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,159
(What is this place with a great vibe?)

216
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,799
(A cultural cafe that provides hot tea in Heyri Art Village)

217
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Is this place...

218
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,169
It looks antique.

219
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,170
(The interior is antique with a wooden color.)

220
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,080
(A variety of teacups just like at a teahouse)

221
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,649
It's a popular, free cafe that opened recently.

222
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,179
- What kind of cafe?
- A free cafe.

223
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,419
- You mean the beverages?
- The beverages are free?

224
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,819
- Do you mean "free?" - Free.

225
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,549
- How could this be free?
- How could it be free?

226
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,819
How is that possible?

227
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,719
They need to make a profit. If they don't make money...

228
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,289
Sir, is this place free?

229
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,130
It's an artists' cafe where everything is free.

230
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,600
Then how do you run this place?

231
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,899
I get sponsorships from elsewhere.

232
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,029
(Thinking)

233
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,370
Let me explain.

234
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,569
(The presence of an artist)

235
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,769
Among people at Heyri Art Village,

236
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,709
- there are artists.
- Right.

237
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,679
- All of them earn a lot of money.
- Yes.

238
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,109
A painting can sell for 50,000 to 100,000 dollars.

239
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,579
- Our economy has grown a lot.
- Right.

240
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,819
Like people abroad, we should also run free cafes.

241
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,850
- I mean, the artists.
- My gosh.

242
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,249
That's why we came together.

243
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,989
(Respecting)

244
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,519
(Clapping)

245
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,229
There's trash thrown away in Heyri, right?

246
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,560
Everything in here was found in the trash.

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,229
- All of these were trash?
- There were trash before?

248
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,729
- All of them were trash.
- They were?

249
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,799
Everything.

250
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,929
(Thrown away objects are reborn as interior decoration items.)

251
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,639
I made all of these myself.

252
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,499
- That's amazing.
- Seriously?

253
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,670
(Thrown away objects are reborn as interior decoration items.)

254
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,739
I'm a fashion designer.

255
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,939
(That's why he has that presence.)

256
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,979
I knew it.

257
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,109
(Smiling)

258
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,710
I went bankrupt in China...

259
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,150
because of COVID.

260
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,349
(Well...)

261
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,190
Why are you laughing? I went bankrupt.

262
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,849
It's because you said it so delightfully.

263
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,919
It's because I got to meet you, Jae Seok.

264
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,589
I feel delighted.

265
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,289
May I shake your hand? I'm your fan.

266
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,199
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
- Sir.
- Yes?

268
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,499
You're amazing.

269
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,429
- Seriously. You're amazing.
- Right.

270
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,640
- I'm impressed. It's so romantic.
- It's amazing.

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,300
This place is very romantic.

272
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,699
- Here you go.
- Yes.

273
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,409
I prepared it especially for you.

274
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,339
- What's this?
- It looks vintage.

275
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,939
- That? It's...
- Yes.

276
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,810
a 300-year-old cup used by an emperor in the Qing Dynasty.

277
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,710
Is that so?

278
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,720
The cup is warm.

279
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,419
(A 300-year-old cup of an emperor in the Qing Dynasty)

280
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,689
This was made 150 years ago...

281
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,789
in Yongchon. It's the original cup.

282
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,360
- Really?
- It's 150 years old.

283
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,659
A hundred and fifty years?

284
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,630
(A 150-year-old cup, a 300-year-old cup)

285
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,999
- And this is 300 years old?
- It's 300 years old.

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,669
That was used by the king. This was used by officials...

287
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,840
Why did you give it only to Jae Seok?

288
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,070
Aren't you playing favorites?

289
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,739
(Am I destined to be a king?)

290
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,940
I had 2 of them, but 1 of them broke.

291
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,180
- That's unfortunate.
- Oh, no.

292
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
This is...

293
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,449
- 60-year-old Pu'er tea.
- Pu'er tea.

294
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,119
- I only have this much left.
- Pu'er tea.

295
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,219
(Tea from Yunnan Province, China that's fermented and aged)

296
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,319
(The sweet and strong flavor depends on the degree of fermentation.)

297
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
It's fermented for a long time.

298
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,830
It's very expensive. This much can cost 1,000 dollars.

299
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,759
- You know exactly.
- Right?

300
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,099
It's sold dry, isn't it?

301
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,029
Pu'er tea of good quality can cost...

302
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,970
- around 14,000 to 15,000 dollars.
- Right.

303
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,739
(The price makes them tremble.)

304
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,840
- Just this much?
- Yes.

305
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,969
He's making Pu'er tea for us.

306
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,510
He does it very well with skills.

307
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,339
- He's very charming.
- It's like his charm is flowing.

308
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,880
- He even pours it with one hand.
- Right.

309
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,549
Please drink this if you'd like more.

310
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,550
Sir, it smells lovely.

311
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,949
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

312
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,280
(We will enjoy the tea.)

313
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,849
(Relaxing with some warm tea)

314
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,289
(Failed)

315
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,190
- It's hot.
- Be careful.

316
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,890
(Quietly)

317
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,930
How is it?

318
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't drink it now.

319
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,170
- Isn't it too hot?
- It's too hot to drink.

320
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,670
(On the other hand, Wonpil drinks it easily.)

321
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,399
It smells wonderful.

322
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,169
- What do you think, Wonpil?
- It's great.

323
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,409
The weather is chilly today.

324
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,039
- Doesn't it warm up your body?
- It melts my body.

325
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,110
(Doesn't it warm up the body?)

326
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,050
(He also takes a warm sip.)

327
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,210
(He drinks it from the king's cup.)

328
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,519
(Is this the king's flavor?)

329
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,719
On top of that, we're drinking in cups that are 150 years old.

330
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,089
- Yours is 300 years old.
- Mine is 300 years old.

331
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,190
Ours is 150 years old.

332
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
(He's 100 percent upset.)

333
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:58,989
(Chuckling)

334
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,990
Let's drink.

335
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,659
(Regardless of the age, let's enjoy it warm.)

336
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,800
One hundred and fifty years?

337
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,969
(Warm tea is perfect when it's cold.)

338
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,439
DAY6, now that you're done with the concert,

339
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,369
- Yes.
- what have you been up to?

340
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,610
We're getting ready for another concert.

341
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,839
That's awesome. That's great.

342
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,580
DAY6 became much more popular than before.

343
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,649
- All their tickets are sold out.
- They're sold out.

344
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,849
You can't buy tickets to their concert.

345
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,249
- I heard that it was impossible.
- A band that can fill...

346
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,249
Goyang Stadium is rare.

347
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,419
(All tickets of 40,000 seats were sold out.)

348
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,419
Here's a funny story. I was on a trip in Vietnam.

349
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,359
The girlfriend of my friend I was traveling with is...

350
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,530
a huge fan of DAY6. She's also my friend.

351
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,999
The Internet speed in Vietnam is slower than in Korea.

352
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,430
She asked us to buy her ticket too.

353
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,169
We were on our phone on a bridge in Vietnam.

354
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,339
(Buying tickets to DAY6's concert on a bridge in a foreign country)

355
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,140
(My goodness...)

356
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,939
- Did you succeed or not?
- We failed.

357
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,270
He failed.

358
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,209
(Oh, no...)

359
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,309
Buying tickets can be a bloodbath.

360
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,179
- Let's go there first.
- Let's go.

361
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,949
Thank you, sir. We enjoyed it.

362
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,980
(Let's get going now.)

363
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,449
- You're walking so harmoniously.
- I agree.

364
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,719
- You look harmonious together.
- We were talking about something.

365
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,689
- We were having a secret talk.
- We were talking in private.

366
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,620
- You were having a secret talk?
- Yes.

367
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,889
- Here's what we were saying.
- Okay.

368
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,330
DAY6 is...

369
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,159
- They have so many fans.
- amazing.

370
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,499
- Thank you.
- Also,

371
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,729
Park Jin Young...

372
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,799
I'm very jealous of him.

373
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,940
Me too.

374
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,939
Park Jin Young... Don't you know him very well?

375
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,410
I know him very well.

376
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,109
All you need is four DAY6 members on stage...

377
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,449
- Right.
- with their instruments.

378
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,479
That's true.

379
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,749
- They write and compose songs.
- They can do everything.

380
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,320
- It's convenient for the agency.
- Right.

381
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,220
My goodness.

382
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,320
Gosh, the audio source...

383
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,889
- Gosh, the audio source...
- must be nice.

384
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,919
"Gosh, the audio source..."

385
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,060
Mimi, you must know because you're also a singer.

386
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,930
Their music royalties would be...

387
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,699
(An exclaiming choir)

388
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,229
- In many ways...
- That's enormous.

389
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,239
They're the best.

390
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,869
You live as a consumer...

391
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,769
and a listener all your life.

392
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,770
(Today's City Tour with DAY6)

393
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,580
It's nice to be back in Heyri after a long time.

394
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,109
- Over here...
- There's also a clothing shop.

395
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,750
- There are many clothing shops.
- Yes.

396
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,520
(When you walk around, you see hip-looking clothing stores)

397
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,780
- There are many accessory shops.
- It's nice.

398
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,350
- It's a sacred place for the art.
- Yes.

399
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,720
It's a wonderful place to walk around.

400
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,989
It must be so difficult for him.

401
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,360
He's carrying a clock.

402
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,429
My goodness.

403
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,799
(Someone who's carrying a clock pathetically)

404
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,070
Unless you'll help him out, don't say anything.

405
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,839
His mouth is open all day long.

406
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
- It must be so painful.
- Exactly.

407
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,210
If you put it that way, how would you live in this world?

408
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,209
It's my artistic temperament.

409
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,210
"Artistic temperament?"

410
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:33,649
How is that an artistic temperament?

411
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,779
Isn't it something like that?

412
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,149
The ground must be in pain because we're stepping on it.

413
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,120
It has its way of supporting our weight.

414
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,890
- Is this the place?
- It's a brunch cafe.

415
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,319
- This can't be fake.
- Has it started?

416
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,289
- How could this be fake?
- Wait a minute.

417
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,329
(The first popular place, Reply 1988)

418
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,029
How is this related...

419
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,560
- to "Reply 1988?" - You're right.

420
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,029
Do they serve food that appeared in "Reply 1988?"

421
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,299
(Do they serve food that appeared in the drama?)

422
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,369
It's this way.

423
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,569
(They enter with suspicion.)

424
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,739
Has it started already?

425
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,710
- Yes, it's starting now.
- It's starting.

426
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,080
Why would this place be...

427
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,479
It looks amazing.

428
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,849
(Exclaiming)

429
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,690
Is the general theme of this place...

430
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,590
a retro style?

431
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,559
It has the vibe of "Reply 1988."

432
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,620
(It's like "Reply 1988.")

433
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,860
(Like an upscale restaurant in the 80s,)

434
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,200
(it's recreated the same atmosphere.)

435
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,199
It looks really beautiful.

436
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
(A popular place in Paju)

437
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,370
- Isn't it the vibe of "Reply 1988?" - That's exactly it.

438
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,739
Aren't these chairs...

439
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,480
- really retro?
- These are real.

440
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,879
(A place full of retro items)

441
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,909
Unbelievable.

(Reply 1988 in Heyri Art Village)

444
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,690
- By the way, - Yes?

445
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,959
this restaurant could be real.

446
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,689
- The owner could be fake.
- The menu could be fake...

447
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,629
- Exactly. Or the theme.
- or the owner.

448
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,659
Or the theme.

449
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,000
We have to pay attention to the theme of this place.

450
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,799
That must be it.

451
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
This is fake.

452
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:00,929
- "Basket pizza." - Right?

453
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,930
This is fake.

454
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,199
- "Basket pizza." - Right?

455
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,070
I also found it a little fishy.

456
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,210
It was created for the accessory.

457
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,479
This is perfect for decoration.

458
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,509
Like ice cream bar latte.

459
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,750
It looks obvious.

460
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,079
Those photos...

461
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,519
- of historical figures in the past.
- Right.

462
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,190
They look somewhat suspicious.

463
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,860
He's a historical figure who looks quite familiar.

464
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,089
Are they writers?

465
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,520
What's this?

466
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,789
Isn't that a photo of Lee Jung Seob?

467
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,990
(Lee Jung Seob, a painter of modern and contemporary art)

468
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,199
Why does everything look fake? This isn't good.

469
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,659
Everything looks suspicious.

470
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,999
The fish tank looks like a typical fish tank...

471
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,100
that you'd find in 1988.

472
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,010
(The ultimate item of retro style)

473

(A large fish tank)

When you went to a coffee house...

475
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,480
in the past, there was always a fish tank like that.

476
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,649
There was always a fish tank.

477
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,079
Yes, there was a fish tank at the movie theater.

478
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,519
- What?
- What's the matter?

479
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,450
That was when Lee Seung Chul was a member of Boohwal.

480
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,519
- He was a member of Boohwal.
- Right.

481
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,389
There's actually an LP.

482
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,390
- Where?
- Goodness.

483
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,390
- Over here.
- My gosh.

484
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,529
That's incredible.

485
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,130
(Reply, Seung Chul)

486
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,129
It was when he was singing "Last Concert."

487
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,930
This album includes "Last Concert."

488
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,499
She went

489
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,600
- outside - When he was part of the band...

490
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,969
("Last Concert" by Lee Seung Chul)

491
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,510
(Looking young and fresh)

492
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,910
Seung Chul was very popular then.

493
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,049
- That's amazing.
- Lee Seung Chul.

494
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,249
Was he like a beast back then?

495
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,990
Yes, he was like a beast.

496
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,619
This album includes...

497
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,559
"Heeya." It was very...

498
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,089
- "Heeya?" - It was released...

499
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,589
when I was in middle school.

500
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,429
- It caused a huge stir.
- At that time,

501
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,570
there were many women with names that ended with "Hee."

502
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,430
His concert was free...

503
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,169
for anyone whose name included "Hee."

504
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,200
- Really?
- Seriously?

505
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,039
I think Won Hee applied for it.

506
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,269
- Really?
- Yes.

507
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,480
I don't know if she went or not.

508
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,680
You guys should do something like that.

509
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,149
- Do what?
- The name...

510
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,209
You're our senior.

511
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,519
- Am I your senior?
- Yes, you're our senior.

512
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,619
You're our senior.

513
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,789
- Am I your senior?
- Yes, you're our senior.

514
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,719
We debuted in September of 2015.

515
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,159
You're our senior by six months.

516
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,220
Is that so?

517
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,390
They're strict about the hierarchy.

518
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,759
In Korean pop music,

519
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,829
- It's been a while.
- Mimi also has her position.

520
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,629
I'm the queen.

521
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,930
Yes, how many years has it been?

522
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,340
- It's been ten years.
- My gosh.

523
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,539
(It's been 10 years since OH MY GIRL debuted.)

524
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,909
Mimi, you should hold...

525
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,269
- a tenth anniversary concert.
- She's a veteran.

526
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,670
We already did.

527
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,809
- You did?
- When?

528
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,010
Did you do it secretly?

529
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,649
- She never told us.
- Did you tell Jae Seok...

530
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,479
- We did it a long time ago.
- Really?

531
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,580
You should've told me about it.

532
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,420
But you're very busy.

533
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,659
(Laughing)

534
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,519
Wonpil, do you have siblings?

535
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,129
I have an older sister.

536
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,189
Young K, don't you have an older brother?

537
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,360
I'm the only child.

538
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,859
You're wrong about everything.

539
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,869
- I thought that you knew him.
- He doesn't pick up his phone.

540
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,870
This is...

541
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,599
Stay out of it when we make our decision today.

542
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,299
- In my opinion...
- Today...

543
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,510
I keep being wrong since the tenth anniversary.

544
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,109
Your intuition today...

545
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,640
(Your intuition is off today.)

546
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,750
Anyway, what should we do here?

547
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,310
We'll invite the owner.

548
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,579
Ma'am?

549
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,750
Ma'am?

550
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,790
Hello, ma'am.

551
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,990
(Reply 1988, Park Mi Seung)

552
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,289
Ma'am, we heard that...

553
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,690
this place is called Reply 1988. What does it mean?

554
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,699
I haven't seen this in a long time. Look.

555
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,159
- From the past...
- These glasses.

556
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,570
- Right.
- The orange juice bottle.

557
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,229
(I like Del Monte.)

558
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,040
(A nostalgic bottle of orange juice from the 80s)

559
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,639
(It's reborn as a water bottle.)

560
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,410
This is so pretty.

561
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,739
- Look at that.
- Don't you recognize this?

562
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,910
- Of course.
- Yes.

563
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,210
Usually, it's bigger than that.

564
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,509
It's hard for the elderly to hold it when it's big.

565
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,749
- It's hard for them to carry.
- That's why?

566
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,380
Smaller bottles are also available.

567
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,019
As you can see over there, the menu is written in big letters.

568
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,549
As I've gotten older,

569
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,849
- I suffer from presbyopia.
- Right.

570
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,589
Many of my customers are elderly.

571
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,289
As the menu is written with large letters,

572
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,600
the elderly customers really appreciate it.

573
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,159
- There's a lot of thoughtfulness.
- This one is also written...

574
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,559
in a huge font.

575
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,829
The menu is written in a large font.

576
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,029
You aren't holding it upside down, are you?

577
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,840
(You aren't holding it upside down, are you?)

578
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,969
I happened to hold it upside down.

579
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,739
- I happened to hold it upside down.
- Seok Jin tried...

580
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,139
to pretend that he could see it.

581
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,409
I happened to do so.

582
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,610
- He held it upside down.
- It just happened...

583
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,449
before I was about to turn it.

584
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,879
(This is the blunt beauty.)

585
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,119
By the way,

586
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,490
why is your theme "Reply 1988?"

587
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,189
- We're in an art village.
- Yes.

588
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,460
So people from everywhere in the country visit here.

589
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,029
As there are many convalescent hospitals nearby,

590
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,459
some come here with their parents.

591
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,929
I started running a pasta restaurant...

592
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,030
with a unique retro vibe.

593
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,199
I started the restaurant in 2017.

594
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,709
I've been running a pasta restaurant for nine years.

595
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,739
(She's been running a pasta restaurant for 9 years since 2017.)

596
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,650
At first, most of my customers were the elderly in the neighborhood.

597
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,649
For customers to reminisce...

598
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,749
about their childhood memories,

599
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,150
I brought these items little by little.

600
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,689
The cute and charming interior...

601
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,029
also became popular among young couples.

602
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,059
As they post about it on social media,

603
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,300
they help promote this restaurant.

604
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,600
(Captivating the elderly and the MZers, is this place real?)

605
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,339
- Kyung Pyo was in "Reply 1988." - Yes.

606
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,409
- You recognize him, right?
- Hello.

607
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,540
Of course.

608
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,209
Is there any discount...

609
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,210
for the cast of "Reply 1988?"

610
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,910
(Well, that's...)

611
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,209
Would that be difficult?

612
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,779
(Would that be difficult?)

613
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,379
(Laughing)

614
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,290
I was looking forward to it.

615
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,890
There isn't any discount at all.

616
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,120
That's unfortunate.

617
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,429
- Is there any dish you'd recommend?
- Yes.

618
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,029
My husband isn't well.

619
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,959
I'm also a Certified Nursing Assistant.

620
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,929
I got certified to nurse him.

621
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,369
We often eat stamina food.

622
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,639
About four years ago, while eating loach soup,

623
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,669
I thought that it'd be a good idea to incorporate it into pasta.

624
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,340
That's how I created this dish.

625
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,310
Loach soup pasta?

626
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,680
That can't be real. Loach soup pasta?

627
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,219
Loach soup pasta?

628
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,050
(An unfamiliar combination that they never heard about)

629
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,349
Loach soup is great for strength recovery...

630
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,319
and boosting the immune system.

631
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,589
I thought it'd be good to combine it with pasta as a healthy dish.

632
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,830
That's how I came up with it.

633
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,699
I buy them once a week...

634
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,399
at the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market.

635
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,699
I buy 10kg,

636
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,510
about 300 loaches a week.

637
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,980
(A spectacular transformation of stamina food)

638
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,950
(Loach soup pasta)

639
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,919
You may think that elderly people don't like pasta.

640
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,350
However, they like this because...

641
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,060
it's easy to digest, light, and delicious.

642
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,289
(The buzz on social media is going through the roof...)

643
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,359
(due to the retro vibe and the unusual menu.)

644
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,630
(The MZers also love it.)

645
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,899
Sixth Sense members,

646
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,369
is this place real?

647
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,070
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

648
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,279
Generally, loach soup isn't liked by everyone.

649
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,909
- Right?
- Yes, it's made with loach.

650
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,749
(Loach soup isn't something that everyone likes.)

651
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,519
As you will see later,

652
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,519
- it served on a pretty...
- A plate?

653
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,649
The presentation?

654
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,850
(The presentation must be different.)

655
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,359
Young people also like it.

656
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,459
(Loach soup pasta loved by MZers is coming soon.)

657
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,629
- Personally, I'm a big fan.
- Of loach soup?

658
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,230
- I like loach soup.
- Me too.

659
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,459
I like whole loach soup.

660
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,800
- Do you eat whole loach soup?
- Yes.

661
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,869
Really? Even the loaches aren't ground?

662
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,969
During my childhood, when I did well on your exam,

663
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,809
I was awarded with whole loach soup.

664
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,810
(Laughing)

665
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,540
- When you were a child?
- When you did well on your exam?

666
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,079
It was a restaurant I’d been going since childhood.

667
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,479
I loved it very much.

668
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,209
- By the way...
- Let's say that...

669
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,319
I came to this restaurant.

670
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,979
- I wouldn't order that.
- Why not?

671
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Why not?

672
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:34,490
The restaurant owner is right behind you.

673
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,659
(She's watching him?)

674
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
(Exclaiming)

675
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,590
(Patient 1)

676
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,159
(Patient 2)

677
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
(Patient 3)

678
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm sorry. It's just my opinion.

679
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,600
Your reaction was unusual.

680
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,340
I forgot.

681
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,310
- Other dishes sound more delicious.
- He felt guilty.

682
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,979
This place has many atypical dishes.

683
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Yes.

684
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:00,279
To add to the retro vibe,

685
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,979
we serve pizza in a basket.

686
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,520
- A moment ago...
- We saw it on the menu.

687
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,450
- We also have aglio e olio.
- That sounds good.

688
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,719
- I love it.
- That sounds delicious.

689
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,719
- Aglio e olio is my favorite.
- I love noodles.

690
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,919
There's also a dessert after your meal.

691
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,789
It's served with ice cream bars from the past.

692
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,160
It's called nostalgic ice cream bar latte.

693
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,559
Once you pick ice cream in the fridge,

694
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,569
- I'll prepare it after your meal.
- Okay.

695
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,029
- We look forward to it.
- Thank you.

696
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,270
This place feels real to me.

698
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,139
She's right about the elderly customers.

699
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,850
Also, this is very detailed.

700
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,850
If the production crew made it up, they wouldn't go this far.

701
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,750
- They would.
- They wouldn't.

702
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,750
They would use the big bottle.

703
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,950
- To create the retro vibe.
- I've never seen small ones.

704
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,659
The fact that she wrote the menu in a large font...

705
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,989
and the bottle...

706
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,589
- It has to be...
- Real?

707
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,029
- Really?
- It feels quite real.

708
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,329
(It seems real!)

709
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,630
(Practical items for the elderly)

710
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,169
Have we been to the place we made the story about?

711
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,739
- No.
- We haven't, right?

712
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,570
- She has the perfect story here.
- And look carefully.

713
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,609
Look at the kitchen.

714
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,980
(Turning around)

715
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,949
Even from a distance, they look busy and...

716
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,310
- It looks coordinated.
- coordinated in the kitchen.

717
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,349
- They aren't being hasty.
- No.

718
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,379
- Not at all.
- But...

719
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,079
This is driving me insane.

720
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,089
(It's difficult.)

721
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,059
The loach soup pasta sounds strange,

722
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,660
but what's worse is the basket pizza.

723
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,590
Why would pizza be served in a basket?

724
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,889
Like potato jeon.

725
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,359
Right, but it doesn't seem suitable.

726
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,959
If she has many elderly customers,

727
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,369
most of them might not order pizza.

728
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,340
- Is it a deception?
- Deception?

729
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,699
- To be honest...
- Is it to deceive them?

730
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,169
The perspective of someone...

731
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,609
- in his 60s could be different.
- It's different.

732
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,110
(Upset)

733
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,240
Seok Jin, you're Young Fifty.

734
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,010
Loach soup pasta...

735
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,210
Wait a minute.

736
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:46,420
When we went to Vietnam for a concert,

737
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,849
I saw it as a meal kit.

738
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,189
- What?
- That's right.

739
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,790
- Loach soup pasta meal kit.
- Seriously?

740
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,359
(A loach soup pasta meal kit in Vietnam?)

741
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,060
(A loach soup pasta meal kit in Vietnam?)

742
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Right.

743
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:57,359
(Confused)

744
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,700
But why would that be in Vietnam?

745
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,129
There was a catering restaurant.

746
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,229
- Catering?
- Yes.

747
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,769
- Wait a minute.
- Hold on.

748
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,969
Did you get fooled?

749
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,909
- You got fooled.
- No way.

750
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,969
- Definitely not.
- You got fooled.

751
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,569
- I got goosebumps. It's ridiculous.
- Me too.

752
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,880
I got goosebumps.

753
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,539
The production crew got involved in that too?

754
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,049
There was something suspicious about it.

755
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,209
(Did they approach DAY6 members in Vietnam?)

756
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,320
The food is here. Let's focus on this first.

757
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,719
- These are boxed meals.
- Yes.

758
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,749
(Boxed meals from the past)

759
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,590
Don't shake these.

760
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,160
- Is it a boxed meal?
- Open the lid...

761
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,589
and enjoy.

762
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,630
- Let's listen to her.
- Let's enjoy the food for now.

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
(Exclaiming with surprise)

764
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,269
- A salad in a boxed meal?
- Unbelievable.

765
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,669
(Salad in a boxed meal from the past)

766
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,070
You've never seen it, have you?

767
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,609
- He got school food.
- I've never seen it before.

768
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,170
- I packed food in here as a child.
- Wonpil...

769
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,380
- Jae Seok, did you also...
- I had a thermos lunch box.

770
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,980
After this...

771
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,509
- He drew the line clearly.
- He really did.

772
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,419
You used this too, didn't you?

773
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,619
I had a thermos lunch box.

774
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,589
(He repeats "thermos lunch box.")

775
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,620
(Drawing the line)

776
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,260
(I'll eat some salad instead.)

777
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,290
(Eating)

778
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,400
(The day of eating)

779
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,029
The salad is really good.

780
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,699
(Refreshing the palate with a salad before the main dish)

781
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,470
I definitely think...

782
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,810
that the owner runs this place with a retro vibe.

783
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,039
However, the loach soup pasta fits...

784
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,010
- the retro vibe.
- Yes.

785
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,909
Here's what's strange.

786
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,149
The meal kit seems out of place in Vietnam.

787
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,479
It shouldn't have been there.

788
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,050
(The loach soup pasta meal kit was out of place in Vietnam.)

789
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,849
It's not easy to make a meal kit.

790
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,420
As Seok Jin said, a meal kit...

791
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,229
It's hard to make...

792
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,959
- a few, individual meal kits.
- Right.

793
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,429
Why would the production crew bother to make meal kits?

794
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,670
They could've made loach soup pasta in Vietnam.

795
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,999
- We could fall into our own trap.
- Exactly.

796
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,169
It's difficult.

797
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,239
(Sixth Sense isn't easy.)

798
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,469
Here's your loach soup pasta.

799
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,940
- Oh, my.
- What's this?

800
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,540
It's a furnace.

801
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,579
- It's a cast iron pot.
- Cast iron pot.

802
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,750
It's not a furnace.

803
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,109
It's a cast iron pot.

804
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,850
A furnace is where you make a fire.

805
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,349
I've only seen it on screen. I'm so honored.

806
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,389
- Mimi, a furnace is...
- Gosh.

807
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,619
I love it.

808
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,120
You put this over a furnace.

809
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,689
- I can't think clearly.
- Enjoy your food.

810
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,460
- Ma'am, this is...
- Thank you for the food.

811
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,200
This is...

812
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,569
This is loach soup pasta.

813
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,969
(A fancy transformation of stamina food)

814
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,069
To prepare the loaches, I sprinkle flour and coarse salt...

815
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,409
over them to remove the earthy smell and...

816
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,910
leave them for 30 minutes. Once they become limp,

817
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,540
I rinse them with water until the flour is washed off.

818
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,349
Then I grind...

819
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,620
steamed loaches with a seafood broth in a blender.

820
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,660
(Loach soup sauce is ready.)

821
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,889
On a frying pan, I stir-fry bracken, shiitake mushrooms,

822
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,630
button mushrooms, and shishito peppers.

823
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,959
After that, I add the loach soup sauce.

824
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,569
(Adding the loach soup sauce)

825
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,329
Once I boil them for four minutes,

826
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,770
they turn into something tasty and healthy.

827
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,309
The loach soup pasta is ready.

828
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,310
(A big transformation of loach soup)

829
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,740
It doesn't look like loach soup at all.

830
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,819
(Loach soup pasta, 18 dollars)

831
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,089
She added ground loaches.

832
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,220
It looks like cream.

833
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,289
(It looks like cream pasta. How does it taste?)

834
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,330
It looks like cream.

835
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,630
(Frowning with sincerity)

836
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,500
- Elderly people would like it.
- Right.

837
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,030
- Elderly people would like it.
- Seriously.

838
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,940
(Eyes popping out)

839
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,310
It tastes like loaches.

840
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,139
I'm not familiar with loach soup.

841
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,179
You're not?

842
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,339
- This is really good.
- I can really taste the loaches.

843
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,409
- Definitely.
- It has a strong taste of loaches.

844
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,519
Since it's made with loaches,

845
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,450
- it feels invigorating.
- Right.

846
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,449
- It's...
- It's not heavy.

847
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,649
- It's nice and savory.
- Yes.

848
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,289
When young people hear that it's made with loaches,

849
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,519
- they could be repulsed by it.
- Exactly.

850
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,729
Some parents fool their children...

851
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,829
- to make them eat something.
- Right.

852
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,159
They would believe it as black pepper pasta.

853
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,430
(Something everyone would love with unrecognizable loaches)

854
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,460
- It's nice. I like it.
- It's delicious.

855
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,229
I like how light it tastes.

856
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,340
(He likes how light it is.)

857
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,239
(Slurping)

858
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,309
It's very good.

859
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,409
It's a little addictive.

860
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,509
I can't stop eating it.

861
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,609
- This is fascinating.
- This is...

862
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,009
It's amazing.

863
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,279
It's an unforgettable taste.

864
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,079
I'd crave more when I go back home.

865
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,550
(It might linger in your mind before you fall asleep.)

866
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,750
- This is...
- It's excellent.

867
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,249
- I'm in trouble.
- With a spoon...

868
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,389
This is...

869
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,120
- Young K is scooping with a spoon.
- He's holding a spoon.

870
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,819
- At first...
- Young K...

871
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,630
- The pizza is here.
- He eats everything.

872
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,960
- I really eat everything.
- A big eater?

873
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,429
- It looks delicious.
- What's that?

874
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,630
(The basket pizza appears.)

875
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,969
I apply the kabocha sauce...

876
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,370
that I made myself on the dough.

877
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,539
On top of that, I sprinkle honey, mozzarella,

878
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,480
and almonds everywhere.

879
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,780
I bake it for 12 minutes in an oven.

880
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,319
(Basket pizza featuring kabocha)

881
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,019
Ma'am, how much is the pizza?

882
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,360
It's written big on the menu over there.

883
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,890
Please take a look.

884
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,130
I missed it.

885
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,700
He can't see that she's busy. The restaurant owner really lost it.

886
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,869
(Laughing)

887
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,869
- "It's written this big." - Right.

888
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,970
I'm sorry.

889
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,599
I'm sorry.

890
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,440
- How much is it?
- It's 23 dollars.

891
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,779
(Impressed)

892
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,980
- Is it good?
- Yes.

893
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,150
This is very...

894
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,650
This place is a tasty restaurant.

895
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,519
How does it taste? There's kabocha in it.

896
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,789
- It's really good.
- Is it?

897
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,259
(The kabocha is a strike of genius.)

898
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,959
(Stretching)

899
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,229
This pizza is...

900
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,560
(In love with the pizza)

901
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,300
What do you think? Isn't the pizza amazing?

902
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,070
Try some pizza.

903
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,769
It's really good.

904
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,710
Ma'am, this is definitely a tasty restaurant.

905
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,239
"Yes, thank you."

906
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,580
(Yes)

907
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,780
To redeem myself,

908
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,650
I said a compliment to redeem myself.

909
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,179
- I said it on her behalf, - Okay.

910
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,650
so it will be aired without problems.

911
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,350
(Please watch it when it gets aired.)

912
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,420
- I want one more.
- The cheese is really good.

913
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,559
Seok Jin, we'll be going to two or more restaurants.

914
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,159
I know, but what should I do?

915
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,029
He'll pretend to eat at other restaurants.

916
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,269
(He'll pretend to eat at other restaurants.)

917
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,130
What should I do? I want more.

918
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,600
I can't pretend to eat at other places.

919
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,100
I've warned you.

920
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,509
Take a look at him at the third place.

921
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,839
(Jee Seok Jin, I'm Still Hungry)

922
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,310
You're living a fake life.

923
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,009
(Fake Seok Jin, age 59, addicted to pizza)

924
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,149
(Living a fake life)

925
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,480
If I can say this, this plating doesn't look natural.

926
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,920
But the theme is "Reply 1988."

927
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,689
Even in "Reply 1988,"

928
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,989
they didn't eat pasta in this.

929
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,089
- That's true.
- What?

930
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,289
- That's true.
- Who eats pasta in this?

931
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,630
- You eat ramyeon in it.
- It's ramyeon.

932
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,459
(Is the plating excessive for the theme?)

933
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,200
Usually on our show,

934
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,369
we make unpopular places popular.

935
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,569
All the food here has a certain quality to it.

936
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,069
I'm sure the place was already a huge hit.

937
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,310
(The food is perfect, so why would it be fake?)

938
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,379
That's why I think this place really exists.

939
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,850
- I think...
- I think so too.

940
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,149
Have you tried the risotto?

941
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,979
Not yet. Hold on. Thank you.

942
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,050
It's really good.

943
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,890
Young K is taking the lead, working through the dishes.

944
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,390
Finding the fake place isn't on your mind today.

945
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,659
- The food is really good.
- The food here is great.

946
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
- It's good.
- Everything's delicious.

947
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,929
(While others wondered about its authenticity,)

948
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,700
(he was lost in the food.)

949
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,699
Young K's enjoying the food so much that...

950
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,710
Look at him sweat.

951
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,640
I bet you felt a little guilty trying the food alone.

952
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,549
I couldn't eat all the food.

953
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,749
- It's that good.
- It's really good.

954
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,680
- This isn't all that we're having.
- Right.

955
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,419
The Ssangssang Bar Latte.

956
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,479
(Nostalgic ice cream bar latte)

957
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,489
Of course!

958
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,089
Since this cafe has a retro theme,

959
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,029
we thought about serving coffee...

960
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,129
with ice cream bars that were popular back in the day.

961
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,399
That's how we came up with these.

962
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
(Nostalgic ice cream bar latte)

963
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,729
I haven't seen anything like this before.

964
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,899
Didn't she say this was popular?

965
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,240
It is. It's been trending.

966
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,909
- Really?
- Ice cream bar lattes are a thing.

967
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,310
(Ice cream bar lattes have been resonating with MZers.)

968
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,650
This is delicious.

969
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,750
What the...

970
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,620
Jae Seok, you almost swore.

971
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,419
No, I didn't!

972
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,489
(Shaking his head)

973
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,660
I was exclaiming, that's all.

974
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,320
It was an exclamation.

975
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
(Exclaiming)

976
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,460
- This is exceptional.
- Seok Jin.

977
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,099
Babambar goes insanely well with it.

978
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
B B Big is the best for me.

979
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,039
(Are they at it again?)

980
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,269
- I was talking to myself.
- Babambar...

981
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,470
I was talking to myself too.

982
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,340
- Why did you chime in?
- I was talking to myself.

983
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,809
(The world's first self-talk battle?)

984
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,309
Why did you cut in?

985
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,350
Why were you listening to me?

986
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,780
Having ears isn't an excuse.

987
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,719
It's really good.

988
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,790
(Let them argue. Who cares?)

989
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,790
It's so good.

990
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,089
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

991
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,159
(They end the meal with a sweet dessert!)

992
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,560
This is what I think.

993
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,659
Including these lattes,

994
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,330
the overall cohesiveness of the dishes...

995
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,199
doesn't get thrown off by any single dish.

996
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,239
I agree.

997
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,869
But I'm suspicious of the loach soup pasta.

998
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,179
In terms of taste, right?

999
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,979
- I've been in constant doubt.
- Right?

1000
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,250
Why was it in Vietnam of all places?

1001
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,719
I told you earlier about meal kits.

1002
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,350
That's not something we can easily make.

1003
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,889
They could use that belief against us.

1004
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,259
It could be a twist of a twist.

1005
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,689
The staff could've put it there on purpose.

1006
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,030
- Loach soup pasta is sold here, - Exactly.

1007
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,399
but they could've delivered it to fool us.

1008
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,500
(Did the crew deliver the meal kit to Vietnam as a twist to fool them?)

1009

We used to carry these around.

- A Mymy?
- The world is in your palm.

1015

(Jae Seok and Mimi come by to take some ice cream.)

1019
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,650
Wait, are these all?

1020
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,259
(What?)

1021
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,059
(What did they see?)

1022
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
What's this?

1023

(A meal kit?)

1024
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,529
What's that?

1025
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,200
(Why is there a meal kit in the freezer?)

1026
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,139
- Wait. We should ask Wonpil.
- Something's fishy.

1027
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,910
- Something's fishy.
- It really exists.

1028
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,539
- Young K, Wonpil, come here.
- I see fish.

1029
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,139
- Yes?
- Is this it?

1030
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,409
Is this what you remember?

1031
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,549
- That's the one!
- Something's suspicious.

1032
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,049
- This is it.
- Yes, this is what we saw.

1033
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,349
- No way.
- They must sell it here.

1034
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,150
- This?
- Yes, this was it.

1035
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,919
Why is this in the ice cream freezer?

1036
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,789
That's our meal kit,

1037
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,259
which we sell online.

1038
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,990
Those were set aside to give to my friends.

1039
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,829
Why would this be sold in Vietnam?

1040
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,500
That just doesn't feel right.

1041
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,269
These aren't easy to make just for use as a prop.

1042
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,500
You can't make fake versions of these.

1043
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,009
Being approved by HACCP and all...

1044
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,680
This seems real to me.

1045
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,309
This is driving me crazy. Are these real or not?

1046
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,949
I think those are real.

1047
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,080
(Is this place selling HACCP-approved meal kits for real?)

1048
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,479
- The weather became better.
- Yes.

1049
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,190
It is. I love it. Don't you?

1050
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,219
Before we head to the next location,

1051
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,759
you'll drop by a trending cafe in Heyri Art Village.

1052
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,360
- Nice!
- I love it.

1053
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,289
We need our caffeine fix.

1054
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,360
That sounds great.

1055
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,030
Head on in.

1056
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,030
(What's this trending cafe in Heyri Art Village?)

1057
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,060
Hello.

1058
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,099
We heard this place serves...

1059
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,699
delicious food and beverages.

1060
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
(Glancing)

1061
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:13,140
(Hey!)

1062
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,509
- Here we go.
- No way.

1063
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,769
(What is this place that has them exclaiming?)

1064
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,940
That looks delicious.

1065
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,180
(You're immediately welcomed by a spacious area.)

1066
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,950
(A display stand filled with donuts)

1067
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,879
Look at those donuts.

1068
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,750
(An array of delicious-looking donuts)

1069
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,319
This is crazy.

1070
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
(Visually satisfying,)

1071
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
(with a wide variety of flavors)

1072
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:33,620
I love donuts like these.

1073
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,130
It's a crime not to know this place in Paju.

1074
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,129
There's a reason these donuts are popular.

1075
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,000
(Paradise for pastry lovers)

1076
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,840
I love donuts like these.

1077
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,470
I'd like that peanut one.

1078
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,310
- It has peanut butter.
- The one with peanut butter.

1079
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,709
As you know, I'm a donut expert.

1080
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,009
How are you a donut expert?

1081
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,209
- Because I eat them a lot.
- Really?

1082
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,819
I can tell that these are delicious.

1083
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,920
We were brought here for their delicious food.

1084
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,020
Hey.

1085
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,320
- I mean...
- That's true.

1086
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,759
The producer brought us here because this place is famous.

1087
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,530
I know that, you brat,

1088
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,099
but these look exceptional.

1089
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,260
Especially this one.

1090
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,799
The one with peanut butter. That does look good.

1091
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,630
There's no way that doesn't taste good.

1092
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,399
I'd like a mild decaf latte.

1093
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,040
- One iced Americano, please.
- Sure.

1094
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,639
- Thank you.
- One hot Americano,

1095
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,909
but with ice, please.

1096
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,209
- A hot Americano with ice?
- A hot Americano with ice?

1097
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,679
- What are you talking about?
- I meant just a hot Americano.

1098
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
I never thought I'd hear anyone say that.

1099
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,110
A hot Americano with ice?

1100
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,079
(Since it's embarrassing, they hurry over to their seats.)

1101
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,150
Let's sit here.

1102
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,590
Back in the day, we had to go abroad...

1103
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,789
- to enjoy things like this.
- That's right.

1104
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,490
These days, Korea has so many fascinating things too.

1105
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,259
Many Korean brands, including convenience stores,

1106
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,800
have opened in Mongolia.

1107
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,939
I've heard the streets look similar to ones in Korea.

1108
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,500
- Really?
- Yes, they're very similar.

1109
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,769
Really?

1110
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,780
(Welcome. Is it your first time in Mongolia?)

1111
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,479
- I'd love to go there.
- I haven't been there before.

1112
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,950
- Me neither. Not Mongolia.
- Even in Japan...

1113
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,220
Jae Seok and I have been there before.

1114
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,579
- It was for a show.
- Do they really have...

1115
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,289
vast grassland plains?

1116
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,790
You can see...

1117
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,290
endless stretches of grassland.

1118
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,990
And stars in the sky...

1119
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,060
- They pour down on you.
- They pour down on you.

1120
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,329
I mean...

1121
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,700
(At night, stars pour down on you.)

1122
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,570
- I'd love to go there.
- Back then,

1123
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,369
he kept saying...

1124
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,569
- how he loved lamb meat.
- I love lamb.

1125
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,200
He said that was all he had been eating.

1126
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,039
Mongolia is known for lamb being a staple.

1127
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,240
- Of course.
- There was a lamb noodle dish.

1128
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,580
He ordered that,

1129
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,149
saying he loved lamb.

1130
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,150
(After Seok Jin had a bite of it...)

1131
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:38,850
(Depressed)

1132
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,819
(The lamb lover couldn't live up to his reputation.)

1133
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,260
He's a so-called lamb lover,

1134
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,660
but he set it aside after one bite.

1135
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,689
- Was it bad?
- Mongolian lamb is tough to handle.

1136
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,630
- Is the smell strong?
- It's an acquired taste.

1137
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,260
Here we go.

1138
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,230
- The skin...
- Goodness.

1139
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,639
- Is this the brulee donut?
- Yes.

1140
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,539
What exactly is a brulee?

1141
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,709
Sugar is sprinkled on top,

1142
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,579
- which is then torched.
- I see.

1143
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,209
(A brulee donut with a hard sugar layer and cream)

1144
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,210
You don't disappoint.

1145
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,210
(She explained it perfectly.)

1146
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:09,809
- She's a pastry lover for sure.
- She's an expert.

1147
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,249
(Mimi, the dessert master)

1148
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,320
It's me.

1149
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,550
That's you.

1150
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:17,150
- I'll enjoy.
- I'll enjoy.

1151
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,159
Let's see.

1152
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
(A bite)

1153
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:21,229
(Yummy)

1154
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,359
- It's good.
- That's nice.

1155
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,059
(Exclaiming and applauding)

1156
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,359
It's delicious.

1157
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
- The dough is chewy.
- Right?

1158
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,999
That's a satisfying chew.

1159
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,029
(He's right.)

1160
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,139
This is what Seok Jin said would be good.

1161
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,399
- The peanut one.
- Right.

1162
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,409
In that case, I'll bring it closer to me.

1163
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,269
(I'll bring it closer to me.)

1164
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,879
(Annoyed)

1165
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,679
There are many people who envy the relationship between us.

1166
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,049
- They're surprised...
- Exactly.

1167
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,179
- how well we get along.
- Right?

1168
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,750
Even though we're old now,

1169
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,249
we're still like a bunch of kids.

1170
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,259
(They joke around like elementary school kids.)

1171
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,659
- I wish to grow old like you guys.
- Really?

1172
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,689
Then get a friend you can be close to.

1173
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,990
Do you have someone like that?

1174
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,829
No, can't I consider you as that friend?

1175
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,400
- Sure, bicker with us.
- Good.

1176
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,730
- Are you sure though?
- So please live long.

1177
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,400
We'll probably leave you behind.

1178
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,040
Please don't say sad things like that.

1179
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,209
- We should leave together.
- That was alarming.

1180
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,210
(The spicy joke of a 60-year-old)

1181
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,439
We should leave together.

1182
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
(He's still shocked.)

1183
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,579
Is that also red bean?

1184
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,680
No, this is mugwort.

1185
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,249
(Walking on eggshells)

1186
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,549
I would've understood...

1187
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,890
if you had asked whether it was green tea.

1188
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,560
How can you say it's red bean when it's green?

1189
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,030
You should know me by now. I don't pay attention.

1190
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,489
It's hard to live your life...

1191
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,029
if you look at things in too much detail.

1192
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,130
- Just take it easy.
- That could be a motto.

1193
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,070
That could be a motto.

1194
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,430
So what if I say something wrong?

1195
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,469
That has no effect on your life, so let it be.

1196
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,770
- You're right.
- Exactly.

1197
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,379
How many concerts do you host in a year?

1198
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,539
Sorry? We just take it easy.

1199
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,710
Do one less.

1200
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,910
So that's how I do it, right?

1201
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,979
Young Hyun, that's it.

1202
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,720
- Don't always answer sincerely.
- Sure.

1203
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,389
I won't retaliate in any way.

1204
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,560
Sure thing.

1205
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,030
(A student of Seok Jin who picks up his laziness)

1206
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,630
- Shall we get going?
- Shall we?

1207
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,229
You need to buckle up.

1208
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,230
(They get in a van to head out.)

1209
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:10,070
The kids are in the back again.

1210
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,299
- Guys.
- I'll fasten two seat belts.

1211
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,569
Would you like to sit up front?

1212
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,570
No, we're good.

1213
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,809
I'm skinnier, so I'll sit in the middle.

1214
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,540
- No, let me.
- Just get over here, you brat.

1215
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,740
Detective Ko, get over here.

1216
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,350
- I mean, you're huge.
- He's right. Sit comfortably.

1217
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,319
(He doesn't care.)

1218
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,849
- Then...
- Do you think...

1219
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,450
Does Seok Jin look like he'll sit in the middle?

1220
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,089
Kyung Pyo, don't sit in the middle.

1221
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,560
You're a big guy to sit there.

1222
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,829
My Day, don't worry. I'm...

1223
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,500
There's nothing going on here.

1224
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,229
There's no need to be jealous.

1225
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,399
- No jealousy, please.
- Mimi's in a tough seat.

1226
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,040
- I'll sit next to them.
- I'm fine!

1227
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,710
- I am...
- I'm sure My Days...

1228
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,469
won't mind Mimi.

1229
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,310
- They wouldn't be worried.
- They wouldn't.

1230
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,809
People don't really...

1231
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,110
feel jealous of me.

1232
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,120
Don't worry.

1233
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,019
- Whenever I visit Heyri, - Yes.

1234
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,520
I feel happy.

1235
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,759
- It's peaceful.
- Exactly.

1236
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,859
I really like it.

1237
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,629
(Heyri in the afternoon is very peaceful.)

1238
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,630
When I'm shooting, I think to myself,

1239
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,830
"I should come here with my family."

1240
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,499
And I only come back for the next shooting.

1241
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,429
(Laughing)

1242
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,069
- Same here.
- Right?

1243
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,070
I end up forgetting about it.

1244
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,609
When I go back home,

1245
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,069
instead of eating out, I end up saying,

1246
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,410
"Can we just order delivery, Kyung Eun?"

1247
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,939
- You just end up ordering delivery.
- Yes.

1248
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,150
- Delivery is so convenient.
- Exactly.

1249
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,679
- I can't be bothered to go out.
- Delivery is easily accessible.

1250
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,450
(Even Jae Seok succumbs to delivery services.)

1251
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,119
Do you two own a car?

1252
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,350
I have no driving license.

1253
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,789
Why? Why not?

1254
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,190
- Young Hyun.
- Yes?

1255
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,659
You don't have a license?

1256
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,190
- Not yet.
- Why won't you get one?

1257
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,800
I should've gotten it in my early 20s when I was naive.

1258
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,369
- That's right.
- You missed the timing.

1259
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,230
Yes. Once I missed it...

1260
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,539
At that age,

1261
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,510
people start looking up what cars they want to buy.

1262
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,109
- Now...
- Their imagination goes wild.

1263
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,009
With how much they're earning,

1264
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,549
- It must be great.
- it must be great.

1265
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,250
They could buy any car.

1266
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,519
- Young Hyun, get your license.
- I will.

1267
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,579
You really should.

1268
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,450
- I really should.
- "I will."

1269
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,719
He's cheeky.

1270
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,019
"I will."

1271
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,119
(He's cheeky.)

1272
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,919
He's very cheeky.

1273
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,930
You're very cheeky.

1274
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,460
I watched and learned today.

1275
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,559
What did I tell you?

1276
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,830
Just go with the flow.

1277
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,669
(Like Seok Jin who drools)

1278
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,639
- Yes, I'll go with the flow.
- Yes.

1279
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,169
- Nice.
- Laugh out loud.

1280
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,110
(Laughing)

1281
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,810
- My gosh.
- This is why...

1282
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,779
you must interact with those older than you.

1283
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,110
- That's right.
- Yes.

1284
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,409
You learn about life.

1285
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,649
Yes. How nice is it?

1286
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,719
(They head to the next location in the uplifting atmosphere.)

1287
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,449
- Where are we going?
- We will...

1288
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,489
- Six Flying Dragons.
- Yes, Six Flying Dragons.

1289
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,749
Six Flying Dragons.

1290
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,320
(The next location is Six Flying Dragons.)

1291
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,189
Six Flying Dragons...

1292
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,929
- sounds like a Korean restaurant.
- Yes, I think so too.

1293
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,359
- It should be something Korean.
- Right.

1294
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,830
A Korean restaurant.

1295
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,770
- It might be a tiled roof house.
- That's right.

1296
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,169
I think it's a hanok restaurant.

1297
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,139
(Is Six Flying Dragons a hanok Korean restaurant?)

1298
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,469
Back then,

1299
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,269
there was a restaurant district called Anygol.

1300
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,010
There was a restaurant named Milady.

1301
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,579
They actually addressed the customers as "milady."

1302
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,650
- Really?
- They were dressed like servants.

1303
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
And they served the food like this.

1304
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,390
- A full table?
- Yes. The servants carried it in.

1305
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,919
- It's much better than a maid cafe.
- That's fascinating.

1306
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
(Heart fluttering)

1307
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:20,419
- It's that era's...
- Right?

1308
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,889
A maid cafe?

1309
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,359
- She is right.
- That's really...

1310
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,660
It's Korean version of it.

1311
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,699
- That's the original.
- When you think about it that way.

1312
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,630
"It's much better than a maid cafe."

1313
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,669
That makes sense.

1314
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,069
(Smiling innocently)

1315
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,639
It doesn't look like there'll be a restaurant here.

1316
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,169
- What's this?
- Is that the one?

1317
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,439
- We're in an alley.
- No.

1318
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,180
- Is it a residential home?
- Kalguksu?

1319
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,609
- It's too remote.
- The location...

1320
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,579
is fishy, isn't it?

1321
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,119
- Hold on.
- It's not what we thought.

1322
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,920
It's in a remote area.

1323
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,689
- And it isn't a Korean restaurant.
- It's remote. What's this?

1324
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,960
It looks too western.

1325
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,860
- What's that?
- What's that?

1326
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,529
- "Small..." - "A course meal..."

1327
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,759
"Cooking eels?"

1328
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,959
- Eels?
- They sell eels.

1329
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,230
Is it an eel restaurant?

1330
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,999
That's great!

1331
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,099
- An eel restaurant?
- Hold on.

1332
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,369
I want eel stew!

1333
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,199
- It's nourishing.
- Is that why it's a dragon?

1334
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,769
(Six Flying Dragons at the end of the remote alley...)

1335
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,669
(is an eel restaurant?)

1336
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,879
I know this place.

1337
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,979
- Dragon?
- How do you know?

1338
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,409
- This place is real.
- Really?

1339
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,579
- It's real.
- Have you been here?

1340
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,180
- That's not it.
- What if they fooled you again?

1341
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,749
- No.
- No?

1342
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,419
- This place is real. Oh, dear.
- Lucky us.

1343
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,589
(Is this a real place which Mimi visited before?)

1344
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:22,819
What will you do, production crew?

1345
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,189
Mimi provided us important information.

1346
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,560
They're in trouble.

1347
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,489
You're in trouble. Mimi says...

1348
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,589
- She knows this place.
- I know this place.

1349
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,290
She knows this place. What will you do?

1350
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,359
We can eat in peace here.

1351
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,799
- Exactly.
- Okay, let's go.

1352
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,129
We might get it right today. One place is off the list.

1353
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,399
- It's off the list.
- Let's go, Mimi.

1354
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,069
- This place is real.
- Let's go.

1355
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,499
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1356
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,739
Let's go.

1357
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,239
Mimi, can we trust you?

1358
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,610
Trust me.

1359
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,940
Come downstairs.

1360
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,010
Is this the right place?

1361
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,110
I've never been here myself.

1362
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,820
(Eyes opening wide)

1363
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,919
It's different from...

1364
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,020
- what we imagined.
- I thought...

1365
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,159
(When you enter the restaurant,)

1366
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,089
(you can see the fancy interior.)

1367
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,760
It doesn't look like they sell eels either.

1368
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,530
(They sell eels here?)

1369
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,070
It's not the vibe we imagined.

1370
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,570
- It looks like a steakhouse.
- Yes.

1371
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,740
Right?

1372
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,009
Normally, eel restaurants would have the grill.

1373
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,039
- They should.
- Yes.

1374
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,479
They should have the grill.

1375
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,039
(Eel restaurants we're familiar with)

1376
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,709
Isn't this an induction stove?

1377
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,149
- Is this an induction stove?
- I see.

1378
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,120
(They have an induction stove instead of a grill?)

1379
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,750
Check the outside, Mimi.

1380
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,590
Looks like you can dine outdoors.

1381
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,189
Don't the tables look like those of a cafe?

1382
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,059
- Exactly. That...
- They're totally cafe tables.

1383
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,990
(People eat eels here?)

1384
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,889
(Let me see.)

1385
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,660
And the lights.

1386
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,729
There are too many of them.

1387
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,699
There are too many.

1388
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,739
A lot of cafes have lights like these.

1389
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,769
(The lights are too fancy for an eel restaurant.)

1390
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,539
This place could be a real cafe,

1391
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,640
and selling eels might be fake.

1392
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,110
(Is it a fake cafe, turned as an eel restaurant?)

1393
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,979
- Right?
- How do you know this place?

1394
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,719
When I run my YouTube channel,

1395
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,419
I'd receive emails for ad placements and so on.

1396
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,489
I think I saw the name of this place.

1397
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,920
- Really?
- The eel restaurant.

1398
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,120
It's a place you know?

1399
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,589
That's making me feel unsure.

1400
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,159
(He feels rather unsure.)

1401
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,760
I think they fooled you.

1402
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,429
- They might've tricked you again.
- How many months ago was that?

1403
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,000
How many months ago was that?

1404
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,500
Quite long ago.

1405
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,540
- About three months ago?
- An eel restaurant in Paju?

1406
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,270
An eel restaurant in Paju?

1407
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:23,339
I don't know if it's in Paju.

1408
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,340
(What?)

1409
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:25,610
Six Flying Dragons?

1410
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,010
- I'm not sure.
- I don't think...

1411
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:28,410
that's the name of the restaurant.

1412
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,750
It doesn't look like an eel restaurant.

1413
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,949
- Hello.
- Hello.

1414
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,789
- Hello.
- Hello.

1415
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,219
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1416
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,189
Ma'am, why is this place called Six Flying Dragons?

1417
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,320
We sell...

1418
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:45,430
eel course meals.

1419
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,899
(Eel course meals?)

1420
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,800
(The top tier of nourishing food)

1421
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,010
(Eels)

1422
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,139
(You can have eels as a course meal?)

1423
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,610
Eels are tasty,

1424
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,480
but people only have them grilled.

1425
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,020
I thought it'd be nice to make it into a course meal...

1426
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,119
which is classy and has various dishes.

1427
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,290
(What if I made classy and various dishes?)

1428
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,859
Starting with eel soup, we have grilled eel,

1429
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,389
(Various dishes made using eels)

1430
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,620
steamed eel,

1431
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,390
and eel stew. I'll have them ready for you.

1432
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,499
(All of them?)

1433
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,630
Look at his face.

1434
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,329
(I'm very happy.)

1435
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,140
He's genuinely happy.

1436
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,709
What we had just now wasn't enough...

1437
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,510
- for Young Hyun.
- That was an appetizer.

1438
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,580
I looked forward to today.

1439
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,909
I didn't know what we'd eat,

1440
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,110
- but I looked forward to it a lot.
- That's good.

1441
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,080
- This is in such a remote place.
- Yes.

1442
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,750
How did this become a hot spot?

1443
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,249
Out of the course menu,

1444
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,719
steamed eel dragon is very popular.

1445
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,789
Maybe that's why.

1446
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,730
- Steamed eel dragon?
- Steamed, yes.

1447
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,329
- Steamed eel?
- Steamed.

1448
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,099
You eat eels steamed?

1449
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,199
- Yes. You've never heard it before?
- I've never heard it before.

1450
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,700
It's my first time hearing about steamed eel.

1451
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,339
I'm from Gochang in North Jeolla Province.

1452
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,669
There are four famous eel restaurants in Gochang.

1453
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,840
One of them was my family's.

1454
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,209
Since I was young,

1455
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,019
Mom made steamed eel for us.

1456
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,019
She didn't sell it.

1457
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,020
(Her mother who ran an eel restaurant made steamed eel.)

1458
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,659
It isn't greasy. It's mild and light.

1459
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,990
That's probably why she made steamed eel.

1460
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,559
It went viral on Instagram,

1461
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,329
so we sell 50 to 60kg of eels a day.

1462
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,670
(Thanks to the popularity, they sell 50 to 60kg of eels a day.)

1463
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,400
In weekends, the sales go up to 10,000 dollars a day.

1464
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,309
The taste and visual of Six Flying Dragons steamed eel was fantastic.

1465
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,610
(It went viral on social media for its taste and appearance.)

1466
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:41,880
(Steamed eel dragon is coming soon.)

1467
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,179
Sixth Sense members,

1468
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,709
is this place real?

1469
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,280
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1470
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,450
Since we're looking for...

1471
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:51,090
the fake place,

1472
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,720
we can't help but question everything.

1473
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,189
- Please understand.
- I apologize in advance.

1474
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,290
This is...

1475
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,129
- The overall vibe of the place...
- Yes.

1476
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,759
doesn't feel like that of an eel restaurant.

1477
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,830
- I see.
- It doesn't.

1478
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,939
- It looks like a cafe.
- Yes.

1479
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,099
I ran...

1480
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,140
a wedding shop for over 20 years.

1481
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,539
So I designed the place...

1482
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,310
to feel like a small wedding, like a party.

1483
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,350
No wonder it's so pretty.

1484
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,049
When we first opened the restaurant,

1485
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,149
a lot of passersby asked if it was a flower shop...

1486
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,790
or an eel restaurant.

1487
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,289
(The interior design reminds you of a wedding aisle.)

1488
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,529
Mimi says...

1489
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,929
- she knows this place.
- Yes.

1490
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,159
- How do you know?
- Yes. I...

1491
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,460
Isn't this a franchise?

1492
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,930
We're not a franchise.

1493
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,369
Then I must've seen wrongly.

1494
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,669
This isn't the place?

1495
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,699
I guess it isn't.

1496
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,810
- Since Pungcheon eels are famous.
- It's in a remote place.

1497
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,969
- I must be mistaken.
- You're mistaken, right?

1498
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,109
- Yes, it must be Pungcheon eel.
- You were so...

1499
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,379
confident just now.

1500
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,039
- I don't think it's this place.
- "It isn't."

1501
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,209
Is Pungcheon eel famous?

1502
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

1503
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:53,280
Then it must be another Pungcheon eel restaurant.

1504
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,350
It isn't this place.

1505
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,620
Can you smell eels?

1506
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,959
I don't really smell them.

1507
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,319
- I don't smell them.
- I don't.

1508
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,560
- Not at all.
- I don't smell them at all.

1509
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,589
I don't smell eels.

1510
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,329
(The eel restaurant doesn't smell of eels?)

1511
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,130
We should be able to tell once the food is served.

1512
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,000
The food is authentic Korean cuisine.

1513
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,540
It's a perfect Korean meal.

1514
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,069
Is that the one?

1515
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,070
(The first eel dish is served.)

1516
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,040
(Surprised)

1517
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,750
- It isn't plated Korean style.
- It's pretty.

1518
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,279
- Is this soup?
- It looks like soup.

1519
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,950
Yes. It's eel cream soup with seaweed base.

1520
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,619
It's a fusion dish.

1521
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,719
We said...

1522
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,390
we didn't smell eels.

1523
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,029
If this is how the food is served...

1524
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,589
It suits the interior design.

1525
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,590
(If they're served in that state, the lack of smell makes sense.)

1526
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,930
The broth is boiled using 5,000 eel heads.

1527
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,099
- What?
- Five thousand?

1528
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,130
(The broth is boiled using 5,000 eel heads.)

1529
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,000
- You said 5,000?
- They used 5,000 eel heads?

1530
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,339
We made the base using 5,000 eel heads.

1531
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,710
- Five thousand?
- Yes.

1532
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,439
The eel heads were cleaned once with salt...

1533
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,080
and once again with flour.

1534
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,079
Onions, green onion roots, tree aralia,

1535
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,020
pepper, licorice, and chili seeds are added.

1536
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,989
Then it's boiled for 5 to 6 hours.

1537
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,160
(Boil it for 5 to 6 hours.)

1538
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,429
Add cream to it.

1539
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,860
(Add cream to eel broth.)

1540
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,760
Put eel chips on top as a topping.

1541
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,870
(How does eel soup with 5,000 eel heads taste?)

1542
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,370
How is it?

1543
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,440
It's good.

1544
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,380
(Amazed)

1545
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,050
- It has umami.
- It's delicious.

1546
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,680
- The umami.
- This is how umami tastes.

1547
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,250
I only ate grilled eels before.

1548
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,150
It's nice.

1549
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,889
- You can feel the eel chunks.
- Yes.

1550
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,889
Yes. Isn't it like dried filefish?

1551
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,130
- Yes, a bit.
- Yes.

1552
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,459
- It's nice.
- It's so good.

1553
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,130
This is incredible. How can it taste like this?

1554
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,929
Some eel restaurants serve eel soup.

1555
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,569
- Really?
- But it doesn't taste like this.

1556
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,899
This is a harmony between the east and the west.

1557
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,370
Yes, this is fusion.

1558
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,009
This is very delicious.

1559
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,410
- I like it.
- It's nice.

1560
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,509
(Being amazed for many times)

1561
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,680
It's really delicious.

1562
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,610
I want to eat more, but there are more dishes to come.

1563
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,120
- Now...
- Are you pretending to eat?

1564
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,790
(Fake laughing)

1565
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,119
You predicted this.

1566
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,620
- I ate it.
- He's starting.

1567
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,890
What are you talking about? I ate it.

1568
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,290
He ate a little now.

1569
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,030
In the third restaurant, he might not eat at all.

1570
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,030
(He can't deny it.)

1571
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:22,900
I'll eat.

1572
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,570
- It's so perfect.
- Here it is.

1573
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,340
(Surprised)

1574
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,010
What's this?

1575
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:33,810
- This is grilled eels.
- Yes.

1576
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,710
It's half-salted, half-spicy.

1577
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,280
We made the sauce using our secret recipe.

1578
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,989
It's delicious and not greasy.

1579
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,320
(Spicy eel is made using their secret recipe.)

1580
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,719
(Salt and spicy grilled eel)

1581
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,460
(The second dish of the eel course meal)

1582
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,059
This has to be real.

1583
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,830
This can't be fake.

1584
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,959
I think it has to be an eel restaurant at least.

1585
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,030
- Yes.
- That's right.

1586
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,300
(How does grilled eel taste?)

1587
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,310
(Eyes opening wide)

1588
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,910
What's this?

1589
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,609
- It's so delicious.
- The eel is so chewy.

1590
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,649
- This?
- Yes.

1591
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,349
- It's not just meaty.
- It's so delicious.

1592
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,149
It's chewy.

1593
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,189
Right?

1594
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,150
(On top of being meaty, it's chewy and firm.)

1595
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,059
It's delicious.

1596
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,130
(It's delicious.)

1597
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,589
- It's delicious.
- It's delicious.

1598
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,689
(It's very delicious.)

1599
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,830
It's so tasty.

1600
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,729
- Honestly speaking, - It's nice.

1601
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:28,969
had we not gone to the first restaurant,

1602
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,799
- I'd have ordered rice.
- I know what you mean.

1603
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,039
- This would go well with rice.
- It goes nicely with rice.

1604
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,469
- We should order rice.
- I'll try.

1605
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,010
(It'll make you finish one whole bowl of rice easily.)

1606
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,510
(Humming)

1607
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,510
(Glancing)

1608
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,010
Seok Jin, have some protein.

1609
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,250
- You put your hands together.
- I'll eat at my own pace.

1610
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,619
Are you done eating?

1611
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,519
- I'm chewing.
- You're resting just for a bit?

1612
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,620
Just for a bit.

1613
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,489
- Pick your chopsticks back up.
- I'm picking it up.

1614
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:52,590
- Yes.
- Yes.

1615
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,059
(Fascinated)

1616
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,830
He's having trouble going about his daily life.

1617
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,400
Because I keep exposing him on the show,

1618
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,799
people only look at that aspect of him.

1619
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,599
Do you know what they say when I compliment the food?

1620
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,999
- What do they say?
- "Do you mean it?"

1621
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,800
(Do you mean it?)

1622
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,110
(Laughing)

1623
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,470
Because you keep saying I live a fake life.

1624
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,180
Fake life.

1625
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,809
It's really chewy.

1626
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,379
Right? It has a great texture.

1627
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,449
- It's delicious.
- It's interesting.

1628
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,949
I wonder how steamed eel tastes.

1629
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,049
It'll be fantastic.

1630
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,519
I've never tried steamed eel.

1631
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,960
Right? The oil would be trapped inside.

1632
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,590
Or would it be drained out?

1633
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,629
Have some protein.

1634
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,230
I'm so glad I'm here today.

1635
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,830
This is so good.

1636
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,299
The taste changes depending on how you prepare it.

1637
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,970
- Here's steamed eel.
- What's that?

1638
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,939
(What's that?)

1639
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,010
What's that?

1640
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,340
(I must stand up to see this.)

1641
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,249
This is my first time hearing about steamed eel.

1642
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,379
It's my first time trying it.

1643
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,180
(How does steamed eel dragon look like?)

1644
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,619
It's a dragon.

1645
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,119
- It's dragon-shaped.
- It's a dragon.

1646
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,189
- It's dragon-shaped.
- It's a dragon.

1647
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:03,389
(Is the eel really shaped like a dragon?)

1648
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,299
- It's a dragon.
- You must see it from the top.

1649
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,600
(You can only see it clearly when you stand up.)

1650
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,730
It's a dragon.

1651
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,040
This is impressive.

1652
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,469
That's why it's Six Flying Dragons.

1653
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,800
(Six Flying Dragons finally reveals itself.)

1654
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,809
We depicted from a dragon's head to toe.

1655
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,640
- It's a dragon.
- It's finally here.

1656
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,350
(The head of the dragon with a jewel in its mouth)

1657
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,350
(A detailed depiction of the dragon's feet)

1658
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,879
It's a shocking visual.

1659
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,890
(Steamed eel dragon, the third dish of the eel course meal)

1660
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,090
Ma'am, you should've served this first.

1661
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,160
This is impressive.

1662
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,230
People would come here just to see this.

1663
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,199
- This is amazing.
- Exactly.

1664
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
(Swallowing his saliva and taking pictures)

1665
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,899
Steamed eel was made by being steamed...

1666
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,929
for a long time at a low temperature.

1667
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,270
This is the signature menu of the restaurant.

1668
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,769
Add star anise, bay leaves,

1669
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,070
and lemon in the lower partition.

1670
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,880
Place green onions, onions, and lemon on top of it.

1671
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,410
Steam eels for 30 minutes.

1672
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,320
(When the eels are cooked after 30 minutes,)

1673
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,589
(apply the secret sauce and steam it for 10 more minutes.)

1674
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,190
(apply the secret sauce and steam it for 10 more minutes.)

1675
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,260
(Next is the most important part of steamed eel.)

1676
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,759
(The owner's touch)

1677
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,760
I thought about what kind of shape I should display steamed eel.

1678
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,230
People eat eels to nourish themselves...

1679
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,840
when they're feeling less energetic.

1680
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,280
What has the strongest energy?

1681
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,910
Dragons.

1682
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,580
I wanted them to get the energy from looking at a dragon.

1683
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,420
So I made it into a dragon-shape.

1684
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,050
(Steamed eel dragon)

1685
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,120
No wonder the first two dishes...

1686
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,590
- were delicious, but a bit plain.
- Yes.

1687
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,590
They were appetizers for this.

1688
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,629
Can this be fake?

1689
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,800
- How can this be fake?
- This can't be fake.

1690
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,369
How is it, Seok Jin?

1691
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,100
(Amazed)

1692
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,539
(Try it right now.)

1693
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,870
It's so refreshing and nice.

1694
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,809
(What's this?)

1695
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:00,910
It's delicious, right?

1696
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:03,409
I've never had eels with this kind of sauce.

1697
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,480
(Thrilling)

1698
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,079
It's different from the eels we've had until now.

1699
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,320
It's completely different.

1700
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,720
Since it's steamed, it's not greasy.

1701
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,859
I never knew eels could taste like this.

1702
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,930
Me too.

1703
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:20,200
It doesn't taste like an eel. It tastes like different food.

1704
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,970
The texture is very unique.

1705
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,530
(Eating)

1706
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,039
Doesn't it feel like French cuisine?

1707
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,699
- It smells nice.
- Take the one in the middle.

1708
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,310
Yes, it tastes very strong.

1709
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,970
It smells amazing.

1710
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,179
Young Hyun and Wonpil, eat up.

1711
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,779
I love it so much.

1712
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,780
Right?

1713
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,380
You must be...

1714
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,520
I won't mind it even if the place is fake.

1715
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,879
- This...
- I love this.

1716
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,689
can't have been made by an amateur.

1717
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,089
- I agree.
- It's so good.

1718
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,020
I want to take this home...

1719
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,959
and have it for breakfast tomorrow.

1720
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,460
- It's a bit...
- Yes.

1721
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,399
It's too professional for it to have been made by a chef.

1722
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,499
Oh, chef...

1723
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,000
(Is a chef professional too?)

1724
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,430
I think...

1725
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,439
I suddenly had this thought.

1726
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,340
Up until the second dish is their actual menu.

1727
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,340
- This?
- A chef could've come up with this.

1728
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,709
Steamed...

1729
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,880
A chef developed this menu?

1730
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,179
That's right. We've never had...

1731
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,420
- steamed eel before.
- Never.

1732
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,620
A chef might've tried something new.

1733
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,919
That could be it.

1734
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,390
(The unfamiliar steamed eel was a chef trying something new?)

1735
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,519
Shall I ask the owner the price?

1736
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,790
- Yes.
- Let's ask.

1737
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,260
Ma'am.

1738
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,589
May I ask how much this is?

1739
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,499
It's a Pungcheon eel course meal.

1740
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,000
It's 78 dollars.

1741
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,599
- Per person?
- Why is it so cheap?

1742
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,269
- The whole course meal?
- Yes.

1743
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,940
- Why is it so cheap?
- Isn't that cheap?

1744
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,969
- There are more dishes to come.
- Yes, there are.

1745
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,610
Eel stew and pot rice.

1746
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,309
- Then it's cheap.
- That's a very reasonable price.

1747
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,640
Then...

1748
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,309
- How is that possible?
- Then...

1749
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,780
- Around 320 dollars?
- It's 300 dollars.

1750
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,049
It's still cheap.

1751
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,449
(The whole meal only costs 78 dollars per person?)

1752
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,349
How long has it been since you started this course meal?

1753
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,190
I've been doing it from the start, so it's been four years.

1754
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,029
My mom cooked this for me and my family.

1755
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,789
- Like this?
- When I was young.

1756
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,029
She has 1 son and 7 daughters.

1757
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,730
Since she has a lot of kids,

1758
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,630
she made steamed eels for us to eat.

1759
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,269
- It's so delicious.
- But I...

1760
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,239
She even brought up her childhood.

1761
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,270
Exactly.

1762
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,379
Does she really have 1 son and 7 daughters?

1763
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,449
(Does she really have 1 son and 7 daughters?)

1764
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:16,450
He's suspicious.

1765
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:17,810
Does she really have 1 son and 7 daughters?

1766
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,720
(At a loss for words)

1767
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,549
I'm going to ask you their names.

1768
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,049
(A new way of investigating is to ask about her family.)

1769
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,290
Because she did this when she said that.

1770
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:31,090
(She has 1 son and 7 daughters.)

1771
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,659
(Her action didn't match her words.)

1772
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,799
Did you mean four daughters?

1773
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,399
No. 1 son and 7 daughters.

1774
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,100
- Is it 1 son and 7 daughters?
- Yes.

1775
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,239
Tell us their names.

1776
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,300
(Flustered)

1777
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,440
- You can go back.
- Okay. I'll leave now.

1778
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,050
- Gosh, it's...
- She does look suspicious.

1779
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,079
That's a lot of names to memorize.

1780
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,920
Seven other siblings...

1781
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,319
Here's the stew and rice.

1782
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,390
Already?

1783
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,690
(Already?)

1784
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,360
Put some on your plate.

1785
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,499
- As I said before, - Per person...

1786
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
- we used 5,000 eel heads.
- Yes.

1787
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,200
Ma'am, why do you look at me as you explain?

1788
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,639
Five thousand eel heads.

1789
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,710
- Five thousand eel heads.
- It's eel stew.

1790
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:20,010
(Made using 5,000 eel heads)

1791
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,179
(Eel's savory flavor seeped into the spicy stew)

1792
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,849
This is a nourishing dish.

1793
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,450
This is the real deal.

1794
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,919
(It's served with pot rice.)

1795
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,520
You must lose weight for three days to enjoy it.

1796
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,819
- Isn't it delicious?
- You eat with gusto.

1797
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,259
- Gosh, this...
- It's incredible.

1798
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,630
- Isn't it great?
- This...

1799
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,799
It's nice.

1800
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,669
- Whatever I eat... It feels real.
- The timing...

1801
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,330
- It washes down my inside.
- Yes.

1802
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,570
It tastes like the soup has all the eel extract.

1803
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:53,380
(The deep taste of whole eels)

1804
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,540
Wonpil, isn't it great?

1805
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,910
It's so tasty.

1806
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,279
- It's an invigorating dish.
- Young K is enjoying it too.

1807
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,819
(DAY6 members get treated with an invigorating dish.)

1808
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,150
They're eating with gusto.

1809
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,789
Since they work a lot, they should eat well.

1810
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,089
- Of course.
- That's right. They perform.

1811
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,560
Seok Jin, don't eat so much.

1812
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:10,890
"Don't eat so much?"

1813
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:14,000
- Don't overdo it. That's right.
- For 26 years...

1814
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,400
- Is this place real?
- It seems real, right?

1815
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,939
It's confusing. Is it real?

1816
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,300
In my opinion,

1817
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,669
this dish and other dishes are real.

1818
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,009
But I feel like the Six Flying Dragons eel dish...

1819
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,710
has been added to the course.

1820
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,080
- I agree with you.
- Right?

1821
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,219
I feel like the presentation of grilled eel should've been...

1822
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,449
as extraordinary as that of the steamed eel dragon.

1823
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,649
Exactly.

1824
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:39,790
It was too...

1825
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,790
You're right. It was too different.

1826
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,789
(A sudden high five)

1827
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,860
That's insane.

1828
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,400
What's insane? What's going on?

1829
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,100
You don't know, do you?

1830
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,270
We need to add a few moments like this one...

1831
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,869
for the fans.

1832
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,310
(The fans will be happy.)

1833
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:01,880
- It was for My Day.
- My Day, I always root for DAY6.

1834
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,820
(Thank you.)

1835
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,549
Even if I've made a mistake...

1836
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,720
(Please look kindly upon me.)

1837
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:13,190
Seok Jin, you're a variety show machine.

1838
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,189
- I'm learning a lot from you.
- Of course.

1839
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,359
I'm learning a lot from you.

1840
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,889
That's a way to survive in the entertainment business.

1841
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,399
This is the secret behind my long-running career.

1842
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,700
(The secret behind Seok Jin's long-running career)

1843
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,129
This is so hard.

1844
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,269
(Six Flying Dragons 1. Steamed eel that's out of place)

1845
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,400
(2. The owner with many siblings 3. Too many courses for the price)

1846
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,370
What's the third one?

1847
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,640
Secret Garden.

1848
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,080
Hold on a second.

1849
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,550
What's this?

1850
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:39,220
- Is Secret Garden a pizza place?
- Pizza?

1851
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,620
Is it a pizza place?

1852
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,120
How strange.

1853
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,020
What's this?

1854
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,320
I see a drawing of ice cream and cookies.

1855
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,760
What?

1856
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,959
The location is so inconvenient for the customers.

1857
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,600
(A popular place that's located on the remote roadside?)

1858
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,400
(Is Secret Garden a dessert place?)

1859
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,100
Do people come here...

1860
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,710
to eat?

1861
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,639
(Suspicious)

1862
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,909
It makes no sense.

1863
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:09,709
(There's only a building that looks like a warehouse.)

1864
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,050
It stands out too much.

1865
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,649
Isn't the location too absurd?

1866
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,350
I know. It's a warehouse.

1867
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,519
Gnocchi, lasagna, pasta, and steak.

1868
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,719
(Is it a restaurant that serves ordinary Western cuisine?)

1869
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,119
I thought it was an ice cream place.

1870
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,729
It says "Ice cream and snack" on the signboard.

1871
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,199
This place is too fake, right?

1872
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,169
(The combination of Western cuisine,)

1873
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,929
(ice cream, and snack?)

1874
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:33,169
- This place is strange.
- Everything seems out of place.

1875
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,199
- I know.
- Right?

1876
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,399
(Secret Garden is even more suspicious up close.)

1877
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,469
(What kind of a place is Secret Garden?)

1878
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:38,570
(What?)

1879
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,709
(Is it a regular unmanned ice cream store?)

1880
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:43,950
It's an ice cream store.

1881
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,979
It's unmanned.

1882
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,719
(Self checkout machine, snacks,)

1883
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,089
(and ice cream fridge)

1884
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:53,760
(It's an unmanned ice cream store we're familiar with.)

1885
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,030
(The snacks and ice cream can't be more ordinary.)

1886
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,630
(They look around.)

1887
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,900
(Rubbing)

1888
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,069
(They touch the fridge.)

1889
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,769
There are just snacks and...

1890
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,700
(Nothing is out of place.)

1891
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,369
I know. It's an ice cream store.

1892
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,669
(Isn't it an ordinary place with nothing to be suspicious of?)

1893
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,169
There's a "Push" button for a door.

1894
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,610
(Push)

1895
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,479
(Seok Jin spots a "Push" button for a door.)

1896
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,350
Is that why it's Secret Garden?

1897
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,820
(He opens the door.)

1898
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,672
There are just snacks and...

1899
01:06:28,673 --> 01:06:30,783
(Nothing is out of place.)

1900
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:32,282
I know. It's an ice cream store.

1901
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:33,512
(Isn't it an ordinary place with nothing to be suspicious of?)

1902
01:06:33,513 --> 01:06:34,952
There's a "Push" button for a door.

1903
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,783
(Push)

1904
01:06:37,323 --> 01:06:40,392
(Seok Jin spots a "Push" button for a door.)

1905
01:06:40,393 --> 01:06:43,363
Is that why it's Secret Garden?

1906
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:47,493
(He opens the door.)

1907
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,433
- It has to be a lie. No way!
- No way!

1908
01:06:56,043 --> 01:06:57,202
(When the door opens,)

1909
01:06:57,203 --> 01:06:59,713
(a luxurious place reveals itself.)

1910
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:02,343
(Behind the automatic door with the cute characters...)

1911
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:07,553
(is a luxurious place that resembles a medieval European banquet hall.)

1912
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:12,353
(The wallpaper and props have the antique vibes.)

1913
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:16,462
(What kind of a place is Secret Garden?)

1914
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:19,332
On the outside,

1915
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,133
it looks like an unmanned convenience store.

1916
01:07:22,903 --> 01:07:24,062
No way.

1917
01:07:24,063 --> 01:07:25,103
(They can't help but exclaim when the door opens.)

1918
01:07:25,633 --> 01:07:26,832
(Their eyes go wide.)

1919
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:27,833
No way.

1920
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:30,403
It's like an escape room.

1921
01:07:30,703 --> 01:07:33,013
This is... Hold on. Is this a restroom?

1922
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:34,073
Open it.

1923
01:07:34,373 --> 01:07:36,713
- It's like "Kingsman." - Is it a restroom?

1924
01:07:36,743 --> 01:07:37,842
It's a restroom.

1925
01:07:37,843 --> 01:07:38,843
(True to the name, Secret Garden, the restroom is in the wardrobe.)

1926
01:07:38,844 --> 01:07:40,352
It's big.

1927
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:41,552
It's spacious inside.

1928
01:07:41,553 --> 01:07:43,523
- No way.
- Gosh, this place...

1929
01:07:43,823 --> 01:07:45,423
is a secret space for real.

1930
01:07:45,553 --> 01:07:46,723
It's unbelievable.

1931
01:07:47,053 --> 01:07:48,792
(It's unbelievable.)

1932
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:50,893
I'm speechless.

1933
01:07:51,723 --> 01:07:53,062
This makes no sense.

1934
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:55,092
(There's a new world behind the door.)

1935
01:07:55,093 --> 01:07:57,332
The owners are crazy these days.

1936
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,562
(A high praise)

1937
01:07:58,563 --> 01:08:00,032
I know. This is...

1938
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,132
(Impressed)

1939
01:08:01,133 --> 01:08:03,043
Doesn't it seem like...

1940
01:08:03,343 --> 01:08:05,843
a set for a show?

1941
01:08:06,343 --> 01:08:08,142
The outside and the inside are too different.

1942
01:08:08,143 --> 01:08:11,183
That's why this place is real.

1943
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:12,752
It's too much like a set.

1944
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:14,282
- The outside too.
- Yes.

1945
01:08:14,283 --> 01:08:16,382
- It's a setting arousing curiosity.
- Yes.

1946
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,783
(Jae Seok thinks it's a unique spot with interior design for marketing!)

1947
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:21,593
- It's too grand to be a set.
- This is incredible.

1948
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:22,923
(Let's see.)

1949
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:26,533
We saw a place like this in Episode 1 of Season 1.

1950
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:29,833
That's right. It was a whiskey bar.

1951
01:08:30,203 --> 01:08:33,003
(They pressed a button to open the door back then too.)

1952
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:35,533
(They opened the secret door...)

1953
01:08:36,003 --> 01:08:37,973
(and went past the secret passageway...)

1954
01:08:38,143 --> 01:08:40,643
(to enter a popular place with the vibes of a palace!)

1955
01:08:41,613 --> 01:08:43,383
(It feels like a set.)

1956
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,713
(They suspected the place as a set too.)

1957
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,353
Was that place real?

1958
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:49,553
That place was real.

1959
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:54,123
(How about this place with a similar concept?)

1960
01:08:54,153 --> 01:08:55,922
We'll need to talk to the owner.

1961
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,022
Sir.

1962
01:08:57,023 --> 01:08:58,693
(They decide to talk to the owner.)

1963
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:00,333
(What?)

1964
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:01,633
(The owner appears from the kitchen.)

1965
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:02,633
- Hello.
- Hello.

1966
01:09:03,503 --> 01:09:06,002
(The owner of Secret Garden, Kim Min Su)

1967
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:07,432
The owner looks ordinary.

1968
01:09:07,433 --> 01:09:09,032
(Taken aback)

1969
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:12,042
Sir, this place has the European vibes,

1970
01:09:12,043 --> 01:09:14,473
but you're wearing casual clothes.

1971
01:09:14,573 --> 01:09:16,442
I think he works out a lot.

1972
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:17,883
Look at his forearm muscles.

1973
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,513
(Bulging)

1974
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:24,623
(His forearm muscles are on another level.)

1975
01:09:24,783 --> 01:09:25,783
(Staring intently)

1976
01:09:25,784 --> 01:09:26,922
Are you a gym owner?

1977
01:09:26,923 --> 01:09:27,923
(Does he have two jobs?)

1978
01:09:27,923 --> 01:09:28,923
No.

1979
01:09:29,563 --> 01:09:30,563
- No?
- No, I'm not.

1980
01:09:30,563 --> 01:09:31,563
I see.

1981
01:09:31,564 --> 01:09:32,962
(Flustered)

1982
01:09:32,963 --> 01:09:34,532
(That's funny.)

1983
01:09:34,533 --> 01:09:36,132
The owner is a bit eccentric.

1984
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:37,162
Here.

1985
01:09:37,163 --> 01:09:38,662
(The owner has alluring charms.)

1986
01:09:38,663 --> 01:09:40,733
Sir, what's your combined weight for the big three?

1987
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:42,942
I don't lift heavy weights.

1988
01:09:42,943 --> 01:09:44,802
But you're so muscular.

1989
01:09:44,803 --> 01:09:46,572
You don't lift heavy weights?

1990
01:09:46,573 --> 01:09:47,573
(DAY6 members are incredulous.)

1991
01:09:47,574 --> 01:09:48,643
That's fake.

1992
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,912
(A muscular man who doesn't lift heavy weights)

1993
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:52,413
(Fake)

1994
01:09:52,713 --> 01:09:53,882
Sir, that's nonsense.

1995
01:09:53,883 --> 01:09:54,883
(After the memorable greetings with the owner)

1996
01:09:54,884 --> 01:09:58,452
Sir, how did you come up with the unexpected interior design?

1997
01:09:58,453 --> 01:09:59,623
We were so surprised.

1998
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:03,292
I wanted to make a place people would want to travel for.

1999
01:10:03,293 --> 01:10:07,093
Think of it as a restaurant that's different inside.

2000
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:10,932
You don't go to a restaurant to simply eat.

2001
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:13,572
You go there for the experience.

2002
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:16,172
So I designed a place that'd amaze the customers...

2003
01:10:16,173 --> 01:10:17,602
upon entrance.

2004
01:10:17,603 --> 01:10:18,702
(He designed it so that amazement would be the first impression.)

2005
01:10:18,703 --> 01:10:21,213
The Medieval European interior design that unfolds...

2006
01:10:21,243 --> 01:10:23,812
when the secret door opens suits my taste.

2007
01:10:23,813 --> 01:10:25,143
Sixth Sense members,

2008
01:10:25,613 --> 01:10:27,152
is this place real?

2009
01:10:27,153 --> 01:10:29,752
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

2010
01:10:29,753 --> 01:10:32,722
What's up with the unmanned convenience store outside?

2011
01:10:32,723 --> 01:10:35,752
You become more moved when you have no expectations.

2012
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:36,762
That's it.

2013
01:10:36,763 --> 01:10:38,963
- My thought is the same as his.
- The key point is the same.

2014
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:41,032
Is this an eatery?

2015
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:42,193
Yes, it's a restaurant.

2016
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,563
Are the products on sale at the store outside?

2017
01:10:44,963 --> 01:10:46,003
Yes.

2018
01:10:46,603 --> 01:10:48,873
- Ice cream bars are on sale.
- How about the snacks?

2019
01:10:49,303 --> 01:10:51,742
The snacks are past the expiration date.

2020
01:10:51,743 --> 01:10:53,672
(He fails to suppress his laughter.)

2021
01:10:53,673 --> 01:10:55,542
Most of them have been discarded.

2022
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:56,812
(The snacks are props that aren't on sale.)

2023
01:10:56,813 --> 01:10:58,442
(DAY6 members are incredulous.)

2024
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:01,852
It's a setup for lowering people's expectations.

2025
01:11:01,853 --> 01:11:04,282
- A setup.
- It isn't for business, right?

2026
01:11:04,283 --> 01:11:06,823
But many people come for ice cream.

2027
01:11:06,953 --> 01:11:08,722
Are there people who only come for ice cream?

2028
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,923
There's a basketball court right in front of the building.

2029
01:11:11,093 --> 01:11:12,732
Children who play basketball come.

2030
01:11:12,733 --> 01:11:14,232
They come and buy ice cream.

2031
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,133
(He makes good money from selling ice cream.)

2032
01:11:16,203 --> 01:11:17,902
I was surprised by...

2033
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:21,202
a convenience store that had a restaurant inside...

2034
01:11:21,203 --> 01:11:22,632
and the owner...

2035
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:24,143
in casual clothes.

2036
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,142
I was surprised.

2037
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:28,672
- I expected a tuxedo.
- Yes.

2038
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:30,912
I thought you'd wear an outfit that suits the atmosphere.

2039
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:32,212
Did you choose that outfit for a twist?

2040
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:33,413
(Did you choose that outfit for a twist?)

2041
01:11:33,813 --> 01:11:35,483
- Did I choose it for a twist?
- Yes.

2042
01:11:35,953 --> 01:11:37,422
I don't have something like a tuxedo.

2043
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:38,582
(I didn't mean it like that.)

2044
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:41,493
(His answer is unexpected.)

2045
01:11:42,493 --> 01:11:44,992
(This DAY6 member can't suppress his laughter.)

2046
01:11:44,993 --> 01:11:46,022
Your reason is so...

2047
01:11:46,023 --> 01:11:47,392
I don't know if it's a marketing strategy,

2048
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:49,332
but you seem very unmotivated.

2049
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:50,363
(You seem very unmotivated.)

2050
01:11:51,163 --> 01:11:53,403
He makes me curious.

2051
01:11:53,573 --> 01:11:54,832
He keeps the customers on their toes.

2052
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:55,902
- Yes.
- So...

2053
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,272
- He keeps them on their toes.
- He makes them curious.

2054
01:11:57,273 --> 01:11:58,873
He's like the entrance of this restaurant.

2055
01:11:58,903 --> 01:12:00,712
- Yes.
- He has that vibe.

2056
01:12:00,713 --> 01:12:01,742
Sir,

2057
01:12:01,743 --> 01:12:03,712
which dishes are popular among customers?

2058
01:12:03,713 --> 01:12:05,442
Bismarck pizza...

2059
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:06,882
and Oreo steak.

2060
01:12:06,883 --> 01:12:09,312
- Oreo, the cookie?
- The snack.

2061
01:12:09,313 --> 01:12:11,222
Why did he incorporate Oreo?

2062
01:12:11,223 --> 01:12:13,822
(Why did he combine a steak and a snack?)

2063
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,892
We'll order the Oreo steak and the other dish.

2064
01:12:15,893 --> 01:12:17,662
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2065
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,722
Thank you.

2066
01:12:18,723 --> 01:12:22,593
(The owner leaves to prepare the dishes.)

2067
01:12:22,693 --> 01:12:24,663
- I'm suspicious.
- What is it?

2068
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:26,733
There's a possibility...

2069
01:12:27,173 --> 01:12:29,033
of the owner being fake.

2070
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:30,543
You think the owner is fake.

2071
01:12:30,573 --> 01:12:31,942
If he's fake,

2072
01:12:31,943 --> 01:12:35,543
wouldn't they have hired someone more enthusiastic?

2073
01:12:36,113 --> 01:12:37,682
But he's too...

2074
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:40,183
- He's too conceptual.
- Yes.

2075
01:12:40,213 --> 01:12:41,712
If it's his restaurant...

2076
01:12:41,713 --> 01:12:43,152
he wouldn't be so...

2077
01:12:43,153 --> 01:12:44,382
He wouldn't be so lazy?

2078
01:12:44,383 --> 01:12:45,423
(He wouldn't be so lazy?)

2079
01:12:45,553 --> 01:12:48,522
(Sir, I didn't say anything.)

2080
01:12:48,523 --> 01:12:50,062
It feels like a gym towel.

2081
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:51,223
- Right?
- Yes.

2082
01:12:51,523 --> 01:12:53,193
A gym towel!

2083
01:12:53,663 --> 01:12:55,332
- A gym towel. Yes.
- He seems like a gym owner.

2084
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,502
He seems like a gym owner.

2085
01:12:56,503 --> 01:12:57,962
(This place is fake!)

2086
01:12:57,963 --> 01:12:59,932
(Is the owner a hired gym owner?)

2087
01:12:59,933 --> 01:13:02,773
(The owner reappears while they're making deductions.)

2088
01:13:02,873 --> 01:13:05,043
(The food catches their attention.)

2089
01:13:05,143 --> 01:13:06,572
- It looks amazing.
- What's that?

2090
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:07,772
What's that?

2091
01:13:07,773 --> 01:13:09,813
What was the name of the pizza?

2092
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:11,782
Bismarck pizza.

2093
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:13,483
- Bismarck pizza.
- What's Bismarck?

2094
01:13:13,653 --> 01:13:17,123
(Bismarck pizza with an unusual appearance)

2095
01:13:17,623 --> 01:13:19,483
Stretch the rested dough with hands...

2096
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:22,193
and spread tomato sauce on the top.

2097
01:13:22,293 --> 01:13:24,793
Spread a handful of mozzarella on the top as well.

2098
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:27,263
Put an egg in the middle...

2099
01:13:27,463 --> 01:13:29,063
and bake in the oven.

2100
01:13:30,463 --> 01:13:32,533
Top with prosciutto, wild arugula,

2101
01:13:32,903 --> 01:13:35,933
and meringue to finish off the pizza.

2102
01:13:37,303 --> 01:13:40,173
(Bismarck pizza)

2103
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:41,943
What's Bismarck?

2104
01:13:42,413 --> 01:13:43,883
Bismarck is...

2105
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:46,313
was a German chancellor.

2106
01:13:46,553 --> 01:13:47,713
How is he related to this dish?

2107
01:13:48,783 --> 01:13:50,422
I had no idea.

2108
01:13:50,423 --> 01:13:51,652
Hold on.

2109
01:13:51,653 --> 01:13:52,853
- Didn't you know?
- No.

2110
01:13:53,923 --> 01:13:56,122
(Spitting)

2111
01:13:56,123 --> 01:13:57,593
I didn't name the dish.

2112
01:13:58,193 --> 01:13:59,462
He was a German chancellor.

2113
01:13:59,463 --> 01:14:02,293
He was a famous man who was known as the Iron Chancellor.

2114
01:14:02,903 --> 01:14:04,962
(There's a likely explanation.)

2115
01:14:04,963 --> 01:14:07,673
(Bismarck was known to love eggs.)

2116
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:11,473
(Perhaps that's why a pizza with an egg on the top...)

2117
01:14:11,673 --> 01:14:15,612
(is called Bismarck Pizza.)

2118
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:17,682
You crack to open the meringue.

2119
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:19,583
- The meringue?
- So that's a meringue.

2120
01:14:20,283 --> 01:14:21,412
I'll crack it.

2121
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:23,153
(I'll crack it.)

2122
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:27,092
- That's...
- It's a meringue.

2123
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:29,223
(He cracks the meringue dome to create a white field of snow.)

2124
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:31,392
On social media, it's known as the meringue pizza.

2125
01:14:31,393 --> 01:14:32,562
Meringue pizza.

2126
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:34,293
- I think I've seen it.
- Not that...

2127
01:14:34,663 --> 01:14:35,692
- Have you seen it?
- Yes.

2128
01:14:35,693 --> 01:14:37,263
I think I've seen the meringue pizza.

2129
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:39,263
It's fun to break it.

2130
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:41,072
- Meringue pizza.
- It's my first time seeing it.

2131
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:42,372
- Same here - It's my first time seeing it too.

2132
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:45,473
There are meringue and egg yolk inside.

2133
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:47,212
- You eat them together.
- You mix them.

2134
01:14:47,213 --> 01:14:49,742
(Meringue and pizza harmonize and give a fun gastronomic moment.)

2135
01:14:49,743 --> 01:14:51,582
Since the restaurant is in a remote place,

2136
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:54,083
people won't come without a marketing strategy.

2137
01:14:54,253 --> 01:14:56,883
- People need a reason to come here.
- They need a reason.

2138
01:14:57,823 --> 01:14:59,483
Here is a slice of pizza.

2139
01:14:59,653 --> 01:15:00,753
Thank you.

2140
01:15:01,523 --> 01:15:02,752
Let's try it.

2141
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:06,263
(How does the meringue pizza taste?)

2142
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,202
Is it tasty?

2143
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:11,302
(I approve.)

2144
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:12,973
It's the epitome of sweet and salty.

2145
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:14,132
It's the meringue.

2146
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:15,373
It's so tasty.

2147
01:15:15,873 --> 01:15:16,903
(My goodness)

2148
01:15:18,503 --> 01:15:20,142
It goes well with prosciutto.

2149
01:15:20,143 --> 01:15:21,372
(It's tasty!)

2150
01:15:21,373 --> 01:15:25,183
It's the taste I've never had in my life.

2151
01:15:26,413 --> 01:15:27,452
(My goodness)

2152
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:28,883
- It's tasty.
- It's unique.

2153
01:15:28,913 --> 01:15:30,153
- It's interesting.
- Mimi.

2154
01:15:31,123 --> 01:15:32,652
- It isn't a dessert.
- No.

2155
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,952
It isn't a traditional pizza either.

2156
01:15:34,953 --> 01:15:36,092
Why is it tasty?

2157
01:15:36,093 --> 01:15:38,193
- Seriously.
- I can't believe I can eat more.

2158
01:15:38,923 --> 01:15:41,133
I can't believe I can eat more.

2159
01:15:41,293 --> 01:15:42,432
(Loach soup pasta, aglio e olio, scallop pasta, etc.)

2160
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:43,732
- It's so tasty.
- What's up with this taste?

2161
01:15:43,733 --> 01:15:44,833
It's so tasty.

2162
01:15:45,863 --> 01:15:47,172
(They've had so much food, but the taste makes them eat more.)

2163
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:48,503
I'm eating more food.

2164
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:50,903
It's sweet, salty, and savory.

2165
01:15:51,143 --> 01:15:52,303
It's different.

2166
01:15:53,573 --> 01:15:55,343
- Here it comes.
- Yes.

2167
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,012
Oreo steak.

2168
01:15:57,013 --> 01:15:59,313
(Why is he bringing out a gift box, not a steak?)

2169
01:15:59,343 --> 01:16:00,482
Smoke is coming out!

2170
01:16:00,483 --> 01:16:01,682
(Smoke is coming out!)

2171
01:16:01,683 --> 01:16:02,712
What is it?

2172
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:05,523
(A suspicious gift box that's surrounded by smoke?)

2173
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,323
Smoke is coming out.

2174
01:16:10,463 --> 01:16:11,763
I smell something burning.

2175
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:13,592
I think he went too far.

2176
01:16:13,593 --> 01:16:15,293
It won't explode, will it?

2177
01:16:16,263 --> 01:16:17,762
- I'll open it.
- Okay.

2178
01:16:17,763 --> 01:16:19,503
(As they feel anxious, the mysterious box finally opens.)

2179
01:16:20,103 --> 01:16:22,373
(The box opens.)

2180
01:16:22,673 --> 01:16:24,042
(What's that?)

2181
01:16:24,043 --> 01:16:25,173
What's that?

2182
01:16:25,843 --> 01:16:29,712
(Amidst the smoke, Oreo steak shows itself.)

2183
01:16:29,713 --> 01:16:32,342
Slice 180g of tenderloin in half...

2184
01:16:32,343 --> 01:16:33,812
and grill the pieces.

2185
01:16:33,813 --> 01:16:35,152
(Grill the pieces for the 1st time.)

2186
01:16:35,153 --> 01:16:36,422
After the first rest,

2187
01:16:36,423 --> 01:16:38,153
cover the pieces with the squid ink crust...

2188
01:16:39,153 --> 01:16:40,592
and bake them in the oven.

2189
01:16:40,593 --> 01:16:41,723
(Bake the pieces for the 2nd time.)

2190
01:16:41,753 --> 01:16:42,892
After the second rest,

2191
01:16:42,893 --> 01:16:45,893
put the cream cheese filling between the pieces.

2192
01:16:45,923 --> 01:16:47,833
(Put the cream cheese filling between the steaks.)

2193
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:51,033
(The cookie-like appearance is complete.)

2194
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:55,773
(Steak that looks like a cookie, Oreo steak)

2195
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:59,243
(It's a dish that catches the eyes.)

2196
01:16:59,813 --> 01:17:01,073
It smells very burnt.

2197
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:03,643
- It's smoked.
- Is it smoked?

2198
01:17:03,783 --> 01:17:04,943
Is it smoked?

2199
01:17:05,443 --> 01:17:07,683
- I definitely smelled it.
- What?

2200
01:17:07,713 --> 01:17:08,852
Isn't it burnt?

2201
01:17:08,853 --> 01:17:10,382
(Sitting closest to the dish, Jae Seok struggles with the smell.)

2202
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:12,023
- It's a bit burnt.
- No, it's smoked.

2203
01:17:13,023 --> 01:17:14,593
It's the smell of burnt paper.

2204
01:17:15,223 --> 01:17:17,392
- Isn't it burnt?
- No.

2205
01:17:17,393 --> 01:17:19,192
Is it the smell of wood chips?

2206
01:17:19,193 --> 01:17:21,893
(He added a lot of smoke so that it wouldn't get out.)

2207
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:25,563
It's called the Oreo steak because it looks like a cookie sandwich.

2208
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,102
I see.

2209
01:17:27,103 --> 01:17:28,473
The inside is a steak.

2210
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:31,273
The outside is Oreo.

2211
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:33,443
No, the outside is squid ink.

2212
01:17:34,143 --> 01:17:35,713
It just looks like Oreo.

2213
01:17:35,843 --> 01:17:38,283
- Did you coat it with squid ink?
- Yes.

2214
01:17:38,513 --> 01:17:39,642
Why?

2215
01:17:39,643 --> 01:17:42,252
(Why?)

2216
01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:43,583
So that it looks like a cookie sandwich.

2217
01:17:44,183 --> 01:17:46,023
So that it looks like Oreo.

2218
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:48,322
Are the customers okay with the smoky smell?

2219
01:17:48,323 --> 01:17:50,063
Don't they struggle with it?

2220
01:17:50,263 --> 01:17:51,322
No.

2221
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:52,622
No one has described it...

2222
01:17:52,623 --> 01:17:54,692
as a burnt smell.

2223
01:17:54,693 --> 01:17:55,932
Was I the first one?

2224
01:17:55,933 --> 01:17:57,633
(Was I the first one?)

2225
01:17:57,663 --> 01:17:59,403
This place is suffocating.

2226
01:17:59,733 --> 01:18:01,503
This is a burnt smell.

2227
01:18:02,203 --> 01:18:04,872
Are you sure Jae Seok was the first one to mention it?

2228
01:18:04,873 --> 01:18:06,342
Although we've never met before,

2229
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:08,443
- we can have a bit of banter.
- Yes.

2230
01:18:09,013 --> 01:18:10,142
I mean...

2231
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,983
(The owner is full of charms.)

2232
01:18:12,143 --> 01:18:14,652
If three tables order the dish,

2233
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:16,013
wouldn't the smoke be too much?

2234
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:18,053
Some people cough.

2235
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,123
Even though they cough...

2236
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:23,123
- Do you cut it here?
- Yes.

2237
01:18:23,363 --> 01:18:25,223
Mimi, cut it.

2238
01:18:25,523 --> 01:18:27,133
Okay, I'll cut it.

2239
01:18:27,793 --> 01:18:29,292
It's really...

2240
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,362
It's a steak. It has been...

2241
01:18:30,363 --> 01:18:31,403
- grilled well.
- The knife goes in easily.

2242
01:18:31,563 --> 01:18:33,572
It's a steak inside.

2243
01:18:33,573 --> 01:18:37,103
(The medium rare steak is perfectly pink inside.)

2244
01:18:37,243 --> 01:18:39,072
Why did he create...

2245
01:18:39,073 --> 01:18:40,742
- such a dish?
- Shall we try it?

2246
01:18:40,743 --> 01:18:43,513
(We'll know once we try it.)

2247
01:18:43,843 --> 01:18:45,082
- How is it?
- Is it tasty?

2248
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,912
- It's tasty.
- Is it tasty?

2249
01:18:46,913 --> 01:18:48,213
(The steak is tasty!)

2250
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:50,622
The outside tastes a bit like squid.

2251
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,823
(The squid ink crust adds umami to the dish.)

2252
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:53,692
It goes well with cream cheese.

2253
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:55,693
(The soft cream cheese adds flavors.)

2254
01:18:55,853 --> 01:18:56,892
Let's cut it.

2255
01:18:56,893 --> 01:18:59,522
- It came in a different way.
- It's a different presentation.

2256
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:00,962
This version...

2257
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:02,762
- looks more like Oreo.
- Seriously.

2258
01:19:02,763 --> 01:19:03,963
It's cute.

2259
01:19:04,063 --> 01:19:05,602
I have to take a photo.

2260
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:06,633
(It looks more like a cookie when it's outside the box.)

2261
01:19:06,903 --> 01:19:09,803
(Seok Jin, the Gen Zer will upload the photos on Instagram.)

2262
01:19:10,403 --> 01:19:12,103
The meat is really tender.

2263
01:19:12,673 --> 01:19:13,842
The cream cheese is...

2264
01:19:13,843 --> 01:19:15,413
- strangely addictive.
- It's very tasty.

2265
01:19:15,873 --> 01:19:18,312
I'd come here because the place is fascinating.

2266
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:21,613
- But the food is enough.
- The food is tasty.

2267
01:19:21,813 --> 01:19:24,382
I'd come here for the food.

2268
01:19:24,383 --> 01:19:27,193
(Are the two dishes that satisfied the Sixth Sense members real?)

2269
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:28,793
I think this place is real.

2270
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,623
I think it's real.

2271
01:19:31,023 --> 01:19:34,192
- Why is the owner so suspicious?
- I know.

2272
01:19:34,193 --> 01:19:36,063
If this place is fake,

2273
01:19:36,163 --> 01:19:37,802
the owner wouldn't explain things like that.

2274
01:19:37,803 --> 01:19:38,933
(The owner wouldn't explain things like that.)

2275
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,972
That's right. They'd hire a better actor.

2276
01:19:41,973 --> 01:19:43,273
They'd hire someone...

2277
01:19:43,803 --> 01:19:45,373
more fitting.

2278
01:19:45,643 --> 01:19:47,042
I think this place is real.

2279
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:48,343
(Because of that, Mimi thinks this place is real.)

2280
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:50,543
- I think this place is real.
- It's real.

2281
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:52,243
To be honest...

2282
01:19:54,713 --> 01:19:56,182
This place totally seemed real.

2283
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:58,282
But the burnt smell makes me think that it's fake.

2284
01:19:58,283 --> 01:20:00,053
Right? That lingers in my mind.

2285
01:20:00,123 --> 01:20:02,292
Who would serve a dish like that when it makes the customers cough?

2286
01:20:02,293 --> 01:20:03,923
(It makes no sense to smoke a dish to the point of coughing.)

2287
01:20:04,363 --> 01:20:05,823
Isn't it funny?

2288
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:07,462
Is it funny?

2289
01:20:07,463 --> 01:20:08,733
(Really? Is it funny?)

2290
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,232
I think it's very funny.

2291
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:12,362
(Flippant)

2292
01:20:12,363 --> 01:20:14,072
If you expect it, it'll be funny.

2293
01:20:14,073 --> 01:20:16,272
- I think it's very funny.
- Really? Then...

2294
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:18,473
I won't be able to suppress my laughter on my way home.

2295
01:20:19,443 --> 01:20:20,943
I know what you mean.

2296
01:20:21,013 --> 01:20:22,773
What kind of a restaurant makes the customers cough?

2297
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,283
- It's very funny.
- It's very funny indeed.

2298
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:26,813
And this place doesn't have...

2299
01:20:28,653 --> 01:20:29,752
It has windows.

2300
01:20:29,753 --> 01:20:31,282
(Blurting out)

2301
01:20:31,283 --> 01:20:32,882
(Laughing)

2302
01:20:32,883 --> 01:20:34,622
It has windows. I had the same thought.

2303
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:36,992
This place is too suffocating to be a restaurant.

2304
01:20:36,993 --> 01:20:38,223
It's suffocating.

2305
01:20:38,893 --> 01:20:40,533
You can open the windows, right?

2306
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:44,363
- I can't open it.
- Push it.

2307
01:20:44,433 --> 01:20:46,803
(Can't you open the windows?)

2308
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:48,602
I don't think you can open it.

2309
01:20:48,603 --> 01:20:50,542
This is a set.

2310
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:51,603
I can't open it.

2311
01:20:51,803 --> 01:20:53,673
- There are no hinges.
- This is a set.

2312
01:20:53,743 --> 01:20:55,913
- I don't know what to think.
- You know...

2313
01:20:56,043 --> 01:20:57,413
- It's so confusing.
- You know...

2314
01:20:57,443 --> 01:21:00,082
- There is so much smoke.
- I think this place is real.

2315
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:01,382
(Secret Garden, 1. Unmotivated owner)

2316
01:21:01,383 --> 01:21:02,652
(2. Steak with too much smoke)

2317
01:21:02,653 --> 01:21:03,753
(3. Fake windows that belong on a set)

2318
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:05,982
Which one do you think it is?

2319
01:21:05,983 --> 01:21:07,823
I don't know.

2320
01:21:08,193 --> 01:21:10,122
The more I think, the more confusing it gets.

2321
01:21:10,123 --> 01:21:11,323
I don't know.

2322
01:21:12,263 --> 01:21:13,462
You should go first.

2323
01:21:13,463 --> 01:21:14,693
There was a place...

2324
01:21:14,963 --> 01:21:17,032
I suspected from the start.

2325
01:21:17,033 --> 01:21:19,033
With caution, I say...

2326
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,032
the first restaurant is fake.

2327
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:23,173
- I see.
- Yes.

2328
01:21:23,873 --> 01:21:26,473
(The first restaurant had the retro interior design.)

2329
01:21:26,843 --> 01:21:31,513
(The retro concept is easy for the production crew!)

2330
01:21:32,213 --> 01:21:35,383
(And there was the secret weapon of the popular place!)

2331
01:21:35,883 --> 01:21:37,582
(Loach soup pasta,)

2332
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,323
(the transformation of an invigorating dish,)

2333
01:21:39,653 --> 01:21:42,123
(When DAY6 went to Vietnam for a concert,)

2334
01:21:42,893 --> 01:21:47,593
(the loach soup pasta meal kit was seen?)

2335
01:21:47,933 --> 01:21:52,462
(After their meal,)

2336
01:21:52,463 --> 01:21:54,673
(the loach soup pasta meal kit was found?)

2337
01:21:55,203 --> 01:22:01,413
(The meal kit the DAY6 members saw?)

2338
01:22:02,213 --> 01:22:06,543
(First hot place, Reply 1988)

2339
01:22:06,753 --> 01:22:08,153
I have a feeling it's number two.

2340
01:22:08,783 --> 01:22:10,582
- Number two seems fake as well.
- I feel the same way.

2341
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:12,422
I felt strongly suspicious...

2342
01:22:12,423 --> 01:22:13,723
- about number two.
- Right.

2343
01:22:14,053 --> 01:22:16,152
(Intrigued)

2344
01:22:16,153 --> 01:22:18,262
(The eel restaurant felt completely different...)

2345
01:22:18,263 --> 01:22:19,723
(from what they expected.)

2346
01:22:20,563 --> 01:22:23,032
(The second hot place felt more like a cafe...)

2347
01:22:23,033 --> 01:22:26,033
(instead of an eel restaurant.)

2348
01:22:26,663 --> 01:22:29,372
(However, they were shocked...)

2349
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:32,543
(by the steamed eel shaped like a dragon.)

2350
01:22:33,203 --> 01:22:39,943
(Second hot place, Six Flying Dragons)

2351
01:22:40,313 --> 01:22:43,352
And as for number one,

2352
01:22:43,353 --> 01:22:44,822
- I think we've...
- Hey, Detective Ko.

2353
01:22:44,823 --> 01:22:45,853
Yes?

2354
01:22:46,123 --> 01:22:48,193
Use that camera when we are moving around.

2355
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:49,992
- He's filming himself.
- Right.

2356
01:22:49,993 --> 01:22:52,062
(I apologize.)

2357
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:53,692
- Detective Ko.
- A narcissist.

2358
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:55,232
- Mimi.
- Yes?

2359
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:56,362
(The camera gets taken from him.)

2360
01:22:56,363 --> 01:22:57,462
What do you think, Mimi?

2361
01:22:57,463 --> 01:23:00,332
- What's your opinion?
- She keeps saying it's number two.

2362
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:02,602
- Number two feels weird as well.
- Gosh.

2363
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:06,302
Objectively, number one feels...

2364
01:23:06,303 --> 01:23:07,713
- the most suspicious.
- Right.

2365
01:23:08,043 --> 01:23:09,943
The number one feels that way,

2366
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:13,342
but number three bothers me as well.

2367
01:23:13,343 --> 01:23:14,383
- What?
- What?

2368
01:23:17,853 --> 01:23:20,492
(As soon as the doors opened,)

2369
01:23:20,493 --> 01:23:23,593
(a magical place was revealed.)

2370
01:23:24,393 --> 01:23:27,592
(Beyond just a meal,)

2371
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:29,933
(a spatial experience is provided?)

2372
01:23:30,603 --> 01:23:35,772
(Third hot place, Secret Garden)

2373
01:23:35,773 --> 01:23:36,902
Here's what's strange about number three.

2374
01:23:36,903 --> 01:23:38,002
A place without windows...

2375
01:23:38,003 --> 01:23:40,272
felt so weird as a restaurant.

2376
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:41,613
Do you also think number three is fake then?

2377
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:43,913
It's around 30 percent for number 3.

2378
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,312
- Is it 33.3 percent?
- Hold on.

2379
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,653
- It's 30 percent.
- Before you got off the car,

2380
01:23:49,853 --> 01:23:51,552
- didn't you say...
- To be simple.

2381
01:23:51,553 --> 01:23:53,452
we should be straightforward as soon as we arrive?

2382
01:23:53,453 --> 01:23:55,222
I can get different thoughts as I arrive.

2383
01:23:55,223 --> 01:23:56,823
- Right.
- Of course.

2384
01:23:57,923 --> 01:24:01,162
How could it be seen even in our Vietnamese concert?

2385
01:24:01,163 --> 01:24:02,632
- It felt so obvious.
- It felt so strange.

2386
01:24:02,633 --> 01:24:03,902
That was why it felt fake.

2387
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:05,102
- So listen up.
- Right.

2388
01:24:05,103 --> 01:24:06,702
- It did feel fake, didn't it?
- Loach soup pasta...

2389
01:24:06,703 --> 01:24:08,032
- sounded really strange.
- Right.

2390
01:24:08,033 --> 01:24:09,402
- It sounded really strange.
- That was made?

2391
01:24:09,403 --> 01:24:10,772
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go with number one.

2392
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:12,642
- Let's go with number one.
- Let's do that.

2393
01:24:12,643 --> 01:24:14,672
It's a twist after another twist.

2394
01:24:14,673 --> 01:24:15,713
- Right.
- Right.

2395
01:24:16,243 --> 01:24:17,982
I can get different thoughts as I arrive.

2396
01:24:17,983 --> 01:24:19,443
- Right.
- Of course.

2397
01:24:19,813 --> 01:24:21,553
There needs to be some sort of ventilation.

2398
01:24:22,113 --> 01:24:23,752
There was a ventilation system at the top.

2399
01:24:23,753 --> 01:24:25,552
A few windows could've been made.

2400
01:24:25,553 --> 01:24:28,122
- Why do you go against that?
- The owner had no choice.

2401
01:24:28,123 --> 01:24:29,593
What do you keep going against my opinion?

2402
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:33,562
- I can have that thought.
- It's not about your thought.

2403
01:24:33,563 --> 01:24:35,332
- Why do you go against it?
- We chose to go with number one...

2404
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,662
in the car.

2405
01:24:36,663 --> 01:24:38,663
I have 35 percent for number 1.

2406
01:24:39,163 --> 01:24:41,002
If it's 35 percent for both places,

2407
01:24:41,003 --> 01:24:42,003
is it 35 percent for the 2nd place as well?

2408
01:24:42,003 --> 01:24:43,003
Yes.

2409
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:45,542
In this situation...

2410
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:46,943
- In this situation, - What number will you go for?

2411
01:24:47,143 --> 01:24:48,572
I will follow the data of the last ten years.

2412
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:49,573
- Right.
- Right.

2413
01:24:49,574 --> 01:24:51,142
I want to trust Wonpil's intuition.

2414
01:24:51,143 --> 01:24:52,282
Why? Don't be like that!

2415
01:24:52,283 --> 01:24:53,283
- That's so much...
- Right. Number one.

2416
01:24:53,284 --> 01:24:54,982
- pressure for me!
- I'm serious.

2417
01:24:54,983 --> 01:24:56,683
- Wonpil.
- If I'm the Hand of Poop,

2418
01:24:56,853 --> 01:24:58,323
he's the Hand of Gold.

2419
01:25:00,183 --> 01:25:06,623
(Wonpil is known as the Hand of Gold in DAY6.)

2420
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:08,892
Your name is Wonpil.

2421
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:10,402
Right. Won means "Best" and Pil means "Help."

2422
01:25:10,403 --> 01:25:11,403
Right!

2423
01:25:11,404 --> 01:25:12,833
"Be the best to help!"

2424
01:25:13,163 --> 01:25:14,932
Won means "Best" and Pil means "Help."

2425
01:25:14,933 --> 01:25:16,333
Go for it, Wonpil.

2426
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,403
Won means "Best" and Pil means "Help."

2427
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:18,403
- Right!
- Go for it.

2428
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,142
- Go!
- You make the decision.

2429
01:25:20,143 --> 01:25:21,212
- Let's go.

2603
01:31:48,707 --> 01:31:50,606
I heard that Heyri Village...

2604
01:31:50,607 --> 01:31:53,677
has many elderly customers.

2605
01:31:54,177 --> 01:31:56,277
How would it be to make a loach soup pasta?

2606
01:31:57,077 --> 01:31:58,817
There are many restorative dishes in Paju.

2607
01:31:59,317 --> 01:32:00,417
I think that's a good idea.

2608
01:32:00,817 --> 01:32:02,586
How was it made so well though?

2609
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:03,986
It actually tasted good.

2610
01:32:03,987 --> 01:32:05,616
(To bring the unfamiliar combination to life,)

2611
01:32:05,617 --> 01:32:06,617
(a special helper has come.)

2612
01:32:06,618 --> 01:32:07,857
- Michelin!
- Gosh.

2613
01:32:08,887 --> 01:32:11,527
- Chef Kim! Welcome!
- Hello.

2614
01:32:12,297 --> 01:32:14,127
I brought the loaches...

2615
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:15,867
that will be used for the dish.

2616
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:17,126
- Really?
- Yes.

2617
01:32:17,127 --> 01:32:18,236
(Chef Kim Do Yun again)

2618
01:32:18,237 --> 01:32:19,496
It's him!

2619
01:32:19,497 --> 01:32:20,566
(Jae Seok was spot on.)

2620
01:32:20,567 --> 01:32:22,967
- You mentioned him earlier!
- See?

2621
01:32:23,207 --> 01:32:24,907
I was right. I mentioned him earlier.

2622
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:27,876
(Through his hands...)

2623
01:32:27,877 --> 01:32:30,876
- He made many healthy dishes...
- Right!

2624
01:32:30,877 --> 01:32:32,376
on our show.

2625
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:33,517
The matcha galbitang.

2626
01:32:34,117 --> 01:32:37,656
(Season 2's greatest helper, Chef Kim Do Yun)

2627
01:32:37,657 --> 01:32:40,357
While eating the food, I wondered to myself,

2628
01:32:40,657 --> 01:32:42,956
- "Chef Kim Do Yun?" - "Could it be Chef Kim Do Yun?"

2629
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:43,957
(He's a Kim Do Yun expert now.)

2630
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,557
- So it really was him.
- Nice one, Jae Seok.

2631
01:32:45,897 --> 01:32:46,926
This is to remove the smell of mud.

2632
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:47,927
I see.

2633
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:49,966
- They swim around in mud.
- Right.

2634
01:32:49,967 --> 01:32:50,967
It was delicious.

2635
01:32:50,968 --> 01:32:52,267
While having the food,

2636
01:32:52,637 --> 01:32:54,236
I could taste the chef's touch.

2637
01:32:54,237 --> 01:32:55,366
Did you taste it?

2638
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,877
It's perfectly seasoned as it's slightly spicy.

2639
01:32:59,537 --> 01:33:02,607
(The recipe has been delivered!)

2640
01:33:02,747 --> 01:33:04,006
(And that was how...)

2641
01:33:04,007 --> 01:33:05,617
So it really was made like that.

2642
01:33:05,777 --> 01:33:06,777
(the loach soup pasta came to life.)

2643
01:33:06,778 --> 01:33:09,116
- I think I'll get reminded of it.
- It will surely come to mind.

2644
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:10,616
- It was nice.
- It was nice.

2645
01:33:10,617 --> 01:33:11,717
It was really good.

2646
01:33:12,357 --> 01:33:15,356
We were told that this was...

2647
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:17,127
for a good cause.

2648
01:33:17,657 --> 01:33:19,426
We will provide the product...

2649
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,267
without much of a profit margin.

2650
01:33:22,827 --> 01:33:25,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

2651
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:27,437
(Thank you.)

2652
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:30,266
As for the profits made from the meal kits,

2653
01:33:30,267 --> 01:33:31,576
should we donate everything?

2654
01:33:31,577 --> 01:33:32,906
(The profits will be donated.)

2655
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:35,976
The meal kit production isn't that difficult.

2656
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,046
Right.

2657
01:33:37,047 --> 01:33:38,846
But...

2658
01:33:38,847 --> 01:33:41,016
(But...)

2659
01:33:41,017 --> 01:33:44,256
we usually take a minimum of three months.

2660
01:33:44,257 --> 01:33:46,987
- Three months?
- That is our minimum.

2661
01:33:47,757 --> 01:33:48,856
(There's a systematic process from development to distribution.)

2662
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:50,087
- It takes a long time.
- Gosh.

2663
01:33:50,357 --> 01:33:52,997
- This was put together?
- All of this was done?

2664
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,726
It wasn't faked. Everything was actually made.

2665
01:33:55,727 --> 01:33:56,767
That's amazing.

2666
01:33:57,497 --> 01:33:58,766
This is the most important thing.

2667
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:01,036
The initial recipe was given to us,

2668
01:34:01,037 --> 01:34:03,366
but a lot of the recipe has to be changed...

2669
01:34:03,367 --> 01:34:04,906
- for mass production.
- Right.

2670
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:06,936
It's hard to create the exact same taste.

2671
01:34:06,937 --> 01:34:08,406
- Right.
- Right.

2672
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:09,746
The taste changes even when it gets delivered.

2673
01:34:09,747 --> 01:34:11,117
It's hard to make it taste exactly the same.

2674
01:34:11,247 --> 01:34:12,876
It actually came to life.

2675
01:34:12,877 --> 01:34:13,977
They went this far?

2676
01:34:14,147 --> 01:34:15,886
- "Make it happen no matter what." - "Make it happen no matter what."

2677
01:34:15,887 --> 01:34:17,316
(The 1st production crew taste test after 2 weeks)

2678
01:34:17,317 --> 01:34:19,716
If it tastes like this when delivered home...

2679
01:34:19,717 --> 01:34:22,056
after watching the show,

2680
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:24,026
I think it will be quite disappointing.

2681
01:34:24,027 --> 01:34:26,227
- She's objective.
- There was honest feedback.

2682
01:34:27,127 --> 01:34:28,626
She sounds objective.

2683
01:34:28,627 --> 01:34:29,867
How meticulous.

2684
01:34:30,727 --> 01:34:33,036
(Deliver the same taste from the restaurant.)

2685
01:34:33,037 --> 01:34:35,266
It's hard to create the same taste.

2686
01:34:35,267 --> 01:34:36,866
- Right.
- It takes a long time.

2687
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:39,036
It has to taste good and original.

2688
01:34:39,037 --> 01:34:40,277
- Right.
- It isn't easy to do that.

2689
01:34:40,507 --> 01:34:42,446
It needs a bit more of the savory taste.

2690
01:34:42,447 --> 01:34:44,047
(It needs a bit more of the savory taste.)

2691
01:34:45,217 --> 01:34:46,346
(Total duration of production, 63 days)

2692
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:47,947
For 63 days. That's 2 months.

2693
01:34:48,447 --> 01:34:49,846
I think anyone would like this.

2694
01:34:49,847 --> 01:34:50,946
(A total of 8 tasting sessions)

2695
01:34:50,947 --> 01:34:53,117
(That is how...)

2696
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:56,456
I'm getting goosebumps.

2697
01:34:56,457 --> 01:34:58,357
(the loach soup pasta meal kit came to life.)

2698
01:34:58,797 --> 01:34:59,856
(All profits will be donated.)

2699
01:34:59,857 --> 01:35:00,956
(Search "loach soup pasta meal kit" on the search engine.)

2700
01:35:00,957 --> 01:35:02,497
So they were actually sold!

2701
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:05,037
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- Bravo!

2702
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:06,697
That's amazing!

2703
01:35:07,197 --> 01:35:09,006
I want to try that.

2704
01:35:09,007 --> 01:35:10,066
(I want to try the meal kit as well.)

2705
01:35:10,067 --> 01:35:12,036
(Another weapon the fool the members)

2706
01:35:12,037 --> 01:35:13,636
- Another weapon?
- Hello, Manager.

2707
01:35:13,637 --> 01:35:15,376
Before the shoot next week,

2708
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:17,816
- we want the DAY6 members...
- No way.

2709
01:35:17,817 --> 01:35:21,146
to be exposed to the loach soup pasta meal kit.

2710
01:35:21,147 --> 01:35:22,347
Could that be possible?

2711
01:35:22,517 --> 01:35:24,657
- Look at that!
- Look at that!

2712
01:35:24,757 --> 01:35:27,387
- Right!
- There it is.

2713
01:35:27,617 --> 01:35:29,126
If this didn't happen...

2714
01:35:29,127 --> 01:35:30,656
I wouldn't have picked number one if this didn't happen.

2715
01:35:30,657 --> 01:35:31,757
Right.

2716
01:35:32,157 --> 01:35:34,796
Based on our schedule,

2717
01:35:34,797 --> 01:35:37,266
I think we can fit it in...

2718
01:35:37,267 --> 01:35:38,867
the catering of our Ho Chi Minh tour.

2719
01:35:39,897 --> 01:35:41,436
(Footage sent from the DAY6 manager)

2720
01:35:41,437 --> 01:35:43,566
Right. Why was that there all of a sudden?

2721
01:35:43,567 --> 01:35:44,737
There it is.

2722
01:35:44,977 --> 01:35:46,937
- What is that?
- What?

2723
01:35:47,607 --> 01:35:49,307
- What is it?
- Pasta.

2724
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,547
- Loach soup pasta?
- That's me.

2725
01:35:51,917 --> 01:35:53,546
When was this filmed?

2726
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:54,787
- Gosh!
- You didn't realize it, did you?

2727
01:35:55,117 --> 01:35:57,046
- You didn't realize it, did you?
- I had no idea.

2728
01:35:57,047 --> 01:35:58,087
I really had no idea.

2729
01:35:58,487 --> 01:36:00,516
(Young K appears.)

2730
01:36:00,517 --> 01:36:01,726
It's a loach soup pasta.

2731
01:36:01,727 --> 01:36:03,026
Gosh, that's amazing.

2732
01:36:03,027 --> 01:36:04,496
- She told you about it too.
- Right.

2733
01:36:04,497 --> 01:36:05,556
(Young K also spots the loach soup pasta.)

2734
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:06,596
(Thank you, Manager!)

2735
01:36:06,597 --> 01:36:09,027
She looks really awkward with it as well.

2736
01:36:10,927 --> 01:36:12,397
- As it was a fake item.
- Right.

2737
01:36:12,897 --> 01:36:15,866
(The art, prop, and set team all make a move.)

2738
01:36:15,867 --> 01:36:17,736
- The setting begins now.
- Gosh!

2739
01:36:17,737 --> 01:36:19,336
The fish tank wasn't there?

2740
01:36:19,337 --> 01:36:20,406
(A giant fish tank with the vibes of the 90s)

2741
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:23,046
- The vibes were created all over?
- Are you serious?

2742
01:36:23,047 --> 01:36:24,306
(Even the rocks were placed!)

2743
01:36:24,307 --> 01:36:25,776
(Comfy flower-patterned cushions for the elders)

2744
01:36:25,777 --> 01:36:27,247
It's been a while for that.

2745
01:36:27,717 --> 01:36:30,047
- That's amazing.
- Old movie posters as well.

2746
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:32,057
So it was originally a pasta restaurant?

2747
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:33,686
It suited the place well.

2748
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:35,027
It was perfect.

2749
01:36:35,487 --> 01:36:37,286
(The original tableware)

2750
01:36:37,287 --> 01:36:38,656
- That's amazing.
- Even the tableware was changed?

2751
01:36:38,657 --> 01:36:40,996
- The tableware.
- Seok Jin was right.

2752
01:36:40,997 --> 01:36:43,226
That felt awkward to me.

2753
01:36:43,227 --> 01:36:46,197
(Transformed into a retro restaurant with unique vibes)

2754
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:47,696
Seok Jin was right.

2755
01:36:47,697 --> 01:36:50,237
- It was a forced concept.
- Right.

2756
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:53,606
(Just like that,)

2757
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:56,576
(the regular restaurant...)

2758
01:36:56,577 --> 01:36:57,816
Gosh!

2759
01:36:57,817 --> 01:36:59,616
- It was like a book cafe.
- It completely changed.

2760
01:36:59,617 --> 01:37:00,646
- Right.
- The concept of the place...

2761
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:01,687
was transformed.

2762
01:37:01,987 --> 01:37:03,086
A retro concept.

2763
01:37:03,087 --> 01:37:04,587
- So that was how it looked like?
- It was like this.

2764
01:37:04,687 --> 01:37:06,717
It looks much better now.

2765
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:08,026
- Right.
- Right.

2766
01:37:08,027 --> 01:37:09,056
Just like this.

2767
01:37:09,057 --> 01:37:11,657
(Start of business)

2768
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:14,996
(Customers of all ages and genders are mesmerized!)

2769
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:17,266
- There are many elders.
- There are many customers.

2770
01:37:17,267 --> 01:37:18,866
Did a lot of customers visit?

2771
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:19,867
(Customers of all ages and genders are mesmerized!)

2772
01:37:19,868 --> 01:37:21,036
In Paju's Heyri Village,

2773
01:37:21,037 --> 01:37:23,406
there's a pasta restaurant that was around for nine years.

2774
01:37:23,407 --> 01:37:24,776
With the props of the past,

2775
01:37:24,777 --> 01:37:26,576
you will get mesmerized by the retro vibes.

2776
01:37:26,577 --> 01:37:28,876
I enjoyed each part of it.

2777
01:37:28,877 --> 01:37:30,246
I think I was always like that.

2778
01:37:30,247 --> 01:37:32,746
I always met my customers with a smile.

2779
01:37:32,747 --> 01:37:36,386
I will always welcome everyone that comes with a smile.

2780
01:37:36,387 --> 01:37:37,587
(I will always welcome everyone that comes with a smile.)

2781
01:37:37,887 --> 01:37:39,316
Sixth Sense,

2782
01:37:39,317 --> 01:37:41,226
this dish is fake.

2783
01:37:41,227 --> 01:37:43,126
(Reply 1988, fake)

2784
01:37:43,127 --> 01:37:44,327
Ma'am!

2785
01:37:45,297 --> 01:37:46,997
- We wish you great success!
- Thank you!

2786
01:37:47,057 --> 01:37:48,266
Earlier...

2787
01:37:48,267 --> 01:37:50,826
- "Best" Won, - "Help" Pil!

2788
01:37:50,827 --> 01:37:51,897
"Help" Pil.

2789
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:53,237
Nice one!

2790
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:54,666
Nice!

2791
01:37:54,667 --> 01:37:56,566
It's been a while to get it right.

2792
01:37:56,567 --> 01:37:57,936
The coffee truck will be sent to the one that gets picked.

2793
01:37:57,937 --> 01:37:59,137
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2794
01:37:59,377 --> 01:38:00,936
If I get picked,

2795
01:38:00,937 --> 01:38:02,506
- I will give it to DAY6.
- Thank you!

2796
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:03,507
Thank you.

2797
01:38:03,508 --> 01:38:04,616
Thank you. I will make sure to enjoy it.

2798
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:06,747
- Do you not know how to refuse?
- It's fine.

2799
01:38:06,877 --> 01:38:08,687
Thank you. I will go with the flow.

2800
01:38:09,247 --> 01:38:11,086
- All right. Who will make the draw?
- Wonpil got it right.

2801
01:38:11,087 --> 01:38:12,487
- Right. Wonpil should do it.
- Okay.

2802
01:38:13,757 --> 01:38:15,227
Please. Be anyone.

2803
01:38:15,857 --> 01:38:17,826
- He'll pick his name right away.
- No.

2804
01:38:17,827 --> 01:38:18,896
Wonpil!

2805
01:38:18,897 --> 01:38:20,726
(Who will be the lucky one to get the coffee truck?)

2806
01:38:20,727 --> 01:38:21,927
He's the Hand of Gold.

2807
01:38:22,197 --> 01:38:23,197
- Really?
- Yes.

2808
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:24,496
- Does he always make good draws?
- I don't think it's me.

2809
01:38:24,497 --> 01:38:26,737
- It's me!
- Who is it?

2810
01:38:27,197 --> 01:38:29,566
(It's me!)

2811
01:38:29,567 --> 01:38:30,937
It's Wonpil!

2812
01:38:31,277 --> 01:38:32,577
He picked his own name!

2813
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:34,007
That's amazing.

2814
01:38:35,007 --> 01:38:36,106
Are you serious?

2815
01:38:36,107 --> 01:38:37,706
- "Best" Won, "Help" Pil.
- See?

2816
01:38:37,707 --> 01:38:38,846
- Gosh.
- He's amazing.

2817
01:38:38,847 --> 01:38:40,246
- You're right.
- You're right.

2818
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:41,446
- He's the Hand of Gold.
- He really has something.

2819
01:38:41,447 --> 01:38:42,916
Don't lie!

2820
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,046
(He's truly the Hand of Gold.)

2821
01:38:44,047 --> 01:38:46,456
We will send it to DAY6 under our name.

2822
01:38:46,457 --> 01:38:48,286
Nice!

2823
01:38:48,287 --> 01:38:49,756
Gosh, they have everything.

2824
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,127
(The coffee truck was successfully delivered.)

2825
01:38:52,187 --> 01:38:54,086
(Eighth City Tour)

2826
01:38:54,087 --> 01:38:56,827
(Gangneung)

2827
01:38:57,657 --> 01:38:59,966
(A tourist spot with so many great things)

2828
01:38:59,967 --> 01:39:03,536
(Who is today's guest who will join them on the tour?)

2829
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:05,006
(Comedian Heo Kyeong Hwan on his second appearance)

2830
01:39:05,007 --> 01:39:07,866
(Actress Ryu Hye Young)

2831
01:39:07,867 --> 01:39:10,606
(Unbelievable places...)

2832
01:39:10,607 --> 01:39:12,846
(with tastes that bring rounds of applause?)

2833
01:39:12,847 --> 01:39:14,576
(If it tastes good,)

2834
01:39:14,577 --> 01:39:16,146
(it will put me in a tough spot.)

2835
01:39:16,147 --> 01:39:17,576
(This place is fake.)

2836
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:20,287
(Hye Young is a deduction machine!)

2837
01:39:20,547 --> 01:39:23,016
(Sir, what is your MBTI?)

2838
01:39:23,017 --> 01:39:24,086
(INTP!)

2839
01:39:24,087 --> 01:39:27,657
(Has a "sharp" guest finally appeared?)

2840
01:39:27,957 --> 01:39:30,556
(Hye Young's deduction won't stop.)

2841
01:39:30,557 --> 01:39:32,426
(That's sharp.)

2842
01:39:32,427 --> 01:39:34,527
(That's sharp!)

2843
01:39:34,767 --> 01:39:36,266
(What about Kyeong Hwan's deduction skills?)

2844
01:39:36,267 --> 01:39:37,336
(It's easy!)

2845
01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:39,606
(After hearing from his experienced seniors...)

2846
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:42,376
(I'll say something else when that happens.)

2847
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:43,537
(Laughing)

2848
01:39:44,537 --> 01:39:47,307
(Figuring out the fake is also hard for someone with experience.)

2849
01:39:47,777 --> 01:39:49,747
Gosh, I'm doomed today.

2850
01:39:50,347 --> 01:39:54,117
(How will their search for the fake in Gangneung end?)
