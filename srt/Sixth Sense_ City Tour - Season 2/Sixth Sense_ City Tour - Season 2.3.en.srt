1
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,218
It's beautiful.

2
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,558
Autumn is really here.

3
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,628
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:39,128
There's so much green.

5
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:41,298
It really feels like autumn today.

6
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,938
The maximum temperature will be 21°C.

7
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:46,367
This is great. It's finally autumn.

8
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:47,838
(The cool autumn breeze is blowing. Where is this place?)

9
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:49,837
Aren't we at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies?

10
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:50,838
That's right.

11
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:52,478
I haven't been here in a while.

12
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:55,377
(The third travel destination on Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,517
(The university town in Gangbuk)

14
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,717
(Hankuk University of Foreign Studies)

15
00:01:00,718 --> 00:01:02,657
(Korea University)

16
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:04,518
(Kyung Hee University)

17
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:06,327
(The university town in Gangbuk is formed...)

18
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:07,787
(by many other universities.)

19
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,327
(Youth...)

20
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:11,357
(and romance)

21
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:14,068
(Where youth thrives)

22
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:17,438
(Is there a hidden fake in the university town in Gangbuk?)

23
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:20,208
What's this?

24
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:23,478
(You can't believe your own eyes.)

25
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:27,148
(The one and only fake that's hidden at this place)

26
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:31,278
(Don't be deceived by anything.)

27
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:33,388
(Gosh, my heart is racing.)

28
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:36,958
(What is today's fake hidden in the university town in Gangbuk?)

29
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:38,318
Hey, Jae Seok.

30
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:39,927
Are they shooting him first?

31
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,228
Jae Seok.

32
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:42,798
Hurry over here.

33
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,458
Why did the shoot start so early?

34
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,328
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:48,838
We were supposed to be here at 9am.

36
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:52,208
- Does he know how to teleport?
- You were with us a moment ago.

37
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,607
(In the basement parking lot 10 minutes ago)

38
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:54,767
Hello.

39
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:56,408
- Hello.
- Yes.

40
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,307
Do you use teleportation?

41
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:00,408
Come quickly.

42
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,118
Did you fly over here?

43
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,288
It's so obvious that anyone can tell.

44
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,548
(Tell what?)

45
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,558
You have nothing to do with this school.

46
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,988
- This is so lovely.
- I can totally tell.

47
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,227
It's really nice. There are university students.

48
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:17,328
Gosh, look at that.

49
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,397
There are new apartment buildings.

50
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,368
Whenever Seok Jin comes to a place, he looks around...

51
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:24,467
- for current real estate prices.
- Those apartments didn't exist.

52
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,737
- No, they didn't.
- Gosh, look at them.

53
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:29,137
Around Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,

54
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:30,777
our friends used to live here.

55
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,807
- Really?
- One of them was Yong Man.

56
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,377
- Yes, that's why...
- Kyung Min lived...

57
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:35,948
near Kyung Hee University.

58
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,277
I came here very often.

59
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:39,347
We often met in front of Kyung Hee University.

60
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:40,387
We played billiards there.

61
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:41,687
We played billiards and drank coffee.

62
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:43,487
- We had coffee.
- We didn't drink a drop of alcohol.

63
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:46,628
(Back then when they were happy without any alcohol)

64
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,027
Mimi, is this your first time here?

65
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:49,597
Most of the places we visit are unfamiliar to me.

66
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:50,857
Really? By the way,

67
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,227
standing like this, we look like KOYOTE.

68
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:53,298
(Big Nose KOYOTE)

69
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,697
(A veteran group, Big Nose KOYOTE)

70
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:56,767
(She's just happy-go-lucky.)

71
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,097
- Are you Jong Min?
- What?

72
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:00,808
There are only three of us. Why aren't you saying anything?

73
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:02,608
I was about to say it.

74
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:04,737
- Where's Kyung Pyo?
- About Kyung Pyo...

75
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:07,447
- We were supposed to meet at 9am, - Right.

76
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,377
but his manager misunderstood.

77
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:11,577
Kyung Pyo will join us around 9:30am.

78
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:12,987
At Hankuk University of Foreign Studies...

79
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:14,717
- It opens at a certain hour.
- There are opening hours.

80
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:16,617
It can't be helped. We must shoot quickly.

81
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,887
I don't know if I can say this,

82
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,628
but his manager is the one who's stressed out the most.

83
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:23,257
- He's thinking, - He must be very anxious.

84
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,827
- "Important seniors are waiting." - His hands must be sweating.

85
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,667
It can happen.

86
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,767
Anyone can make mistakes.

87
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,407
But let's make one thing clear.

88
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,737
The manager could be...

89
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:36,008
covering up Kyung Pyo's flaw.

90
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,277
It's possible.

91
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:39,447
- He's taking the blame?
- It's possible.

92
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:40,777
Of course.

93
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,517
Kyung Pyo slept in.

94
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:44,178
His manager tried to cover it up by saying,

95
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,187
"I thought that it was 9:30am instead."

96
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,818
To be honest, I've done it before.

97
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:50,618
"Could you cover it up for me?"

98
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:51,758
(He was talking about his experience.)

99
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,027
He was talking about his experience.

100
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:55,057
Seok Jin is the worst.

101
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,127
The alarm didn't go off...

102
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,668
- Is that what you've been doing?
- I didn't hear the alarm.

103
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:01,067
- Sometimes in life, - It happened ten years ago.

104
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,597
it could happen.

105
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:03,598
- Of course.
- It could happen.

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,067
Either way, we have to go...

107
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,907
- and meet our guests.
- I see.

108
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:08,837
That's where Kyung Pyo will join us.

109
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:09,838
Will he meet us there?

110
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:10,838
He'll be one of the guests.

111
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,708
Yes, he'll be like a guest today.

112
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:15,247
- He's our guest.
- Yes.

113
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:17,218
- Here is the theme for today.
- What is it?

114
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,017
You will visit three popular spots...

115
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:21,648
- in the university town in Gangbuk.
- Really?

116
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,958
"The university town in Gangbuk is strange?"

117
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:30,427
"Strange Room, Strange Space, Strange House?"

118
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,098
(1. Strange Room, 2. Strange Space, 3. Strange House)

119
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,567
Centered around the university town in Gangbuk,

120
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,097
there are Strange Room, Space, and House.

121
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:38,498
They're capturing the attention of the university students.

122
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:41,637
(For university students who are tired from studying)

123
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:44,078
(There's a strange room.)

124
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,507
(A karaoke room?)

125
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:46,807
(A comic book store?)

126
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,107
(A sauna?)

127
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:51,048
(What is the Strange Room where university students go to?)

128
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:53,448
(A strange space near the university town?)

129
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:55,458
(One step in a set of stairs?)

130
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,318
(Space in a studio?)

131
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:59,628
(Or blank space in the answer?)

132
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:03,257
(What is the Strange Space in the university town in Gangbuk?)

133
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:05,258
(Hidden in the university town)

134
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:09,538
(Targeting the MZers' taste)

135
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:13,368
(There's a strange house?)

136
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:17,937
(What is the fake hidden in the university town?)

137
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,977
It's a series of strange things.

138
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:21,547
We've always been going...

139
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:24,177
- to strange places.
- They were very strange.

140
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,178
Right.

141
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,347
- Shall we get going?
- Yes, let's get moving.

142
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,418
Let's go.

143
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,417
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

144
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,157
How is your life at the university?

145
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,357
It's difficult.

146
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:34,628
Is it difficult?

147
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,097
(Moaning sadly)

148
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:37,657
Are you eating a fish cake bar for breakfast?

149
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:38,897
- Yes.
- A fish cake bar?

150
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,327
- You didn't have breakfast.
- Eat it slowly.

151
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:42,598
- Gosh, hello.
- Hello.

152
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,638
- Do you know Mimi?
- Do you know her well?

153
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,567
- No.
- You've never met, right?

154
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:48,438
- It's our first time meeting.
- You seemed so friendly.

155
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,307
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

156
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,177
As they're in foreign studies, everyone looks so hip.

157
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,407
This is Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

158
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:57,277
Did you know? This is where President Obama...

159
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:59,187
gave a speech here.

160
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:00,618
- Really?
- Of course.

161
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:04,417
(The first US President to give a speech at the university in Korea)

162
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,288
(Barack Obama, the 44th president of the US)

163
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:11,358
Let's go together. Thank you very much.

164
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:15,128
You must have good grades to be admitted to this university.

165
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,498
I can't even dream of coming here.

166
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:19,337
I got to come here for a shoot.

167
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,538
- Seriously...
- There is...

168
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:24,477
- the intersection.
- Are there many hot places here?

169
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,607
Seok Jin, you pretend...

170
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:28,078
- like you know this place.
- "The intersection."

171
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,277
- Of course, it's an intersection.
- Seok Jin,

172
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,648
don't say anything if you don't know anything.

173
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:32,987
The intersection.

174
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:34,918
(It's obviously an intersection.)

175
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:37,287
This place has changed so much.

176
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,487
How did it change? I can't tell.

177
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:43,527
In the past, most of the buildings were low like this.

178
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,867
(The university town was mostly made up of low-rise buildings.)

179
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,868
(Even the subway station was small.)

180
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:52,168
(Now, the subway station became modern-looking.)

181
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,767
Now, it's completely...

182
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:58,738
(The old look disappeared as high-rise apartments were built.)

183
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,348
I wonder who the guests are today.

184
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:05,248
(A woman with a beautiful silhouette)

185
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:09,618
(And a man with a familiar-looking mustache)

186
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:10,988
Gosh.

187
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,727
While everyone is either going to work or school,

188
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:14,827
we're sitting here out in the open.

189
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:15,897
(Laughing)

190
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,198
"Please take a look at us."

191
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:18,967
I know.

192
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:19,968
(Today's guests)

193
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,538
(Singer MIYEON and Actor Lee Dong Hwi)

194
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,397
(His Ryu Dong Ryong role led him to stardom.)

195
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:26,638
(Kyung Pyo appeared briefly.)

196
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:28,977
(Why would you do your best?)

197
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,538
(He became a blockbuster actor in "Extreme Job.")

198
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:35,818
(A master of acting, Actor Lee Dong Hwi)

199
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,618
(Girl group i-dle)

200
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:42,357
(From the beautiful main vocalist)

201
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,557
("MIYEON Makes a Comeback with 'Say My Name'")

202
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:44,988
("MIYEON of i-dle Officially Starts as a Solo Artist")

203
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,257
(She returns with pop ballad music, perfect for the autumn weather.)

204
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:52,397
(Beautiful Main Vocalist, MIYEON)

205
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,268
The last time I saw you was...

206
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,597
at the Blue Dragon Series Awards.

207
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:58,768
It was last year.

208
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,578
And we meet again today.

209
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,107
I don't think you remember.

210
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,278
(You caught me.)

211
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,947
- Whenever I perform, - Right.

212
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,317
I get very nervous.

213
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:14,788
Both Seok Jin and I love ballad songs.

214
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:17,258
(Nodding)

215
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,188
What?

216
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:24,057
Most people would respond...

217
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,058
by saying yes.

218
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:28,228
I guess you don't think about Seok Jin at all.

219
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:30,237
It's so obvious.

220
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,637
(No interest)

221
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,068
I like things like this.

222
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:34,807
What do you usually look at?

223
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:38,238
(They're coming.)

224
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,448
(Extremely excited)

225
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:42,978
(Surprised)

226
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:44,678
Hey.

227
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:46,047
- It's Dong Hwi.
- Hello.

228
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,317
- What?
- Lee Dong Hwi.

229
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,517
- Hello.
- Lee Dong Hwi.

230
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:49,657
(Hello)

231
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:50,658
(Happy to see them)

232
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:51,958
- It's MIYEON.
- MIYEON.

233
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,687
(I'm here too.)

234
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,558
- With Dong Hwi...
- Hello.

235
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,697
- Hello.
- Hello.

236
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:01,767
- MIYEON.
- Hello, it's been a while.

237
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,197
Dong Hwi, have you been well?

238
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:04,567
- Hello.
- Yes, I've been well.

239
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:06,838
- Have you been well?
- Yes, how about you?

240
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,568
Gosh, your bottom and top.

241
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,438
They aren't suitable for the season.

242
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,108
- Isn't it "top and bottom?" - Really?

243
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:14,677
(Picking up a fight as soon as they meet)

244
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,147
- "Bottom and top." - They're the same.

245
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,478
Dong Hwi thinks of Seok Sam as...

246
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,218
We're friends.

247
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:22,148
Wait, let's sit somewhere.

248
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:24,257
Why don't we order?

249
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:25,957
Their cakes are amazing.

250
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,188
- Really?
- Yes.

251
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,628
(A cup of coffee that's rich with acidity)

252
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:35,128
(Freshly baked bread that MZers love)

253
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:38,897
The popular drink here is called the apple milk tea.

254
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:39,908
(They also ordered apple milk tea.)

255
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:42,577
Dong Hwi, this is autumn. Aren't you hot in that?

256
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,577
He's fashionable. His top and bottom are different.

257
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:45,977
- It's very hot, - He's wearing shorts.

258
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,408
but my legs are cold.

259
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,178
- So...
- I'm regretting it a lot.

260
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:52,247
Take a look at this.

261
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:53,787
Today's theme is...

262
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,287
- the strange university town.
- "Strange university town?"

263
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,987
We're going to strange places.

264
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,028
The first one is Strange Room.

265
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:00,957
- Strange Room?
- Strange Room.

266
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,958
(Coughing)

267
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,768
- It's my first time meeting Mimi.
- Okay.

268
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,197
- You meet her for the first time?
- Yes.

269
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:08,367
- We've never met before.
- Right.

270
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:09,967
- And?
- It's very fascinating.

271
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,997
It's similar to when I met Seok Jin for the first time.

272
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:13,367
- How so?
- What?

273
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,568
- How so?
- What?

274
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,307
- What do you mean exactly?
- This is...

275
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:17,707
- Don't be upset.
- Dong Hwi.

276
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,977
Do you know what he said when we first met?

277
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,548
He almost asked for my autograph.

278
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:21,707
- Really?
- He said that he was my fan.

279
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,677
- He didn't get your autograph.
- No.

280
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:25,477
- He didn't get your autograph.
- Shouldn't he have gotten it?

281
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:27,148
He wanted to save face as a celebrity.

282
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:28,717
He looked at me...

283
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:31,057
(Is that really true?)

284
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,757
He looked at me like a Hollywood star.

285
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,858
I really did.

286
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:38,658
When I saw him for the first time, his nose was huge.

287
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,397
(His nose is huge.)

288
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:42,398
(He's as good as a Hollywood star for his nose.)

289
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,068
I thought that it was a fake nose attached to his glasses.

290
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,968
- Many people say that.
- I looked at it very carefully.

291
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:50,377
MIYEON and Mimi, don't you know each other well?

292
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,077
- Kyung Pyo is here.
- There he is.

293
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,078
(I'm here.)

294
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,307
Live like Ko Kyung Pyo.

295
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,217
Live like Ko Kyung Pyo.

296
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:59,888
- Kyung Pyo.
- Hello.

297
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,847
- Come this way.
- I really hate...

298
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,057
being late.

299
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,587
- We know.
- It's okay. Anyone can sleep in.

300
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:05,887
Anyone can sleep in. It's okay.

301
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,027
- Is this how you corner me?
- By the way...

302
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:09,358
- It's okay. It can happen.
- For us...

303
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,327
- For us...
- Right.

304
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:12,897
It's been a while, MIYEON.

305
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,068
- Hello.
- Goodness.

306
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,197
Are you on a blind date?

307
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,367
(Are you on a blind date?)

308
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,537
- On "The Backpacker Chef..." - We were on a variety show...

309
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,607
- before.
- Right.

310
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,438
- Really?
- We met briefly.

311
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:24,838
(When he heard that MIYEON was here)

312
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,308
What's going on?

313
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:29,218
Oh, MIYEON!

314
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:32,217
- Kyung Pyo, order some beverages.
- Order some drinks.

315
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,487
- Take this and make the order.
- Seok Jin.

316
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:35,647
Could you also pay?

317
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:36,757
Seok Jin, please pay for it.

318
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:37,788
I will pay.

319
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,158
- Go with him.
- When he brings the drinks...

320
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,658
Seok Jin is wearing all white today.

321
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,797
- He's wearing all white.
- Seok Jin likes white cotton pants.

322
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:45,058
- White cotton pants?
- That's right.

323
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,227
Everyone here is so stylish.

324
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,767
Seok Jin? As you can see, he's not.

325
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,697
- Doesn't he dress very hip?
- What is it?

326
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:51,737
- What?
- Seok Jin.

327
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:52,738
He likes things that are hip.

328
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,068
- Youthful and hip.
- Right.

329
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:55,307
He likes those things.

330
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,308
- That's the standard...
- That's his ideal style.

331
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,037
of what's considered hip.

332
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,577
He could eat poop if it's considered young.

333
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:02,308
(He could eat poop if it's considered young.)

334
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:03,818
He could eat poop if it's considered young.

335
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:07,887
What I mean is...

336
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,118
He's that obsessed.

337
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:11,218
That's how everything about him is...

338
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,327
- centered around youth.
- Kyung Pyo.

339
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:14,387
You got here late, so don't laugh.

340
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:15,727
(You got here late, so don't laugh.)

341
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:18,158
- Why are you being harsh with him?
- Seok Jin.

342
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,627
- Seriously.
- You got here late, so don't laugh.

343
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,327
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

344
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:22,998
So this is apple milk tea.

345
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:24,967
It's a popular drink here.

346
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,368
(The most popular drink in the university town, apple milk tea)

347
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,938
(Drinking)

348
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,108
- Isn't it sweet?
- It's delicious.

349
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:31,938
It's refreshing.

350
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:33,308
- Isn't it sweet?
- It's delicious.

351
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,148
- Gosh, it's really...
- It's refreshing.

352
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:37,147
- It's delicious.
- It must be.

353
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,948
MIYEON and Mimi, do you know each other?

354
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:40,787
- We met on "Running Man." - That's right.

355
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:42,857
- So you don't know each other well?
- No.

356
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:44,917
- I've seen you a lot on TV.
- Right.

357
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,357
- Just on TV.
- You said that...

358
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:47,527
you didn't want to hear me talk.

359
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:48,758
Is that the day you were there?

360
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:49,827
- Right.
- Right.

361
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,127
When Seok Jin said something,

362
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,727
MIYEON said that she didn't want to hear him.

363
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:53,797
(Laughing)

364
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,527
"I don't want to hear you."

365
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:56,998
"I don't want to hear you."

366
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,637
You happen to be sitting next to each other.

367
00:12:58,638 --> 00:12:59,907
(Again today)

368
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:01,508
- "I don't want to hear you." - "I don't want to hear you."

369
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:03,238
- "I don't want to hear you." - "I don't want to hear you."

370
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,208
(Shaking his head)

371
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:06,477
We'll reserve that for today.

372
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:08,147
(Happy)

373
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:10,147
MIYEON's solo album is coming out soon.

374
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,647
- Really?
- That's right.

375
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:12,717
What's the song title?

376
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:13,817
"Say My Name."

377
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:14,987
- "Say My Name?" - Yes.

378
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:16,218
I asked her a moment ago.

379
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:19,288
It's a ballad song that she's good at.

380
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,727
- This is my second album.
- You know that, right?

381
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,397
She's the main vocalist of i-dle.

382
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:24,557
Of course I know.

383
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:25,757
MIYEON is the main vocalist.

384
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:27,898
- She doesn't look like it, right?
- We know that.

385
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,398
- She doesn't look like it, right?
- We know that.

386
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:32,437
I apologize to all main vocalists in the country.

387
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,967
(Detected his downfall)

388
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,567
- What are you talking about?
- All main vocalists in the country?

389
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,408
(He takes back what he said in 3 seconds.)

390
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:38,507
What are you saying?

391
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:39,907
I didn't have an ulterior motive.

392
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:41,107
They don't look like her?

393
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:43,218
- Never mind.
- He suddenly sensed...

394
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:45,218
(I don't want to hear you!)

395
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:47,747
In the car on your way here, your manager...

396
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,087
I found out that I was late...

397
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,917
- when I got here.
- Really?

398
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,827
My manager didn't tell me until we got here.

399
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:54,157
- He didn't tell you?
- He stayed quiet.

400
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:55,557
- He didn't want to worry you.
- Right.

401
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,897
Your manager was being thoughtful.

402
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,197
He was already in a rush. He didn't want...

403
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,098
- to make you feel rushed as well.
- Right.

404
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,467
He didn't want to be criticized...

405
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:03,668
on his way here.

406
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,938
No, that's not true.

407
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:08,338
- That was probably the case.
- I can understand.

408
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:09,738
His manager was wise.

409
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:11,938
He didn't want to make it uncomfortable...

410
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:13,778
on their way here in the car.

411
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,747
- Don't you think?
- He's smart.

412
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:16,817
He's smart.

413
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,717
- He was thinking like a parent.
- Right.

414
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:21,217
When your parents are sick,

415
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,687
- they don't tell you about it.
- That's true.

416
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:24,718
This could be helpful to other managers.

417
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:27,488
But it shouldn't become a trend.

418
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:28,788
If it becomes...

419
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,658
- a trend...
- Right, it shouldn't be.

420
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,558
You're right.

421
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:34,897
- Shall we go to the first spot?
- Yes.

422
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:36,067
Let's go.

423
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:38,668
(They move to the first popular place.)

424
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:40,608
So...

425
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,507
this building has been here for a long time.

426
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,577
- Right.
- You're right.

427
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,308
It's from the 80s or the 90s.

428
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:46,907
It's old.

429
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,508
- Can't you tell from the outside?
- Yes.

430
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:52,947
(They follow the path of memories towards the Strange Room.)

431
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:54,747
- It looks old-fashioned inside.
- Right.

432
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:56,157
- You know what?
- What?

433
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:57,487
It doesn't apply to every name,

434
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,988
but when you hear someone's name,

435
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,227
- you can guess when they were born.
- Right.

436
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:03,827
- Based on their name?
- My friends, for example.

437
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,227
Among my peers,

438
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:06,597
Kyung Sook is a common name for women.

439
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:07,797
- Right.
- You're right.

440
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:09,337
- Is your name Kyung Sook?
- Or Kyung Mi.

441
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:10,338
What?

442
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,297
- Is your name Kyung Sook?
- No.

443
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:13,307
My name is Seok Jin.

444
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:14,767
A common female name...

445
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:17,007
- among his peers.
- Among my peers.

446
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,977
Ji Kyung Sook doesn't sound right, does it?

447
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:20,048
Kyung Mi.

448
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,577
All of a sudden, she asked Seok Jin,

449
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,448
"Is your name Kyung Sook?"

450
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:26,148
I've never heard such a question.

451
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,218
I was really surprised.

452
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:30,487
I thought that Seok Jin was his alias.

453
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,857
(I thought that Seok Jin was his alias.)

454
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,557
Wait, where are we going first?

455
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,057
It's called Strange Room.

456
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,528
- Strange Room?
- Yes.

457
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:37,957
Is it something like Escape Room Game?

458
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,527
- That's exactly what I thought.
- It must be around here.

459
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:40,698
- Where is it?
- Where?

460
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,227
An internet cafe?

461
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:43,437
- An internet cafe?
- What?

462
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:44,737
- That sounds fun.
- I haven't been there...

463
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:45,867
in such a long time.

464
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,867
There's a lot of good food at internet cafes.

465
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:50,178
If it's fake, could it be something that they made?

466
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:52,177
The internet cafe already existed, but the system...

467
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:53,747
They just changed the system.

468
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:54,848
(The system could be fake while the internet cafe is real.)

469
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:56,618
By the way,

470
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:58,448
you can tell from the vibe.

471
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,548
It looks like an internet cafe that opened recently.

472
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:02,348
Is there a strange room inside?

473
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:05,518
- There's nothing strange about it.
- What's strange about it?

474
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,527
Gosh, the internet cafe is huge.

475
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:08,957
(Gosh, the internet cafe is huge.)

476
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,658
- It's really nice.
- It's nice.

477
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:11,958
It's very...

478
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:13,898
It's pleasant.

479
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,737
The air feels pleasant as soon as you come inside.

480
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,498
(A pleasant environment)

481
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:21,567
(It looks like an ordinary internet cafe.)

482
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:24,107
(What does the Strange Room mean?)

483
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,478
These days, internet cafes are...

484
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,847
almost as nice as fancy restaurants.

485
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,677
- Haha told me recently.
- What?

486
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:32,717
That food at internet cafes is amazing.

487
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,017
- I agree with that.
- Yes.

488
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,088
Nowadays, there's no cigarette smell at internet cafes.

489
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:37,618
- Of course not.
- Smoking is prohibited.

490
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,187
Was that your last time at the internet cafe?

491
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,388
Yes, I haven't been back for ten or more years.

492
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:45,858
(Internet cafes way back in the day when tigers used to smoke)

493
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:49,027
A long time ago, Seok Jin practically lived at internet cafes.

494
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,567
I spent a lot of time here...

495
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:51,667
when I didn't have work.

496
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:52,767
- When we played...
- Of course.

497
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:53,908
Crazyracing KartRider.

498
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:56,677
I was at the black glove level.

499
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,677
From the lack of your response, I can tell that you don't know.

500
00:16:58,678 --> 00:16:59,848
The black glove...

501
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:01,207
Isn't that an advanced level?

502
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,177
Yes, the black glove was above the rainbow glove.

503
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,547
While looking shabby himself,

504
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,287
he dressed his character so well.

505
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:08,617
(He dressed his character so well in the game.)

506
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,118
He bought outfits for the character.

507
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:11,458
- Of course.
- Yes.

508
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,357
- I dressed it well.
- He did.

509
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,927
- I bought a nice car too.
- Meanwhile, he looked shabby.

510
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:15,928
(He finds it funny.)

511
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:16,998
I did that back then.

512
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,128
Please come this way and sit down.

513
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:20,798
Take a seat, everyone.

514
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:23,338
I haven't been to an internet cafe in years.

515
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,307
There's nothing strange about it.

516
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,107
- I know. It's not strange.
- Sit down.

517
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,168
Have a seat, MIYEON.

518
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:30,408
I mean, Mimi.

519
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:31,707
My legal name is Mi Hyun.

520
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,907
(Mi Hyun is here, not MIYEON.)

521
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:33,948
I switch back and forth.

522
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,948
We have Mi Hyun and MIYEON with us.

523
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:38,818
But there's nothing strange about this place.

524
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,788
Where's the manager?

525
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,218
Hello.

526
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,517
(The manager of the Strange Room appears.)

527
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:45,957
- Hello.
- Hello.

528
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,487
- Hello.
- Hello.

529
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:49,188
(Why is this internet cafe called Strange Room?)

530
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:50,897
We came here as Strange Room,

531
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:52,158
but it's just an internet cafe.

532
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,028
- What's strange about it?
- I can't tell what's strange.

533
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:58,967
We have something different on the menu compared to others.

534
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,367
- What?
- Something different?

535
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,168
(A different menu compared to ordinary internet cafes?)

536
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:04,178
Let me introduce it to you.

537
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:06,747
(He approaches the curtain on the side.)

538
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:07,808
This must be it.

539
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:11,077
(Something behind the curtain is finally revealed.)

540
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:13,318
(What's this?)

541
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,388
No, this is ridiculous.

542
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:17,618
What's this?

543
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:19,318
I mean...

544
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,428
It's a lie.

545
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:23,997
This?

546
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,297
Why would you go this far?

547
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:26,668
(What is it that makes them deny what they're seeing?)

548
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:31,038
(An electronic rotisserie?)

549
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,808
(Once you pass the ordinary seats at the internet cafe,)

550
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:39,107
(An electronic rotisserie on one of the walls)

551
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:42,917
There are many internet cafes that sell a variety of food.

552
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,977
Before opening this cafe,

553
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:46,918
the CEO held a contest to decide the menu.

554
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:50,317
(Traditional whole chicken and pork belly grilled...)

555
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:52,818
(with an electric roasting machine)

556
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:56,188
We have customers who come here just to eat.

557
00:18:56,228 --> 00:19:00,468
Some of them ask for takeout.

558
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:04,137
As we sell a limited amount,

559
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,198
we're usually sold out before closing.

560
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,367
(The talk of the town on social media)

561
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:09,877
(It will be impossible to focus at the internet cafe.)

562
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:11,378
(- I go here to eat. - It looks amazing.)

563
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:13,147
- Sixth Sense members, - Sixth Sense members,

564
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,007
- is this place real?
- is this place real?

565
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:18,218
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

566
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:19,787
This?

567
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:20,888
Why would you go this far?

568
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:22,788
- It's incredible. It's real.
- My goodness.

569
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:24,687
- Gosh.
- What's this?

570
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:25,757
This is really...

571
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,128
Are internet cafes like this these days?

572
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,598
They have rotisserie chicken?

573
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:33,127
This is a little suspicious.

574
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,998
- I'm sorry.
- Do they really roast the chicken?

575
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:37,737
- This is...
- It's ridiculous.

576
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,468
- This is ridiculous.
- I agree.

577
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,037
- That's a whole chicken.
- Yes.

578
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,477
How much is it?

579
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,377
It's either 9.9 dollars or 7.9 dollars.

580
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:46,507
It depends on the dish.

581
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,747
(How much?)

582
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:48,808
What?

583
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,978
The price is different depending on the sauce.

584
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,988
Isn't that the price from a long time ago?

585
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:56,558
That's not enough to cover the cost.

586
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,257
Isn't it the price from a long time ago?

587
00:19:58,258 --> 00:19:59,487
- Old-fashioned chicken...
- I'm doubtful about the price.

588
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:00,787
- The price can't be possible.
- I mean,

589
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,227
we sell most of our dishes...

590
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:03,828
at a low price.

591
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:08,527
They created this menu to draw more customers to the internet cafe.

592
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,038
That must be why it's so cheap.

593
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,667
I don't know if that's the reason,

594
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,837
but we had high sales during the first month.

595
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,008
- Did you make a lot?
- Yes.

596
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:18,007
We opened in July.

597
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,247
During the first month, we made over 90,000 dollars.

598
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:22,277
- Did you say 90,000 dollars?
- Yes.

599
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:23,347
July wasn't a long time ago.

600
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,417
Ninety thousand dollars?

601
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,048
(90,000 dollars as soon as they opened?)

602
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:27,418
July?

603
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,217
July wasn't a long time ago.

604
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:30,557
It's worth doubting.

605
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:31,758
It's very recent.

606
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,157
I heard something similar...

607
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,028
- not so long ago.
- Where?

608
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:37,257
Where?

609
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:39,098
- Haha told me.
- Really?

610
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:40,228
Seriously?

611
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,768
He didn't tell me the details.

612
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,937
There may be places that get rotisserie chicken delivered,

613
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:47,708
but they roast chicken on site?

614
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,608
- Then it could be real.
- Really?

615
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:50,738
Haha told you?

616
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,637
Haha talks about it a lot.

617
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:55,047
(Is this a real internet cafe that Haha knows about?)

618
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,147
Can you play games...

619
00:20:57,148 --> 00:20:58,518
while eating chicken?

620
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:01,347
It's because it's all about stamina.

621
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:03,757
(Eating protein is necessary.)

622
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:05,388
People play for five hours.

623
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:07,727
To play Crazyracing KartRider...

624
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:08,757
(Run)

625
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:09,758
You have to do this.

626
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:12,728
(Personal camera of zl Zone Big Nose)

627
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:14,667
These days, people play League of Legends.

628
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,068
- They play for a very long time.
- Right.

629
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:19,808
In the middle of playing games, when people eat,

630
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,738
they watch media contents on the Internet.

631
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:25,377
Or they play games that only require the use of a mouse.

632
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:26,977
(They watch videos or play simple games while eating.)

633
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:29,208
Shall we order something from the menu?

634
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:31,777
You'll see "Order Products" on the right.

635
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:32,878
Okay.

636
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:34,488
"Order Products?"

637
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,848
There it is.

638
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,657
(When you open the Order Products window on the right)

639
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:41,628
There's also Chapaghetti.

640
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,398
Oh, my. This is incredible.

641
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,928
What's all this?

642
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:48,498
There's also Chapaghetti tangsuyuk.

643
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:49,837
There are so many.

644
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,537
- There's also barbecue.
- Let's see.

645
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:52,938
(Barbecue)

646
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,208
(Various rotisserie chicken dishes under the barbecue tab)

647
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:58,108
This is incredible.

648
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:00,148
I should order one cream cheese.

649
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:02,978
There's also butter garlic.

650
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:04,748
(There's also butter garlic.)

651
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,447
(Butter garlic?)

652
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:11,218
The way Mimi talks is very unique.

653
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:12,658
Right.

654
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,128
"There's also butter garlic."

655
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:16,857
It's cute.

656
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:17,958
(Are you talking about me?)

657
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:19,997
(Happy)

658
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:22,527
I'm really surprised.

659
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:23,738
(Jae Seok is surprised by such a variety of dishes.)

660
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,168
There's so much on the menu. Who cooks all this?

661
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,537
- They make everything here.
- How?

662
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:31,808
(Compared to many options, the kitchen looks somewhat cramped.)

663
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:33,747
It's hard to say that it's fake.

664
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:36,618
Doesn't the rotisserie fit perfectly in this space?

665
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:39,317
- It fits so perfectly.
- That's...

666
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,517
(Seok Jin examines the finishing details carefully.)

667
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:43,218
(Careful)

668
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:45,017
(The finishing details are also perfect up close.)

669
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:47,857
How could it fit in here so perfectly?

670
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:48,887
It must be...

671
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,957
(The measurements are perfect like it's been planned.)

672
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,427
They could have brought the rotisserie from somewhere.

673
00:22:53,428 --> 00:22:54,527
There are pulleys.

674
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:56,128
No, those are wheels, not pulleys.

675
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,437
- Those are wheels, not pulleys.
- Wheels.

676
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,007
(The object that's been agreed to be called a wheel)

677
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,368
Those are wheels, not pulleys.

678
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,837
(Is it today's crucial hint that determines what's fake?)

679
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:06,007
Right, most places buy secondhand equipment.

680
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:08,377
By the way, it runs all day long...

681
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:10,877
It's been running for a few months.

682
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,178
For two months.

683
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,817
- Considering the rotisserie, - For two months.

684
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,117
it doesn't smell like chicken here.

685
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:16,618
- Did you smell it?
- I did.

686
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:18,858
- It really smelled.
- Shouldn't the smell be stronger?

687
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:20,828
How much stronger?

688
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,697
(You're right.)

689
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:24,928
Do you have rhinitis?

690
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,597
Seok Jin, do you have a stuffy nose?

691
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:27,827
Compared to the size of your nose,

692
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,567
your sense of smell...

693
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,938
- There's a smell.
- Due to the changing season...

694
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:33,437
Did it really smell?

695
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,138
When we came in...

696
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:36,238
Seok Jin.

697
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:37,238
- Seok Jin.
- When we came in...

698
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,308
- You're covering MIYEON's face.
- Seok Jin!

699
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,248
They won't miss it.

700
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,177
Why would you worry about that? There are so many cameras.

701
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:45,217
You looked like you were in a car.

702
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:47,187
(We will do our best.)

703
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:49,488
She's our guest.

704
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:51,918
MIYEON, could you hide for a second?

705
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:53,757
("Controversial Mr. Ji Tells Guest to Hide")

706
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:54,758
(I want to be in the frame.)

707
00:23:55,358 --> 00:23:56,358
Dong Hwi.

708
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,398
Stop pointing your finger at me.

709
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,127
(Gosh, that brat...)

710
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:01,498
- How many times should I tell you?
- Dong Hwi.

711
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:03,997
Did you smell it when you came in?

712
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,098
I smelled it.

713
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:06,767
- Did it really smell?
- Yes.

714
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:07,937
Was I the only one who didn't smell it?

715
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:09,107
(Big Nose Conan will become a great detective one day.)

716
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:10,177
I thought...

717
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,477
(His big nose is useless.)

718
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:13,037
Everyone, with a beverage on the line,

719
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,847
you'll play a game that's popular among university students.

720
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,548
- Okay, what is it?
- Students these days...

721
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:18,577
(Exclaiming)

722
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:19,818
It's a game for MZers.

723
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:21,387
(The game that Sixth Sense members will play...)

724
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:22,988
(with a beverage on the line)

725
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:25,257
(The mission in each round is completed through "cooperation.")

726
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:26,417
(It uses simple controls,)

727
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:27,628
(and teamwork is very important.)

728
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:30,327
(The nickname of this game with cute characters)

729
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:32,328
(Game that Destroys Friendship)

730
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,868
(Follow the order!)

731
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,298
(Shouting is common.)

732
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:42,108
(The players are likely to fight.)

733
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:44,077
(Will Sixth Sense members manage to claim...)

734
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:45,738
(the drinks without fighting?)

735
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,277
Which one is mine?

736
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,808
Who is the blue one?

737
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,718
I'm the blue one.

738
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:52,177
(Introducing the characters)

739
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:53,647
Stay calm. One by one.

740
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:54,987
(Dong Hwi, Kyung Pyo, Mimi,)

741
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,248
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, MIYEON)

742
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,358
I'm the head. We'll start.

743
00:24:58,658 --> 00:24:59,758
What's this?

744
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,088
Wait a minute.

745
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:04,697
(From the start,)

746
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,768
(they face a difficulty.)

747
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,728
(An incredibly difficult challenge)

748
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:12,398
(Will Sixth Sense members succeed?)

749
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:15,838
You have to move forward little by little.

750
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:17,377
Little by little.

751
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:19,177
(If you stumble a little, you will fall.)

752
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:20,278
Wait.

753
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:22,777
I'll move forward a little from here.

754
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,878
All right. Seok Jin, please stay still.

755
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:26,578
Seok Jin, stay still.

756
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:28,687
- What should I do?
- That's right.

757
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:30,058
- Do I go up?
- That's right.

758
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:32,017
- You have to do it well.
- Move forward a little.

759
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:33,157
Move up more.

760
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,287
What?

761
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:35,958
The purple one has to do well.

762
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:37,957
- The purple has to jump.
- Jump.

763
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,328
- While jumping...
- Me?

764
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:40,828
(Screaming)

765
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:44,037
(MIYEON, the type to play games by shouting)

766
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:46,068
She's not very good at jumping.

767
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:47,567
Move up more.

768
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:48,808
(Her secret is revealed.)

769
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:50,638
You got it.

770
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:52,278
MIYEON, jump.

771
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:53,848
Jump while moving forward.

772
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,377
Move up more.

773
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:56,378
(Screaming)

774
00:25:57,648 --> 00:25:59,647
(The dignity of the queen who jumps instead of her character)

775
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,047
Get closer... No!

776
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:02,787
(No!)

777
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:04,987
I don't want to do it.

778
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,217
I will do it.

779
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:07,357
- Could you move...
- Please move forward.

780
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,558
Jae Seok is going to jump. Everyone, advance a little.

781
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:11,627
(Jae Seok starts to climb up.)

782
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:13,058
Purple, please go forward.

783
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:14,728
You have to move forward by a lot.

784
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:16,737
Purple, you have to move farther.

785
00:26:16,738 --> 00:26:17,838
- Farther?
- Move a little more.

786
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:19,767
Purple...

787
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,308
(Moaning wearily)

788
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:23,308
- Move up a little.
- That's it.

789
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:24,638
(Slightly)

790
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:26,777
(The perfect stairs are finally formed.)

791
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:28,648
(The rest is up to Jae Seok.)

792
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,347
(He pressed the space bar.)

793
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:31,847
- There he goes.
- Good job.

794
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,348
(He succeeds after his first attempt.)

795
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:35,047
Okay, I knew it.

796
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:36,248
That was great.

797
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:37,487
Okay.

798
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:38,687
That's right.

799
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,588
- We got it.
- Okay.

800
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:43,698
(Once they go into the door in order)

801
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:45,828
(Success)

802
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:47,828
That's right.

803
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:49,468
Jae Seok, this is fun.

804
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:51,268
This is fun.

805
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,907
- We got it. Clear.
- This is fun.

806
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,168
(Mister who's after the MZers' trends)

807
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:57,678
Why do university students play it these days?

808
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:59,508
(Bursting out laughing)

809
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,448
(Serious)

810
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:03,618
(He still has a hard time understanding MZers.)

811
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:05,318
Wait, how do we get there?

812
00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:06,648
What do we do here?

813
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:09,417
Oh, like this...

814
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:11,358
- Move up little by little.
- That's right.

815
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:12,788
Like that.

816
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:14,427
We have to press that red button.

817
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:17,157
(We might have to press the red button after jumping over.)

818
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,197
You have to wait.

819
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:19,997
(Before they build the stairs)

820
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:21,968
(Suddenly taking off)

821
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:23,798
You're being too greedy.

822
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:26,637
You have ten seconds before the food is served.

823
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:27,767
Gosh.

824
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,108
Hurry up.

825
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:33,578
(They must clear this mission to win the drinks.)

826
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,707
- Pink.
- No.

827
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:36,708
- Go up.
- Don't move.

828
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:39,078
Wait. Don't move. I'll go up.

829
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:40,918
I'll go up. No one moves.

830
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:42,418
Wait. Don't move.

831
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,217
(The vibe of a penalty shoot-out during the final)

832
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:46,388
Go up.

833
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:48,287
Go up quickly.

834
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:49,587
(Mimi, the visiting cheerleader)

835
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:50,757
Don't move.

836
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:51,927
- Go.
- Wait. Don't move.

837
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,097
(Kyung Pyo prays for Seok Jin's success.)

838
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:55,427
I'll go up.

839
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:57,367
(I believe in you, Big Nose.)

840
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:59,037
- Four.
- Go up.

841
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,667
(Go up.)

842
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,908
- Go up.
- Don't move.

843
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:04,378
Here I go.

844
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:06,237
(He's finally at the time. What remains is...)

845
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,907
(a jump.)

846
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:09,808
One, two, three.

847
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,217
Jump!

848
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:12,247
(Let's go. Jump!)

849
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:13,418
I got it.

850
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:16,147
(Dreams come true.)

851
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:17,957
- Press the button.
- I did.

852
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,058
There's a bridge.

853
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,658
- Everyone.
- This is fun.

854
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,327
Okay, we're in.

855
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,497
(Mission cleared)

856
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:25,698
We'll give you the drinks.

857
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:27,168
(They finally got the drinks.)

858
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,168
- This is fun.
- It's fun.

859
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:31,338
At first, I didn't know why we were doing it, but it's so much fun.

860
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:32,898
Can't we play this all day long?

861
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:36,337
Gosh, I should've developed this game.

862
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:37,737
(I should've created this game.)

863
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:39,638
You live only as a user.

864
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:42,008
(The older guys are funny.)

865
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:43,817
- Instead of leading his life, - If I had created it...

866
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:45,378
- he lives as a user.
- I know.

867
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,187
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

868
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:49,447
(At that time, food is served.)

869
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:50,787
Enjoy your food.

870
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:53,288
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

871
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:54,888
- Enjoy your food.
- It looks amazing.

872
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:57,958
Wait, how much is this?

873
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:00,398
This is impossible.

874
00:29:01,668 --> 00:29:04,037
We use whole brined chickens sold at the supermarket.

875
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,498
With four chickens per row,

876
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,867
we grill them at 200°C for an hour.

877
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:09,737
(As they're grilled slowly, the chickens are lean without oil.)

878
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:11,807
What's special about food at this internet cafe is...

879
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,548
that it's served with special sauces.

880
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:16,148
Doenjang sauce.

881
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:18,678
Spicy mayonnaise sauce.

882
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:20,788
Pineapple sauce.

883
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,657
Three different sauces are served.

884
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,658
It's a rotisserie chicken with three sauces.

885
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:29,757
With thick cream cheese sauce...

886
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:31,228
(Pouring a lot of thick cream cheese sauce)

887
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:34,497
Jalapenos are added to make it less greasy.

888
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:35,697
It's whole chicken with cream cheese.

889
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:37,538
(Whole chicken with cream cheese)

890
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:39,237
(Dishes high in protein...)

891
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:40,407
(only available at this internet cafe)

892
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:42,668
Is this only 7.9 dollars?

893
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:43,908
It's amazing.

894
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:46,638
Everyone. There are three colors.

895
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,747
Either dip it in this...

896
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:49,877
(He dips the chicken leg in the sauce.)

897
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,148
How is it?

898
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,547
(Mimi also takes a big bite.)

899
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,087
It's really delicious.

900
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,218
(Her eyes widened.)

901
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:57,418
(Exclaiming)

902
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,118
Try it. Isn't it delicious?

903
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,287
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

904
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:03,358
The quality...

905
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:05,257
(She takes another bite.)

906
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:07,168
The quality is unbelievable.

907
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,728
Try it with the cream sauce.

908
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:11,467
Thank you.

909
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:12,768
- Try it.
- It's amazing.

910
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,568
It looks delicious.

911
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,208
(Humming)

912
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:19,338
It's chicken that tastes like carbonara.

913
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,378
Isn't it delicious?

914
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:23,208
It tastes like rose tteokbokki.

915
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,378
Did you look at this whole pork belly?

916
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:27,788
- MIYEON, take a look at it.
- That's amazing.

917
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:29,717
(Awed by the glossy appearance)

918
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:30,718
This is...

919
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:32,788
Try some pork belly.

920
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,528
(Exclaiming)

921
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,057
Isn't it amazing?

922
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:39,128
(It's needless to say.)

923
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,528
This is so good.

924
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:44,238
(Humming)

925
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:45,897
- It's good.
- It's really good.

926
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:47,068
It's so tasty.

927
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:48,608
I wish we could stay here.

928
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:51,908
- Why don't we stay here today?
- I know.

929
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:54,277
These days, parents worry...

930
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:55,977
about their children going to internet cafes.

931
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:57,548
But our children eat well.

932
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,948
With this quality,

933
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:02,148
they eat better than their dads.

934
00:31:02,348 --> 00:31:03,958
Ji Ho also told me...

935
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:07,388
that he went to an internet cafe with his friends recently.

936
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:09,487
I can't believe him.

937
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,497
(He's been enjoying this delicious food by himself.)

938
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,728
There's no need to worry about your kids.

939
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:14,498
How can there be an internet cafe like this?

940
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:16,628
(Tell me about it.)

941
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,197
I heard something similar to this.

942
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:20,908
Really? Then...

943
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:22,308
wouldn't this be real?

944
00:31:22,568 --> 00:31:25,737
Seok Jin, Haha could've lied to you.

945
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:26,877
No way.

946
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:27,907
Because...

947
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:29,947
- Just to trick him on this show?
- Because...

948
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:31,277
Just for the sake of this show,

949
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,147
the staff could've contacted the people around you...

950
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:35,917
so they could tell you about this place.

951
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:37,687
That actually happened once!

952
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,258
- Really?
- They went to such lengths?

953
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,428
They do that and more.

954
00:31:41,528 --> 00:31:43,127
In season one,

955
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:45,757
- Sook tricked Eun I, remember?
- She tricked Eun I.

956
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:47,027
The day before filming...

957
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,227
(The staff tried to trick Eun I through her good friend Kim Sook.)

958
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:53,368
- She mentioned it to you.
- I didn't pay attention.

959
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:56,468
(Back then, the plan failed.)

960
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,838
You're right. That could be it.

961
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:00,877
(Confused)

962
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,047
I don't see how this can be real though.

963
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,248
(Is the staff pulling a trick, or does Haha really know the place?)

964
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:06,617
Never stop doubting.

965
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:09,148
You've all let your guard down because the food is too good.

966
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:12,417
Here are your drinks.

967
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:14,527
Check out the size of this drink.

968
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:15,827
(Large)

969
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:18,398
I didn't order an extra large drink.

970
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:21,027
I'm sorry, but I think I messed up my order.

971
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:22,028
(Laughing)

972
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,098
What on earth?

973
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:25,437
Looks like I'll have to carry this around...

974
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:26,668
like an IV drip.

975
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,778
(An extra large coke)

976
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,208
How much is that?

977
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:34,508
How is the coke only 1.9 dollars?

978
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:36,678
- No way.
- Did you say 1.9 dollars?

979
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:40,318
(The coke is too affordable that it seems fake.)

980
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:41,417
Does this coke even have a margin?

981
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,648
This is 2.3 dollars.

982
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:44,657
This has to be fake.

983
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,117
(Did the staff drop the ball with the price tags?)

984
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:47,987
It seems like the owner wants you...

985
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,187
to stay here all night.

986
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:50,327
- Exactly.
- You're right.

987
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:51,328
A game of stamina.

988
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,627
You could go to an internet cafe just to grab a meal.

989
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:56,667
The food is incredible.

990
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:59,098
Seok Jin, did you actually order tangsuyuk?

991
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,208
Try some. It's really good.

992
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:05,337
I know it's good...

993
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:06,937
- but we're...
- Try some.

994
00:33:06,938 --> 00:33:09,247
The staff led us here for a reason.

995
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,818
A reason? It's all here.

996
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:12,647
That's the reason.

997
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,088
Guys, try a piece of the tangsuyuk.

998
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:15,317
I mean...

999
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:16,347
- It's really good.
- It's like...

1000
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:18,058
a stray cat poked at this chicken.

1001
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:20,657
- Eat more of the meat, will you?
- What?

1002
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:21,658
(Big Nose Cat, 59, tangsuyuk-lover)

1003
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,687
- Try some.
- Did you steal a bite of this?

1004
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:25,427
Seok Jin, you haven't eaten it.

1005
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:27,767
- Are you just getting started?
- Of course.

1006
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:29,527
I'll be taking everything home.

1007
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:31,467
- The leftovers, I mean.
- You're ready to eat, right?

1008
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,498
- Sure.
- You're the most immature one here.

1009
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,278
Please be more understanding of him.

1010
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,308
- I apologize for my junior.
- His junior.

1011
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:41,577
I apologize for my junior.

1012
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,708
(A fun sight)

1013
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:45,718
He used to get an earful from the producers...

1014
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:48,518
for being bad at acting.

1015
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:52,017
- He got an earful.
- And I thought...

1016
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:54,287
I can have a career that doesn't involve acting.

1017
00:33:54,288 --> 00:33:55,288
That's what I thought.

1018
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:57,957
I was recently recommended a video of you acting.

1019
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,027
Same here!

1020
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,627
- "You're so perfect." - Yes, that's the one.

1021
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:03,067
"You're so perfect that I feel pressured."

1022
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:04,938
Why has that been resurfacing lately?

1023
00:34:05,098 --> 00:34:07,167
(Seok Jin broke up with his girlfriend...)

1024
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:09,268
(because she was too perfect.)

1025
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,837
(Do you still not get it?)

1026
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:15,307
(You're too perfect.)

1027
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:16,908
It reminded me of "Lovers in Paris."

1028
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:20,078
I looked like Park Shin Yang at the time.

1029
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:24,618
(They failed to keep a straight face.)

1030
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,117
His acting was terrible.

1031
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,157
(Park Shin Yang, my foot.)

1032
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:29,227
Who was the director again?

1033
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,557
I still remember him to this day.

1034
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:32,558
(Jee Mang Saeng, 59, aspiring actor)

1035
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:34,727
The taste tells me it's real,

1036
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:37,238
but the owner won't turn a profit at this price.

1037
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:39,198
Exactly. That doesn't make sense.

1038
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:41,867
(Let me see...)

1039
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,708
The owner didn't seem...

1040
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,308
nervous at all.

1041
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,348
- Exactly. That's true.
- Right.

1042
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:51,018
MIYEON, that's the kind of thing experts like me catch.

1043
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:53,817
Amateurs focus on the price.

1044
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:56,188
I try to see if the employees are actors.

1045
00:34:57,088 --> 00:35:01,657
(I see...)

1046
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:03,488
(We don't want to hear it)

1047
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:06,727
(We don't want to hear it!)

1048
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,898
I'm sorry, but no one's faking it as much as you are.

1049
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,638
This is a tough one.

1050
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,137
If only I had been to internet cafes a lot.

1051
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:17,737
Then I could tell if this was adequate or not.

1052
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:18,777
(Strange Room: 1. Too affordable even for its location,)

1053
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:19,778
(2. Good timing to open a fake one, 3. Is it the one Haha mentioned?)

1054
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:21,207
This is tough.

1055
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,477
- Tell me about it.
- It's really tough.

1056
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:26,677
Internet cafes these days do offer a variety of food.

1057
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,918
- Exactly.
- So that could be served for real.

1058
00:35:29,488 --> 00:35:31,117
Didn't rotisserie chicken with cream cheese...

1059
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:32,357
remind you of this?

1060
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:35,358
Back when we went to Suwon,

1061
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:37,227
there was a rotisserie chicken...

1062
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:40,597
- cooked with cheese.
- Yes, with kimchi.

1063
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:41,598
That was delicious.

1064
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,428
The same chef could've cooked this.

1065
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:44,938
- Did it taste similar?
- Yes.

1066
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:45,997
You're right.

1067
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:47,838
(Is it fake? The chicken resembles a dish they had before.)

1068
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:51,278
I can't tell with that chicken alone.

1069
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:53,948
I wonder what a Strange Space is.

1070
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:57,208
- What kind of space is there?
- Could it be a subway car?

1071
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:00,148
(Is the strange space a subway car?)

1072
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,218
Like Mimi said, it could be a board game.

1073
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,858
- Blue Marble.
- A space on Blue Marble.

1074
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:08,187
- There's a die drawn on this space.
- Yes, a die.

1075
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:09,357
(Is the strange space a board game cafe?)

1076
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:11,928
I think it's been ten years since I went...

1077
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:13,428
to a board game cafe.

1078
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:16,197
Everything's at least been a decade for you.

1079
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:17,198
Almost...

1080
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,438
Is this his lost ten years?

1081
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,167
He's missing ten years of his life.

1082
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:22,768
What did you do for the past ten years?

1083
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,807
- For ten years, - Where were you?

1084
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,237
- I lived like I was being chased.
- Like you were being chased?

1085
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:28,747
Yes, that's right.

1086
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:30,477
(Repeating like an echo)

1087
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:32,917
You're the first one to do a voice impression of me.

1088
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,918
"You're the first one to do a voice impression of me."

1089
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:36,747
(He's good!)

1090
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:39,118
"I lived like I was being chased."

1091
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,727
(Clapping fervently)

1092
00:36:40,728 --> 00:36:42,088
That sounded just like him!

1093
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,387
No way.

1094
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:44,697
(Seok Jin's pleased.)

1095
00:36:44,698 --> 00:36:48,297
(While laughing and joking around, they head to the next location.)

1096
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:50,198
- This place...
- What could be over here?

1097
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:51,838
Is it over here?

1098
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,538
Look at this place.

1099
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:55,967
How adorable and pretty is this?

1100
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:57,038
Check out this alley.

1101
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:58,837
(A narrow alley from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies...)

1102
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:00,538
(to Kyung Hee University)

1103
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:02,477
You're getting that nice alleyway vibe.

1104
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:03,878
- Right?
- It's pretty.

1105
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,647
It's famous for its murals.

1106
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:09,887
I feel like I've warped into a new space.

1107
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:11,018
(It's like being in a new space.)

1108
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:12,988
Hey, he's making something.

1109
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,988
He's making something.

1110
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:17,658
What's that?

1111
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:19,927
(Holding a long stick)

1112
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:20,998
I wonder what that is.

1113
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:22,597
What's that?

1114
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:24,368
(Mysterious powders are in front of him.)

1115
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,198
The Cotton Candy Man?

1116
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,238
Don't tell me it's him.

1117
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,838
Come on.

1118
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,107
- Hello.
- Goodness.

1119
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:34,977
- This isn't one of the places.
- I see.

1120
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:36,378
He's the famous local cotton candy man.

1121
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:40,247
- This isn't one of the places?
- Really?

1122
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:42,247
- Hello.
- Is he for real, then?

1123
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:43,648
- Yes, he is.
- I see.

1124
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:46,017
What kind of cotton candy are you famous for?

1125
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:48,988
I do street performances using cotton candy.

1126
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:51,427
(Street performances?)

1127
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:52,558
I'd love to see it.

1128
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:57,397
He's famous for shooting cotton candy in your face.

1129
00:37:57,398 --> 00:37:58,668
He shoots it at your face?

1130
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,037
At your face?

1131
00:38:00,038 --> 00:38:02,168
(He's not your typical cotton candy vendor.)

1132
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,977
(A performer who shoots cotton candy)

1133
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,478
(A performance where he shoots cotton candy in the face)

1134
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:10,747
(A trending performance that went viral on social media)

1135
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:12,347
(The cotton candy performance is a work of art.)

1136
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:14,288
(- It was the most popular. - I'd love to see it.)

1137
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,018
Who wants cotton candy in their face?

1138
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:18,817
We gave it a shot, and it's not that bad.

1139
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,687
- It's not bad?
- Really?

1140
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:22,428
- In the face?
- Look at him waiting.

1141
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:23,958
Seok Sam should be the one.

1142
00:38:24,528 --> 00:38:25,958
- Why...
- I shoot it directly at your face.

1143
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:28,068
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yes.

1144
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,898
It'll be fine since your glasses don't have any lenses.

1145
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:32,638
Will it be sticky?

1146
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:36,737
As long as you pull it off in about 3 to 4 seconds...

1147
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:37,977
- Will it be okay?
- Yes.

1148
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,077
Give it a try.

1149
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:40,308
(Watching the cotton candy show from afar)

1150
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:41,977
(Shooting air from his heat gun)

1151
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:43,147
(Shaking)

1152
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:44,247
It won't hurt.

1153
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:45,318
- It's not dangerous.
- Exactly.

1154
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,178
- Fire away.
- Sure.

1155
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:50,888
(Shooting cotton candy)

1156
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:55,428
(It instantly covers his face.)

1157
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:59,327
(A performance they've never seen before)

1158
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,497
(Snatch!)

1159
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:03,768
(Kyung Pyo grabs some and eats it.)

1160
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:07,138
It's Big Nose Grandpa!

1161
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:09,767
Is it Christmas already?

1162
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:11,137
It's Big Nose Grandpa!

1163
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:12,207
I can just pull it off.

1164
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:15,207
(The performance leaves him happy.)

1165
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,377
- This...
- Who knew this was a thing?

1166
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:19,177
I have to ask though.

1167
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:20,788
Do people ask you to shoot cotton candy in their faces?

1168
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:23,348
Children from 2 to 7.

1169
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:27,057
- It's for children.
- I probably wouldn't.

1170
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:29,488
You're the most immature one among us.

1171
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:32,528
(Chuckling)

1172
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:34,768
What are some of your other performances?

1173
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:39,297
- Here's my opening act.
- Is this what you do?

1174
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:40,938
- I do this to draw customers.
- I see.

1175
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:43,367
(The more it gets spun on the long stick)

1176
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:44,408
What's that?

1177
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:49,578
It pleases the kids, and this is what they can share.

1178
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,218
- I make one for 50 to 100 people.
- For 100 people?

1179
00:39:52,878 --> 00:39:55,318
- For 100 people?
- For 100 people?

1180
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:56,987
That's so pretty!

1181
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:57,988
(The strands of cotton lift up and attach to the stick.)

1182
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,187
No way.

1183
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,957
(Wow!)

1184
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:04,028
- They're like floating clouds.
- Exactly.

1185
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:05,758
Do the strands follow the stick like that?

1186
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:09,028
This is what he does to draw customers.

1187
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:12,438
Of course, the children would gather around.

1188
00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:15,907
I can't believe the candy reaches the stick like that.

1189
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,708
- Look at it float up.
- Exactly!

1190
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,707
- This is incredible.
- How beautiful is that?

1191
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,777
(A scene they can't look away from)

1192
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:24,478
(A cotton candy for 100 people)

1193
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:26,247
Can we take this with us?

1194
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:27,648
Your face will look smaller by comparison.

1195
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,557
(Bouncing)

1196
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:33,818
- No way.
- Look at that.

1197
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:36,327
(Jae Seok switches on his prankster mode.)

1198
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:39,027
(Laughing)

1199
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:41,097
(Feeling 100 percent happy)

1200
00:40:41,098 --> 00:40:42,867
That's the face of a kid between 2 and 7.

1201
00:40:42,868 --> 00:40:44,028
Catch it if you can.

1202
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:45,798
Catch it if you can.

1203
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,037
- Hand it over.
- Catch it if you can.

1204
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:49,738
- You should stop.
- Hand it over.

1205
00:40:50,268 --> 00:40:52,577
- Let it stop.
- Have some, guys.

1206
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,378
(They all share the jumbo cotton candy.)

1207
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,678
Kids would demolish that in no time.

1208
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:58,118
It's huge!

1209
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,577
(The tastes of childhood!)

1210
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:01,648
It reminds me of my childhood.

1211
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:03,847
It's just sugar.

1212
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:04,887
(Killing the childhood innocence)

1213
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:06,017
Of course, it is.

1214
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:08,258
It's been a while since I had plain sugar like this.

1215
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:10,857
- It was fun.
- I hope your business flourishes.

1216
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:12,598
- Okay.
- Good luck.

1217
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:14,158
Seriously,

1218
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:16,197
it's been a while since I had plain sugar.

1219
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:17,698
- It was tasty.
- Hey.

1220
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,998
What? There's a used book store.

1221
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,337
There's a used book store too.

1222
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:22,838
- There's a used book store too.
- It's atmospheric.

1223
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:26,377
You know the smell of books, right?

1224
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:28,008
(A place near the university that's full of the smell of books)

1225
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:29,447
- The smell of books.
- This is incredible.

1226
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,878
- Do you smell the books?
- Yes.

1227
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:33,677
I really enjoyed "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

1228
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:35,088
- Really?
- "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

1229
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:39,887
(At the university town, you can feel...)

1230
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:43,588
(the sentimentality and atmosphere of the university students.)

1231
00:41:43,788 --> 00:41:46,357
(Seok Jin reads an English book.)

1232
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:47,398
Can you read it?

1233
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:49,628
- I'll give it a try.
- You can read it out loud, right?

1234
00:41:49,868 --> 00:41:52,038
Jack opened his eyes.

1235
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:55,608
Sunrise through the window.

1236
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,277
Muindo, the deserted island?

1237
00:41:58,278 --> 00:41:59,437
"The deserted island?"

1238
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:00,978
- The window.
- Does it say "The deserted island?"

1239
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:02,747
- Let's go.
- You know,

1240
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:03,947
I haven't seen a used book store in a while.

1241
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:05,617
I know. It feels nice.

1242
00:42:05,618 --> 00:42:07,517
- There's a variety of businesses.
- That's...

1243
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:08,718
That's a salon.

1244
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:11,717
There are many barber shops these days.

1245
00:42:11,718 --> 00:42:13,018
That's right.

1246
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:14,587
Kwang Soo shop.

1247
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,058
(Does "Barber shop" equal "Kwang Soo shop?")

1248
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:17,927
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo isn't a fool.

1249
00:42:17,928 --> 00:42:19,358
I know that he isn't a fool.

1250
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:22,897
"Kwang Soo isn't a fool" was so funny.

1251
00:42:22,898 --> 00:42:24,437
That scene was so funny.

1252
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,467
"Kwang Soo isn't a fool."

1253
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:27,738
We went somewhere for a shoot.

1254
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:30,238
As Kwang Soo walked by, a fan shouted,

1255
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:32,438
"Kwang Soo isn't a fool."

1256
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:33,907
(They didn't know how to take her words of support.)

1257
00:42:33,908 --> 00:42:35,107
Those were her words of support.

1258
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:36,108
(They didn't know how to take her words of support.)

1259
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,078
I saved Kwang Soo's number on my phone...

1260
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,178
- under "Kwang Soo isn't a fool..." - "Kwang Soo isn't a fool."

1261
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:41,988
- at that moment.
- I see.

1262
00:42:43,148 --> 00:42:46,517
(Kwang Soo isn't a fool.)

1263
00:42:46,518 --> 00:42:47,588
We must be here.

1264
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:49,288
- Where is it?
- What?

1265
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:50,488
A grocery store?

1266
00:42:50,489 --> 00:42:51,557
Where is it?

1267
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:52,658
A grocery store?

1268
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:55,068
- No way.
- Then where is the place?

1269
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:56,196
We must be here.

1270
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:57,766
- Where is it?
- What?

1271
00:42:57,996 --> 00:42:59,766
- A grocery store?
- Where is it?

1272
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,430
A grocery store?

1273
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,589
- No way.
- Then where is the place?

1274
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,599
I think it's this place.

1275
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,100
- Taco?
- Is it this place?

1276
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,229
Taco?

1277
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,000
97z Grill.

1278
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,700
Child's?

1279
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,799
- Hello.
- Child's?

1280
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,839
- Is it this place?
- Taco?

1281
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Is it this place?

1282
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,379
(It's a 1-minute walk from Kyung Hee University.)

1283
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,179
(The second popular place, taco restaurant)

1284
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,609
- Is it this place?
- Taco?

1285
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,279
- Is it this place?
- I feel like I'm abroad.

1286
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,980
It makes sense since it's a small space.

1287
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,649
- A small space.
- A small space.

1288
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,319
It's a small space that's the size of a room.

1289
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,260
- It really is a small space.
- A small space.

1290
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,390
Sir.

1291
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,589
- Hello.
- Hello.

1292
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

1293
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,659
I feel like I'm abroad.

1294
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,229
If you take a photo here, it'll look like you're abroad.

1295
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,699
If I take a photo here,

1296
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,970
- it'll look like I'm abroad.
- You see such signs abroad.

1297
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,499
This place seems so hip.

1298
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,539
- Right?
- Yes.

1299
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,739
- What?
- I feel like I'm abroad.

1300
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,969
That signboard is so pretty.

1301
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,169
That signboard with lightbulbs.

1302
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,810
I really feel like I'm abroad.

1303
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,180
(The place is full of English posters.)

1304
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,149
(It's completely set up with the foreign sentimentality.)

1305
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,249
(Eating tacos)

1306
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,350
Take a photo.

1307
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,620
I feel like I'm abroad.

1308
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,990
(Making a V-sign)

1309
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,460
Does it look like I'm in LA?

1310
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,060
Why does it look so photoshopped?

1311
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,189
(Laughing soundlessly)

1312
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,489
- Send me the photo.
- Seok Jin.

1313
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,099
- Does it look like I'm in LA?
- No, an AI-generated image.

1314
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,360
(No, an AI-generated image.)

1315
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,669
(LA Genie)

1316
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,429
(Fake)

1317
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,070
To be honest, this seems like...

1318
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,969
- a regular taco place.
- Yes.

1319
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,939
The production crew couldn't have chosen it...

1320
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,639
for its exotic vibes.

1321
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,779
- I know.
- What's fake?

1322
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,210
- It seems real.
- What's fake?

1323
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,719
(It definitely looks real.)

1324
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,589
Sir, this place has been introduced as Strange Space.

1325
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,619
How is it Strange Space?

1326
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,089
This is...

1327
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,259
a Mexican restaurant...

1328
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,659
- that sells tacos.
- Mexican.

1329
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,889
- Mexican.
- Mexican.

1330
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,199
"Can" and "Space" are homophones.

1331
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,359
Mexican.

1332
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,369
We got "Space" since it was a homophone for "Can."

1333
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,499
(We got "Space" since it was a homophone for "Can.")

1334
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,170
(Strange Mexican place)

1335
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,439
This is a Mexican restaurant...

1336
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,180
that's located in Hoegi-dong.

1337
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,410
The representative menu items are birria taco...

1338
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,850
and cheese mac taco.

1339
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,189
The best-seller is...

1340
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,720
this taco.

1341
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,429
(The most popular menu item is coming soon.)

1342
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,789
For how long have you run this place?

1343
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,999
We opened...

1344
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,559
in April of last year.

1345
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,999
April of last year?

1346
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,130
He has quite a bit of experience.

1347
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,769
So it has been a bit over a year.

1348
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,339
- It has been a bit over a year.
- I see.

1349
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,709
- Starting this March, - Okay.

1350
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,749
we showcased a menu item called the walking taco.

1351
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,410
That was how the place became famous.

1352
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,980
Walking taco?

1353
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,479
(Eating)

1354
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,389
Is it a taco you eat as you walk on the street?

1355
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,689
- Yes.
- Is it a take-out menu item?

1356
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,149
- Really?
- Like a hot dog?

1357
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,660
(Is it a taco you eat on the street like a hot dog?)

1358
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,129
What's a walking taco?

1359
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,330
(What's the walking taco that made the restaurant popular?)

1360
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,429
If you bring any snacks,

1361
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,270
we turn them into tacos.

1362
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,169
That's why it's right next to a grocery store!

1363
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,770
- You're right.
- Snacks?

1364
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,369
- Snacks?
- Yes.

1365
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,440
You turn any snacks into tacos?

1366
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,149
For a walking taco,

1367
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,379
we turn the customer's choice of snack...

1368
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,020
into a taco.

1369
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,519
So that they can eat it with ease,

1370
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,489
we turn it into a taco in the same bag.

1371
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,959
(Snack)

1372
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,120
(Taco)

1373
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,529
(Taco and snack)

1374
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,699
There are other taco restaurants...

1375
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,499
that turn Doritos...

1376
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,269
and other popular chips into tacos.

1377
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,839
But what we do differently is...

1378
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,909
that the customers can bring whatever snacks they want...

1379
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,110
and customize them however they want.

1380
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,140
On top of the snacks of their choice,

1381
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,980
we add the sauces and toppings of their choice for consumption.

1382
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,250
(A customized taco you can make however you want)

1383
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,850
There are customers...

1384
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,760
who bring unusual snacks on purpose.

1385
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,659
(Onion snack)

1386
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,599
(Squid snack)

1387
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,130
(Puffed whole wheat kernels)

1388
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,099
No matter what snack they bring,

1389
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,200
we turn it into a taco with the recommended combination.

1390
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,570
Customers love it.

1391
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,770
They enjoy it.

1392
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,539
(The university town is experiencing the talking taco craze!)

1393
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,080
(The real reviews show that this place is good.)

1394
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,449
Sixth Sense members,

1395
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,019
is this place real?

1396
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,289
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1397
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,089
In the last season...

1398
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,190
- Pizza.
- Pizza.

1399
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,059
(Customized pizza on "Sixth Sense: City Tour 1")

1400
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,259
(Jjajangmyeon pizza)

1401
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,029
(Braised kimchi and tteokbokki pizza)

1402
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,570
(Snack pizza too)

1403
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,509
Since that place was real, this place might be real as well.

1404
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,839
- This place might be real as well.
- I don't know.

1405
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,179
(Is the place that turns any snacks into tacos real?)

1406
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,309
In any case, we need to try...

1407
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,779
the walking taco.

1408
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,449
- That's right.
- Let's see if it's real or fake.

1409
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,920
- Let's go and buy snacks.
- That's a good idea.

1410
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,520
Since this is a university town, only three people will go.

1411
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,190
- I'll go.
- That's good. Mimi.

1412
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,089
Shall we go on the count of three?

1413
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,889
- Dong Hwi, do you want to go?
- I'll work hard.

1414
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,229
- Dong Hwi.
- I'll go.

1415
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,859
- And... Okay.
- Then...

1416
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,929
- You can go.
- Mi Hyun, MIYEON, and Dong Hwi.

1417
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:06,999
It's okay. You can go.

1418
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,499
- Mi Hyun, MIYEON, and Dong Hwi.
- Okay.

1419
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,699
- Mi-MI-Dong.
- We'll be back.

1420
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,200
What kind of snacks do you want?

1421
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,269
I want wafers.

1422
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,699
- Wafers?
- Wafers.

1423
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,539
- Wafer taco?
- Seok Jin.

1424
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,609
Can they turn wafers into tacos?

1425
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:17,969
You'll eat them as tacos.

1426
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,140
I know. I want wafers.

1427
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,139
(Why did he come to a taco place?)

1428
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,349
Can you turn wafers into tacos?

1429
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,410
Of course.

1430
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,450
I want the octopus snack.

1431
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,090
The octopus snack?

1432
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,149
- The octopus snack?
- The octopus snack.

1433
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,290
The octopus snack?

1434
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,319
I want puffed wheat.

1435
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,029
- Puffed wheat?
- Puffed wheat sounds good.

1436
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,389
I feel like...

1437
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,359
the regular burritos the owner makes will be tastier.

1438
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,130
- I agree.
- The tacos too.

1439
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,329
- Snacks...
- I feel like...

1440
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,269
it's too much trouble to bring snacks here.

1441
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,339
That's right.

1442
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,169
- It's too much trouble for me.
- So you think it's fake.

1443
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,269
I wonder how it tastes.

1444
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,439
- Let's taste it first.
- We'll be back.

1445
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,639
We'll go and get snacks.

1446
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,810
(The snack expedition team sets off.)

1447
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,950
(How does the customized snack taco taste?)

1448
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

1449
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,349
- Hello.
- I smell ramyeon.

1450
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,490
Here are snacks.

1451
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,919
(Oh, my!)

1452
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,920
(My goodness!)

1453
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:06,990
(Oh, my!)

1454
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,159
(My goodness!)

1455
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,989
- The octopus snack isn't here.
- Right?

1456
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,499
The octopus snack and wafers aren't here.

1457
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,999
Those two snacks are old.

1458
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,169
They only eat old snacks.

1459
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,470
(They only eat old snacks.)

1460
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,970
There's no puffed wheat either.

1461
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,669
None of them are here.

1462
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,670
None of them are here.

1463
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:23,270
We'll need to choose the snacks on our own.

1464
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,309
- There are wafers!
- Wafers.

1465
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,409
(There are wafers!)

1466
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,509
There are only wafers.

1467
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,679
- Good choice.
- Seok Jin is...

1468
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,980
- the relatively trendy one.
- Yes. There are wafers.

1469
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,049
- Hoegi-dong has changed so much.
- This place...

1470
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,579
Is it Kyung Hee University...

1471
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,089
- if we take the right turn?
- Yes.

1472
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,549
I know this street.

1473
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,289
In the past, these alleys were a part of the residential area.

1474
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,820
Kyung Hee University is very pretty.

1475
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,729
- That's right.
- It's well-known to have...

1476
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,929
- a pretty campus.
- That's right.

1477
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,830
(It's pretty in spring as well.)

1478
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,029
Many dramas were filmed at Kyung Hee University.

1479
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,070
- Many dramas.
- That's right.

1480
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,469
("The Classic" was filmed at Kyung Hee University.)

1481
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,769
(This is the entrance of the main library.)

1482
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:58,480
(Movie, "Architecture 101")

1483
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,780
(This is in front of the liberal arts building!)

1484
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,249
They do many concerts at Kyung Hee University.

1485
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,619
- Grand Peace Palace.
- Singers do that.

1486
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,050
- There's a square.
- Yes.

1487
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,119
(Kyung Hee University's signature building,)

1488
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,860
(Grand Peace Palace)

1489
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,589
You came to Kyung Hee University more often...

1490
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,130
- than Ajou University.
- I came here more often.

1491
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,200
Many of my friends lived here.

1492
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,899
(The main entrance of Kyung Hee University in 1955)

1493
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,669
(He was the guardian of Kyung Hee University back then.)

1494
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,640
- This is a university town, right?
- Yes.

1495
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,569
So the walking taco is entirely possible.

1496
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,809
- Yes. It has a fun element.
- That's right.

1497
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,879
- You eat many snacks in university.
- That's right.

1498
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,639
- I don't know.
- If there's only a bit left,

1499
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,709
- you want to finish it.
- That's right.

1500
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,420
When you consider the neighborhood, this place makes sense.

1501
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,690
- Yes. It's a university town.
- It's a university town.

1502
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,220
Birria taco?

1503
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,660
Birria taco stand?

1504
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,960
Is that the walking taco? It isn't, right?

1505
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,859
Is that the walking taco?

1506
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,160
The walking taco isn't on the menu.

1507
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,000
This is...

1508
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:00,500
(The walking taco isn't on the main menu.)

1509
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,269
Had the walking taco been popular,

1510
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,710
- they would've written it here.
- Right?

1511
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:10,180
I feel like it's the work of the production crew.

1512
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,419
It's written there. "Bring your favorite snacks."

1513
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,480
What? Where?

1514
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,590
It's to Kyung Pyo's left. Look inside the kitchen.

1515
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,290
- You're right.
- Is it there?

1516
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,789
(There's a sign for a walking taco in the kitchen!)

1517
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,829
- Let me see.
- It's on the wall.

1518
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,529
Anyone who orders can see it.

1519
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,260
(The one who orders can see it.)

1520
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:30,969
(It isn't on the menu, but there's a sign.)

1521
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,040
Hey,

1522
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,339
doesn't it seem like the work of the broadcasting station?

1523
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,370
I'm talking about the font and everything.

1524
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,939
- I agree. The material...
- Right?

1525
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,810
- of this sign too.
- The sign too.

1526
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,550
(By the way)

1527
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,280
Seok Sam!

1528
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,079
(Sitting behind Seok Jin,)

1529
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,819
(Jae Seok calls his name warmly.)

1530
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,820
(Seok Sam!)

1531
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:52,589
(Jae Seok?)

1532
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,660
Seok Sam!

1533
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,330
Your back is hunched.

1534
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,830
Your back is hunched.

1535
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,800
(Flapping his arms)

1536
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,429
(Kyung Pyo loves it.)

1537
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,500
- Hey.
- I thought you were a shrimp.

1538
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,440
(Resentful)

1539
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
- Jeerimp.
- Jeerimp!

1540
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,179
- Jeerimp!
- That punk.

1541
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,180
(Laughing)

1542
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,980
Jeerimp isn't a bad nickname.

1543
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,480
Really?

1544
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,749
(Thus, the outstanding deduction comes to an end.)

1545
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,820
That's right.

1546
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,419
- We're back.
- We're back.

1547
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,420
- Did you buy them?
- Seok Jin,

1548
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:26,219
these days, convenience stores don't carry...

1549
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,060
- the octopus snack.
- No?

1550
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,159
- There wasn't puffed wheat either.
- There wasn't puffed wheat either.

1551
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,959
- That's strange.
- Really?

1552
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,799
But strangely, there were wafers.

1553
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,300
There were wafers. Seriously.

1554
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,930
Seok Jin.

1555
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,499
There were only wafers.

1556
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,740
Do you go to a convenience store often?

1557
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,199
I love wafers.

1558
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,410
- We bought the snacks we wanted.
- Well done.

1559
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,580
Lastly, I bought this for you to take home.

1560
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,849
It's a present.

1561
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,809
(Gosh, you punk)

1562
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,119
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1563
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,449
- Thanks.
- You should eat nuts.

1564
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,480
Okay.

1565
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,550
Let's put in the special order.

1566
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,289
(Unpredictable combinations)

1567
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,419
(Chocolatem, chocolate, cream, and yogurt flavors)

1568
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,130
- This place...
- This place...

1569
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,599
- seems real.
- It's a taco place.

1570
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,229
- That's right.
- But the walking taco is a bit...

1571
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,260
I know.

1572
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,899
Dong Hwi, come here. Check out the vibe of this sign.

1573
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,299
See if it has the vibe of a broadcasting station.

1574
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,399
- Okay.
- It's over there.

1575
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,140
I'm sorry, but please let go of my hand.

1576
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:17,909
For goodness' sake.

1577
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,709
(I refuse.)

1578
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,810
Why are you pulling so much?

1579
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,010
"Bring your favorite snacks." It's written there.

1580
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,949
- You're right.
- Does it have the vibe...

1581
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,180
or a broadcasting station or a Mexican restaurant?

1582
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,990
It looks like...

1583
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,419
It looks like...

1584
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,419
- it was made in haste.
- It does, right?

1585
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,560
"Bring your favorite snacks."

1586
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:36,929
What do you think, MIYEON?

1587
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,029
I wonder why he decided to add this menu item.

1588
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,130
I'm not sure.

1589
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,700
Sir.

1590
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,599
- How did you suddenly come up...
- Yes?

1591
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,870
with the walking taco?

1592
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,070
I was checking out social media posts from abroad.

1593
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,910
The item wasn't widely available in Korea.

1594
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,640
It looked fun.

1595
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,410
- Do people eat this abroad?
- Yes.

1596
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,279
It's a very popular item abroad.

1597
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,380
- Really?
- Yes.

1598
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,119
(It's very popular abroad.)

1599
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,159
(Walking taco)

1600
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,459
(Caviar)

1601
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,559
(Bread)

1602
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,400
(Sushi)

1603
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,599
(Walking tacos are made...)

1604
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,369
(with various ingredients abroad.)

1605
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:20,370
Sir,

1606
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,569
how many walking tacos do you sell...

1607
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,740
- in a day?
- In a day,

1608
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,209
I sell about 30.

1609
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,779
- Thirty?
- That's a lot.

1610
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,410
- If you mix them...
- Thirty in a day?

1611
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:32,320
(Mimi watches the owner closely.)

1612
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,390
(Is there a problem?)

1613
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,589
You know...

1614
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,950
(What is it?)

1615
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,589
He doesn't make it with a lot of care.

1616
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,720
- Really?
- Yes.

1617
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,559
He doesn't make it with a lot of care.

1618
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,089
Are you speaking quietly so that he won't hear you?

1619
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,629
What will you do if this place is real?

1620
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,900
He just pours the sauces like this.

1621
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,469
Hey, MIYEON. I mean, MIYEON.

1622
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,400
- I mean, Mi Hyun.
- Mi Hyun.

1623
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,869
Mi Hyun, when you're standing here, it seems like...

1624
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:56,239
(Laughing)

1625
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,539
you're running a taco business abroad.

1626
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,809
(Is there an idol who is running a taco business abroad?)

1627
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,180
- Bonjour.
- Taco.

1628
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,980
It seems like you're running a taco business abroad.

1629
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,579
Tacos are Mexican.

1630
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,349
- Why are you saying, "Bonjour?" - That's right.

1631
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,819
- What do you want?
- It looks like...

1632
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,589
- What do you want?
- she's dating as well.

1633
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,590
(Fascinated)

1634
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,919
It seems like you're running a taco business abroad.

1635
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,959
(Fascinated)

1636
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,129
It's a kiosk.

1637
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,190
A kiosk.

1638
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,460
- Don't you know what it means?
- All right.

1639
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,360
- It's here.
- It's here.

1640
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,830
It's here.

1641
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,169
- What?
- It's served in the snack bag.

1642
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,200
The snack bag.

1643
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,370
It's served like this.

1644
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,809
- No way.
- What's this?

1645
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:29,810
(Surprised)

1646
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:35,349
(Walking taco 1, Nacho chips)

1647
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:38,450
To the nacho chips, I usually add the cheese mac meat as a topping.

1648
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,379
Cheese mac tacos...

1649
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,049
are made with minced pork and beef.

1650
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,390
The base is like the soy sauce bulgogi.

1651
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,790
To that, I add cilantro and pico de gallo.

1652
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,960
(The new world of tacos is complete.)

1653
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,969
(Walking taco 2, cone-shaped corn snack)

1654
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,240
To the cone-shaped corn snack, I add the meat for the birria tacos.

1655
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,770
It's a mix of pork shoulder...

1656
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,210
and flat iron steak.

1657
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,110
I sear it and stir-fry it so that the oil comes out.

1658
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,349
Then I pour in the broth...

1659
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,880
and boil for 6 to 7 hours.

1660
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,219
Then I pull the tender meat apart.

1661
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,360
(The tender meat is pulled apart to be added as a topping.)

1662
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,059
It looks legit.

1663
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,229
- This is...
- This is real.

1664
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,299
It looks nice.

1665
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,300
(Hello.)

1666
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:28,300
- This is real.
- What's this?

1667
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:29,999
The portion size is big.

1668
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It'll help students save money.

1669
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,199
At first, I thought it was fake.

1670
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,540
But this makes me think that it's real.

1671
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,770
If it's ten dollars...

1672
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,980
- It's enough for four people.
- That's right.

1673
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,879
If it's ten dollars, isn't it a bit expensive?

1674
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,450
- How much is it?
- Excuse me.

1675
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,649
How much is the walking taco made with nacho chips?

1676
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,589
I charge about eight dollars.

1677
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,750
- It's cheap.
- Eight dollars.

1678
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,389
- But you buy the snack.
- You buy the snack.

1679
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,060
It's only two dollars.

1680
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,060
- It's 2.5 dollars.
- It's expensive, Seok Jin.

1681
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,700
- It's 2.5 dollars.
- It's expensive, Seok Jin.

1682
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,029
It's a difference of 50 cents.

1683
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,529
It's too expensive.

1684
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,199
I'd rather eat an actual taco.

1685
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,329
How much is an actual taco?

1686
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,869
- It's 5.90 dollars.
- That's what it says.

1687
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,170
(1 piece of taco is about 5 dollars.)

1688
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,839
(Is the price expensive for a university town?)

1689
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,569
(Is the walking taco fake?)

1690
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,979
Let's try it.

1691
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,710
- If the snack is 2.50 dollars...
- All right.

1692
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,109
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

1693
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:20,250
(Eating)

1694
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,450
How does it taste? I'm sure it's tasty.

1695
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,519
"How does it taste? I'm sure it's tasty."

1696
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,989
- Seriously.
- What?

1697
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:28,190
(Laughing)

1698
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,789
- Why did he even ask?
- It's bound to be tasty.

1699
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,459
- Why did he even ask?
- You didn't let me answer.

1700
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,429
- Why did you even ask?
- It's bound to be tasty.

1701
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,029
You didn't let me answer.

1702
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,500
Look at this. It's bound to be tasty. Sir.

1703
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,300
- "Sir." - Who were you talking to?

1704
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,109
(Sir, I'm eating.)

1705
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,710
- Who were you talking to?
- You know...

1706
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,040
It's tasty.

1707
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,410
(Foodie Kyung Pyo takes a bite as well.)

1708
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:51,980
It's tasty.

1709
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,479
It's tasty.

1710
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,689
- It's really tasty.
- It's tasty.

1711
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,019
- It's better than I expected.
- It's tasty.

1712
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,560
- You know, it's really tasty.
- Yes.

1713
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,860
It's the taste of the university town.

1714
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,890
Let me explain that taste.

1715
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,559
It's sour and spicy.

1716
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,700
The tastes are strong on the palate.

1717
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,470
The moment it enters the mouth...

1718
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,869
- It slaps the tongue.
- Slap!

1719
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,400
- The taste of youth.
- The taste of youth.

1720
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,870
It's the taste of youth.

1721
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,170
- The taste of youth.
- It's the taste of youth.

1722
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:19,709
- Is it beer food?
- It's the taste of youth.

1723
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,909
Seok Jin, I'm sorry, but you're covering the camera.

1724
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,210
- Hold on a second.
- Okay.

1725
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,579
(Lee Dong Hwi, faceless actor)

1726
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,619
- Let me get some corn snacks.
- Seok Jin, I need to work.

1727
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,090
Okay. Go ahead.

1728
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,350
(Eating)

1729
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:33,519
This university town has so much tasty food.

1730
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,589
I know. It's fun.

1731
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:37,830
They can digest food like this one.

1732
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,959
Since it's served in the snack bag,

1733
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,399
it's bound to go viral on social media.

1734
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,599
You're right. The visuals are good.

1735
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,299
- The visuals are eccentric.
- It's tasty.

1736
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,169
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

1737
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,040
There's meat inside.

1738
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:50,409
(It's covered in the meat topping.)

1739
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,540
It's tasty.

1740
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,550
- It's tasty.
- Why is it so sour?

1741
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,109
- Is it sour?
- It has a variety of flavors.

1742
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,020
- Why is it so sour?
- Why is it sour?

1743
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,779
(Ball snack,)

1744
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,049
(chocolate mushroom snack,)

1745
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,650
(and popcorn)

1746
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:07,990
(Yogurt jelly too)

1747

(Walking taco 3, Assorted snacks)

1748
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:11,690
When a customer brings a sweet snack,

1749
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,229
I sprinkle the sour sauce...

1750
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,070
to cut down on the greasy flavors.

1751
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,670
(It can be sour.)

1752
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,739
Kyung Pyo, it's because you're old.

1753
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,539
(It's because you're old.)

1754
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,010
This is the taste of youth.

1755
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,209
(He isn't youthful anymore.)

1756
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,910
- This is the taste of youth.
- That's right.

1757
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,480
- You enjoy this sour taste...
- Endure it.

1758
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,519
when you're young.

1759
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,649
Then I think it's nice!

1760
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:39,389
(Then I think the sour taste is nice!)

1761
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,320
(He hypnotizes himself into being young.)

1762
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,959
- You're grimacing.
- No, it's tasty.

1763
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,459
But his body is going...

1764
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,929
(His body doesn't react as he wants.)

1765
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,030
"It's nice."

1766
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,669
Mimi, try it.

1767
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,299
It's tasty. It's very tasty.

1768
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,500
- Seok Jin, please stop yelling.
- My goodness.

1769
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,639
(He's a young man at heart, but there's a communication issue.)

1770
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,139
- Seriously.
- It's amazing. Try it.

1771
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,640
(He's a young man at heart, but there's a communication issue.)

1772
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,109
- Sir.
- Yes?

1773
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:05,279
Are all of these walking tacos eight dollars?

1774
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,249
That one is about 6.5 dollars.

1775
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,280
How about this one?

1776
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,519
That one has the fewest toppings, so it's about five dollars.

1777
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,520
(Mixed walking taco)

1778
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:14,559
Sir, the prices aren't fixed, but estimates.

1779
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,330
(No fixed prices?)

1780
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,700
Usually, the customers choose the toppings they want.

1781
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,429
Each topping is 1 or 1.5 dollars.

1782
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,669
I see. It's customized.

1783
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,639
So there are no fixed prices. People choose their own toppings.

1784
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,669
It says "Customized."

1785
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,140
(It's on the sign.)

1786
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:32,139
Thank you for the food.

1787
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,609
- Thank you for the food.
- Sir, it was very tasty.

1788
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,409
- Thank you for the food.
- It was very tasty.

1789
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,449
(Strange Space 1. University town-fitting concept)

1790
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,549
(2. Hastily-put posters 3. No walking taco on the menu!)

1791
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,019
Seok Jin and I hung out here often back in the day.

1792
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,290
We came here often to play.

1793
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:44,620
Kyung Hee University is right here.

1794
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,819
It's right here.

1795
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,459
We hung out here often back in the day.

1796
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,029
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin spent their youth on this street.)

1797
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,299
If we go this way, we'll see Kyung Min's old place.

1798
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,729
That's right. We went there often to come up with ideas.

1799
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,970
- That's right.
- Gu Ra went there too.

1800
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:00,000
We had so many meetings for ideas.

1801
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,040
- We ran out of ideas.
- We did that all week.

1802
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:05,709
This place has energy.

1803
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:08,009
- A university town is different.
- That's right.

1804
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,210
A university town is different for real.

1805
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,549
- A university town is different.
- That's right.

1806
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,250
(The university town has the energy of youth.)

1807
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,819
- Upstairs is a dessert cafe.
- A dessert cafe.

1808
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,850
This place must be popular.

1809
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,160
What's this?

1810
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,619
It's another popular place.

1811
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,990
(It's located in front of Kyung Hee University.)

1812
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,260
(The popular place is reminiscent of the movie, "Kingsman.")

1813
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,829
(Her eyes widened.)

1814
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,400
- You smell waffles, right?
- Yes.

1815
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,700
Croffles.

1816
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,810
Waffles smell amazing.

1817
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,909
The smell intensified as soon as we came upstairs.

1818
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,310
(It's topped with honey and ice cream.)

1819
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:46,020
(Then it's covered in brown cheese.)

1820
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,749
(It's already all over social media.)

1821
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:54,319
(A popular place for croffles Kyung Hee University students love)

1822
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,230
- It's nice.
- It's so nice and cool.

1823
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,230
- It's so nice.
- Really?

1824
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,560
Did you have a hard time because of Seok Jin?

1825
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,500
But he sat next to me.

1826
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:05,639
But he sat next to me.

1827
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,739
(I didn't have a hard time, but he sat next to me.)

1828
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,239
But it's okay because he leans toward Dong Hwi a lot.

1829
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,669
- Really?
- I'll take care of him.

1830
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,679
I'll sit next to you and...

1831
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,849
If you sit in front of me, I won't cover you.

1832
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,809
He's filming only you.

1833
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,720
That cameraman is filming only you.

1834
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,290
Why are you suddenly doing this?

1835
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,019
- She doesn't disappoint.
- She's making a heart.

1836
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,489
- She's an idol.
- She's experienced.

1837
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:26,990
- It's an occupational habit.
- It's an occupational habit.

1838
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,089
What else do you do?

1839
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,629
- I always lift one foot.
- Why?

1840
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,830
- It's an occupational habit.
- Like this.

1841
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,830
- To appear tall?
- No.

1842
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,129
(Key point)

1843
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,270
To appear cute?

1844
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,600
She looks bubbly.

1845
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,040
- You lift the right foot.
- Yes.

1846
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,639
- You pose like this.
- So my left leg is more muscular.

1847
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,339
- Your left leg is more muscular.
- My left leg.

1848
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,440
So you can stand on one foot.

1849
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,349
- Can't you do it?
- You only do it...

1850
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,510
for the one-legged fight, right?

1851
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,680
That's right.

1852
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:54,020
I stand on one foot if there's a prize.

1853
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,450
I don't do it normally.

1854
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:57,419
Do you know how to test your body age with a gait?

1855
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,519
- What's that?
- What's that?

1856
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,589
Do this.

1857
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,619
- What's that?
- What's that?

1858
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,719
(If you can't do it, you're old.)

1859
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,360
- Skipping? If you can't skip...
- If you can't skip...

1860
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,530
I do that all the time.

1861
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,760
Anyone can do it.

1862
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,100
Seok Jin, show us.

1863
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,429
(The man who wants to be a Gen Zer, Seok Jin gives it a go.)

1864
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,869
Hey, that's how I go home. This is it.

1865
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:14,940
Whenever I go home...

1866
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,739
- You can't do it.
- That isn't it.

1867
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,909
(What?)

1868
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,140
- You can't do it.
- That isn't it.

1869
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,910
- You can't do it.
- Isn't this it?

1870
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,679
- Seok Jin, that isn't it.
- You can't do it.

1871
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,379
- This is it.
- No.

1872
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,419
Isn't this it? How do you do it?

1873
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,879
(This is it.)

1874
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,889
- Am I doing it right?
- You can do it.

1875
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,189
(Two young members' perfect skipping)

1876
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,860
- Anyone can do it.
- Go ahead.

1877
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,429
(You can't do it.)

1878
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,990
- It looks strange.
- There's the cheerful vibe.

1879
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,030
I'm sorry, but are you AI?

1880
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,569
- You seem like one.
- I have one at home.

1881
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,570
- Really?
- Yes.

1882
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:46,270
Hey, don't talk to Seok Jin about youth.

1883
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:47,769
- Hey.
- Like I said earlier,

1884
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,170
- in order to be young...
- I...

1885
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,969
- He'll even eat poop.
- He'll even eat poop.

1886
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:52,339
(In order to be young, he'll even eat poop.)

1887
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,510
Since when were you so obsessed with youth?

1888
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:59,479
- Oh, no.
- Don't talk about youth.

1889
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,480
How did that happen?

1890
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:03,019
If people don't tell me that I look young,

1891
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,789
(Why did he become so obsessed with youth?)

1892
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,819
then I won't make the effort.

1893
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,020
But at one point...

1894
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:10,089
"You look like you're in your 40s."

1895
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,690
People began to tell me that.

1896
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,099
Do you know who says that often?

1897
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,030
- Read the room.
- Yang Se Chan.

1898
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,969
- He does it on purpose.
- Even if there are no cameras,

1899
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,400
he says that when we meet in the morning.

1900
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,270
"Seok Jin, you look like someone my age."

1901
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,069
- Does Se Chan say that?
- Yes.

1902
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,880
Doesn't he say that to speak to you casually?

1903
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,050
- Thank you.
- He wants to speak to you casually.

1904
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,210
(The croffle is ready as well.)

1905
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,919
I have a question.

1906
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,019
- What's that?
- What's this?

1907
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,919
Spaghetti?

1908
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,160
It's brown cheese, right?

1909
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,419
That's so much.

1910
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,329
I bet you don't know it because you aren't hip.

1911
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,660
(You can get a heap of it on the spoon.)

1912
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:49,500
(He takes a big bite with the cheese.)

1913
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:50,769
(My goodness)

1914
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:51,800
Seriously, this is...

1915
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:53,840
In this neighborhood, food is...

1916
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,300
- It's young.
- It's young.

1917
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,410
(Eating)

1918
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,779
(Oh, my!)

1919
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,009
The B.C. is insane.

1920
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,449
- Seok Jin, young people...
- "The B.C. is insane."

1921
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:06,080
- What's B.C.?
- He shortened "Brown cheese."

1922
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,480
"The B.C. is insane."

1923
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,850
- You understood me.
- Do you mean "Buchimgae?"

1924
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,520
B.C. Brown cheese.

1925
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,559
- He has a lot of self-love.
- That's right.

1926
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,660
(Seok Jin has a lot of self-love.)

1927
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,499
- I think you're right.
- He loves himself so much.

1928
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,799
(He admits it in a cool manner.)

1929
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,670
Kyung Pyo, I wouldn't change my face with yours.

1930
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,100
Me neither.

1931
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,200
I wouldn't change my face with yours.

1932
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,139
(That goes without saying.)

1933
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,169
What was that?

1934
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,479
(What was that comment?)

1935
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,810
No one asked you.

1936
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,209
- I wouldn't do it.
- You asked me just now.

1937
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,449
You asked me just now.

1938
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,419
Why did you ask Kyung Pyo that?

1939
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,190
I didn't ask, "Would you change your face with mine?"

1940
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,320
Why did you answer when I didn't ask?

1941
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:46,890
I think he's a bit sullen.

1942
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,019
You know, it's so funny.

1943
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,159
Seok Jin always fights against many.

1944
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,200
- I know.
- He's like Sirasoni.

1945
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,029
- You know...
- His nickname is Jeerasoni.

1946
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,269
He's Jeerasoni.

1947
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:57,800
He fights against three people.

1948
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,169
What matters is how old you appear to be, right?

1949
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,009
(Staring)

1950
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,010
Seok Jin.

1951
01:06:04,011 --> 01:06:06,310
MIYEON, why did you sit there?

1952
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,510
Please look at me as well.

1953
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,409
I keep leaning forward because of you, okay?

1954
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:12,419
(Seok Jin keeps obstructing his view.)

1955
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,480
(Laughing)

1956
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,720
I'm sorry.

1957
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,389
(Dong Hwi is good!)

1958
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,119
No matter how young I try to be,

1959
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,429
there are things I can't do.

1960
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,060
I can't read the room.

1961
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,489
No matter how young I try to be...

1962
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,500
(Seok Jin doesn't realize that Dong Hwi is copying him.)

1963
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,230
My stomach hurts from laughing.

1964
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,329
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1965
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:34,170
(They wrap up and move to the next location.)

1966
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,869
Thank you.

1967
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,039
- What should we do?
- Thank you.

1968
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,109
Take an umbrella.

1969
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,180
- It's raining a lot.
- Okay.

1970
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,309
Let's pay attention to the last place.

1971
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:43,380
- What kind of house will we see?
- The last place is the key.

1972
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,080
The previous places got me confused.

1973
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,120
This is hard.

1974
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,980
- Strange House.
- Strange House?

1975
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,350
- Strange House, right?
- House.

1976
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,720
Tang, tang, tang, hulu, hulu.

1977
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,530
(They sing in unison like it's the most natural thing.)

1978
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,330
It's an old alley.

1979
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,370
- That's right.
- It's atmospheric.

1980
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,570
Seriously, I...

1981
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:06,970
(They spot an old alley on the way to the place.)

1982
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,969
- Old houses.
- I used to play in such alleys.

1983
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,570
That's right. I also played in such alleys.

1984
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,839
My goodness.

1985
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,079
- Seriously, - It's an old barber shop.

1986
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,010
- An old salon.
- it's an old bathhouse building.

1987
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,679
- It's an inn.
- It's a bathhouse.

1988
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,779
- It looks cool.
- Such places are rare these days.

1989
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,920
- I know.
- You're right.

1990
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,949
(Homely signboards from the past)

1991
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,020
Barber shop.

1992
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,019
- Such places are rare.
- There's a bathhouse.

1993
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,360
(It's as if time had stopped in this alley.)

1994
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,760
I can smell it already.

1995
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,869
(What's Strange House in the university town in Gangbuk?)

1996
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:37,930
What's this?

1997
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,200
(What's this?)

1998
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,910
(A bathhouse?)

1999
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,540
- A bathhouse? Come on.
- No way.

2000
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,209
(At the end of the homely alley...)

2001
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:53,420
(is an old bathhouse.)

2002
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,819
Is that it? It looks so fake.

2003
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,490
- Indoor stall?
- It's fake.

2004
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:58,290
- It's too...
- It's fake.

2005
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,020
- Come on.
- It's fake.

2006
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,689
- Bathhouse and indoor stall?
- That's...

2007
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,429
It's fake, right?

2008
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:04,889
- It's...
- It's too...

2009
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,159
- It's too...
- It's fake.

2010
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,829
It's too easy. The fake one is obvious today.

2011
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:08,929
(Are there a bathhouse and an indoor stall in one place?)

2012
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:10,600
- It's too...
- It's fake.

2013
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,270
- It's too obvious.
- We found it.

2014
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,139
Seriously, it's fake.

2015
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,070
- We found it. It's fake.
- It's fake.

2016
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,479
It makes no sense.

2017
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,779
The bathhouse signboard is too new.

2018
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,079
It looks fake.

2019
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,620
(On top of that, the signboard is too clean.)

2020
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,090
(They enter carefully.)

2021
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,420
This place looks so fake.

2022
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:40,930
(At a glance, it looks like a regular bathhouse.)

2023
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,970
(They continue to go inside.)

2024
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,630
- What?
- This is...

2025
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,769
(It's full of tables!)

2026
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,010
This is...

2027
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:55,079
(When they enter,)

2028
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,909
(they see multiple tables.)

2029
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,249
It's an old bathhouse...

2030
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,419
that has been remodelled, right?

2031
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,190
(Is it an old bathhouse that has been turned into a pub?)

2032
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:04,920
Hey, there are celebrity autographs.

2033
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,920
- Saori.
- It's so strange.

2034
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,190
Um Ki Joon.

2035
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:10,759
He's famous.

2036
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,330
He's a famous musical actor.

2037
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,800
Saori from "Shooting Stars?"

2038
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,700
(Multiple celebrities have visited this place.)

2039
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,769
- Gosh, there's a bathhouse inside!
- Where? What?

2040
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,539
- Gosh, there's a bathhouse inside!
- Where?

2041
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:23,639
(Is there a bathhouse inside the pub?)

2042
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,640
- Is that a bathhouse?
- There's an actual bathhouse.

2043
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:25,870
Is that an actual bathhouse?

2044
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,609
This is a bit...

2045
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:29,180
- Is it a concept?
- This is...

2046
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,509
Is it a restaurant?

2047
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,750
- Oh, my.
- A pub?

2048
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,849
An old bathhouse has been turned into a pub.

2049
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,389
This is an actual bathhouse.

2050
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:39,390
(How does it look inside?)

2051
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,359
(When you pass the main hall of the pub...)

2052
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,890
(that used to be the changing room)

2053
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,729
Is it a restaurant? A pub?

2054
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,530
(A bathhouse and a pub?)

2055
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,669
(This place is a bathhouse pub.)

2056
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,330
You can take a shower, right?

2057
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,900
There's no water.

2058
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:00,240
(There's even a scrubbing bed that helped people feel refreshed.)

2059
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,580
(The old mural completes the memories of the past.)

2060
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,489
(Strange House, Bathhouse and pub)

2061
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:10,949
It isn't an actual bathhouse, right?

2062
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,219
This is an actual bathhouse.

2063
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,019
- Do people take a bath here?
- It makes no sense.

2064
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,219
They can't accept many customers.

2065
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,890
- This is...
- Seriously.

2066
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,289
- This is fake.
- But the kitchen...

2067
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,430
It makes no sense.

2068
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:22,229
But the kitchen...

2069
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,399
looks used.

2070
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,530
- Seriously.
- There's a kitchen.

2071
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:29,299
(Is there an actual kitchen next to the bath?)

2072
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,609
How can you eat...

2073
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:31,870
in such a humid place?

2074
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,580
"How can you eat in such a humid place?"

2075
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,550
- I think you can.
- Really?

2076
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,619
(I see.)

2077
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,749
What's inside?

2078
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,190
(They aren't done looking around the bathhouse.)

2079
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:44,620
Is this real?

2080
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:46,290
What's this? A sauna?

2081
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,860
- The sauna isn't working.
- It's a storage room.

2082
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,489
(There's a sauna as well.)

2083
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,490
- I think it's real.
- It's a storage room.

2084
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,590
It looks real.

2085
01:10:52,591 --> 01:10:53,960
- It looks real.
- Yes.

2086
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,159
Let's take a seat.

2087
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,630
(Feeling confused already, they take a seat.)

2088
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,439
This is...

2089
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,040
- a bit...
- The chairs are too uncomfortable.

2090
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,839
Drunk people...

2091
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,040
- are bound to trip over.
- The chairs are too uncomfortable.

2092
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:09,209
(Is the table too cramped for adult men?)

2093
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,249
It's too cramped, right?

2094
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,409
You can't eat here.

2095
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:12,580
You can't sit here.

2096
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,719
It's like a table for the bible studies.

2097
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,489
(Chuckling)

2098
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:17,519
- It's too...
- It's for the bible studies.

2099
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,720
The chairs look too fake.

2100
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,319
Is he the owner?

2101
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,390
- Hello.
- The owner.

2102
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,659
(The owner appears.)

2103
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,929
- He must be the owner.
- Hello.

2104
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,059
- Hello.
- Hello.

2105
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,259
Sir,

2106
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,330
how old is this pub?

2107
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,829
This pub is...

2108
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,300
three years old.

2109
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,170
- It's pretty old.
- It's pretty old.

2110
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,139
Sir, how did this place come to be?

2111
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,340
Was it originally a bathhouse?

2112
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,840
I ran the bathhouse for 20 years.

2113
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,779
- I ran the bathhouse for 20 years.
- You ran it.

2114
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:48,020
Because of the pandemic, I couldn't run it anymore.

2115
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,350
So I closed it down...

2116
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,150
and turned it into a pub.

2117
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:54,859
(In 2019, the pandemic hit the entire world.)

2118
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:56,959
(The bathhouse use was restricted...)

2119
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,230
(due to the rules on the mask and the number of people.)

2120
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,700
(In the end, the bathhouse took a fall in sales.)

2121
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,539
I began running a bathhouse...

2122
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:08,939
in 2001.

2123
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:13,140
In 2022, I closed it down due to the pandemic.

2124
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,939
My friend and I thought about...

2125
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,079
different things we could do.

2126
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,750
Because of the neighborhood...

2127
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,280
and my lack of experience in the foodservice industry,

2128
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,450
I felt like a regular pub won't draw in customers.

2129
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:28,920
So we kept the name as Bathhouse Indoor Pub.

2130
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,529
We kept the concept as it was...

2131
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,559
so that people would visit out of curiosity.

2132
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,030
That was how it started.

2133
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,700
The second floor isn't used anyway.

2134
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,639
So nothing has been altered.

2135
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,339
(It's still a neighborhood bathhouse in our memories.)

2136
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,939
When young customers visit,

2137
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,709
they don't come down for 20 to 30 minutes.

2138
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,550
They take photos...

2139
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,820
and lie down.

2140
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,920
(It's a photo spot for the Gen Zers.)

2141
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,890
(It's a popular place that's full of real reviews.)

2142
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,159
Sixth Sense members, is this place...

2143
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,459
real?

2144
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,399
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

2145
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,729
It must get hot in summer.

2146
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:11,000
Most customers...

2147
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:14,339
- eat in the hall.
- They eat outside.

2148
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,139
When the tables are full, they enter this room.

2149
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,140
But...

2150
01:13:18,141 --> 01:13:20,209
some young people want to eat here.

2151
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:23,109
- They want to upload photos.
- Yes.

2152
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,510
They take photos like this and upload them.

2153
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,249
That's right. Shall we take a photo and see how well it comes out?

2154
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,280
- That's right. A Gen Z shot.
- A Gen Z shot.

2155
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,249
Gen Zers don't look at the camera.

2156
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,350
They don't look at the camera.

2157
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,590
- Don't look at the camera.
- Okay.

2158
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,960
They capture the top of their heads.

2159
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,629
They capture the top of their heads.

2160
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,630
(It's called the aerial shot.)

2161
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,259
(Staring)

2162
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,169
Jae Seok, don't look at the camera.

2163
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,369
- Don't look at the camera.
- Don't look at the camera.

2164
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,800
- Don't do that.
- I looked.

2165
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,070
- I'm not a Gen Zer, after all.
- One, two, three.

2166
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,399
(She tries again.)

2167
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,070
(Turning his head)

2168
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,980
(He moves faster than anyone.)

2169
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,040
- He moved with desperation.
- You don't have much hair.

2170
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,980
The top of your head is showing.

2171
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,750
- Did it show?
- The top of your head.

2172
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,780
Who are you bowing to?

2173
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:05,090
- You shouldn't show your face.
- Go ahead and bow.

2174
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,460
(Seok Jin doesn't disappoint.)

2175
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,829
- I'm not sure. The Gen Z shot...
- Why?

2176
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:10,959
- isn't...
- It looks cute.

2177
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,600
It isn't so photogenic.

2178
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,429
(Is the place unsuitable for a Gen Z shot?)

2179
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:21,099
It isn't so photogenic.

2180
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,100
It's so...

2181
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,509
By the way, what's...

2182
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:26,069
the signature dish of this pub?

2183
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,280
(What's the signature dish?)

2184
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,840
The popular dishes are...

2185
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,949
- the squid jjamppong ramyeon, - Ramyeon.

2186
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:32,550
beef spicy noodles,

2187
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,620
and Bibigo mixed dumplings.

2188
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,519
- Bibigo mixed dumplings?
- Yes.

2189
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,620
- Bibigo?
- Bibigo dumplings?

2190
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,919
Yes, I use Bibigo dumplings.

2191
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,630
(Yes, I use Bibigo dumplings.)

2192
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,829
I use the products...

2193
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,860
people commonly eat at home...

2194
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,770
that are judged to be the tastiest.

2195
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,199
So I put the brand names on the menu.

2196
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,370
(He put the brand names on the menu.)

2197
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,969
These are the dishes I ate...

2198
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,310
when I drank at home.

2199
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,609
I modified those recipes...

2200
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:02,280
and developed the menu.

2201
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:04,609
(Ramyeon, noodles, dumplings)

2202
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:07,680
(The tastes of the past are coming soon.)

2203
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,919
Please give us those dishes.

2204
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,219
- The three dishes?
- Yes.

2205
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,720
- I'll prepare them.
- Thank you.

2206
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2207
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,660
- The owner...
- Why does he seem real?

2208
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:18,529
seems real.

2209
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:20,799
- He has no desire whatsoever...
- He is unfazed.

2210
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,529
- to promote the place.
- That's right.

2211
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:23,999
- He seems real.
- Seriously.

2212
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,700
- I think this place is real.
- He is so calm.

2213
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,269
- He doesn't have an actor's tone.
- No.

2214
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:31,210
- His voice is very low-pitched.
- I know.

2215
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,339
Actors have a loud voice.

2216
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,509
- They speak with energy.
- Yes.

2217
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:36,079
He doesn't speak with energy. He doesn't seem like an actor.

2218
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,810
That's why you always sound like you're acting.

2219
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,850
(Absorbed)

2220
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,149
I pass out when I go home.

2221
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,650
(He acts too passionately.)

2222
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,889
(The Dream Life of Mr. Jee)

2223
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:45,990
You know,

2224
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,119
he sells Bibigo dumplings.

2225
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,389
What's up with that?

2226
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:50,490
He's honest.

2227
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:53,359
(I see.)

2228
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,860
He could act like the dumplings aren't from Bibigo.

2229
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,129
But he says that he uses Bibigo.

2230
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,740
(Most of the menu items have the product names.)

2231
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,469
There are many pubs...

2232
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,969
that put the product names on the menu these days.

2233
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:08,609
Since Bibigo dumplings are tasty.

2234
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,009
- they specify the brand.
- Bibigo.

2235
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,779
- Yes.
- It's the new world.

2236
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,849
(The new world of pubs)

2237
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,680
Is it okay to turn a bathhouse into a pub?

2238
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,019
- Legally?
- Is it allowed?

2239
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,250
You have a point.

2240
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,819
How did he do that?

2241
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,919
(The combination of a bathhouse and a pub...)

2242
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,129
- A different purpose...
- It's this place.

2243
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,260
(was strange from the start.)

2244
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:31,569
(Is it possible to sell food at a bathhouse?)

2245
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:33,269
You just need to register it.

2246
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,369
- Really?
- Yes.

2247
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:37,669
If you register it as a restaurant, it's fine.

2248
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,470
You can change the building usage.

2249
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:42,510
Could it be fake?

2250
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:44,710
If it's registered as a restaurant, it's fine.

2251
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,579
It must be hard to move a stew...

2252
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,119
- or something like that.
- I know.

2253
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,520
Does it cost more...

2254
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,149
- to eat at this table?
- Is there an additional fee?

2255
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,490
- No.
- I see.

2256
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,689
It looks tasty.

2257
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,390
(Squid jjamppong ramyeon enters.)

2258
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,960
- It looks spicy.
- How much is it?

2259
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,629
- It's 13 dollars.
- It's 13 dollars.

2260
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,930
It's cheap.

2261
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,099
I use a big company product,

2262
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,339
but I add a whole squid.

2263
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,170
(A whole squid gets added.)

2264
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:14,979
For spiciness, I season the dish further...

2265
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,550
with spicy chili powder and other condiments.

2266
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,919
(Squid jjamppong ramyeon)

2267
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,150
(Big company ramyeon that contains various ingredients, 13 dollars)

2268
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,589
Thirteen dollars?

2269
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,549
- Look at this squid.
- It's so cheap.

2270
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,419
- There's a lot of seafood.
- Squids are expensive these days.

2271
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,420
Yes.

2272
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,730
- The price makes no sense.
- It's too cheap.

2273
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,990
The price makes no sense.

2274
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,429
- Isn't it expensive?
- Isn't seafood expensive?

2275
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:35,529
It's expensive.

2276
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:36,729
(The price makes no sense if you consider the seafood price.)

2277
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:39,100
- It looks so tasty.
- It isn't profitable.

2278
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:41,399
Think of it as seafood ramyeon.

2279
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,509
(He takes a piece of squid.)

2280
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,780
(Slurping)

2281
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,110
(Eating)

2282
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,380
- Gosh.
- It's tasty.

2283
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,019
- Let me try the squid.
- You know...

2284
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,020
(She eats as well.)

2285
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,190
- It's so tasty.
- It's so tasty.

2286
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,689
- This is...
- He added some chilis.

2287
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:02,959
It's spicy.

2288
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,760
(The Cheongyang chilis make the soup spicy.)

2289
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:08,429
- Seriously.
- It's so spicy and tasty.

2290
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,800
(Her eyes go wide.)

2291
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:11,800
- It's tasty.
- It's nice.

2292
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,899
- It's the best for soju lovers.
- Yes.

2293
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,400
It'll cure a hangover.

2294
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,640
It'll go down easily.

2295
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:18,040
It's the real deal.

2296
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,669
- Seriously.
- It's the real deal.

2297
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,740
(Have fun and cure a hangover with a spicy ramyeon.)

2298
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,679
- Here comes another dish.
- You love ramyeon so much.

2299
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,550
- It's the taste I like.
- Noodles.

2300
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,919
(My goodness)

2301
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,520
It looks tasty. Beef spicy noodles.

2302
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,790
- That's it.
- Please don't mix them.

2303
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,820
Put a piece of meat on the noodles and eat them.

2304
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:35,319
You shouldn't mix them.

2305
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,460
This place is real.

2306
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:38,859
It contains 200g of beef.

2307
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,729
The sauce doesn't contain MSG.

2308
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,229
I use gochujang, chili powder,

2309
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,469
garlic, sugar,

2310
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,200
soy sauce, and vinegar.

2311
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,069
These spicy noodles...

2312
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,999
don't come from a product. He made them.

2313
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,410
(Eat the noodles without mixing them.)

2314
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,970
- Gosh, all right.
- Those are the Bibigo dumplings.

2315
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,909
Put these vegetables on top of a dumpling...

2316
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:59,209
and eat them in one bite.

2317
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,080
(Bibigo mixed dumplings you eat with vegetables)

2318
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,389
(Bibigo mixed dumplings)

2319
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,890
(Big company dumplings and spicy vegetables, 14 dollars)

2320
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,959
Even the speed the food gets served is perfect.

2321
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,219
- This place is real.
- This place is real.

2322
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,459
- This place is real.
- The owner...

2323
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,589
- isn't rushed...
- I know.

2324
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,499
- or hesitant.
- Exactly.

2325
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,329
When he talked about the pandemic,

2326
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,900
his eyes became a bit moist.

2327
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:20,339
- I know.
- If that's...

2328
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,569
- fake...
- That story was so genuine.

2329
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:24,339
If that's fake, I'll be so upset.

2330
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,109
Perhaps they hired...

2331
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,880
the owner of a snack food place.

2332
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,409
- The owner of a different place?
- That's right.

2333
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,779
- You're right.
- You're right.

2334
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,049
- The owner of a restaurant.
- That's right.

2335
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,349
- Then he'll be able to cook.
- You're right.

2336
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:36,919
This is the food you get in the university town.

2337
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,189
- Look.
- You have a point.

2338
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,260
This isn't the food you get in the office area.

2339
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,329
(Is this a closed-down bathhouse...)

2340
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:46,560
(with the owner of a snack food place?)

2341
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,929
(Let's eat.)

2342
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:53,370
- There's space in the stomach.
- I know.

2343
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,970
I didn't even think about that.

2344
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,170
It's tasty.

2345
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:58,869
- Jae Seok, - The noodles are so tasty.

2346
01:19:58,870 --> 01:19:59,979
that's a bit...

2347
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,010
(Jae Seok, that's a bit...)

2348
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,179
- Hey, Jae Seok.
- You keep...

2349
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,209
emphasizing the youth.

2350
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,249
(Try it.)

2351
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,080
This passes.

2352
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,419
- It passes.
- It's so good!

2353
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,519
- Right.
- It passes.

2354
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,549
It feels like homemade banquet noodles.

2355
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,589
Right!

2356
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,760
(A taste that brings all generations together)

2357
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,260
First of all, as for the taste of the dish,

2358
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,930
it won't end here...

2359
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,299
- if a chef was involved.
- Right.

2360
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,430
- It would be fancier.
- Right.

2361
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:27,339
If this place were to be fake, a chef would've been asked...

2362
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,400
to make dishes that would suit a pub.

2363
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:31,340
A chef would never serve a dish like this.

2364
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:35,079
Their professionalism would not have been...

2365
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,179
- left out of the dish.
- Right.

2366
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,220
Right. So including the taste of the dish...

2367
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,650
Close in on me. I'm so sharp today.

2368
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:46,419
- What?
- How are you sharp?

2369
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,420
I just got goosebumps.

2370
01:20:47,421 --> 01:20:49,520
- Right.
- He was surprised by himself.

2371
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,299
He was surprised by himself?

2372
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,360
That's crazy.

2373
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,559
This is the last scene of "Detective Conan."

2374
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,300
(Immersed)

2375
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,899
(Appalled)

2376
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,339
- Your nose is sharp.
- How are you sharp?

2377
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,809
(Detective Yunan)

2378
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,869
So if this is fake,

2379
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:07,939
it wouldn't have ended here...

2380
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,179
as a dish...

2381
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,579
put together by a chef.

2382
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:11,680
He's right about that.

2383
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,749
For example, a special egg dish would've been placed on top.

2384
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:14,779
- A fancy decoration.
- It would've been fancier.

2385
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,120
Truffles would've been used.

2386
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:19,149
(Like the previous episodes,)

2387
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,919
(a fake place would've had a fancier dish.)

2388
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,489
It feels like it was made by a real owner.

2389
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:25,559
- Right.
- It's real.

2390
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,590
Right.

2391
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,199
(This place feels real!)

2392
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,600
(Real bar food that doesn't have a touch of a chef)

2393
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:35,570
- Why does this place feel fake?
- This isn't food for office areas.

2394
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,369
- This place feels fake?
- Yes.

2395
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,739
It feels that way once you get a hunch.

2396
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,980
Why does this place feel fake, MIYEON?

2397
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,449
Because everything feels so natural.

2398
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,549
(A place that feels suspicious as it's so natural)

2399
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:45,979
It feels fake because it feels so real?

2400
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,149
It feels like a lot of care was put into this place.

2401
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,379
Don't feel upset when I say this to you, MIYEON.

2402
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,520
That's a trap that rookies fall into.

2403
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,189
But in the end...

2404
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:55,690
"It feels fake because it feels so real."

2405
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,930
Many rookies...

2406
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,190
fall into this trap.

2407
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:00,959
That made a lot of sense though.

2408
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,670
- Really?
- I think I went in too deep.

2409
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,229
"Don't feel upset when I say this to you."

2410
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,099
You all know that means it's going to be upsetting, right?

2411
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,100
(Choking)

2412
01:22:09,101 --> 01:22:11,110
Indeed. That's 120 percent true.

2413
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:12,710
- Right.
- Also,

2414
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,540
this is a term that I don't understand the most.

2415
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,080
"I may be wrong, but..."

2416
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,410
Starting a sentence with that...

2417
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,880
means the speaker doesn't know anything.

2418
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,919
(He's right.)

2419
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,049
The speaker is usually wrong,

2420
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,290
but that happens often.

2421
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,419
- Then...
- I had no other choice.

2422
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,329
it feels like the first place is fake today, right?

2423
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,860
The first place feels fake.

2424
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,230
But...

2425
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:36,969
(Strange Room)

2426
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:39,129
(The internet cafe with a rotisserie machine is fake?)

2427
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,000
But actually, I heard about the first place...

2428
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,100
from Haha.

2429
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:44,809
- That's what's weird.
- That's what's weird.

2430
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,939
Getting a sudden call like that...

2431
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,779
- That feels suspicious.
- It wasn't a call.

2432
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:50,850
It was during a break when we were at a shoot.

2433
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,880
I think that was when it happened. I'm not exactly sure.

2434
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:54,379
We were talking about internet cafes...

2435
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,890
and he said, "Internet cafes even have rotisserie chicken."

2436
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:59,520
But that feels so awkward.

2437
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:04,559
He said it was fascinating to see it when he visited.

2438
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,029
I think Sang Yeob mentioned it recently as well.

2439
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:09,559
(Sang Yeob mentioned it recently as well?)

2440
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,730
They're all close.

2441
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:12,700
They're all close.

2442
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,570
Right. Our producer...

2443
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:18,409
- No way.
- knows Sang Yeob...

2444
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,569
- and Haha as well.
- Right.

2445
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,379
- Right.
- They went that far for this?

2446
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:24,110
If someone who didn't have any connections said that,

2447
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,779
- it would've made more sense.
- It does feel very awkward.

2448
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,219
- But they're all close.
- It wasn't out of nowhere.

2449
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,720
- It didn't feel strange.
- Really?

2450
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:32,020
It must be real, as they brought it up naturally.

2451
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,090
(A real internet cafe that just started to gain popularity?)

2452
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:39,259
They must've been asked to talk about it naturally.

2453
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,199
(Or is it a move by the crew to trick the members?)

2454
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,900
If the production crew did that on purpose...

2455
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:46,470
to ask the two to trick Seok Jin,

2456
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,369
they played a sly move. They didn't target us...

2457
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:50,870
and only targeted Seok Jin.

2458
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,269
So...

2459
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,340
(Laughing)

2460
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,609
This was their plan.

2461
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:57,079
(This was their plan.)

2462
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,180
They went for the weakest one.

2463
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,219
They went for the one who gets easily shaken.

2464
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,349
That's not it.

2465
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:02,549
- Haha brought it up.
- When you weren't here,

2466
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,249
- they went after her.
- Right.

2467
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,489
- They went after Mimi.
- Right.

2468
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:06,959
They kept trying to shake me up.

2469
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,689
After making your deduction, we will walk to the final spot...

2470
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,289
which is a minute away.

2471
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,589
- Hold on. This is too hard.
- I have no idea.

2472
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,399
- I don't have a clue.
- I really have no idea.

2473
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,599
What if we get it wrong again today?

2474
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,099
If we get it wrong three times in a row,

2475
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,229
- Has that never happened before?
- the viewers...

2476
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:20,639
- won't let this go.
- Right.

2477
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,699
Is that so? Will they get upset about it?

2478
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,700
"Enough is enough."

2479
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:24,009
- "Enough is enough." - "Enough is enough."

2480
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,109
"Stop pretending not to know the answer."

2481
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,210
- The viewers won't know though.
- We really don't know.

2482
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,909
But it's not easy to pretend not to know the answer...

2483
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:29,940
three times in a row.

2484
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,879
- That's hard to do.
- We're just terrible at this.

2485
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,349
- We're being truthful.
- We're not pretending.

2486
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:35,779
- We're not pretending.
- Right.

2487
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,620
The title of the show should be changed.

2488
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,290
"I May Be Wrong."

2489
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,120
"I May Be Wrong."

2490
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:42,690
"I May Be Wrong."

2491
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,189
It should be changed to "I May Be Wrong."

2492
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,359
- Not "Sixth Sense." - Right.

2493
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,230
(Uncomfortable place to drink, natural owner, realistic food)

2494
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:51,100
- Which place do you think it is?
- I have no idea!

2495
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:53,229
It's confusing the more you think about it.

2496
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,339
I'm totally lost.

2497
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,940
(Time for the final decision)

2498
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,440
- It's time to decide.
- I have no idea.

2499
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:00,409
We can't get it wrong three times in a row.

2500
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:02,479
- That can't happen.
- I feel clueless.

2501
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,580
What do we do?

2502
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,779
I think we'll have different opinions today.

2503
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,780
As for me...

2504
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:08,380
- We'll have different opinions.
- What do you think?

2505
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,390
- I think the first place is fake.
- Really?

2506
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:12,850
One vote for the first place.

2507
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:16,420
(A hidden secret in the strange internet cafe)

2508
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:20,059
(It's hard to believe even though it's right before their eyes.)

2509
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:23,799
(There's a rotisserie machine in the internet cafe?)

2510
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,029
(Strange Room)

2511
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,769
(The internet cafe with a rotisserie machine is fake?)

2512
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:29,899
- What about you, Dong Hwi?
- As I mentioned earlier,

2513
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,709
I think the internet cafe is fake.

2514
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:32,810
Really?

2515
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:34,880
There are 2 votes for the 1st place.

2516
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,779
- What about you, Seok Sam?
- The second place.

2517
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,109
- What?
- We're splitting up like this?

2518
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,010
The second place felt real,

2519
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,920
but I had to clear away the places that felt even more real.

2520
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,190
The second place ended up becoming my choice.

2521
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,890
(My own snack will be turned into a taco?)

2522
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:55,660
(The Gen Mzers were attracted by its looks and taste.)

2523
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,769
(Strange Space)

2524
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,900
(Mexican Walking Taco made by snacks)

2525
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,740
- What about you, MIYEON?
- The third place.

2526
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,510
Okay.

2527
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:09,940
(There's a bar in a tub?)

2528
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,949
(A big transformation of the closed down bathhouse)

2529
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:17,719
(Strange House, bathhouse bar)

2530
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,890
- What about you, Mimi?
- The first place.

2531
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,790
The internet cafe gets three votes.

2532
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,289
The first place feels fake?

2533
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:24,929
- I'm telling you it's real.
- The first place is fake.

2534
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:25,930
I heard about it.

2535
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,029
Everything you heard was fake.

2536
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:30,470
- That felt off.
- You were fooled by their lies.

2537
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:32,530
You kept saying from the start that the first place felt fake, right?

2538
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,999
As soon as I tried the chicken with cream cheese,

2539
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,139
I was reminded of the kimchi bomb chicken...

2540
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,209
from Suwon.

2541
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,709
I thought it was made by the same chef.

2542
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:42,009
- Really?
- That came into mind.

2543
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:44,149
There were also three different sauces.

2544
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:45,710
That's something a chef would do.

2545
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:46,950
- Gosh!
- So...

2546
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:48,519
- That was sharp.
- Right.

2547
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,279
- Pork belly.
- And on top of that,

2548
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,819
I thought it wouldn't be profitable with that price.

2549
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,319
Right. It didn't make sense.

2550
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,390
- It's sold at that price?
- It would be profitable.

2551
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,029
- Sorry?
- It would be profitable.

2552
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:58,659
I'm totally lost.

2553
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,089
- It would be profitable?
- Trust me.

2554
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,800
- You were fooled.
- I was told about it.

2555
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,599
I'm totally lost.

2556
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,699
What about you, Kyung Pyo?

2557
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,469
- I will also go with number one.
- Right.

2558
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,870
We have to go with that one today.

2559
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,439
So are you saying the ones that told me about it were won over?

2560
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,469
You never know.

2561
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,009
They were definitely won over.

2562
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:15,210
I think so too.

2563
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,079
- They're that sly?
- I think so too.

2564
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,080
You never know.

2565
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:19,379
Will you go with number one by majority?

2566
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,380
- Yes.
- Number one.

2567
01:27:20,381 --> 01:27:21,649
- Here we go.
- Today,

2568
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,049
- we'll go by majority.
- Right.

2569
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:24,549
- Right.
- By majority.

2570
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,719
It isn't the first place.

2571
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,720
(Frustrated)

2572
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:28,259
So you all have chosen number one.

2573
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:30,119
See! He's trying to move things quickly.

2574
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,230
I'm telling you it's not the first place!

2575
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,889
I said I was told about it.

2576
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:34,229
It can't be helped though.

2577
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:35,230
- Fine.
- Right.

2578
01:27:35,231 --> 01:27:37,200
- Number 1!
- I think it's number 2.

2579
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,969
The answer will be revealed.

2580
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,470
What if we get it wrong again?

2581
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,999
I'm feeling anxious again.

2582
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,440
My heart is beating so fast!

2583

(Third Sixth Sense Tour)

2584
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,609
(University area in Gangbuk)

2585
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:47,809
We got it wrong for two weeks straight.

2586
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:50,080
- We have to get it right this week.
- Right.

2587
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,549
If we get it wrong for the third time...

2588
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,850
(There are strange things in the university area in Gangbuk.)

2589

"The strange university area."

2590
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:59,020
It's almost empty at around 7 or 8pm.

2591
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:02,020
It could be quite dangerous.

2592
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,790
I decided to never do it the second time.

2593
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:07,259
- Let's see!
- My heart is beating so fast!

2594
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,330
Let's see.

2595
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,030
Please!

2596
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:12,029

- Strange House!
- Strange House!

2601
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,610
Actually, there wasn't a place that felt fake today.

2603
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:25,749
It was so hard today.

2604
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,979
(A place where you can enjoy games and rotisserie chicken)

2605
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:29,579
Gosh, it's so hard.

2606
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,650
(Top-tier internet cafe)

2607
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:33,759
I'm telling you. I was told about this place.

2608
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,159
I heard that there was an internet cafe...

2609
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,759
that sold rotisserie chicken.

2610
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,029
(All snacks, come to me.)

2611
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:41,430
The production crew is doing amazing these days.

2612
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,529
They're too intense!

2613
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,999
(Walking taco in Gangbuk)

2614
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,029
(Strange Space, custom-made Mexican tacos)

2615
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,340
The second place? Could this place be fake?

2616
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,240
I'm telling you this place is fake.

2617
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,780
- Number two is fake.
- They didn't even have a menu.

2618
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,309
(Is this a bathhouse or a bar?)

2619
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:57,649
Oh, please!

2620
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,749
- It can't be number 3.
- Number 3!

2621
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,050
It's number three!

2622
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,920
(Strange House, bathhouse bar)

2623
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,949
Now that I think about it, number three feels off.

2624
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:07,020
Gosh!

2625
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,559
(It wasn't easy once again, was it?)

2626
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,889
It really wasn't easy.

2627
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:11,259
It wasn't easy? I have no idea at all.

2628
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:16,760
(Which is the one place that is fake?)

2629
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,530
All right!

2630
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,999
- Let's get it right today!
- Please!

2631
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,040
(Which is the one place that is fake?)

2632
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:26,439
I heard about the first place!

2633
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,440
(Or will they fail once again?)

2634
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:34,380
(Which is the one place that is fake?)

2635
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,349
My gosh!

2636
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:37,820
- Number 3 felt off!
- It's number 2, isn't it?

2637
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,689
It must be number two.

2638
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:42,389
(Or will there be a twist?)

2639
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,960
(Which is the one place that is fake?)

2640
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,269
My gosh!

2641
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:47,270
(Is the rotisserie internet cafe the fake place?)

2642
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:48,840
- Number 3 felt off!
- It's number 2, isn't it?

2643
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:50,499
It must be number two.

2644
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,069
(Or will there be a twist?)

2645
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,440
(Which is the one place that is fake?)

2646
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,579
(Strange Room, rotisserie internet cafe,)

2647
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,380
(Fake)

2648
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:04,149
(We finally got it right!)

2649
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,319
(Cheering)

2650
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,360
(Yes!)

2651
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:08,719
- Number 3 felt off!
- It's number 2, isn't it?

2652
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,259
(No!)

2653
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,630
- Number 3 felt off!
- It's number 2, isn't it?

2654
01:30:16,928 --> 01:30:17,928
I got it right too!

2655
01:30:17,929 --> 01:30:20,327
See! I was right!

2656
01:30:20,328 --> 01:30:22,468
- What did you say, Seok Jin?
- My gosh.

2657
01:30:22,768 --> 01:30:24,807
I heard about it! What happened?

2658
01:30:24,808 --> 01:30:27,208
- What was that about?
- Why was number three like that?

2659
01:30:27,508 --> 01:30:29,638
- What happened, Seok Jin?
- Was I fooled?

2660
01:30:29,878 --> 01:30:31,378
- My gosh.
- No way!

2661
01:30:31,548 --> 01:30:33,177
I know what it feels like as I've been there before.

2662
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,578
It felt real.

2663
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:36,117
(I want to hide.)

2664
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:37,317
- I thought...
- We saw it earlier.

2665
01:30:37,318 --> 01:30:38,348
Exactly.

2666
01:30:38,588 --> 01:30:40,587
Then what was originally there?

2667
01:30:40,588 --> 01:30:41,718
(What is the identity of the rotisserie internet cafe?)

2668
01:30:41,858 --> 01:30:44,627
(In the corner of a regular internet cafe,)

2669
01:30:44,628 --> 01:30:46,027
(there's rotisserie chicken being grilled?)

2670
01:30:46,028 --> 01:30:47,758
So that was made?

2671
01:30:48,798 --> 01:30:49,827
(How did this internet cafe come to life?)

2672
01:30:49,828 --> 01:30:51,428
Gosh, I think that will actually work.

2673
01:30:51,498 --> 01:30:52,597
Exactly.

2674
01:30:52,598 --> 01:30:54,768
I would've never imagined that.

2675
01:30:55,898 --> 01:30:58,367
(Domestic economic stagnation carried on.)

2676
01:30:58,368 --> 01:31:01,108
(Small business owners suffered even more.)

2677
01:31:01,578 --> 01:31:02,677
(Around 1 million places closed down in 2025.)

2678
01:31:02,678 --> 01:31:04,708
Business owners really struggled.

2679
01:31:05,278 --> 01:31:07,548
(The business category that suffered the most)

2680
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:09,277
("Economic Slump Forced Out 490,000 Bars and Internet Cafes")

01:31:09,278 --> 01:31:10,787
("Decline in Internet Cafes, 34 Percent in 5 Years")

2682
01:31:10,788 --> 01:31:12,687
(The internet cafe industry encountered a crisis.)

2683
01:31:12,688 --> 01:31:15,057
- Internet cafes struggled.
- Right.

2684
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:16,317
They went through so much trouble.

2685
01:31:16,318 --> 01:31:18,627
(To give the internet cafe industry a little bit of hope,)

2686
01:31:18,628 --> 01:31:21,598
(Sixth Sense will make one that never existed before.)

2687
01:31:21,798 --> 01:31:23,858
(An internet cafe was found in a university area.)

2688
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:25,798
(Down to the basement following the stairs...)

2689
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,737
It was really nice.

2690
01:31:27,738 --> 01:31:28,838
(It's nice and clean inside.)

2691
01:31:29,038 --> 01:31:31,368
(However,)

2692
01:31:32,638 --> 01:31:33,807
(there are barely any customers.)

2693
01:31:33,808 --> 01:31:35,037
There are no customers.

2694
01:31:35,038 --> 01:31:37,478
I see. But it's such a good internet cafe.

2695
01:31:37,678 --> 01:31:39,948
There was an internet cafe here before we came.

2696
01:31:40,148 --> 01:31:42,878
I'm aware that they closed down with the loss of customers.

2697
01:31:43,618 --> 01:31:44,717
(There was an internet cafe here since 2020.)

2698
01:31:44,718 --> 01:31:45,787
(However, economic struggles forced owners to close down.)

2699
01:31:45,788 --> 01:31:47,888
So many owners closed down in this area.

2700
01:31:48,988 --> 01:31:50,357
It was opened in July?

2701
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:51,588
It hasn't been that long.

2702
01:31:51,828 --> 01:31:53,358
It's a fairly new internet cafe.

2703
01:31:54,058 --> 01:31:56,697
I'm the producer of Sixth Sense: City Tour.

2704
01:31:56,698 --> 01:31:57,767
- It's great to see you.
- Hello.

2705
01:31:57,768 --> 01:32:00,197
I used to be in the restaurant industry.

2706
01:32:00,198 --> 01:32:02,767
The company motto is to provide...

2707
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:05,207
cheap and healthy food to students.

2708
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:06,367
That's the CEO?

2709
01:32:06,368 --> 01:32:08,677
Any possible issues with the ingredients...

2710
01:32:08,678 --> 01:32:10,378
are dealt with directly by the company.

2711
01:32:10,638 --> 01:32:12,748
Anything that is thought to be risky isn't made from the start.

2712
01:32:13,008 --> 01:32:15,217
We would be willing to do this even if more is needed.

2713
01:32:15,218 --> 01:32:16,847
Even if we have to pay more for it.

2714
01:32:16,848 --> 01:32:18,588
Along with your original company motto,

2715
01:32:18,688 --> 01:32:20,488
I think we will be a great match.

2716
01:32:21,358 --> 01:32:22,587
(What would the students like?)

2717
01:32:22,588 --> 01:32:24,088
That's amazing.

2718
01:32:24,788 --> 01:32:27,797
Rotisserie chicken.

2719
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:30,497
The ones you see on the streets.

2720
01:32:30,498 --> 01:32:31,797
Gosh, that was a great idea.

2721
01:32:31,798 --> 01:32:33,927
Along with pork belly,

2722
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:35,298
it would seem quite attracting.

2723
01:32:35,438 --> 01:32:36,597
(Internet cafe)

2724
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:38,467
- That's amazing.
- That's truly amazing.

(Rotisserie machine)

2726
01:32:41,108 --> 01:32:42,807
Is it really sold at that price?

2727
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,647
- Yes.
- Really?

2728
01:32:44,648 --> 01:32:46,447
- Are you serious?
- It's being sold at that price.

2729
01:32:46,448 --> 01:32:47,478
(Amazed)

2730
01:32:47,748 --> 01:32:49,348
That's truly amazing!

2731
01:32:49,618 --> 01:32:51,147
(Let's install the rotisserie machine.)

2732
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:52,948
Was the wall knocked down for this?

2733
01:32:53,488 --> 01:32:55,587
(The production crew spotted a wall on one side.)

2734
01:32:55,588 --> 01:32:57,458
- That's gone now, right?
- That wall was knocked down.

2735
01:32:58,858 --> 01:33:04,228
(All procedures were done safely after consulting a professional.)

2736
01:33:04,428 --> 01:33:06,127
(The wall was knocked down.)

2737
01:33:06,128 --> 01:33:07,797
It was completely knocked down.

2738
01:33:07,798 --> 01:33:09,337
That's amazing!

2739
01:33:09,338 --> 01:33:11,837
(It's now ready to embrace the rotisserie machine!)

2740
01:33:11,838 --> 01:33:15,708
(The rotisserie machine is now on its way.)

2741
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:19,147
Gosh, this is a big shock to me.

2742
01:33:19,148 --> 01:33:20,577
(The custom-made machine gets installed.)

2743
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:23,578
(For a safe cooking environment,)

2744
01:33:24,218 --> 01:33:26,387
Everything was made to fit into place.

2745
01:33:26,388 --> 01:33:28,457
(the ventilation fan was installed to release the heat and smoke.)

2746
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:30,588
(That is how it came to life.)

2747
01:33:31,788 --> 01:33:34,697
(Cooked in 200°C for 1 hour)

2748
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:35,797
No way!

2749
01:33:35,798 --> 01:33:37,057
- That was fake?
- That's impressive.

(Rotisserie chicken)

(An extraordinary supporter to add a special taste)

2753

Who is it?

2754
01:33:46,508 --> 01:33:48,177
- Who is it?
- It's her!

2755
01:33:48,178 --> 01:33:50,637
Hello. I'm well known as the Schoolfood Master.

2756
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:52,347
My name is Lee Mi Young. It's a pleasure to meet you.

2757
01:33:52,348 --> 01:33:53,608
That's amazing.

2758
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:57,277
I've been serving school meals for 17 years...

2759
01:33:57,278 --> 01:33:58,718
and I retired recently.

2760
01:33:59,448 --> 01:34:00,588
(Schoolfood Master, Chef Lee Mi Young)

2761
01:34:00,918 --> 01:34:02,157
That was why it was good.

2762
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:03,218
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

2763
01:34:03,288 --> 01:34:05,987
Instead of just having the rotisserie chicken,

2764
01:34:05,988 --> 01:34:08,097
I see the need for various types of sauces.

2765
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:10,558
The sauces that can be enjoyed with the chicken.

2766
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,297
No wonder!

2767
01:34:12,298 --> 01:34:14,028
- I guess that right!
- Really?

2768
01:34:14,168 --> 01:34:15,667
- I said that earlier!
- You're right.

2769
01:34:15,668 --> 01:34:16,867
She's a genius.

2770
01:34:16,868 --> 01:34:18,338
She has an incredible sense of taste.

2771
01:34:19,508 --> 01:34:20,708
You should call yourself Mitaste.

2772
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:22,408
Mitaste instead of Mimi?

2773
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:23,877
- Mitaste?
- Right.

2774
01:34:23,878 --> 01:34:26,347
- You should be called Mitaste.
- That sounds a bit weird.

2775
01:34:26,348 --> 01:34:27,578
(Mitaste instead of Mimi)

2776
01:34:27,818 --> 01:34:29,818
I will use our country's traditional doenjang.

2777
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:32,317
The sauces were really good.

2778
01:34:32,318 --> 01:34:33,318
(She started making simple and healthy sauces for the students.)

2779
01:34:33,319 --> 01:34:36,358
Spicy, sweet, and sour!

2780
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:38,957
(Spicy, sweet, and sour dipping sauce)

2781
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:41,158
- She mentioned the three sauces.
- Right.

2782
01:34:41,298 --> 01:34:43,698
Young people these days...

2783
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:45,797
love eating cheese.

2784
01:34:45,798 --> 01:34:47,467
I should call myself Misharp.

2785
01:34:47,468 --> 01:34:49,098
(Even the cream cheese sauce is ready.)

2786
01:34:49,168 --> 01:34:51,267
No wonder it was so good. Gosh, there it is!

2787
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:52,537
(The rotisserie chicken and sauce set is complete.)

2788
01:34:52,538 --> 01:34:54,377
- It was so good.
- Right.

2789
01:34:54,378 --> 01:34:55,437
It was really good.

2790
01:34:55,438 --> 01:34:57,748
(The rotisserie dishes start getting sold.)

2791
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,177
They're offered in such great deals.

2792
01:35:00,178 --> 01:35:01,178
- That's amazing.
- Right.

2793
01:35:01,818 --> 01:35:03,417
(Orders flooded in as soon as they were listed.)

2794
01:35:03,418 --> 01:35:05,317
That's a whole new world of internet cafe food.

2795
01:35:05,318 --> 01:35:06,447
(The rotisserie internet cafe open was a great success.)

2796
01:35:06,448 --> 01:35:08,518
- Right.
- The orders flooded in.

2797
01:35:08,718 --> 01:35:10,217
(The internet cafe became a hot place after its open.)

2798
01:35:10,218 --> 01:35:12,388
- There are a lot of customers.
- Right.

2799
01:35:13,328 --> 01:35:18,028
(It went wild on social media as well.)

2800
01:35:19,098 --> 01:35:20,497
Anyone would love this place.

2801
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:22,898
(Actual social media response)

2802
01:35:23,038 --> 01:35:26,007
- Haha could've seen that post.
- Right.

2803
01:35:26,008 --> 01:35:27,738
I would've also been really confused if I saw that.

2804
01:35:28,438 --> 01:35:30,237
(This isn't it!)

2805
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:31,908
This isn't it? I told you!

2806
01:35:32,048 --> 01:35:33,278
- I told you!
- Are you serious?

2807
01:35:34,618 --> 01:35:35,817
Excuse me.

2808
01:35:35,818 --> 01:35:37,748
- Who is it?
- Gosh!

2809
01:35:37,948 --> 01:35:40,417
- Hey!
- Brother!

2810
01:35:40,418 --> 01:35:42,258
(Their voices sound familiar.)

2811
01:35:43,018 --> 01:35:44,257
- It's Haha.
- Hey!

2812
01:35:44,258 --> 01:35:45,287
(Why are Im Woo Il and Haha here?)

2813
01:35:45,288 --> 01:35:46,458
Woo Il as well?

2814
01:35:46,728 --> 01:35:47,958
- It's Haha.
- Hey!

2815
01:35:48,228 --> 01:35:50,198
(They fooled me.)

2816
01:35:50,258 --> 01:35:51,827
There are two things to keep in mind.

2817
01:35:51,828 --> 01:35:55,298
Here's the first one. When you press "order,"

2818
01:35:55,738 --> 01:35:58,237
- get the cream cheese chicken.
- Cream cheese chicken.

2819
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:01,007
- There's also the pork belly.
- Okay.

2820
01:36:01,008 --> 01:36:02,637
You have to say things like,

2821
01:36:02,638 --> 01:36:04,407
- "There are all sorts of things." - Got it.

2822
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:08,347
(The internet cafe appears often in Haha YouTube channel.)

2823
01:36:08,348 --> 01:36:13,787
(He was asked to do a shoot in the fake internet cafe.)

2824
01:36:13,788 --> 01:36:15,487
Actually, a fake video was uploaded yesterday...

2825
01:36:15,488 --> 01:36:17,558
to trick the viewers.

2826
01:36:17,858 --> 01:36:19,888
- It was uploaded yesterday?
- To trick the viewers.

2827
01:36:20,028 --> 01:36:22,027
Even the viewers were tricked?

2828
01:36:22,028 --> 01:36:23,057
- Awesome!
- Gosh!

2829
01:36:23,058 --> 01:36:24,667
- Haha did that?
- They're so thorough.

2830
01:36:24,668 --> 01:36:27,397
- Gosh, Sixth Sense...
- That's just amazing.

2831
01:36:27,398 --> 01:36:29,797
(September 18, 2025)

2832
01:36:29,798 --> 01:36:32,937
(A short-form video was uploaded on Haha's social media page.)

2833
01:36:32,938 --> 01:36:34,978
A short-form video was made with this internet cafe.

2834
01:36:35,038 --> 01:36:36,578
I just got goosebumps.

2835
01:36:36,808 --> 01:36:39,577
They have barbecue dishes here.

2836
01:36:39,578 --> 01:36:40,977
- Barbecue dishes?
- Right.

2837
01:36:40,978 --> 01:36:42,117
Gosh, what?

2838
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:46,118
(The short-form video seemed completely real.)

2839
01:36:47,618 --> 01:36:50,657
(The viewers were successfully tricked.)

2840
01:36:50,658 --> 01:36:51,758
No way.

2841
01:36:52,388 --> 01:36:54,928
Come on. Did you have to go that far?

2842
01:36:55,398 --> 01:36:56,997
If I came across that,

2843
01:36:56,998 --> 01:36:58,828
I would've never guessed it to be fake.

2844
01:36:58,968 --> 01:37:00,997
Why did he bring it up with me then?

2845
01:37:00,998 --> 01:37:02,197
(Why did he bring it up with me?)

2846
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:04,707
- That's the first request.
- Right.

2847
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:07,107
The next one is during the "Running Man" shoot.

2848
01:37:07,108 --> 01:37:09,238
- You should fool Seok Jin.
- The "Running Man" shoot.

2849
01:37:09,508 --> 01:37:10,607
Gosh.

2850
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:12,707
He talks about internet cafes often though.

2851
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:13,747
(Fake information was spread out through Haha.)

2852
01:37:13,748 --> 01:37:15,977
- You should bring it up.
- I'll tell Se Chan about it.

2853
01:37:15,978 --> 01:37:16,978
Se Chan?

2854
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:18,817
He might figure it out if I tell him.

2855
01:37:18,818 --> 01:37:20,787
- Then you should tell Se Chan.
- Right.

2856
01:37:20,788 --> 01:37:22,017
Nice one.

2857
01:37:22,018 --> 01:37:23,057
(The scenario was adjusted for Seok Jin.)

2858
01:37:23,058 --> 01:37:24,658
- It'll be a double-team move.
- Right.

2859
01:37:24,788 --> 01:37:26,087
So all of that was planned?

2860
01:37:26,088 --> 01:37:27,457
(Dumbfounded)

2861
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,557
Awesome.

2862
01:37:28,558 --> 01:37:30,357
I won't talk about it at all.

2863
01:37:30,358 --> 01:37:32,528
- Okay.
- I'll make Se Chan do it.

2864
01:37:32,968 --> 01:37:33,997
(The production crew starts the plan.)

2865
01:37:33,998 --> 01:37:35,537
- That's amazing.
- No way.

2866
01:37:35,538 --> 01:37:36,797
"Dear Haha."

2867
01:37:36,798 --> 01:37:38,167
(The production crew starts the plan.)

2868
01:37:38,168 --> 01:37:39,337
(I talked about it a lot last week. More of it will make it weird.)

2869
01:37:39,338 --> 01:37:40,737
"More of it will make it weird."

2870
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:42,207
Right. It was brought up just once.

2871
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:44,577
I don't tend to listen to things in great detail.

2872
01:37:44,578 --> 01:37:46,277
(There's one shot left.)

2873
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,507
- Right.
- Sang Yeob as well?

2874
01:37:47,508 --> 01:37:49,318
- Sang Yeob was in this too.
- Gosh!

2875
01:37:49,518 --> 01:37:52,917
We made a fake place.

2876
01:37:52,918 --> 01:37:54,587
Are you still being like that?

2877
01:37:54,588 --> 01:37:55,887
(He went through this before.)

2878
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:57,188
- So...
- Sang Yeob?

2879
01:37:57,418 --> 01:37:58,857
That's amazing.

2880
01:37:58,858 --> 01:38:00,028
They're so detailed.

2881
01:38:00,228 --> 01:38:01,927
(Filmed by Sang Yeob's phone)

2882
01:38:01,928 --> 01:38:05,898
These days, there's an internet cafe that sells rotisserie chicken.

2883
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:08,197
- There's a rotisserie machine.
- It looks so natural.

2884
01:38:08,198 --> 01:38:09,368
I heard it was crazy good.

2885
01:38:09,668 --> 01:38:11,407
- Really?
- An internet cafe?

2886
01:38:11,408 --> 01:38:13,737
(He was already brainwashed by Haha.)

2887
01:38:13,738 --> 01:38:16,108
I remembered what I heard from Haha.

2888
01:38:16,678 --> 01:38:18,208
It popped up in my head.

2889
01:38:21,518 --> 01:38:22,877
(Mission complete)

2890
01:38:22,878 --> 01:38:25,248
- Gosh, look at him smile!
- Sang Yeob!

2891
01:38:25,518 --> 01:38:27,188
- Jae Seok.
- Seok Jin.

2892
01:38:27,388 --> 01:38:28,558
- Fell for it, haven't you?
- Fell for it, haven't you?

2893
01:38:30,118 --> 01:38:33,628
- It was perfectly set up!
- Gosh, look at those two.

2894
01:38:33,758 --> 01:38:35,227
- Sixth Sense, - Sixth Sense,

2895
01:38:35,228 --> 01:38:37,158
- these dishes are fake.
- these dishes are fake.

2896
01:38:39,168 --> 01:38:41,167
(They all went through so much work!)

2897
01:38:41,168 --> 01:38:43,037
(Feeling lost)

2898
01:38:43,038 --> 01:38:44,268
That got me good!

2899
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:45,868
I can't trust anyone now.

2900
01:38:46,008 --> 01:38:48,937
- See? That's what happens!
- Why me?

2901
01:38:48,938 --> 01:38:50,307
Why target Seok Jin?

2902
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:51,308
(Why target Seok Sam?)

2903
01:38:51,309 --> 01:38:52,507
I see why.

2904
01:38:52,508 --> 01:38:55,278
You're going for Seok Jin now after Mimi.

2905
01:38:55,578 --> 01:38:58,318
The original members knew too much.

2906
01:38:58,548 --> 01:39:00,047
They went for the weak one.

2907
01:39:00,048 --> 01:39:01,258
It worked out perfectly.

2908
01:39:02,718 --> 01:39:04,087
I won't fall for it twice.

2909
01:39:04,088 --> 01:39:05,127
(The presence of the one with experience)

2910
01:39:05,128 --> 01:39:06,187
Congratulations.

2911
01:39:06,188 --> 01:39:07,727
The one who gets selected will receive a coffee truck.

2912
01:39:07,728 --> 01:39:08,897
(Sending a coffee truck to the selected member)

2913
01:39:08,898 --> 01:39:09,957
Coffee truck.

2914
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,328
The prize is a coffee truck.

2915
01:39:11,398 --> 01:39:13,098
- Shall I pick the name?
- Yes.

2916
01:39:13,168 --> 01:39:15,037
I thought that we were completely off.

2917
01:39:15,038 --> 01:39:16,297
I agreed with the answer thinking,

2918
01:39:16,298 --> 01:39:18,038
"You go ahead and suffer."

2919
01:39:18,068 --> 01:39:19,507
(He finishes selecting.)

2920
01:39:19,508 --> 01:39:21,207
(Which one will receive a coffee truck?)

2921
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,977
- Jee Seok Jin.
- Okay.

2922
01:39:22,978 --> 01:39:24,038
Actually, it's Mimi.

2923
01:39:25,008 --> 01:39:26,907
- Jee Seok Jin.
- Okay.

2924
01:39:26,908 --> 01:39:27,977
Actually, it's Mimi.

2925
01:39:27,978 --> 01:39:32,117
(Mimi, not Jee Seok Jin)

2926
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:33,287
(Thank you)

2927
01:39:33,288 --> 01:39:34,458
He's really angry.

2928
01:39:34,518 --> 01:39:36,017
Is it Mimi again?

2929
01:39:36,018 --> 01:39:37,288
She also gets picked for penalty.

2930
01:39:37,358 --> 01:39:38,827
There's something to my name.

2931
01:39:38,828 --> 01:39:40,688
The same happened in Season One.

2932
01:39:40,728 --> 01:39:42,397
We will send...

2933
01:39:42,398 --> 01:39:44,298
a coffee truck to Mimi.

2934
01:39:44,898 --> 01:39:46,097
- Thank you.
- If you don't need it,

2935
01:39:46,098 --> 01:39:47,267
I'll buy it for 300 dollars.

2936
01:39:47,268 --> 01:39:48,397
(If you don't need it, I'll buy it for 300 dollars.)

2937
01:39:48,398 --> 01:39:50,238
Is he trying to buy it from her?

2938
01:39:51,208 --> 01:39:56,138
(She received it well.)

2939
01:39:56,177 --> 01:39:59,777
(Strange freaks spotted in the waters by Incheon?)

2940
01:39:59,977 --> 01:40:03,516
(Sixth Sense appears to catch the freaks.)

2941
01:40:03,517 --> 01:40:05,716
(A fighter to catch the freaks)

2942
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:07,117
(Kim Dong Hyun)

2943
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:09,357
Actually, I'm a mind reader.

2944
01:40:09,657 --> 01:40:12,797
(The fighter's instinct leads to explosive reasoning.)

2945
01:40:12,897 --> 01:40:15,026
- The owner made a mistake.
- How so?

2946
01:40:15,027 --> 01:40:16,267
He smelled like raw fish.

2947
01:40:16,327 --> 01:40:17,627
It's because there's a raw fish restaurant next door.

2948
01:40:18,037 --> 01:40:19,737
Don't make mistakes yourself.

2949
01:40:20,237 --> 01:40:21,606
Just stay quiet.

2950
01:40:21,607 --> 01:40:23,767
(Dong Hyun is dull, but he laughs a lot.)

2951
01:40:24,837 --> 01:40:26,306
- Oh, my.
- What's wrong?

2952
01:40:26,307 --> 01:40:27,336
I thought that it was a mouse.

2953
01:40:27,337 --> 01:40:28,446
(Dong Hyun, a champion of reaction)

2954
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:30,377
He has a big build, but he's a scaredy-cat.

2955
01:40:30,877 --> 01:40:32,046
(Powerful)

2956
01:40:32,047 --> 01:40:33,047
She's strong.

2957
01:40:33,117 --> 01:40:34,817
(The second fighter, Chuu with a beautiful smile)

2958
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:36,147
You didn't know, did you?

2959
01:40:36,287 --> 01:40:37,646
This is a fig.

2960
01:40:37,647 --> 01:40:39,817
(A harmless yet annoying attack)

2961
01:40:39,957 --> 01:40:41,287
- Mimi.
- You're healthy.

2962
01:40:41,487 --> 01:40:44,057
Didn't you say that you were 59?

2963
01:40:44,857 --> 01:40:46,197
- But you're very...
- Stop thinking about age.

2964
01:40:46,297 --> 01:40:47,326
- He's upset.
- He is.

2965
01:40:47,327 --> 01:40:48,327
(One annoying person who's all innocent)

2966
01:40:48,328 --> 01:40:51,496
(The counterattack of the freaks)

2967
01:40:51,497 --> 01:40:53,436
(In a rush)

2968
01:40:53,437 --> 01:40:55,567
(A freaky dish appears which dissuades them.)

2969
01:40:55,767 --> 01:40:58,506
(But how is it delicious?)

2970
01:40:58,507 --> 01:40:59,706
(Captivating the eyes and the mouth)

2971
01:40:59,707 --> 01:41:01,846
(A huge explosion of flavors)

2972
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:02,906
(Freaky, fake)

2973
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:05,051
(Sixth Sense versus Freaks, who will be the final winner?)

2974
