00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,972
The weather is wonderful today.

2
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:19,341
- It's bright and clear. - Yes.

3
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:20,371
It's amazing.

4
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:21,611
- It's really bright and clear. - It's amazing.

5
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:22,742
(One sunny and warm day)

6
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:24,911
(Mimi pretends to be pretty this morning.)

7
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:26,882
(Winking)

8
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:29,751
Again, Mimi...

9
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:32,082
I realize once again how big of a star Mimi is.

10
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,151
(Refreshing Mimi)

11
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:35,791
This is what I do at work.

12
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:36,922
(Embarrassed)

13
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:38,921
There are also salted butter rolls.

14
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,932
(Those who have worked hard, enjoy!)

15
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,292
(Slightly embarrassed)

16
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,561
Please feel free to order.

17
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:44,731
Gosh, this is...

18
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,831
Mimi, does this photo also belong to....

19
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:49,102
Yes, it's one of their photos. I took it during the shoot.

20
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:52,202
They did a lot of nice editing on Photoshop.

21
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:54,012
- It's impossible not to. - No way.

22
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:55,671
Editing is necessary.

23
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:57,782
It'd be embarrassing if the photos weren't edited.

24
00:00:58,082 --> 00:00:59,812
Why wouldn't you use available techniques?

25
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:03,381
Aren't techniques created to be used?

26
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:04,782
- They should be used. - Exactly.

27
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:07,291
Please use them as generously as possible.

28
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,292
It's amazing.

29
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:09,391
- Thank you. - Thank you.

30
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:10,592
We should eat some.

31
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,491
Seok Jin also appeared in a commercial.

32
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:14,791
Really? Congratulations.

33
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,031
A laver commercial.

34
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,502
- Gosh. - It happened by chance.

35
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,502
Is that why you're dressed in laver color?

36
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,101
(The laver look from head to toe)

37
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:25,812
That's perfect. Nice.

38
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:27,612
Nice.

39
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:30,581
On the packaging,

40
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:32,041
there's a photo of Seok Jin's face.

41
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,612
- Really? - I thought that he was a young boy.

42
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:36,651
- It was photoshopped. - He looks like a young boy.

43
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,151
- Right. - Yes.

44
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:40,222
(Successfully rejuvenated by using all available techniques)

45
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,891
Here's your map for today.

46
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,222
- We're in Cheonan today. - Yes, Cheonan.

47

(The 9th city on Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

48
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:46,992

49
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,561
(A transportation hub connecting the capital,)

50
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:49,862
(Chungcheong and Honam region)

51
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:52,132

(History rooted in the heart)

53
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:57,572
(Flavors, happiness felt by the heart)

(Art that makes your heart beat)

55
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:01,641
(The heart of the Korean Peninsula lies here.)

56
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:02,812
(Cheonan in South Chungcheong Province)

57
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:05,612
(What's the one and only fake hidden at this place?)

58
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:09,222
(Even with your eyes wide open,)

59
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:12,022
(everything seems strange.)

60
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,451
(Seemingly fake)

61
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:19,462
(Inside popular places that seem real)

62
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:24,102
(Don't believe anything.)

63
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:27,532
(What is today's fake that will give you goosebumps?)

64
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:29,871
- I come to Cheonan often recently. - Cheonan.

65
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,701
- We came to Cheonan recently. - Did we?

66
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,072
We were here for "Running Man."

67
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,972
Did we come to Cheonan to shoot "Running Man?"

68
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:36,811
Seok Jin, it's only been two months.

69
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:38,912
You should forget what happened two months ago.

70
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:40,751
I don't even remember...

71
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:42,282
- what I had for breakfast. - Seriously?

72
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:44,322
Let's see.

73
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:46,122

What?

79
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:58,502
(Hidden everywhere in this city)

80
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,102
(Cheonan)

81
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,211
(Goodbye, everyone.)

82
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,682
(The squid's breakaway will start.)

83
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,781
(Hide well if you can.)

84
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,412
(Squids hiding all over the city?)

85
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:17,982
(Or an unusual transformation of a squid?)

86
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,652
(What could Squid's Breakaway be?)

87
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:25,162
(Possessed cutting)

88
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,261
(A Korean set menu restaurant owner...)

89
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,632
(with possessed techniques?)

90
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:32,132
(Or it's not an ordinary Korean set menu.)

91
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,201
(A Korean set menu restaurant...)

92
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,102

(Now, sundaeguk can be eaten cold.)

96
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:50,382
(Cold sundaeguk with floating thin ice?)

97
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:53,322
(Sundaeguk at Below 10°C is coming.)

98
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:57,292
(Which is the one and only fake?)

99
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,161
"Sundaeguk at Below 10°C?"

100
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,431
- What? - Below 10°C?

101
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:01,562
(Sundaeguk at Below 10°C?)

102
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,531
- Sundaeguk should be hot. - I know.

103
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:05,932
If it's below 10°C, will the sundaeguk be cold?

104
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,031
- Cold sundaeguk... - I don't even want to imagine it.

105
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:09,871
- Already... - Goodness.

106
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:11,201
It will smell.

107
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:12,872
There would be grease on top.

108
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:14,612
This has to be fake.

109
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,411
- Which one? - The sundaeguk.

110
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:17,711
The sundaeguk? Already?

111
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,011
- It's fake. - Something like this is real.

112
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:20,381
- Is this real? - Yes, it's real.

113
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:21,651
- It's mostly real. - It seems fake.

114
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:22,882
"It seems fake."

115
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,851
Let's go and meet our guests today.

116
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:26,852
- Our guests. - Yes.

117
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:28,691
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

118
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,662
(They set out to meet the guests.)

119
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,461
- What will we find in Cheonan? - I know.

120
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,831
- What's there in Cheonan? - It's my first time in Cheonan.

121
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:36,061
- Is it your first time? - Yes.

122
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,462
- Seriously? - Yes.

123
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:40,001
When we came to Cheonan last time...

124
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:41,632
- to shoot "Running Man," - Yes?

125
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,102
there was Sundae Street.

126
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:44,571
- Was that here? - In Cheonan...

127
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,572
- Is that so? - Yes.

128
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,911
- There is... - Hyo Ri's restaurant?

129
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,912
Yes.

130
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,341
(A street that emerged alongside the growth...)

131
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:50,842
(of a nearby ham factory in the 1960s)

132
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,381
(One of Cheonan's iconic street,)

133
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,981
(attracting an average of 700,000 visitors each year)

134
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,282
- Is it run by Hyo Ri's uncle? - Right.

135
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:01,422
I've never seen Seok Jin remember something so clearly.

136
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,321
He remembered thanks to me.

137
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:05,991
We came here recently, and it was Cheonan.

138
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,191
- Cheonan. - Right.

139
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,092
- You didn't know it was Cheonan? - No, I didn't.

140
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:10,661
Sundae.

141
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,302
- Could it be squid sundae? - What?

142
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,172
Squid sundae?

143
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:15,731
- For some reason... - Do you know anything...

144
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,071
about today's guests?

145
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,102
I don't know anything.

146
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:20,511
People around me like you the most.

147
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:21,512
Really?

148

I have many of your fans around me.

149
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:25,681

150
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:28,051

155
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,062
Gosh, what's that?

156
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:39,591
What?

157
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:40,661
- Here they are. - Goodness.

158
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:42,232
- What? Why are they... - Hello.

159
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:43,932
- Gosh. - Are they waiting for us like that?

160
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,501
Who's that? Is it Beom?

161
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:46,531
- I thought... - Yes.

162
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:47,532
Beom?

163
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,801
- Hello. - Who else is it?

164
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,942
It's Si An from "Single's Inferno."

165

00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,921
- Is your leg okay? - Yes, it's gotten much better.

181
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,292
- Really? - It's gotten better.

182
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:46,191
- Hello. - Hello.

183
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:47,762
Have you been well?

184
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:49,961
Do Mimi and Si An know each other?

185
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:51,131
- I've met her once... - Yes.

186
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,732
on "Radio Star."

187
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:59,772
(They even danced together when they met for the first time.)

188
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,612
We should try it.

189
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,381
Did you order bread?

190
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,012
Let's eat some bread too.

191
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:09,982
(With spacious interior...)

192
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,722
(and delicious food next to each other)

193
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:17,392
(Fancy-looking bread that catches your attention)

194
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,291
There's a lot.

195
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,762
(A popular place for bread lovers in Cheonan)

196
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,431
- Let's just try these. - These two?

197
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,502
- Two? - Yes.

198
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,901
I enjoy watching "Youngupjung" on YouTube.

199
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,271
- Hello. - Please invite me.

200
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,131
- He changed the title. - Sure...

201
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,972
- You changed the title of the show. - I didn't.

202
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,271
It's always been "Youngupjung."

203
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:34,341
- You didn't change it? - No.

204
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:35,871
Didn't you change it to something "chung?"

205
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,981
- "Chung?" - Yes.

206
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,312
- You mean, "Youngupchung?" - No, it had "chung" in it.

207
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,052
I must have seen something else.

208
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:43,151
- Isn't your show successful? - Yes.

209
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,721
- It's successful. - Thankfully, it's successful.

210
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:46,922
- You punk. - Yes.

211
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:48,852
- It's been exceptional. - Then you should act arrogant.

212
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,662
- May I? - Of course.

213
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,432
You seem ready.

214
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,461
If no one has paid yet, may I pay for it?

215
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:56,462
Seriously?

216
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,861
(The class of being sensational)

217
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,101
Is this how you'll start?

218
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,402
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

219
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,071
The winner will pay for it.

220
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:04,971
- So that I can be more arrogant? - Yes.

221
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:06,311
Can you also pay for the production crew?

222
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,672
- Sure. - Include the production crew.

223
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,942
- There are 20 of us. - His eyes are quivering.

224
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,312
Seriously?

225
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:14,981
- Add some snacks. - The entire production crew.

226
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,251
- Including snacks? - Yes.

227
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,751
- Why do you keep adding more? - He added it.

228
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:20,921
Okay, including snacks.

229
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:23,191
- Do you have your wallet? - Of course. I have Samsung Pay.

230
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,021
- I have Apple Pay. - Apple Pay?

231
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,362
Gosh, Apple Pay?

232
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:27,891
That's hot.

233
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,061
I don't think you can pay with Apple Pay.

234
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:30,261
- Can't I pay with Apple Pay? - Yes.

235
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:32,601
Is it possible? The winner will pay.

236
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:35,432
- Okay. - Beom's eyes quivered a little.

237
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:36,941
The winner gets to buy?

238
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,271
- Yes, and you can decide. - His pupils are quivering.

239
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,711
- How many children do you have? - I have two.

240
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,011
Gosh, this is...

241
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:44,212
My children can eat only vegetables next week.

242
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,651
Anyway, the winner gets to pay.

243
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,811
- Of course. - Okay.

244
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,121
- The winner? - The winner gets to pay.

245
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:51,151
The winner will pay.

246
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,752
Rock-paper-scissors.

247
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:54,651
(Whose wallet...)

248
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:56,422
(will open?)

249
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:59,361
(Who will be the one to pay for the snacks?)

250
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:00,532
Rock-paper-scissors.

251
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,162
(Seok Jin is picked.)

252
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:03,501
Scissors. Goodness.

253
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,601
(Clapping with excitement)

254
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:06,872
- The winner has to pay. - Will you be paying, Seok Jin?

255
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:10,441
- Thank you. - Thank you.

256
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,812
- He shot in a laver commercial. - I got confused for a moment.

257
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,971
I thought that I wasn't paying because I won.

258
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,211
- I got confused too. - Right?

259
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:19,011
- "Do I have to pay?" - You thought that because you lost.

260
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:20,052
(Kids, we can eat meat next week.)

261
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:23,251
- They even sell walnut cake shakes. - That sounds delicious.

262
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:25,252
"Cheonan's specialty, walnut cake shake."

263
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:27,621
- We have to try that. - Right.

264
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:28,951
There are walnut cakes inside.

265
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,462
- Really? - That's enough.

266
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,891
Don't eat so much.

267
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:36,361
- Shouldn't we try it here? - You don't have to...

268
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,001
- eat a meal here. - Okay.

269
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,401
One walnut cake shake, please.

270
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,471
(He doesn't care.)

271
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,632
We should try it.

272
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,501
Who wants to save points?

273
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,571
(Seok Jin pays for everything including the walnut cake shake.)

274
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:47,412
Yes, please bring them when they're ready.

275
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,612
- Let's go. - Let's go.

276
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:53,352
(The production crew members also enjoyed the drinks.)

277
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,951
I figured out the reason why...

278
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:58,251
you greeted us at the window.

279
00:09:58,252 --> 00:09:59,652
- Did you meet for the first time? - Yes.

280
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,721
- It was very awkward. - Exactly.

281
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,991
- It was very awkward. - It was very awkward.

282
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:07,161
He kept talking to me.

283
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,161
So we kept talking,

284
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:11,501
- but it didn't flow at all. - It didn't flow?

285
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:12,702
What are you talking about?

286
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,802
That's not true. We enjoyed our conversation.

287
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,442
- Really? - Yes.

288
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,171
You must be a little introverted.

289
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,071
- Me? I'm shy around new people. - Are you?

290
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:22,772
- Are you shy? - Yes, in the beginning.

291
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:24,711
Despite being shy,

292
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,651
- you were in "Single's Inferno." - I know.

293
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:29,852
- I was bold and daring on the show. - Bold and daring?

294
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,051
I wore skimpy clothes...

295
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,122
and opened up.

296
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,292
- You were bold and daring. - Yes.

297
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:37,021
There are so many shows like that, so it's confusing.

298
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,721
"I'm Solo," "Single's Inferno."

299
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,061
Isn't there one where people go to an island?

300
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,062
- She was in that. - Yes, I was.

301
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,191
- You were in that show? - I went to an island.

302
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,302
Right, an island.

303
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,831
I think such shows also exist abroad.

304
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:46,871
People go to an island.

305
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:48,602
- Right. - You mean, "Too Hot to Handle?"

306
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:49,842
I don't know.

307
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:51,801
"Too Hot to Handle."

308
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,341
He watches all of them.

309
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:54,471
Seok Jin only watches...

310
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:56,012
- shows like that these days. - Do you watch that too?

311
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,281
- I read about it in an article. - Why would there...

312
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,211
be an article about "Too Hot to Handle" in Korea?

313
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:01,882
(It's a foreign reality TV show.)

314
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,581
I read about it in an article.

315
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,282
- Where was it published? - "Solo..."

316
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:07,992
Where was the article published?

317
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:10,321
(Shaking)

318
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,322
Goodness.

319
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:13,032
Because of "Too Hot to Handle..."

320
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:16,731
He keeps shaking his leg.

321
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,732
(He can't hide his anxiety.)

322
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:20,532
As one of the similar shows,

323
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:21,871
there was an article written about it.

324
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:24,241
I heard that this will be aired on Christmas.

325
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,871
- Really? - Yes.

326
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:28,571
We even talked about our plans for Christmas.

327
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,011
Really? Your Christmas plans?

328
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,141
Si An, what are your plans?

329
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:33,181
I'm going on a trip.

330
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:36,722
I told him that I was going to the US and Finland.

331
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,752
I'll be going with Eun Bi.

332
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,952
- Kwon Eun Bi? - Yes.

333
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,991
- Are you close to Eun Bi? - Yes, I'm close.

334
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,462
(Si An and Eun Bi are quite close.)

335
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,492
Beom, what are you doing on Christmas?

336
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:47,892
You have snot.

337
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,461
(Guarding his snot)

338
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:52,562
Snot? Aren't you being too harsh?

339
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,501
- Wait. - We got very close.

340
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:55,772
- Exactly. - That's why she brought it.

341
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:57,501
(While Beom's nose was running, the desserts arrived.)

342
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:58,702
Thank you.

343
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:02,712
This is our signature bread called pastry bread.

344
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:07,312
And it's our signature drink, walnut cake shake.

345
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,052
- Exactly. - Is this for you, Si An?

346
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,651
- No, it's not. - That's the walnut cake...

347
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,151
That's called Rocher.

348
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,152
- What? - It's our signature drink.

349
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,961
- It's their signature drink. - I see.

350
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:22,161
(Signature Drink 3, Rocher coffee inspired by Ferrero Rocher)

351
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,931
Usually, there are 1 or 2 signature drinks.

352
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,001
You have so many.

353
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:27,901
(You have so many.)

354
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,602
Since we're on TV...

355
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:30,772
Thank you.

356
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:31,902
(A collection of signature menu items)

357
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,672
If this is another signature drink, please tell us.

358
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,942
- It's our popular Americano. - Okay.

359
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,912
- These two? Try it. - This is walnut cake latte.

360
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:43,581
(Seok Jin tries the Rocher coffee first.)

361
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:44,621
Thank you.

362
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:45,982
- Thank you. - Thank you.

363
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,452
- This is insane. - Why?

364
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:49,791
It's so delicious.

365
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:52,322
(Rich sweet and nutty flavor that makes you crave chocolate)

366
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,061
- Shall I try it? - Try it.

367
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,092
(Jae Seok takes a sip of the walnut cake shake.)

368
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:56,502
(Humming)

369
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,262
It tastes like walnut ice cream.

370
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:01,431
- Walnut Maru? - That?

371
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,532
It tastes like Walnut Maru.

372
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,671
(Laughing)

373
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:07,841
- Why are you laughing? - Walnut Maru?

374
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:08,842
Yes.

375
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,612
He drank with the straw, so we can't taste it.

376
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,652
(Drinking with the straw)

377
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,222
I described its taste.

378
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:21,651
I told you how it tasted.

379
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:24,262
(Laughing uncontrollably again)

380
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,362
Thank you for the description.

381
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,061
So it tastes like walnut ice cream?

382
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:30,062
(Thank you for the description.)

383
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:33,172
- He refuses to share it. - He isn't sharing.

384
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:34,702
He's not sharing at all.

385
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,271
Do your children believe in Santa Claus on Christmas?

386
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,271
- No, not anymore. - No?

387
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:41,411
- Of course not. - Already?

388
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:44,011
- Already? - She's in elementary school.

389
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,511
She shares information with her friends.

390
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:48,011
Right. With her friends?

391
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,381
I believed in Santa Claus until I was in elementary school.

392
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:51,551
- Really? - Yes.

393
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:54,151
My father dressed up as Santa Claus, but I didn't know that it was him.

394
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,252
- You didn't know? - No, I didn't.

395
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,821
Did your father also do impressions of Santa Claus?

396
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,031
- Exactly. - "Goodness."

397
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:03,661
- Really? - He called me on the phone too.

398
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,931
I never did it for my children. It's too embarrassing.

399
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,502
- You'd be perfect at it. - But...

400
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,442
Now that you're a real grandfather now...

401
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,102
You can do it now.

402
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:13,941
Without any special makeup?

403
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,112
(He can be Santa Claus without any makeup.)

404
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:17,042
Please come for Na Eun.

405
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,552
Only if you pay me 50 dollars per hour.

406
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,351
- Fifty dollars per hour? - Yes.

407
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,521
- I'll think about it. - If you pay me, I'll consider it.

408
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:25,522
(Na Eun, don't worry. Santa Claus actually exists.)

409
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:26,921
- Shall we get going? - Shall we?

410
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:28,051
(Shall we go and find what's fake?)

411
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:30,162
Let's go and try some squid.

412
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:31,562
Squid's Breakaway.

413
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:34,832
Would it be nasty if I focus too much on guessing correctly?

414
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,632
No, you should do your best.

415
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:40,271
I'm planning to look inside their trash bags.

416
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:41,272
That's fine.

417
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:42,631
(Clapping for Kwak Beom)

418
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,701
- You can do that. - That's a good idea.

419
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:44,972
We need someone who is obstinate.

420
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,711
I like the smell of autumn.

421
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:48,712
The scent of autumn.

422
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:49,771
(They can smell the scent of autumn as they walk.)

423
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:50,782
The scent of autumn.

424
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:53,681
- The warmth of foliage. - Foliage?

425
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:55,252
I love this kind of vibe.

426
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,351
- I like things like this. - Me too.

427
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,321
- Shouldn't we scatter them? - While scattering them...

428
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,421
- I love things like this. - Like this.

429
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,791
- You know best. - One, two, three.

430
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,661
- Like this. - She knows best.

431
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:06,932
(A feeling of late autumn from the fallen leaves)

432
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:09,691
A TV personality from a reality dating show is different.

433
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,661
You can put this inside a bookmark.

434
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,971
You have the old-fashioned vibe.

435
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,131
I like things that evoke emotions.

436
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,902
- In the past, this was really... - That's why...

437
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,571
- You can put it inside an album. - Or bookmarks.

438
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:21,572
(They're happy to relate to her.)

439
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:22,842
That's quite old-fashioned...

440
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:26,681
Mimi can't resist and says everything on her mind.

441
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:28,382
- Feel free to do so. - I'm sorry.

442
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,721
- I'm not very patient. - You just figured that out?

443
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,182
She says exactly what's on her mind.

444
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:36,151
Ji An, is this your first time meeting Jae Seok?

445
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,621
- Yes. - It must be fascinating.

446
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:39,822
- It's very fascinating. - She's Si An, not Ji An.

447
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,431
Didn't I call her Si An?

448
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,192
- You called her Ji An. - Just brush it off.

449
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,402
Why did you pretend not to hear it?

450
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,531
This is how I learn people's names.

451
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:48,532
I tried to ignore it.

452
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,371
- Her name is Si An. - Si An.

453
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:52,302
Seok Jin, how old do you look?

454
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,311
(Here come her flirting skills.)

455
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,442
About 26?

456
00:15:58,612 --> 00:15:59,781
- I bet she was born in 1999. - In 1996?

457
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,282
- In 1999? - In 1999.

458
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,352
- I was born in 1999. - Wasn't I right?

459
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:06,551
- Wasn't I accurate? - How did you know?

460
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:07,621
I knew that she was born in 1999.

461
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:09,722
In what year do you think Seok Sam was born?

462
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,692
In 1966?

463
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,761
She knew before coming here.

464
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:14,931
- Seriously? - Why are you...

465
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,291
- so disappointed? - It's upsetting.

466
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,302
Why?

467
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:19,631
- I hate when they guess correctly. - Why are you disappointed?

468
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:22,202
I guessed your age correctly. Why would you be upset?

469
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:24,042
His ears turned red.

470
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:26,771
Gosh, I hate it.

471
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,372
He seems very upset.

472
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:30,882
- It must be the place. - What?

473
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,341
Is it here?

474
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:34,482
(They arrived at Squid's Breakaway, the first popular place.)

475
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,382
Jjamppong?

476
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,882
It doesn't look like a popular place.

477
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:43,891
(Easily found in any neighborhood)

478
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:46,761
There isn't anything special about it.

479
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,862
(It looks like an ordinary Chinese restaurant.)

480
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:52,301
This is on here too.

481
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,471
So many people use it these days.

482
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,601
We see it often these days.

483
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,101
- We see it very often. - Many people use it.

484
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,301
We see it on every restaurant.

485
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:58,542
We also saw it last time.

486
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,471
- Shall we go inside? - Yes.

487
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:03,012
(What will be Squid's Breakaway today?)

488
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:05,211
Please go inside.

489
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,381
(They go inside the restaurant.)

490
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:07,481
This is...

491
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:08,951
(Is it also an ordinary Chinese restaurant inside?)

492
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:11,022
Isn't it just a jjajangmyeon and jjamppong restaurant?

493
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,522
What's so special about this place?

494
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,051
(Common Chinese dishes on the menu)

495
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,692
There's nothing unusual about it.

496
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,531
There's nothing strange about it.

497
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,631
(It looks like a Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.)

498
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:24,902
- Shall we sit down first? - Yes.

499
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:27,531
This is very strange.

500
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:28,901
- There's nothing strange... - What's strange about it?

501
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,472
It's strange that there's nothing strange about it.

502
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:32,842
(Focused)

503
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:36,311
- And this in the back... - At 7:30pm...

504
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,911
- On social media? - The words sound unnatural.

505
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:39,912
Right?

506
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:41,281
What do you mean?

507
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:42,282
(Where?)

508
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,321
"Take pretty photos of the food."

509
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:45,552
They dropped the honorifics.

510
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,551
(It's strange that it's written without the honorifics.)

511
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,591
- No. - Without the honorifics...

512
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,622
It's not without the honorifics.

513
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:54,391
"Take photos and upload them with reviews, please."

514
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,132
(Please upload your photos with reviews.)

515
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:59,101
- You didn't read it all the way. - I'm sorry.

516
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:00,432
Beom, you didn't read it.

517
00:18:01,072 --> 00:18:03,542
(He realized that it was written with honorifics.)

518
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,441
What's Squid's Breakaway?

519
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:08,071
- I'm so curious about it. - He's here.

520
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:09,611
- Hello. - Hello.

521
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:11,581
- Hello. - Sir,

522
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:14,511
is this a Chinese restaurant that we're used to?

523
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,351
Yes, it's a jjamppong restaurant.

524
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,421
A jjamppong restaurant?

525
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:18,681
- A jjamppong restaurant? - And tray jjajangmyeon.

526
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,651
The keyword we got was Squid's Breakaway.

527
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:25,161
I needed a unique dish at my restaurant.

528
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,491
Of course.

529
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,791
I came up with tray jjajangmyeon...

530
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,331
with squid and stir-fried spicy pork.

531
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:32,301
(Tray jjajangmyeon with squid and stir-fried spicy pork)

532
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,771
With squid and stir-fried spicy pork.

533
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,432
- Stir-fried spicy pork? - That sounds delicious.

534
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,441
Tray jjajangmyeon with squid and stir-fried spicy pork?

535
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,472
Yes.

536
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:41,041
Half of it is jjajangmyeon,

537
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,681
and the other half is stir-fried spicy squid and pork.

538
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,511
Really? Like seasoned squid and pork belly?

539
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:47,251
Is it seasoned squid and pork belly jjajangmyeon?

540
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,352
(The unprecedented tray jjajangmyeon is coming soon.)

541
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:51,582
That's fascinating.

542
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,921
- When did you start making it? - Right.

543
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:54,991
Since the restaurant opened.

544
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,521
- Since it opened? - When did the restaurant open?

545
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:57,862
How long has it been?

546
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:00,832
We opened in January of last year, so it's been about two years.

547
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,131
Which dishes do you recommend today?

548
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:04,931
I recommend the signature dishes,

549
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,631
tray jjajangmyeon with squid and pork...

550
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:07,931
and pollack roe and milt jjamppong.

551
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,031
- Pollack roe? - That sounds great.

552
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,972
- The pollack roe sounds delicious. - Please bring them.

553
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:12,041
Okay.

554
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:14,212
I've never heard of pollack roe and milt jjamppong.

555
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,572
Wouldn't it be similar...

556
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,311
- to spicy pollack stew? - Exactly.

557
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,851
It must be similar to spicy pollack stew.

558
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:23,212
It's like spicy fish roe soup.

559
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,321
Isn't there too much Korean food...

560
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:26,522
at a Chinese restaurant?

561
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:27,791
Right.

562
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,351
For the tray jjajangmyeon with squid and pork,

563
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:30,992
when it's made with rice instead of noodles,

564
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:32,522
it'd be like squid rice bowl.

565
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,731
- It'd be like squid rice bowl. - Right.

566
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:36,292
It could be a Korean cuisine chef's idea.

567
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,762
It seems that way.

568
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,931
The menu looks way too new.

569
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,242
(The menu looks like it was made recently.)

570
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:46,071
- May I look closely? - Go ahead.

571
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:47,972
Doesn't it look very new?

572
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:51,382
- Beom, what are you doing? - I'm checking the dust.

573
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,311
- There must be an amount of dust... - Yes.

574
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,012
- of two years. - That's clever.

575
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,511
(Kwak Beom, the self-sacrificing chief detective of deduction)

576
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:58,751
You're like a chief detective today.

577
00:19:58,752 --> 00:19:59,851
- There's a lot. - Is there any?

578
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:00,991
- It's true. - There's a lot of dust.

579
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,051
Is it true?

580
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,222
(There's a lot of dust.)

581
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:05,691
(A rare clue that Beom found)

582
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:07,661
Take a look up there.

583
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:08,691
- Where? - On top of the menu.

584
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,931
- Here? - Over there.

585
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,201
You'd better be careful.

586
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:12,901
Beom's leg is still injured.

587
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:13,902
(Oh, right.)

588
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,472
Don't order him around just because he's there.

589
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,701
My doctor told me...

590
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,542
- to go up and down. - Really?

591
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:21,242
(Wiping)

592
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,111
- It's true. - Is it?

593
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:24,241
It's true.

594
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:25,812
- Then it's right. - This place seems real.

595
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:27,951
- We'll know when we taste it. - Yes.

596
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,611
He's saying that his dish is...

597
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,222
- popular. - It's popular.

598
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:33,082
To be popular, it has to taste...

599
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:34,891
- It has to be very delicious. - Exactly.

600
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,522
- Or it has to look amazing. - Right.

601
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,122
- What is it? - It's a lot of food.

602
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:42,861
(Something big is coming.)

603
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,432
Gosh, it looks incredible.

604
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:45,761
- What is it? - Goodness.

605
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:47,101
(Enormous)

606
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:48,572
It looks incredible.

607
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:54,471
(Just its appearance catches our attention.)

608
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:55,572
It's a lot of food.

609
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:57,412
- It looks incredible. - What?

610
00:20:58,212 --> 00:20:59,381
(Gulping)

611
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:00,481
- Unbelievable. - Goodness.

612
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,712
This looks very delicious.

613
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,411
It looks incredible.

614
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,022
(Tray jjajangmyeon with squid and pork)

615
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:08,622
Put the squid, meat, and vegetables over high heat.

616
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:11,622
Stir-fry them quickly until they pick up a smoky flavor.

617
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:15,192
Add chili powder to boost the spiciness...

618
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:17,061
and flavor with smoke once again.

619
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:19,632
(Make it spicier and add the smoky flavor once again)

620
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:22,931
It turns into squid and stir-fried spicy pork...

621
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,902
that goes well with jjajangmyeon.

622
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:27,972
Once jjajangmyeon is served next to it...

623
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:29,641
(Tray jjajangmyeon with squid and pork)

624
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:31,212
It looks really amazing.

625
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,881
My sales are 1,500 dollars on weekdays.

626
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:35,411
(Weekday sales, 1,500 dollars)

627
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:38,352
My sales are between 2,500 and 3,000 dollars on weekends.

628
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:41,921
On weekends, there are customers...

629
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:43,892
who wait 1 to 1.5 hours to eat.

630
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:46,661
Many customers seem to like it.

631
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:48,231
Sixth Sense members,

632
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:49,761
is this place real?

633
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:52,302
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

634
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:54,301
It looks incredible.

635
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:56,072
(It looks incredible.)

636
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,341
I definitely have to take a photo of this.

637
00:21:58,342 --> 00:21:59,402
(I definitely have to take a photo of this.)

638
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,971
I can see why it's a popular place.

639
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,742
The question is whether it's real or fake.

640
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:03,911
For how many people is this?

641
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,541
Usually, it's for two people.

642
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,542
- This? - This?

643
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:07,681
And it's 25 dollars?

644
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:08,781
(This is for 2 people?)

645
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,081
I have a hunch.

646
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:11,451
What is it?

647
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:12,452
Really?

648
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:13,551
I think it's fake.

649
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:15,291
- Really? - I also think that it's fake.

650
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,262
- The amount is too big. - I think it's real.

651
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,921
Unbelievable.

652
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,291
(Based on the price and amount, it can't be for 2 people.)

653
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,361
Enjoy your food.

654
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:22,661
(Taking a close look at the pickled radish)

655
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:23,902
- He said... - Yes?

656
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,362
that it was for two people.

657
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:27,701
There isn't enough pickled radish.

658
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:28,831
You're right.

659
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:30,671
(Didn't he serve too little pickled radish for 2 people?)

660
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:31,741
(Thinking)

661
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,571
There's a self-service side dish bar.

662
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:34,771
(A self-service side dish bar)

663
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,212
- It's right behind you. - A self-service side dish bar?

664
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,741
Didn't you go too far?

665
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,282
(You're free to serve yourself more pickled radish.)

666
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:41,451
- As he's making something... - I thought that it was sharp.

667
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:43,882
- that he's not used to... - Right.

668
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:45,752
Let's try it first.

669
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:47,791
It looks delicious.

670
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:50,592
(A bite of the squid)

671
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,991
- Tasting will give us an idea. - Let's see.

672
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,162
The squid tastes amazing.

673
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,091
(She tries jjajangmyeon with squid.)

674
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:57,232
This is insane.

675
00:22:57,632 --> 00:22:58,732
Isn't it so good?

676
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:02,301
(A sincere look)

677
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:04,172
The squid is fresh.

678
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,442
(Humming)

679
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:07,872
Isn't it so good?

680
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,241
(Exclaiming)

681
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:10,242
(The taste that leaves you in awe)

682
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:11,342
It's really good.

683
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:13,011
- Yes. - Right?

684
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:15,312
- It's fresh. - It's very delicious.

685
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,451
Since the squid is spicy,

686
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,481
it tastes like Sichuan jjajangmyeon.

687
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,491
Yes.

688
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:24,591
(Devouring)

689
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:25,622
Goodness.

690
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:28,592
As the squid was grilled in a flame,

691
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:30,461
it has an intense smoky flavor.

692
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:32,562
It goes so well with jjajangmyeon.

693
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,301
It makes a good match with stir-fried spicy pork.

694
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:35,572
Yes, I agree.

695
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:37,642
Why didn't anyone...

696
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,471
- come up with this idea before? - I bet it's very successful.

697
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:41,811
Why didn't anyone come up with it?

698
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:42,971
- It's so delicious. - I know.

699
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:43,981
(Exclaiming)

700
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,711
- This is... - It's incredible.

701
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:47,251
- I see why it's so popular. - Yes.

702
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:48,852
- It's really good. - This must be real.

703
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,721
- Yes, it must be real. - For me,

704
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,451
it's so delicious that it has to be fake.

705
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:53,551
- Why? - Really?

706
00:23:53,552 --> 00:23:55,052
Why do you think so?

707
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:56,422
Si An whom I got close to.

708
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,391
(Say that we're close now.)

709
00:23:58,392 --> 00:23:59,462
Gosh.

710
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,031
I'll just eat.

711
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:02,092
(I'll just eat.)

712
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,932
You two can't carry on a conversation.

713
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,361
I don't think that we click.

714
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,672
(I don't think that we click.)

715
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,301
I don't click with her either.

716
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:10,571
Why not?

717
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:11,741
I even guessed your correct age.

718
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,572
- That's why. - That's why?

719
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:15,741
- He doesn't like that. - I hate it the most.

720
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,481
He hates it the most when someone guesses his age correctly.

721
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:20,582
Here's what made me think that this place is real.

722
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,481
This wasabi.

723
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:25,282
(The wasabi proves that it's real?)

724
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:26,621
Why is it there?

725
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:27,921
- It's for the squid. - Yes.

726
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:29,322
(The wasabi is for the squid.)

727
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:32,121
This couldn't have been added for no reason.

728
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,931
- A customer must have asked him. - You're right.

729
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,262
(The sauce was served to go with the dish.)

730
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,001
He has signature dishes...

731
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:40,801
that are successful.

732
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:44,072
Was it necessary to have so many dishes on the menu?

733
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:45,841
- Do you find it excessive? - Yes.

734
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:48,111
Yes, there are so many other dishes...

735
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,911
like jjamppong with cockles.

736
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:51,882
(The menu seems unnecessarily long.)

737
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:56,111
I noticed that people in Cheonan have different ideas...

738
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,582
about signature dishes than us.

739
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,651
- I agree. - You're right.

740
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:00,692
Their ideas are slightly different.

741
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:01,921
- You're right. - Like at the bakery?

742
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,322
At the bakery?

743
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:06,992
This is a challenge for running a business in Cheonan.

744
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:08,661
When you open a restaurant, you need...

745
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:09,991
more than five signature items.

746
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,231
(5 signature items are necessary.)

747
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:12,932
Wherever you go including cafes...

748
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:16,001
With two signature items, it's impossible to start a business.

749
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:17,101
No, it's impossible.

750
00:25:17,102 --> 00:25:18,571
(Reasoning is impossible due to a peculiarity in Cheonan.)

751
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:19,702
Definitely.

752
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:21,841
A big one is coming. Oh, my.

753
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:23,981
(Covering her mouth)

754
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,181
Gosh, this is...

755
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:26,312
(Gasping)

756
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:28,281
This looks delicious.

757
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:29,312
(Generous)

758
00:25:30,252 --> 00:25:31,681
This also looks...

759
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:32,952
(It looks insane.)

760
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,621
A big one is coming. Oh, my.

761
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:36,922
(Pollack roe and milt jjamppong appears.)

762
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:41,592
There are whole pollack roe and milt in this jjamppong.

763
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:45,762
When the jjamppong broth is boiled without a stop,

764
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:47,702
it becomes much richer.

765
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:51,641
(Filled with pollack roe and milt)

766
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:54,242
Once it's covered with toppings,

767
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,681
the pollack roe and milt jjamppong is ready...

768
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,782
with a strong flavor of pollack roe and milt.

769
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:01,111
How much is this?

770
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:03,251
- It's 13 dollars. - Sir.

771
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,822
Do you make any profit?

772
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,081
I don't make much profit.

773
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:07,222
I have to sell a lot.

774
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:09,022
Shall we try it?

775
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:11,192
(A bite of milt)

776
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:12,892
The milt tastes amazing.

777
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:16,261
You have to taste the milt.

778
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:17,431
(Strongly recommending the milt)

779
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,862
(He tries some milt.)

780
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:21,972
(Impressed)

781
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,602
(A sigh of admiration rising from the core)

782
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,241
It's fresher than...

783
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:28,611
the pollack stew restaurant I go to. How is it possible?

784
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:29,641
You're totally right.

785
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:31,341
- He's right. - Isn't it fresh?

786
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:33,512
The milt is very fresh.

787
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:35,252
It almost tastes alive.

788
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:37,421
(Mimi and Si An also enjoy the milt.)

789
00:26:37,422 --> 00:26:38,851
(Exclaiming)

790
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:39,921
Gosh, the milt...

791
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:41,192
It tastes amazing.

792
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:42,492
Si An, did you study abroad?

793
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:43,961
- No. - I thought so...

794
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:45,091
from the way you exclaimed.

795
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:46,462
(Study abroad all of a sudden?)

796
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:48,562
Gosh, the milt...

797
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:51,932
- Gosh, it's good. - It's good.

798
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:53,261
It's very fresh.

799
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:54,301
- I know. - Right?

800
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:56,131
It's not fishy at all.

801
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:59,872
(Kyung Pyo devours the noodles.)

802
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:02,212
- The noodles are soaked... - It's so good.

803
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:03,841
in the broth.

804
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:05,881
(The noodles are soaked in the broth.)

805
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,311
The broth is just like spicy fish stew.

806
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:10,212
(Like spicy fish stew, the broth is spicy.)

807
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:11,521
This is crazy.

808
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:13,221
(His eyes widen.)

809
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:15,252
We didn't know about it when it's so good.

810
00:27:15,522 --> 00:27:17,191
I'd love more milt.

811
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:18,762
(I'd love more milt.)

812
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:20,161
Shall I ask if we can get more?

813
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:21,332
Yes.

814
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:23,561
- Sir. - Yes?

815
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:25,732
Is it possible to get more milt?

816
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:28,271
I don't offer extra toppings.

817
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,201
It's quite costly.

818
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,601
- Right? - Yes.

819
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,342
The price wouldn't cover it if you offer more.

820
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,911
- That's true. - What if we take photos...

821
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,281
and Si An posts them?

822
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,112
She has 1.08 million followers.

823
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,452
Could we get 12 fried dumplings?

824
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,681
All of a sudden?

825
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:46,822
I eat a lot.

826
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:48,792
But that's my Instagram.

827
00:27:48,822 --> 00:27:50,321
We've already drifted apart,

828
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:51,792
so I decided to drift apart even more.

829
00:27:52,222 --> 00:27:53,892
I don't think it will work.

830
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:57,231
If this is real,

831
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:59,332
he wouldn't make any profit, would he?

832
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:01,431
No,

833
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:03,831
the price of 13 dollars is too low.

834
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:07,172
In my opinion, he should raise it to 15 dollars.

835
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:09,041
He gave us a generous portion.

836
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,471
He gave us a lot.

837
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,042
(Is this place fake? It doesn't seem profitable.)

838
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:14,311
Come and eat here.

839
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,082
(She's still looking for anything suspicious.)

840
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:17,751
She's very detailed right now.

841
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,451
- Wait. - She's the only one who disagrees.

842
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:20,452
- Si An is... - She's the only one...

843
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:21,621
who insists that it's fake.

844
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:22,691
Right now...

845
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,191
(Si An is looking for clues that prove that it's fake.)

846
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,191
- We need someone like Si An. - Yes, she's sharp.

847
00:28:26,192 --> 00:28:27,892
We're too dull.

848
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,162
- Right. - We need someone like her.

849
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,331
I don't know who will be her boyfriend,

850
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:32,702
but he'll have to work hard.

851
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:35,101
- As soon as he cheats on her... - Right.

852
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:37,471
Si An, aren't you good at guessing?

853
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:38,741
- Yes, I am. - Right?

854
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:39,971
I have a sixth sense.

855
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:41,741
- I bet you're spot on. - You have a sixth sense, don't you?

856
00:28:41,742 --> 00:28:42,872
Definitely.

857
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,342
What about you, Beom? Do you have a sixth sense?

858
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:47,752
- I'm close to being a shaman. - What?

859
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:48,951
- You're close to being a shaman? - Yes.

860
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,411
Actually, you seem blunt.

861
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,921
- That's hard to believe. - You can't be.

862
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:53,322
Then I'll say that I'm not.

863
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:56,491
First of all, your face looks blunt.

864
00:28:56,492 --> 00:28:57,662
Like a chestnut.

865
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,092
- A face shaped like a chestnut? - Like a chestnut.

866
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:02,991
We aren't aware of people dating around us.

867
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:03,992
I don't know either.

868
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,662
- I'm very dull. - We don't know.

869
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,972
Sometimes, I don't understand why I get scolded.

870
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,232
I think that my wife is being harsh.

871
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,741
I bet you get scolded too.

872
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:13,201
- I get scolded often. - When you do,

873
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,671
you probably don't understand why.

874
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:16,611
- I don't know why she scolds me. - I knew it.

875
00:29:16,612 --> 00:29:18,741
As long as I don't bring it up,

876
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:20,211
the fight doesn't get big.

877
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,081
There's one line that makes her angrier.

878
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:23,082
What is it?

879
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:25,021
"Why are you so angry?"

880
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:26,722
You shouldn't say that.

881
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:29,851
- Gosh, he has no know-how. - He doesn't.

882
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,121
- Beom, you have no know-how at all. - But...

883
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,061
Pretending to be sick is the best at times like that.

884
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:35,761
(Pretending to be sick is the best.)

885
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:38,062
(What?)

886
00:29:38,162 --> 00:29:39,902
Are you serious?

887
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:43,001
A sudden upset stomach. A problem with your stomach.

888
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:44,342
- Really? - Yes.

889
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,271
When you pretend to be sick,

890
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:48,311
- she'll say, "What's wrong?" - Wait.

891
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:49,912
- "Wait." - "What I ate earlier..."

892
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:51,981
- This is perfect... - That's an advanced skill.

893
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:54,251
for getting through moments like this.

894
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,281
Of course.

895
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:56,551
After the show airs,

896
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:57,951
you two can't pretend to be sick anymore.

897
00:29:57,952 --> 00:29:58,952
They'll find out your trick.

898
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:00,652
I will still pretend.

899
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:02,551
We'll complain about pain somewhere else.

900
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,091
You can say that you have a headache.

901
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:06,222
I can complain about something else, like toothache.

902
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,132
There are many options.

903
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,961
That's the wisdom of married men.

904
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:12,301
This is real wisdom.

905
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:13,861
- Seriously. - This is wisdom.

906
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,201
- Yes, it's wisdom in life. - Right.

907
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:16,431
Being scolded well is important.

908
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:17,542
Of course.

909
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:19,442
It's impossible not to be scolded.

910
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,341
Open your eyes pathetically.

911
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:22,441
Right.

912
00:30:22,442 --> 00:30:23,711
You have to be scolded with skills.

913
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:25,341
Your eyes must be out of focus.

914
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:28,112
(An example of a married man getting out of a crisis)

915
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:30,111
So there are tactics.

916
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:31,651
(1. Korean-style food menu at a Chinese restaurant)

917
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:33,352
(2. Prices that aren't profitable, 3. Enough dust for 2 years)

918
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:35,752
- I bet he gets a lot of business. - I think so too.

919
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:37,722
Si An, wasn't it difficult being on "Single's Inferno?"

920
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,161
- I had a lot of fun. - Really?

921
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:43,292
I got a dopamine rush while I was on the show.

922
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:47,261
- It must have suited you. - It was fun.

923
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,272
(Gasping)

924
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,732
Do you like having casual relationships?

925
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:54,072
(An unexpected question in Mimi's language)

926
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:56,511
- She gets a dopamine rush. - "Do you like casual relationship?"

927
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,741
I hate the ambiguity before getting into a relationship.

928
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:02,281
Here's a reason why I don't watch dating shows.

929
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:03,512
It's difficult to watch.

930
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:06,121
I'm someone who hates competition.

931
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:07,222
Me too.

932
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:10,452
- I got a piece of information. - What information?

933
00:31:10,962 --> 00:31:12,061
They're asking...

934
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:14,231
if you hate competition because you always lose.

935
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:16,261
(Information recently received from Mr. Jee)

936
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:17,932
(He has nothing to say.)

937
00:31:18,132 --> 00:31:21,072
He loses all the time, so he hates it.

938
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:24,132
This year is almost over already.

939
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:25,942
Isn't it getting aired on Christmas?

940
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:28,041
It's so sad.

941
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:30,111
My heart doesn't flutter even though it's Christmas.

942
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:31,642
(A married man who became mellow)

943
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:35,081
Before we got married,

944
00:31:35,082 --> 00:31:36,982
on Christmas, Seok Sam and I...

945
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:39,822
We didn't go anywhere special.

946
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:42,691
- We probably went to a nightclub. - We went clubbing.

947
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,152
- So you did something. - It's so special.

948
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:46,521
Doesn't it mean that you went somewhere?

949
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:48,661
Going to a nightclub isn't anything special.

950
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:49,691
We had fun alone.

951
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,802
- We just had fun alone. - We were drenched in sweat.

952
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:53,831
- All we did was dance hard. - I mean...

953
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:56,432
There was a sense of anticipation in the beginning.

954
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:57,971
When I realized that it wouldn't work,

955
00:31:57,972 --> 00:31:59,142
I drenched myself in sweat.

956
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:01,071
"Drenched in sweat?"

957
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:03,011
(He can totally imagine it.)

958
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:04,912
That's the real "Single's Inferno."

959
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:07,282
No, it's simply inferno.

960
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:10,952
Those who remain were people like us.

961
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:14,921
Everyone was drenched in sweat.

962
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,021
(You too?)

963
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:17,151
All we did was dance instead of meeting girls.

964
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,162
They looked at us affectionately,

965
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,921
and we looked at them the same way.

966
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,131
(When they weren't competitive,)

967
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:23,362
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok exchanged sorrowful looks with others.)

968
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,261
At a Cheongnyangni nightclub,

969
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:26,931
I won second place in sexy dance competition.

970
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:29,402
- You did? - You don't need to share that.

971
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:33,272
Don't talk about sexy dance.

972
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:35,171
I'd hate to brag about that.

973
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,811
(Something shameful to share)

974
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:38,512
It's one of the awards I won.

975
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:40,641
I didn't win many awards in my life,

976
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:41,811
so it's memorable.

977
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:44,152
I'm sorry. I've never seen him disgusted.

978
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:46,182
We're at a market.

979
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:49,691
(They arrive at Cheonan Jungang Market.)

980
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:50,692
(Seafood)

981
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:51,991
(Traditional snacks)

982
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:53,422
(And fresh vegetables)

983
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,891
I love the vibe at a market.

984
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,931
(Cheonan Jungang Market at the heart of Cheonan)

985
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,201
They have a specialty in Cheonan...

986
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:01,272
- called ugly twisted donuts. - Are we stopping by?

987
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:02,872
(Exclaiming)

988
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:05,541
This is amazing.

989
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,641
(Twisted donuts at a market?)

990
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:07,971
- Be careful. - Hello.

991
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,612
(They can feel a warm atmosphere from the entrance.)

992
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:11,081
You know what was funny about the lady?

993
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:12,411
While saying hello to Seok Jin,

994
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:13,981
she said, "It's Yu Jae Seok."

995
00:33:13,982 --> 00:33:15,511
She was looking only at Jae Seok...

996
00:33:15,512 --> 00:33:16,982
- while holding hands... - While holding my hand.

997
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,251
(She grabbed Seok Jin's hand first.)

998
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:21,322
(Her eyes were fixed on Jae Seok.)

999
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,091
She held my hand,

1000
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:25,291
- She held Seok Jin's hand. - but she called out Jae Seok.

1001
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,391
(Jae Seok is the ladies' favorite at the market.)

1002
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:27,662
Here are the twisted donuts.

1003
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:30,461
- Isn't this a franchise? - It looks delicious.

1004
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:31,631
This is the original shop.

1005
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:33,502
It's the original?

1006
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:34,672
(Exclaiming)

1007
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,301
I've had so many of these.

1008

1009

(there are about 150 franchise shops in the country.)

1011
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:44,381
(Even in other countries like the US and Malaysia,)

1012
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:46,512
(it created a Korean twisted donut craze.)

1013
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:48,081

1015

- Hello, they look delicious. - Hello.

1018
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:02,191
- My goodness. - Hello.

1019
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,292
Hello.

1020
00:34:03,462 --> 00:34:04,661
Is this where you started?

1021
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:06,431
- I started inside the market. - Inside the market?

1022
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,802
It was at a tiny stall.

1023
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:11,601
I heard that we can also find them abroad.

1024
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:13,941
Our shops are in the US and Malaysia.

1025
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:15,912
(Korean twisted donuts were launched to the US and Malaysia.)

1026
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:18,012
- May we try some? - Yes.

(How will Korean twisted donuts that sell abroad taste?)

1028
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,081
(Sixth Sense members moved to the 2nd floor.)

1029

(The unpleasant story of Beom's sexy dance award)

1031
00:34:29,922 --> 00:34:31,861
- It was unpleasant. - How so?

1032
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,862
(What's wrong with the sexy dance competition?)

1033
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,361
We know what type of performance it is.

1034
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:37,932
- Right. - Yes.

1035
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:39,701
To win second place,

1036
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,832
don't you have to take off your top?

1037
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,842
You have to take off your top at least.

1038
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:47,541
What kind of dance did you do?

1039
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:49,972
One by one,

1040
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:52,011
- male dancers started... - They took off their clothes?

1041
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:53,682
to take off their clothes.

1042
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:54,952
So I also...

1043
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:57,752
took off my clothes and kicked a lot.

1044
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:00,422
Along with the music.

1045
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:03,251
What kind of music was it?

1046
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,722
The rhythm went like this.

1047

(Cheongnyangni Night Club Sexy Dance Competition)

The twisted donuts are here.

1053

- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

1054
00:35:23,272 --> 00:35:24,641
- Thank you. - He started at a tiny stall.

1055
00:35:24,642 --> 00:35:25,642
Yes.

1056
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:28,051
- They smell so sweet. - What if we can't finish them?

1057
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:30,551
This is the signature donut.

1058
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,522
- Are these twisted donuts? - Yes.

1059
00:35:33,022 --> 00:35:34,791
These are twisted donuts with green onions.

1061

1064
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:43,131
If you don't mind asking,

1065
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:45,402
how much are the annual sales?

1066
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:49,632
There are about 150 shops in Korea.

1067
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,801
The annual sales are about 20 million dollars.

1068
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:53,701
(About 150 shops in Korea, annual sales of 20 million dollars)

1069
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,611
Annual sales of 20 million dollars?

1070
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,882
We continue to create the legend of 3,000 dollars.

1071
00:35:58,242 --> 00:35:59,312
Congratulations.

1072
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,382
Jae Seok, have you heard this?

1073
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:02,911
He was even invited to be on "You Quiz on the Block."

1074
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:03,951
- Really? - Is that so?

1075
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:05,751
Due to our shop opening in San Diego,

1076
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:07,021
I couldn't attend.

1077
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:08,222
I see.

1078
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,451
He was invited to "You Quiz on the Block,"

1079
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:12,221
- but he had a schedule conflict. - Right.

1080
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:13,222
He must be very busy.

1081
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:14,861
- I'd love to go on the show. - I see.

1082
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:16,892
(Speaking of which, I'd love to go on the show.)

1083
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,132
One more time...

1084
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,501
He'd like one more chance.

1085
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:20,502
(Flustered)

1086
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:22,102
I'm not in charge of invitations.

1087
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:24,201
As my business grows,

1088
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:25,872
I also do a lot of community service.

1089
00:36:26,002 --> 00:36:27,471
We live in a world together.

1090
00:36:27,472 --> 00:36:29,912
Once I was very successful.

1091
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:32,582
When I went bankrupt, I worked at a gas station pumping gas.

1092
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:34,851
(While listening to the owner's inspiring story of growth,)

1093
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:37,312
(a thought suddenly comes to mind.)

1094
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:39,581
He's being interviewed here instead of on "You Quiz on the Block."

1095
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:43,421
(He must have regretted a lot.)

1096
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,091
He regrets not being able to go on the show...

1097
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,321
due to his schedule conflict.

1098
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:47,791
So he's doing it here.

1099
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,732
I wonder if I should ask him a few questions.

1100
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:51,961
(Feeling shy but wanting to go on "You Quiz on the Block")

1101
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,132
- We will enjoy them. - Thank you.

1102
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:56,602
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1103
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:57,901
Sir, you don't have to...

1104
00:36:57,902 --> 00:36:59,942
We can get them ourselves.

1105
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,412
Are you aiming for "You Quiz on the Block?"

1106
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:03,672
No.

1107
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:05,481
That's not it.

1108
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:06,482
(Feeling shy but wanting to go on "You Quiz on the Block")

1109
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,252
- He doesn't have the authority. - Right.

1110
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:11,422
I'm not in charge of inviting guests.

1111
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:12,881
(The owner who hopes to be...)

1112
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:13,981
(on "You Quiz on the Block" leaves.)

1113
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,852
Thank you for the donuts.

1114
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:17,752
It's still warm.

1115
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:23,232
(Freshly made twisted donuts have to be delicious.)

1116
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:25,902
(In love with the sweet taste of twisted donuts)

1117
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:27,261
Try it.

1118
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:28,701
This is really good.

1119
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:29,702
(Humming)

1120
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:33,342
(A taste that makes you gasp in admiration)

1121
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:36,172
We don't use eggs or milk when making twisted donuts.

1122
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,112
There's no need to worry about allergens.

1123
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,882
The glutinous rice makes the twisted donuts taste light.

1124
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,052
They're easy to digest and delicious.

1125
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:45,822
I want to try the round one.

1126
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:49,251
(Si An tries the sweet potato ball.)

1127
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:50,321
Cream cheese.

1128
00:37:50,322 --> 00:37:51,362
Si An.

1129
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,732
Aren't you getting full?

1130
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:57,661
You seem to be eating a small one because you're full.

1131
00:37:57,662 --> 00:37:58,901
I'm not full.

1132
00:37:58,902 --> 00:37:59,931
(Flustered)

1133
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:01,802
You're eating less and less.

1134
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:03,171
Stay strong.

1135
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:05,272
We're going to the second place next.

1136
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:08,641
We still have the 2nd and 3rd place to go,

1137
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,941
so I'm trying to eat small amounts.

1138
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:12,041
A moment ago, Seok Jin...

1139
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,142
How did you get invited to be on "Single's Inferno?"

1140
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:18,721
The writer reached out to me through social media.

1141
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,022
- After seeing your page? - Yes, my social media page.

1142
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:23,152
Did you want to be on the show the second you received the offer?

1143
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:26,462
I had received offers for previous seasons as well.

1144
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:28,362
They kept asking until you finally said yes.

1145
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,831
I was dating someone at the time, so...

1146
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:33,101
You were in a relationship.

1147
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,531
You have to be single...

1148
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:36,531
- to be on the show. - Nicely done.

1149
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:37,601
How honest of you.

1150
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,702
- How honest of you. - Of course!

1151
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:41,271
Did any of your exes contact you...

1152
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:42,942
after you appeared on the show?

1153
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:44,741
- They did. - Of course they did.

1154
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:47,541
At least one of them would've contacted her for sure.

1155
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,551
- Of course. - Absolutely.

1156
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:50,552
Did he contact you so you two could be on "EXchange?"

1157
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:53,222
Come on.

1158
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,821
How could I not react to that?

1159
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:57,822
(The sexy guy's heart is racing.)

1160
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,662
I had to ask. I couldn't help it.

1161
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:03,032
We were just mentioning how sincere she was, but you...

1162
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:04,861
It'd be weird to use it as an opportunity...

1163
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:06,362
to be on "EXchange."

1164
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:10,231
I apologize a lot today.

1165
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:13,172
(Hilarious)

1166
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:16,572
Beom mentioned one of the awards he had won.

1167
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:18,241
He finished in second place...

1168
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:19,542
at the Cheongnyangni nightclub sexy dance competition.

1169
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:22,351
Mimi, have you won any awards?

1170
00:39:22,352 --> 00:39:25,121
I got a participation award in an art competition.

1171
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:27,251
- Also one for perfect attendance. - Perfect attendance?

1172
00:39:27,252 --> 00:39:29,092
- Right. - Is there anything you won?

1173
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:30,252
What?

1174
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:31,621
What awards have you won?

1175
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,021
I got an award for perfect attendance,

1176
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:36,932
and a few more from school competitions, but none from outside.

1177
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,332
I was elected class president.

1178
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:41,062
Every year?

1179
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,901
Every year until sixth grade.

1180
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:43,971
(He was elected class president from grades 2 through 6.)

1181
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:45,302
From grades 2 through 6.

1182
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:48,042
- Wait, that's no small feat. - It's not.

1183
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:49,241
Were you also the student body president?

1184
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:50,342
(Was he also the student body president?)

1185
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:54,012
I'm afraid I was busy when that election took place.

1186
00:39:55,712 --> 00:39:57,452
What could you have been busy with?

1187
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,252
There was some trouble at home.

1188
00:40:00,452 --> 00:40:01,751
(His family situation suddenly changed.)

1189
00:40:01,752 --> 00:40:03,652
- How could you have been busy? - There was trouble at home,

1190
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,161
so I never ran in the election.

1191
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,362
- You're stuck with class president. - Yes, just that.

1192
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:10,392
(That's ridiculous.)

1193
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,162
Kyung Pyo, what about you?

1194
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:14,001
- As for me... - Art, right?

1195
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:16,972
Yes, I entered art competitions and science fairs in elementary school.

1196
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:19,102
Hold on. Were you good at art?

1197
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,811
I never took lessons or anything, but I guess I was born talented.

1198
00:40:21,812 --> 00:40:24,072
I recently held my own exhibition.

1199
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,011
- Look at you being smug. - Right.

1200
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:27,541
(Artist Ko held his own exhibition last summer.)

1201
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:30,682
I see it's a day of shameless bragging today.

1202
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:33,221
I dropped out of college as an art major.

1203
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,321
- You? - Really?

1204
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:35,322
- Really? - He...

1205
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:37,722
I competed at the regional level.

1206
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:40,221
I entered competitions across the entire province.

1207
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:41,362
(An elite artist who competed in North Jeolla Province)

1208
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:43,832
- Could you draw Seok Sam? - Could you draw me?

1209
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:45,401
- Let's see. - Could you...

1210
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,202
- I could do that easily. - Really?

1211
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,671
Hold on. This would be great.

1212
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:51,201
(Seeing how confident he is, they prepare art supplies for him.)

1213
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,271
- Could you draw him? - Draw me, then.

1214
00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:55,841
My portrait of Park Myung Soo...

1215
00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:57,271
- went viral online. - Really?

1216
00:40:57,272 --> 00:41:00,212
- For real? - I know which drawing that is.

1217
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,581
Can I have a pen too? I'll draw him as well.

1218
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:03,951
(Artist Ko will also draw a portrait of Seok Sam.)

1219
00:41:03,952 --> 00:41:05,582
Sure thing. Mimi, you too.

1220
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:08,351
- I'll draw him too. - Sounds like fun.

1221
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,852
- Do you mean it? - But I'm not...

1222
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,022
- Draw Seok Sam, everyone. - Draw me.

1223
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:13,521
(The Jee Seok Sam Drawing Competition begins.)

1224
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:14,662
I can't wait to see how they do.

1225
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:17,191
You should draw me too. I bet it'll be funny.

1226
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,762
I'm the worst at drawing.

1227
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,362
- Give it a shot. - Should I?

1228
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,632
(Lastly, Si An enters the drawing competition.)

1229
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,901
(What artworks will be created today?)

1230
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,872
I have zero interest in drawing your hair.

1231
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:31,841
- I'm all done. - Mimi's done.

1232
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:32,942
Really?

1233
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:34,112
I'm done as well.

1234
00:41:34,113 --> 00:41:35,251
(Artist Ko finishes second.)

1235
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:36,312
Thanks!

1236
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,781
- Woo Jong! - That looks great.

1237
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:39,451
- This is Jo Woo Jong. - That looks like Jo Woo Jong.

1238
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:41,351
(The drawing looks a lot like the announcer Jo Woo Jong.)

1239
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:43,521
Thank you so much.

1240
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:46,222
(Seok Sam is pleased with Kyung Pyo's drawing.)

1241
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:49,292
- Mimi did great as well. - Check out Mimi's work.

1242
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:50,931
No way!

1243
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:52,932
(Copy and paste)

1244
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:54,871
(Wow!)

1245
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:56,372
That looks like a caricature.

1246
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,071
Could you sign this and give it to me?

1247
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:01,202
(He's pleased enough that he wants it signed.)

1248
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:02,911
Let's see Beom's work next.

1249
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:04,811
My paper was small,

1250
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:06,742
so I focused on his facial features.

1251
00:42:07,142 --> 00:42:10,752
(What does the elite artist's drawing of Seok Jin look like?)

1252
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:13,982
Why?

1253
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:17,821
(A shocking hyperrealistic style)

1254
00:42:17,822 --> 00:42:19,721
What the...

1255
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:21,692
What's with all the wrinkles?

1256
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:23,761
Doesn't he look a bit dark?

1257
00:42:23,762 --> 00:42:25,201
He looks sleazy.

1258
00:42:25,202 --> 00:42:27,032
Do you know what this looks like?

1259
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,501
It looks like the guy in the back of the club...

1260
00:42:29,502 --> 00:42:32,601
watching the sexy dance competition.

1261
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:33,971
(An old man watching the sexy dance competition)

1262
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:35,742
You drew an old man watching the sexy dance competition.

1263
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,242
It's very similar to what I drew.

1264
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:41,312
(What am I seeing?)

1265
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:45,252
- Is this an alien? - That doesn't look like me at all.

1266
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:48,221
- I focused on his big nose, - That's not me.

1267
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:49,751
- and added on to that. - But it's...

1268
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:51,621
- Mine's a lot like his. - I look kind of sleazy.

1269
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:54,791
Mimi and Beom's drawings are complete opposites of each other.

1270
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:55,891
They're complete opposites. Just look.

1271
00:42:55,892 --> 00:42:58,762
The way they see Seok Jin is reflected in their work.

1272
00:42:59,232 --> 00:43:01,431
Si An sees Seok Jin...

1273
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:03,172
as an alien.

1274
00:43:03,502 --> 00:43:04,702
She has no interest in me at all.

1275
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:09,472
Kyung Pyo sees Seok Jin as a nice older guy.

1276
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:13,341
To Mimi, Seok Jin is a sweet older guy.

1277
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:14,342
- True. - A benevolent...

1278
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,851
Beom sees Seok Jin as kind of creepy...

1279
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:18,752
- A sleaze. - and secretive.

1280
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:22,192
It looks like a composite sketch of a suspect.

1281
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,422
- Isn't that a mugshot? - A mugshot?

1282
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:27,722
You guys are all good at drawing!

1283
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:29,831
Shall we head to the next location then?

1284
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:31,561
- Sure. - We got a wide variety of drawings.

1285
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:33,802
(The hilarious first Jee Seok Sam drawing competition is over.)

1286
00:43:33,932 --> 00:43:34,932
Aren't we having...

1287
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:36,332
- a Korean set menu next? - We are.

1288
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:39,171
This is called Minarit-gil.

1289
00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:40,772
- So this is the place. - What?

1290
00:43:41,772 --> 00:43:43,472
- Minarit-gil? - I've heard of it before.

1291
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:45,342
Minarit-gil Mural Village.

1292
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:48,352
- The whole neighborhood... - Look at all these murals.

1293
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:51,721
There's one here.

1294
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:52,722
(Murals lining the neighborhood walls)

1295
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:54,881
This was done as part of the urban regeneration project.

1296
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,451
I heard they painted a lot of murals.

1297
00:43:56,452 --> 00:43:58,621
They were intentionally painted throughout Minarit-gil.

1298
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:00,362
(Minarit-gil was transformed into a beautiful cultural space.)

1299
00:44:01,322 --> 00:44:03,762
(It is now a popular photo spot in Cheonan.)

1300
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:05,262
This place is...

1301
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:06,762
These are pretty.

1302
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:08,932
Wait, that's a tiger.

1303
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:12,642
(On one side of the alley, a tiger looks ready to pounce.)

1304
00:44:12,672 --> 00:44:16,242
- It's a tiger. - Doesn't the tiger look flat?

1305
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:18,042
I think it looks like Beom.

1306
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:20,582
- It kind of looks like you. - I think it looks like Beom.

1307
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,051
Why does it look so flat?

1308
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:23,411
(He's one to talk.)

1309
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,252
- How did it turn out this way? - It does seem flat.

1310
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:29,852
- Beom also means tiger. - You're right, and he's Kwak Beom.

1311
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,121
That's Beom getting scolded by his wife.

1312
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:35,091
- That's me. - That's Beom.

1313
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:36,132
(Let's see.)

1314
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,231
"What did you buy this time?"

1315
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:39,232
(The latest release)

1316
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:40,262
"Take it and leave!"

1317
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:42,802
- That'd be his expression. - "Take it and leave."

1318
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,801
(While looking at the murals)

1319
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:47,002
Here's a shaman.

1320
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,272
"A shaman who always gets it right, despite not knowing your birthday."

1321
00:44:50,842 --> 00:44:54,112
(A shaman's shop sign catches Seok Jin's eye.)

1322
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,481
- They're all fortune tellers. - I know.

1323
00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:57,582
That's what "possessed" means.

1324
00:44:58,182 --> 00:44:59,281
- Could a possessed person... - That's what it is.

1325
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:01,522
- be a cook? - The cook must be a shaman.

1326
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:03,352
You're right. They're all shrines.

1327
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,091
Did "possessed" refer to a shaman?

1328
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:07,122
(There are a lot of shrines on Minarit-gil.)

1329
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:08,991
- Maybe she runs a restaurant... - A restaurant?

1330
00:45:08,992 --> 00:45:11,462
and works as a shaman in the afternoon.

1331
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:14,601
This seems fake to me.

1332
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:15,732
- Right? - Yes.

1333
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:18,231
It feels too forced to be real.

1334
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,242
(Is Possessed Korean Set Menu just made up?)

1335
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,541
Is this the place?

1336
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:21,671
(The second restaurant is at the end of Minarit-gil.)

1337
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:22,812
What is it?

1338
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:23,942
This is it.

1339
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:25,311
- What on earth? - This is scaring me.

1340
00:45:25,312 --> 00:45:26,312
What is this place?

1341
00:45:26,912 --> 00:45:28,342
(What?)

1342
00:45:28,452 --> 00:45:29,682
Nymph Ssanghwa!

1343
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,351
That's the real deal.

1344
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:32,582
It really is a shrine.

1345
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:35,122
It's a real shrine.

1346
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,421
(They finally arrive at the restaurant...)

1347
00:45:37,422 --> 00:45:39,162
(serving the Possessed Korean Set Menu.)

1348
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:43,631
(From the outside, it looks like an ordinary shrine.)

1349
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:45,962
(Nymph Ssanghwa)

1350
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:50,072
(What exactly is the Possessed Korean Set Menu?)

1351
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:51,571
Second floor, guys.

1352
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:52,672
(The shrine is on the 2nd floor.)

1353
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,872
We were told they serve a Korean set menu.

1354
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:56,311
That's what it said.

1355
00:45:56,312 --> 00:45:58,272
- Exactly. They serve a set menu. - They serve a Korean set menu.

1356
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:02,081
I can smell incense in the air.

1357
00:46:02,082 --> 00:46:03,612
I do too.

1358
00:46:04,252 --> 00:46:06,121
(The stairs to the shrine...)

1359
00:46:06,122 --> 00:46:08,651
(are filled with the smell of incense.)

1360
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:10,321
(Looking behind him)

1361
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:11,552
Hush.

1362
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:14,861
- Hello. - Hello.

1363
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:15,931
No way.

1364
00:46:15,932 --> 00:46:17,162
This is it.

1365
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,461
Goodness. Hello.

1366
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:19,932
- Hello. - Hello.

1367
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:21,601
- No way. - We thought this was...

1368
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:22,871
a Korean restaurant.

1369
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:24,572
- I've never visited a shrine. - Me neither.

1370
00:46:25,672 --> 00:46:28,642
(What you wouldn't expect at a Korean restaurant)

1371
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,242
(Various ritual tools)

1372
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:32,512
(Nymphs in various forms)

1373
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:34,641
- Her energy is unreal. - Do you perform the readings?

1374
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:36,352
- Really? - Yes, my head's tingling.

1375
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:40,581
(Is this the restaurant with the Possessed Korean Set Menu?)

1376
00:46:40,582 --> 00:46:41,992
Why is it called the Possessed Korean Set Menu?

1377
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:45,621
We thought this was a Korean restaurant.

1378
00:46:45,622 --> 00:46:46,792
What's going on?

1379
00:46:47,092 --> 00:46:49,531
A possessed Korean Set Menu is what you get.

1380
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:51,491
I do readings on the second floor...

1381
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,801
and serve a Korean set menu downstairs...

1382
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:55,401
- based on the results. - What?

1383
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:57,772
(A Korean set menu is served according to her readings.)

1384
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,242
(You get a reading upstairs,)

1385
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,611
(then eat downstairs?)

1386
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,941
Is the meal designed to bring us luck?

1387
00:47:04,942 --> 00:47:07,411
First, I perform a reading.

1388
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:08,681
You've probably heard of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements.

1389
00:47:08,682 --> 00:47:10,211
The reading determines what energy you lack.

1390
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:12,621
- The food... - Do you serve meals?

1391
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,151
is served downstairs accordingly.

1392
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:16,921
(The food supplements the energy you lack.)

1393
00:47:16,922 --> 00:47:20,262
Hello, this is a fortune teller's shop in Cheonan...

1394
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:22,291
where we offer readings...

1395
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:26,562
and serve Korean set meals based on the results.

1396
00:47:29,232 --> 00:47:32,442
My mother and grandmother were shamans,

1397
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:34,602
and the power is passed down in the family.

1398
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:37,442
Being a shaman was not something I wanted at first.

1399
00:47:37,612 --> 00:47:41,182
Before all this, I worked a corporate job in food development.

1400
00:47:42,012 --> 00:47:44,611
Two years ago, spirits strongly marked me,

1401
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,452
and I was told that allowing them to possess me was my fate.

1402
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:49,651
I was torn between...

1403
00:47:49,652 --> 00:47:52,492
what I wanted to do and what I had to do,

1404
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:54,961
and that's how I ended up opening this place.

1405
00:47:54,962 --> 00:47:57,531
(She opened a Korean restaurant that allows her to perform readings.)

1406
00:47:57,532 --> 00:48:00,731
Instead of using rituals or talismans,

1407
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:02,631
the energy people lack is restored through food.

1408
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,232
(Energy is restored through food.)

1409
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:08,241
Yin-Yang and the Five Elements are closely tied to our internal organs,

1410
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:11,212
so customized meals are served downstairs.

1411
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:16,811
For example, someone who lacks water needs cold, salty food.

1412
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,581
so I recommend pork, cold soup,

1413
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:20,722
salted seafood and so on.

1414
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,891
On the contrary, if you lack fire,

1415
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:25,361
you need something warm and bitter,

1416
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,991
so I recommend food like duck, red bean porridge,

1417
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:30,031
and acorn jelly, which helps with blood circulation.

1418
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,491
(If you lack fire, she recommends food that's warm and bitter.)

1419
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,562
We only take reservations.

1420
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:36,401
We accept 2 to 3 teams a day.

1421
00:48:36,402 --> 00:48:39,072
Recently, we became a bit famous,

1422
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:42,771
so we're fully booked for the next three months.

1423
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:44,712
(Fully booked for 3 months)

1424
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:49,352
(It's a popular restaurant with a lot of reviews on social media.)

1425
00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:51,012
Sixth Sense members,

1426
00:48:51,252 --> 00:48:53,381
is this place real?

1427
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:57,822
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1428
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,322
How long has it been since you started this?

1429
00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:04,191
I accepted the spirit in August, 2023.

1430
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,631
- That was two years ago. - Yes.

1431
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:07,901
The spiritual power would be at its strongest now.

1432
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:09,201
- You're right. - That's right.

1433
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,131
Before you accepted the spirit,

1434
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:12,642
what did you work as?

1435
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:15,271
I graduated from the Department of Food and Nutrition.

1436
00:49:15,272 --> 00:49:16,412
- Really? - That's why.

1437
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,071
And...

1438
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:20,311
I worked at...

1439
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:21,481
- As a nutritionist. - a food company.

1440
00:49:21,482 --> 00:49:23,482
No, I was in the development team.

1441
00:49:24,152 --> 00:49:25,651
- Food development team. - Food development team.

1442
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:26,652
Yes.

1443
00:49:27,282 --> 00:49:30,321
- Do you cook yourself here? - That's right.

1444
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:32,022
(She cooks here herself.)

1445
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:34,261
This is actually very difficult.

1446
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,561
Changing the menu based on the customers'...

1447
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:36,631
- fortunes and constitutions... - That's right.

1448
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:37,731
- That's right. - Yes.

1449
00:49:37,732 --> 00:49:38,901
That isn't easy.

1450
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:40,401
Overall, I'm sorry to say this, but I don't think...

1451
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:42,402
- you can cover the cost. - I don't think so too.

1452
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:43,771
Do you get some dishes...

1453
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,301
from a side dish store?

1454
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:46,801
(Laughing)

1455
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:48,671
- When she's too busy... - Yes, when she's too busy.

1456
00:49:48,672 --> 00:49:50,511
- Just some side dishes. - Just some side dishes.

1457
00:49:50,512 --> 00:49:52,442
I make my own side dishes. And...

1458
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:55,612
there are just two main menus,

1459
00:49:55,682 --> 00:49:57,811
so they aren't that hard to prepare.

1460
00:49:57,812 --> 00:49:59,951
If I have too many customers,

1461
00:49:59,952 --> 00:50:02,622
I call in a helper just for that day.

1462
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:04,052
So it isn't that difficult.

1463
00:50:04,522 --> 00:50:05,891
In that case,

1464
00:50:05,892 --> 00:50:08,931
I'm curious about the price of the menu.

1465
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:12,461
Actually, I don't sell the food on its own.

1466
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:14,731
Both the fortune telling and the food...

1467
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:16,331
- cost 100 dollars. - It's 100 dollars?

1468
00:50:16,332 --> 00:50:17,771
- Really? - Yes.

1469
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:19,902
Then if she has 3 to 4 teams per day...

1470
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:22,442
- About 300... - Since it's 100 dollars per person.

1471
00:50:23,372 --> 00:50:25,411
Since we're here...

1472
00:50:25,412 --> 00:50:27,442
We can't all have our fortunes read.

1473
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:29,211
Shall we go with Beom?

1474
00:50:29,212 --> 00:50:31,452
(Beom is the first to try.)

1475
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,551
(Resolute)

1476
00:50:34,552 --> 00:50:35,621
- Are you trying to beat her? - You look like...

1477
00:50:35,622 --> 00:50:37,391
you're in a competition.

1478
00:50:37,392 --> 00:50:39,062
I, well...

1479
00:50:39,522 --> 00:50:40,791
I have...

1480
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:43,492
- Doubt. - a bit of doubt.

1481
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,402
(Is this a real fortune-telling shop?)

1482
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:49,171
- Firstly, - It's so fascinating.

1483
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,431
please tell me your name.

1484
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,441
It's Kwak Beom. My first name has one syllable.

1485
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:54,541
- One syllable. - Yes.

1486
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:56,372
- It's your real name. - Yes, it's my real name.

1487
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:58,072
Nowadays,

1488
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:00,082
even fortune telling is done using a tablet.

1489
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:02,712
- That's what they do nowadays. - She does everything on it.

1490
00:51:02,752 --> 00:51:03,911
Do you know what time you were born?

1491
00:51:03,912 --> 00:51:06,652
I was born between 2 to 3pm,

1492
00:51:06,722 --> 00:51:08,051
or so they assume.

1493
00:51:08,052 --> 00:51:09,251
- Assume? - Assume?

1494
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:10,252
They assume?

1495
00:51:10,253 --> 00:51:12,262
- Did you ask your mother? - She can't remember.

1496
00:51:13,222 --> 00:51:15,061
Let me explain.

1497
00:51:15,062 --> 00:51:17,261
Kwak Beom,

1498
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:18,462
you have the fortune of a tiger.

1499
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:20,731
- He looks like a tiger. - Yes.

1500
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:22,201
- There was a tiger just now. - Yes.

1501
00:51:22,202 --> 00:51:23,572
You're a tiger.

1502
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:25,501
Out of all tigers,

1503
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:26,901
you're a red tiger.

1504
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:28,911
- A Joseon tiger. - A Joseon tiger?

1505
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:30,912
You have the fortune of a Joseon tiger.

1506
00:51:31,342 --> 00:51:33,041
He does sexy dancing and stuff.

1507
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:34,181
(He sure is an ex-sexy dancer.)

1508
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:35,211
A red tiger.

1509
00:51:35,212 --> 00:51:36,681
Doesn't it say I'm a Cheongnyangni tiger?

1510
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:38,251
- A Cheongnyangni tiger. - It doesn't say that.

1511
00:51:38,252 --> 00:51:39,451
- You're a Joseon tiger. - Yes.

1512
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:42,021
And you can see here that your birth fortune...

1513
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:43,551
has earth.

1514
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:45,421
- This color represents earth. - I have earth?

1515
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:47,262
Yes, your fortune has earth.

1516
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:49,091
Such earth fortune...

1517
00:51:49,092 --> 00:51:50,092
is known as negative earth.

1518
00:51:50,093 --> 00:51:51,691
- Negative earth? - Negative earth.

1519
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,531
There are various types of earth.

1520
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,131
Negative earth...

1521
00:51:56,132 --> 00:51:57,232
is feminine.

1522
00:51:58,102 --> 00:52:00,841
- Do I have a feminine fortune? - Yes.

1523
00:52:00,842 --> 00:52:03,812
It's easier to understand when you call it a feminine fortune.

1524
00:52:04,442 --> 00:52:07,141
People with such fortune get totally whipped...

1525
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:08,682
when they get married.

1526
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:11,552
- He did mention that just now. - He said that just now.

1527
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:13,951
I call my wife once every hour.

1528
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:15,321
(Reporting to his wife)

1529
00:52:15,322 --> 00:52:16,351
- I see. - He reports to his wife.

1530
00:52:16,352 --> 00:52:18,791
Your fortune says you should be whipped.

1531
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:20,461
I agree. I feel at ease that way too.

1532
00:52:20,462 --> 00:52:21,462
- Right? - Yes.

1533
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:22,932
You'd feel comfortable living that way.

1534
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:25,231
And there's no water in your fortune.

1535
00:52:25,232 --> 00:52:26,931
There's no water. This varies...

1536
00:52:26,932 --> 00:52:28,872
from person to person,

1537
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:30,931
But in your fortune,

1538
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:32,072
water represents wealth.

1539
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:33,871
- He doesn't have wealth? - He doesn't have wealth?

1540
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:36,511
- You may earn a lot, - But he spends.

1541
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,971
but you'll spend as much as you earn.

1542
00:52:37,972 --> 00:52:39,581
- She's a psychic. - How does she...

1543
00:52:39,582 --> 00:52:41,211
- You talked about shopping. - Yes.

1544
00:52:41,212 --> 00:52:43,182
And raising two kids costs a lot.

1545
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,982
How do you know that?

1546
00:52:46,252 --> 00:52:47,252
Your fortune...

1547
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:48,551
It's not that I know it. Your fortune tells me that.

1548
00:52:48,552 --> 00:52:50,051
We talked about it on our way here.

1549
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:51,252
(It's his birth fortune until here.)

1550
00:52:51,622 --> 00:52:52,691
When I focus,

1551
00:52:52,692 --> 00:52:55,161
I can see something.

1552
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:57,391
Since you came here, I've been seeing it.

1553
00:52:57,392 --> 00:52:58,562
(There's something I can see when I focus.)

1554
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,831
Since you came here, I've been seeing it.

1555
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:02,402
- She kept looking at me. - Yes.

1556
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,571
- Her stare is scary. - There was a kind of vision...

1557
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:04,972
I could see.

1558
00:53:06,002 --> 00:53:07,172
Let me check.

1559
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:08,472
You're in trouble.

1560
00:53:08,802 --> 00:53:10,471
If you're hiding something, confess now.

1561
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:12,012
(She picks up her ritual tools.)

1562
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:20,122
(She starts the ritual.)

1563
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:21,751
Dear spirit,

1564
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:24,491
born in November 1, 1986...

1565
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,021
is Kwak Beom.

1566
00:53:26,022 --> 00:53:27,022
(Shaking the bells while reciting the spell-like phrase)

1567
00:53:33,062 --> 00:53:34,531
You bought something big recently, didn't you?

1568
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:37,732
(You bought something big recently, didn't you?)

1569
00:53:37,772 --> 00:53:38,772
What did you buy?

1570
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:40,642
(Really?)

1571
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:44,312
The spirit says you shouldn't wear it or ride it.

1572
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:46,681
- He can't wear it or ride it? - He can't wear it or ride it?

1573
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,212
What is it? What did you buy?

1574
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:50,481
- Did you buy clothes? - Suddenly?

1575
00:53:50,482 --> 00:53:51,951
- I bought a motorcycle. - I knew it.

1576
00:53:51,952 --> 00:53:53,721
- Oh, my gosh. - You bought a motorcycle?

1577
00:53:53,722 --> 00:53:55,752
You might get injured. You should sell it.

1578
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:58,551
- Are you serious? Do you mean it? - Did you really buy it?

1579
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,021
- A motorcycle... - Are you serious?

1580
00:54:00,022 --> 00:54:01,792
It's bigger than a motorcycle.

1581
00:54:02,392 --> 00:54:03,561
- Sorry? - It's something bigger.

1582
00:54:03,562 --> 00:54:05,032
- What? - Is there anything bigger?

1583
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,401
- Sorry? - It's something bigger.

1584
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:07,732
Is there anything bigger?

1585
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:10,101
- What can you ride? - What did you buy?

1586
00:54:10,102 --> 00:54:12,231
- I signed a contract... - What contract?

1587
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:13,302
to buy an electric car.

1588
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:15,072
An electric car...

1589
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:16,671
Did you sign a contract for an electric car?

1590
00:54:16,672 --> 00:54:17,972
- I only signed the contract... - Brother.

1591
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:19,681
- I only signed the contract... - Brother.

1592
00:54:19,682 --> 00:54:22,581
Something really bad might happen if you buy it.

1593
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:23,982
- The electric car? - How does she know that?

1594
00:54:24,612 --> 00:54:26,551
You really shouldn't ride it.

1595
00:54:26,552 --> 00:54:27,682
(Her voice becomes adamant.)

1596
00:54:28,052 --> 00:54:29,552
Why don't you change the engine?

1597
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:30,822
No, this...

1598
00:54:30,823 --> 00:54:32,122
Did you tell anyone about this?

1599
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:33,921
Only I know about this.

1600
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:34,961
How does she know?

1601
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:36,791
I signed the contract on the website on my own.

1602
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:39,031
How does she know this? I kept it a secret...

1603
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:40,261
- from my wife too. - Does your wife know about it?

1604
00:54:40,262 --> 00:54:41,431
I was going to tell her later...

1605
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:42,601
- when it arrived. - You bought so many things.

1606
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:43,731
- You bought a motorcycle too. - Exactly.

1607
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:45,801
The motorcycle was my dream for a long time.

1608
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:46,872
I ride it with my wife.

1609
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:50,271
If she's fake, the staff could've gotten the information beforehand...

1610
00:54:50,272 --> 00:54:52,241
- and told her. - Exactly.

1611
00:54:52,242 --> 00:54:54,412
His manager could've told them.

1612
00:54:54,512 --> 00:54:56,111
But Beom never told anyone.

1613
00:54:56,112 --> 00:54:58,181
- You shouldn't ride it. - You shouldn't.

1614
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:00,281
You really shouldn't buy it.

1615
00:55:00,282 --> 00:55:02,121
And beside that,

1616
00:55:02,122 --> 00:55:03,551
I keep saying this,

1617
00:55:03,552 --> 00:55:04,952
but why do I keep seeing a leg?

1618
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,092
A leg?

1619
00:55:06,822 --> 00:55:08,022
- A leg? - What?

1620
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,862
- He injured his leg. - He's injured.

1621
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:13,561
You have a lot of accident-related fortune this year.

1622
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:14,602
Accident-related fortune.

1623
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:16,972
I'm so scared.

1624
00:55:17,672 --> 00:55:19,001
I did get hurt a lot this year.

1625
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:20,241
There's another one beside that.

1626
00:55:20,242 --> 00:55:21,401
There's another accident-related fortune.

1627
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:22,912
Did you get involved in another accident recently?

1628
00:55:23,742 --> 00:55:26,212
After she shakes the bells,

1629
00:55:26,412 --> 00:55:27,881
- she gets possessed, I think. - I think so.

1630
00:55:27,882 --> 00:55:28,942
Oh, yes.

1631
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:30,851
- What? I didn't catch that. - What is it?

1632
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:32,281
- What? Sorry, I didn't hear. - What is it?

1633
00:55:32,282 --> 00:55:33,421
- What is it? - You better be careful, brother.

1634
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:35,051
- It wasn't a big accident. - What was it?

1635
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:37,122
I went on a family trip to Japan.

1636
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:38,921
Since our car was right-hand drive,

1637
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,961
- I couldn't get used to it. - Did you have a car accident?

1638
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,792
I didn't secure enough space on the left...

1639
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:44,691
- and scratched... - You scratched the car?

1640
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:46,602
the left side of the car. And that...

1641
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:48,032
cost me...

1642
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:50,101
- about 6,000 dollars in Japan. - Oh, my gosh.

1643
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:51,402
- You had to pay yourself? - Yes.

1644
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:53,301
- There was no other way. - The money...

1645
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:55,002
- keeps leaking out. - The money keeps leaking out.

1646
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,271
- How does she know that? - Exactly.

1647
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:57,541
But she's right.

1648
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,872
- How... - You should be careful.

1649
00:55:59,082 --> 00:56:00,241
But...

1650
00:56:00,242 --> 00:56:02,181
if it weren't you, your family would've been hurt.

1651
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,181
(If the accident didn't happen,)

1652
00:56:04,182 --> 00:56:06,222
(other family member could've gotten hurt.)

1653
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,451
- Is it better that I got hurt? - Yes.

1654
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:08,881
I think it's better that you got hurt.

1655
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,222
Or your family member could've gotten hurt a lot worse.

1656
00:56:11,352 --> 00:56:12,892
- And... - Recently...

1657
00:56:13,962 --> 00:56:17,032
(What happened this time?)

1658
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,039
If it weren't you, your family would've been hurt.

1659
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,079
(If the accident didn't happen,)

1660
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,150
(other family member could've gotten hurt.)

1661
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,220
- Is it better that I got hurt? - Yes.

1662
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:25,679
I think it's better that you got hurt.

1663
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,120
Or your family member could've gotten hurt a lot worse.

1664
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,760
- And... - Recently...

1665
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,159
(What happened this time?)

1666
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,960
My daughter played dodgeball in school.

1667
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,360
My younger daughter.

1668
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,330
She picked up a ball...

1669
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,069
and turned, and as soon as she did,

1670
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,270
- the bug screen... - It fell?

1671
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,799
The window frame fell.

1672
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,040
- Oh, my gosh. - So...

1673
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,909
- Had she not turned... - If the timing wasn't right,

1674
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,080
- she could've gotten hurt. - That was a close call.

1675
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,449
The school changed all the window frames recently...

1676
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,880
because of what happened to her.

1677
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,449
- What happened to your leg... - I’m better off...

1678
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,889
- was for the best. - getting hurt.

1679
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,090
(Yes, it's for the best that you hurt your leg.)

1680
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,759
Then... Hold on.

1681
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,090
Shall we change to Si An?

1682
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,719
Si An, come forward.

1683
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,460
(Next is Si An's turn.)

1684
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,359
I mean...

1685
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360
For me...

1686
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,469
I signed the contract...

1687
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,769
on my own without telling my wife.

1688
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,839
- Nobody knows? - I did it on my phone.

1689
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,539
I actually thought...

1690
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,709
she might know about it...

1691
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,539
- because the staff... - I think...

1692
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,439
- asked your manager about it. - he told them about it.

1693
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,840
But you did it yourself.

1694
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,479
I'm so nervous. Hold on.

1695
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,579
(Is it real?)

1696
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,519
That was scary.

1697
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,880
(She even guessed Beom's contract with her psychic power.)

1698
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,819
(I'm so nervous.)

1699
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,449
I'll explain it to you.

1700
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,720
You have the same earth as him.

1701
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,560
I said we hit it off.

1702
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,360
That's irrelevant.

1703
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,230
She's cold.

1704
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,099
(Upset)

1705
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,100
- She seems real. - Right?

1706
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,199
- It feels real. - The way she says things too.

1707
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,400
I think she's real.

1708
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,639
He had the fortune of negative earth.

1709
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,869
- Yes. - You're positive earth.

1710
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,039
- Positive earth. - Positive earth?

1711
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,839
- A big mountain. A masculine woman. - You're masculine.

1712
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,840
You're a masculine woman.

1713
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:00,579
- She's quite masculine. - She has the masculine vibe.

1714
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,019
And your fortune is the same as someone I read the fortune of...

1715
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,849
when I was in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu.

1716
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,850
You have the same fortune as Pak Se Ri.

1717
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,349
Park Se Ri?

1718
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,719
- The golfer. - Park Se Ri.

1719
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,419
Had you done sports when you were young,

1720
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,160
you'd have made a name for yourself.

1721
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,729
- I did do sports. - Didn't you...

1722
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,929
- swim? - I was a professional swimmer.

1723
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,359
- Really? - Yes.

1724
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,029
(Si An actually was a swimmer back in school.)

1725
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,400
But I wasn't good at it.

1726
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,869
- If I'd continued... - Another sports.

1727
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,669
- You should've done another sports. - You're right.

1728
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,509
- You should've continued. - Swimming wasn't for you.

1729
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,039
- I chose the wrong sports. - You should've played golf.

1730
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,380
- You'd have become a great golfer. - You should've played golf.

1731
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,079
And you're holding swords in each hand.

1732
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,120
- What? - What?

1733
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,379
It's called yanginsal.

1734
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,720
Back in the days, you couldn't have gotten married to a nobleman.

1735
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,489
- Then who can I marry? - But in the modern world,

1736
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,460
it's a very good fortune for a celebrity.

1737
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,360
- You're born to become one. - That's great news.

1738
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,159
Si An has a good fortune.

1739
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,300
And your fortune says you'll leave your house early.

1740
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,230
You must've become independent at a young age.

1741
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,669
Since I was 19, when I became a trainee,

1742
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,569
- I lived in a dorm away from home. - I see.

1743
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,639
That's early.

1744
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,340
See? Si An is destined to become a celebrity.

1745
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,849
And you too, since just now, I keep...

1746
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,880
What is it now?

1747
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,820
(Creeped out)

1748
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,550
(She picks up the bells again.)

1749
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,090
(She summons the nymph using the bell and the chant.)

1750
00:59:18,091 --> 00:59:20,359
Born in February 25, 1999...

1751
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,829
is Lee Si An.

1752
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,030
(She summons the nymph using the bell and the chant.)

1753
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,270
(Observing intently)

1754
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,540
- Her eyes changed. - You like stuff like this.

1755
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,540
- What do you mean? - Stuff like this.

1756
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,209
(Surprised)

1757
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,569
- What is it? - You like stuff like divination,

1758
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,380
- tarot cards, and fortune-telling. - Yes.

1759
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,880
But why do you do it so often?

1760
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,609
- Do you do it often? - Do I?

1761
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,610
How does she know that?

1762
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,749
That's not something she can find out.

1763
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:43,780
Why do you do it so often?

1764
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,989
Honey, you shouldn't have your fortune told so often.

1765
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,660
You have a singang fortune.

1766
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,059
It means you have a very strong fortune.

1767
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,389
(Singang fortune: A fortune with many positive Five Elements)

1768
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,730
(The person with this fortune is opinionated and stubborn.)

1769
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,859
Whenever you go for fortune telling, your energy is taken away.

1770
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,099
(Going for fortune telling often might take away her good energy.)

1771
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,469
So don't go too often and believe it blindly.

1772
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:01,500
And...

1773
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,040
- You're exactly like him. - In what sense?

1774
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,839
- You're exactly like him. - What do you mean?

1775
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,069
- I can't have that. - Her money leaks out.

1776
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,480
Your money leaks out. You spend too much.

1777
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,949
Dermatology and luxury goods.

1778
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,710
You spare no expense on grooming yourself.

1779
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,320
(Right on point)

1780
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,149
- She's changed. - Dermatology...

1781
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,089
- and luxury goods. - Her expression has changed.

1782
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,960
You spare no expense on grooming yourself.

1783
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,860
(Something really bad might happen if you buy it.)

1784
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:36,970
(Honey, you shouldn't have your fortune told so often.)

1785
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:40,269
(She addressed them differently.)

1786
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:44,240
(Is she a real shaman who serves multiple spirits?)

1787
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,580
You'll become successful anyhow.

1788
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:47,850
(Exclaiming)

1789
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,579
I feel sorry to say this,

1790
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,620
but your fortune is slightly better than Beom's.

1791
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,189
(You're suddenly saying that?)

1792
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,720
So you don't need to worry.

1793
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,890
But you worry too much.

1794
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,589
- I worry a lot. - You worry too much.

1795
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,099
(That's right.)

1796
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,999
And why do you rely so much on alcohol to relieve your stress?

1797
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,199
The spirit says you reek of alcohol.

1798
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,630
I don't drink at all.

1799
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,130
What are you talking about?

1800
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,840
I don't drink at all.

1801
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,569
(What?)

1802
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,140
- I smell alcohol. - You're flustered.

1803
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,569
You drink to relieve stress.

1804
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:19,649
You're stressed because of a man,

1805
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,449
- so you drink alone. - I'm not stressed...

1806
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,979
- about men at all. - You're stressed about a man?

1807
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,319
I don't drink at all.

1808
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,649
But you do get stressed because of a man?

1809
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,519
- I don't get stressed about men. - You must be honest, Si An.

1810
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,289
- This is really not true. - Really?

1811
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,690
I really don't drink.

1812
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,189
It's strange if she gets everything right too.

1813
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,690
(Did the nymph make a mistake?)

1814
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,799
You both have earth in your fortune,

1815
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,060
but your mountain is frozen.

1816
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,669
- You need to keep your body warm. - It's cold.

1817
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,129
- Yes, I feel cold easily. - You... Yes.

1818
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:43,969
Duck will help you...

1819
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,710
with your blood circulation.

1820
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,869
And red bean porridge will be good for you too.

1821
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,540
- Red bean porridge. - Red bean porridge?

1822
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,380
- You have a lot of earth, Beom. - Yes.

1823
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,749
You need to suppress it with cold food.

1824
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,119
- Cold food. - Have naengmyeon,

1825
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,650
seaweed, and pork.

1826
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,949
(Beom and Si An's fortunes)

1827
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,289
(Kwak Beom: A feminine fortune, lacks water, cold food recommended)

1828
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,589
(Lee Si An: A masculine fortune, frozen mountain,)

1829
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,759
(food that helps blood circulation recommended)

1830
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,089
- We need two people... - Okay.

1831
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,090
All right.

1832
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:10,859
Let's go and help her to cook.

1833
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,659
We really need to help her cook?

1834
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,100
Exactly. This is pretty odd too.

1835
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,870
- Has this ever happened? - No.

1836
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,369
Never.

1837
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,040
(They've never helped with cooking on Sixth Sense before.)

1838
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,709
This is where...

1839
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,979
(What food will fill up...)

1840
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,240
(the energy they lack?)

1841
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,049
Do I go in with my shoes on?

1842
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,449
- Take them off? - Do I take off my shoes?

1843
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:29,520
Yes.

1844
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,380
(The 1st floor has a different vibe from the 2nd floor.)

1845
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:37,019
The cooking area is really...

1846
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,460
below the shrine.

1847
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,559
They can't...

1848
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,789
(It looks like an ordinary Korean set menu restaurant...)

1849
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:43,999
fake this.

1850
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,730
(with a drop of shrine.)

1851
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,100
- You can help me. - Okay.

1852
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,200
When you're here...

1853
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,839
- It's so... Yes. - It feels different, right?

1854
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,139
(The shaman seems completely different.)

1855
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,140
You look like a school nutritionist.

1856
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,549
We have warm food and cold food.

1857
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,809
- Yes. - So...

1858
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,749
- You serve yourself. - It's written here.

1859
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,680
(The side dishes are prepared according to their types.)

1860
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:08,190
(The popular aspect of Possessed Korean Set Menu)

1861
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:09,449
"Fire, bitter taste."

1862
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,589
(The side dishes are prepared according to the Five Elements.)

1863
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,690
"Water, salty taste."

1864
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,590
"Wood, sour taste."

1865
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,460
"Metal, spicy taste."

1866
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,160
"Earth, sweet taste."

1867
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,359
The side dishes are prepared in the way where the individual...

1868
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,600
can choose based on their Five Elements.

1869
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,770
I change them once every two weeks.

1870
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,809
I prepare two main dishes...

1871
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:30,240
so the customers can choose based on their constitutions.

1872
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,209
(Is this place really Possessed Korean Set Menu?)

1873
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,179
Beom, can you...

1874
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,089
scoop six bowls of rice?

1875
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,090
Shall I scoop the rice?

1876
01:03:41,091 --> 01:03:43,460
- Mimi, can you help me? - Okay.

1877
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,460
- Shall I lay them out on the plate? - Yes.

1878
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,329
Do it prettily, just like you.

1879
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,029
- Gosh, you're much more beautiful. - Like this.

1880
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,059
Okay, I got it.

1881
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,230
(The kitchen is very peaceful.)

1882
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,600
When did you move here?

1883
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,169
About three months ago.

1884
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,670
- Three months? - Yes.

1885
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,109
- Good job, Mimi. Keep asking. - So...

1886
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:03,110
Right?

1887
01:04:03,111 --> 01:04:04,280
(Kudos to Mimi for not forgetting her main task.)

1888
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,450
Do you have a boyfriend?

1889
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,910
Gosh, sadly...

1890
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,480
Once this airs, I might get one.

1891
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,220
Since she's very good looking.

1892
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,560
By the way,

1893
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,189
Mimi, you have...

1894
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,859
good fortune in romance.

1895
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,360
- I have good fortune in romance? - You do.

1896
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,159
- Do I really have it? - Yes, you do.

1897
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,929
- This year? - What?

1898
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,629
- There's only one month left. - This year...

1899
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,169
- This year is almost over. - Yes.

1900
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,640
On Christmas day, you must be in a hurry.

1901
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,210
- I just snatch someone quickly. - You must be in a hurry.

1902
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,910
"Follow me."

1903
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,380
- Mimi. - Yes?

1904
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,009
(Be quiet.)

1905
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,309
(Here.)

1906
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,479
It's clean.

1907
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,950
- It's clean? - It's clean.

1908
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,150
(I got it.)

1909
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,949
(Is it fake?)

1910
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,060
(The board is very clean and dust-free.)

1911
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,760
If this is real, it's quite fun.

1912
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,260
It is fun.

1913
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,729
Having your fortune told...

1914
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,059
(Fortune-telling and good food, he can see how it became famous.)

1915
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,200
- Exactly. - and eating.

1916
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,929
This...

1917
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:04,269
- You can see Mimi. - I can see Mimi.

1918
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,339
(Meanwhile, on the 2nd floor)

1919
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,670
You can see her here.

1920
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,170
- For security. - You can see here.

1921
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,409
- The video is so sharp. - It's amazing.

1922
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,479
My goodness.

1923
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,680
- You can zoom in too? - What?

1924
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,609
- You can see their expressions. - She's cooking duck.

1925
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,649
This is amazing.

1926
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,949
- Duck. - I can see their expressions...

1927
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,349
and the food.

1928
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:20,889
I can see everything so clearly.

1929
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,120
This is how CCTV works nowadays.

1930
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,019
And if you want to see what's happening here,

1931
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,460
- you can select it. - Really?

1932
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,529
- 4 corners. - 4 corners.

1933
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,129
- And press this. - And press this.

1934
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,269
- Like this. - That's the trespassing path.

1935
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,729
- That's the path. - You can set it.

1936
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,770
- You can set it. - You can monitor only here.

1937
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,699
If there's a sign of anyone breaking in.

1938
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,809
That's fascinating.

1939
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,909
- It says "people counting." - What's that?

1940
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:44,240
It counts the number of visitors.

1941
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,279
You can check...

1942
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,479
- how many people entered. - You can check...

1943
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,979
- how many people entered the shop. - Exactly.

1944
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,079
It's so convenient nowadays.

1945
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,080
You can do everything with this.

1946
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,819
You can manage the shop just from using this.

1947
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,949
Exactly.

1948
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,420
You can be reassured when you go out.

1949
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,819
- That's nice. - It's so good.

1950
01:05:58,820 --> 01:05:59,990
(We protect the nymph safely.)

1951
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,630
This is so confusing.

1952
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,660
She looks real.

1953
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,930
This is very personal,

1954
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,600
but the aura of this place itself is too strong.

1955
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,700
- Is it strong? - Yes.

1956
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:11,470
- Really? - My head keeps pounding.

1957
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,840
Then it's...

1958
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,639
- Is the vibe strong? - Yes, it's heavy.

1959
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,140
- Does it press you down? - Yes.

1960
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,780
- The energy presses you down? - Yes. It's heavy.

1961
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,780
But isn't using fortune...

1962
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,619
- to cook too complicated? - It's inefficient.

1963
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,420
- It's too complicated. - It's too inefficient.

1964
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,220
Why bother?

1965
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,150
I think...

1966
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,260
- A lot of shamans are in this area. - Yes.

1967
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,260
So there's an actual shaman on the second floor.

1968
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,059
- They just rented the space? - They just rented the space.

1969
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,060
I think so.

1970
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:40,199
She didn't seem to use the book much either.

1971
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,500
These are fake too.

1972
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,869
These are all plastic.

1973
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,510
- The apples too. - The staff could've placed them.

1974
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,909
- Like this. - The space...

1975
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:53,580
(Fiddling with them)

1976
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,280
(Are these all ritual tools?)

1977
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,819
- And she got some things wrong. - That's right.

1978
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:00,919
You said you didn't drink.

1979
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,519
- I really don't drink. - Do you really not drink?

1980
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,390
Do you drink something similar to alcohol?

1981
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,590
(Clenching her eyes shut)

1982
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:06,629
Something similar?

1983
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,189
Do you drink a lot of non-alcoholic drinks instead?

1984
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,029
- I don't go to cafes often too. - Really?

1985
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,459
I don't fancy drinking...

1986
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,830
- any type of liquid. - You don't like to drink?

1987
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,200
That's why I can't go number two.

1988
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,599
I can't poop.

1989
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,769
- If you say that... - It's too much.

1990
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:21,839
- She did the sexy dance... - It's...

1991
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,279
- and talked about poop. - too much information.

1992
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,439
Si An, you revealed so much information about yourself.

1993
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,749
- We're getting so much information. - Thank you.

1994
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,949
She told us that she was constipated.

1995
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:30,079
To make sure we understood, she said,

1996
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,080
- "I can't poop." - I can't poop.

1997
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,889
You don't drink enough liquid.

1998
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,720
- There's no moisture. - There's no moisture.

1999
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,720
Had this shaman received information from the staff,

2000
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,529
- she would've learned... - That's right.

2001
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,089
whether or not Si An drank.

2002
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,329
- Of course. - Right?

2003
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,699
- That was... - She wouldn't have gotten it wrong.

2004
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,499
- It's an amateur mistake. - She wouldn't have made it.

2005
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,570
Never.

2006
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,339
I think this place is real.

2007
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,499
(They keep changing their minds. Is this place real?)

2008
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,540
- Do you think it's real? - Yes.

2009
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:56,109
- It's done. - Yes.

2010
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,580
There's so much food.

2011
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,149
- It smells good. - It smells good.

2012
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,150
(There are duck meat and stir-fried spicy pork.)

2013
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:03,520
It smells really good.

2014
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,520
It's the smell of tasty food.

2015
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,719
- Come on in. - It smells familiar.

2016
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,459
- Come on in. - Get your own side dishes.

2017
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,660
- Should we get our own side dishes? - Yes.

2018
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,559
Those who weren't told fortune, just take a bit of everything.

2019
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,729
- Should we eat? - Yes.

2020
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,860
Okay.

2021
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,399
(Amazed)

2022
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,869
This place seems real.

2023
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:21,870
(While Jae Seok looks around the 1st floor)

2024
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,129
Now...

2025
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,269
(Si An begins to get side dishes.)

2026
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,140
- I'm fire, so... Bellflower root? - Tofu and...

2027
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,280
By the way,

2028
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,810
you shouldn't touch the items in the shrine.

2029
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,750
- What? - What was that? I didn't hear her.

2030
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,319
- How did she know? - What?

2031
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,589
- You shouldn't have touched them. - She touched the items...

2032
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,989
- in the shrine. - That's right.

2033
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,019
(How does she know that Si An touched the items?)

2034
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,729
(What?)

2035
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:49,259
Maybe she has a security camera app on her phone.

2036
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,699
- That's right. - Did you check the app?

2037
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,000
Maybe she checked the app.

2038
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,100
(Seriously, how did she know?)

2039
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,870
Is there anything you can sense from Seok Jin?

2040
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,440
I think he'll be very successful next year.

2041
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,080
When he gets his fortune read on "Running Man,"

2042
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,309
- they say he'll do badly that year. - "You'll do badly this year."

2043
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,310
(He's the type to do better in the future.)

2044
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:09,379
- They say he'll do well next year. - Seriously.

2045
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,979
- It's nice. - You'll be very successful.

2046
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,680
- You'll be very successful. - More successful than now?

2047
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:15,749
Did you make all of these dishes by yourself?

2048
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,919
- Yes. - She cooked them just now.

2049
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,889
- They helped me. - Yes.

2050
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:20,890
Is this...
- It's stir-fried. - Yes.

2051
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,800
It's stir-fried.

2052
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,199
- Is there something to say? - Also,

2053
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,270
Kyung Pyo seems to be having a headache.

2054
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,540
Kyung Pyo seems to be having a headache.

2055
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,410
That's because of the overwhelming energy.

2056
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,009
You'll be okay once you leave.

2057
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,310
- Really? - Yes.

2058
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,610
- Enjoy the food. - Thank you.

2059
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:45,480
(Glaring)

2060
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,819
- The staff told her, right? - Of course.

2061
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:49,850
The staff told her, right?

2062
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,330
- Mimi and I were downstairs. - Yes.

2063
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,000
She didn't look at her phone.

2064
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,929
- She must've done it quickly. - Right. They have a message app.

2065
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,669
- She could've done it quickly. - That's right.

2066
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,099
- "Kyung Pyo has a headache." - How Si An touched...

2067
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,240
She knew that I touched the items.

2068
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,869
- It's tasty, right? - It's tasty.

2069
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,910
It's tasty.

2070
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,670
The taste is clean.

2071
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:11,009
It's the taste of a professional.

2072
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:14,709
- Did she cook it herself down here? - No.

2073
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,749
It's suspicious.

2074
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,779
- Didn't she cook it herself? - When we got here,

2075
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,080
- The food was already prepared. - the meat was seasoned.

2076
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,219
- That's... - She just stir-fried it.

2077
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,220
Yes.

2078
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:25,660
(When Beom and Mimi came down to help her cook,)

2079
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,730
(the shaman was already stir-frying the meat.)

2080
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:33,730
(Did she prepare food in advance?)

2081
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,100
I don't think this is a restaurant.

2082
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,740
I think she runs a shrine...

2083
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,470
and serves meals to visitors.

2084
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,879
This could be the waiting area.

2085
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,110
That's right. There's a chance...

2086
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,010
this is a house...

2087
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,549
- in which she sleeps. - A resting area.

2088
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,850
(Is the 1st floor a waiting area or a house?)

2089
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:57,320
(Full of suspicion)

2090
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,689
But this stir-fried spicy pork is tasty.

2091
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:59,860
- I know. - It's tasty.

2092
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,559
It's the taste of a professional.

2093
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,100
(The taste of stir-fried spicy pork makes them forget about suspicion.)

2094
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,030
A nearby restaurant...

2095
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,729
(Inhaling cold seaweed soup)

2096
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,440
I thought you were eating noodles.

2097
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,510
- It's tasty. - Yes.

2098
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:14,639
It's tasty.

2099
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,709
(The cold seaweed soup makes them slurp noisily.)

2100
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,940
I think this food comes from a side dish store.

2101
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,880
I mentioned a side dish store earlier.

2102
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,110
Does it come from a side dish store?
- That might be the case. - The braised tofu tastes like it.

2103
01:11:23,111 --> 01:11:25,180
- It totally tastes like it. - That might be the case.

2104
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,719
Is the shrine upstairs fake?

2105
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,089
- You know, - Maybe the restaurant is real.

2106
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,819
for someone who doesn't believe in it,

2107
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,389
you're eating the dishes she told you to eat.

2108
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,529
(She was told that she lacked fire.)

2109
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,799
- She's eating only duck. - Right now,

2110
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,769
- she's tackling the duck dish. - She's eating only duck.

2111
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,669
She's eating only duck.

2112
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,870
Just in case.

2113
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,110
It could be real.

2114
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,510
- It's tasty. - Here's what we need to remember.

2115
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:55,449
- Is it real? - This is the best place to make up.

2116
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:56,949
- That's right. - That's right.

2117
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,320
- But... - That's right.

2118
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,419
- how did she know that... - I know.

2119
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,320
Beom had signed a contract to buy an electric car?

2120
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,689
- He did it alone. - You told no one, right?

2121
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,429
- That's right. - Doesn't your manager know?

2122
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,060
(No one else knew about his contract to buy an electric car.)

2123
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,799
Maybe Beom is a spy.

2124
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,069
- Right. Can there be a spy? - What?

2125
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,070
(Is Beom a spy?)

2126
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,570
I wish I were a spy.

2127
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:23,580
He signed a contract, but she told him to cancel it.

2128
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,040
She told you to cancel it no matter what.

2129
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,009
- He'll need to check the result. - I'll need to check the result.

2130
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,010
I see.

2131
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,320
(I want to ride an electric car.)

2132
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:33,049
All right. Let's go to the last location.

2133
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,219
(Possessed Korean Set Menu 1. Uncomfortable location to eat...)

2134
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,449
(and get a fortune reading 2. Knowledge on Beom's contract)

2135
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,690
(3. Side dishes that seem to come from a store)

2136
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,190
Shall we go to the sundaeguk place right away?

2137
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,989
Between the 1st and 2nd places,

2138
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,529
the second place seems fake, right?

2139
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:45,030
- That's right. - Yes. I think number one is fine.

2140
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,999
How is your headache?

2141
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,070
It went away. My head is clear.

2142
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,270
- Did it suddenly go away? - Yes.

2143
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,539
I guess there really was energy.

2144
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,910
I think the shrine is real.

2145
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,280
I think the shrine is real.

2146
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,810
- It wasn't made up, right? - That's right.

2147
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,280
I think the second place might be real.

2148
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,020
If it's real, it'll drive us crazy.

2149
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,919
- Think about the overall concept. - Okay.

2150
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,089
So far, the show tried to help...

2151
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,929
the struggling business owners by setting up their places...

2152
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,799
- as fake restaurants. - That's right.

2153
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,129
- The shrine isn't like that. - That's right.

2154
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,430
- That's right. - You're right.

2155
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,429
There's no need for a solution.

2156
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,469
(When it comes to a shrine, there's no need for a solution.)

2157
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,539
If you think about that, the first place is fake.

2158
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,639
- That's right. Otherwise, - It could use a solution.

2159
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,369
the third place is likely to be fake.

2160
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,140
- The third place. - Cold sundae.

2161
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,139
(My goodness)

2162
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,650
- Let's go and see. - Jae Seok, you're right.

2163
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,879
- You have a point. - I didn't even think about that.

2164
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,150
You're really sharp.

2165
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,690
I've never seen cold sundae.

2166
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,520
I think it'll be strange.

2167
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,890
I can't imagine it.

2168
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:47,090
And today... Think about it.

2169
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,089
We had bread at a cafe this morning.

2170
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:51,130
Secondly, we had jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

2171
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,630
Thirdly, we had twisted donuts.

2172
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,270
Then we had a set meal at the last place.

2173
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,299
- We ate so much. - We ate so much.

2174
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,499
We ate a lot of food.

2175
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,669
Not even "Tasty Guys" members eat this much.

2176
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:00,670
(We agree.)

2177
01:14:00,671 --> 01:14:02,210
Even "Tasty Guys" members...

2178
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,709
- take a break after eating. - That's right.

2179
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,279
They take a nap.

2180
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,649
We won't shed the calories even if we run to Yeosu.

2181
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:09,779
Of course not.

2182
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:10,780
(Sixth Sense is like a food show.)

2183
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:12,320
We could run home.

2184
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,919
This is the place.

2185
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,289
- It's Sundae Street. - Sundae Street.

2186
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:16,449
- Byeongcheon Sundae Street. - We visited this place.

2187
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,819
Byeongcheon Sundae Street. We visited this place indeed.

2188
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,820
(Byeongcheon Sundae Street)

2189
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,390
(Sundae Street)

2190
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,529
(Byeongcheon Sundae Street was formed in the 1960s.)

2191
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,499
(Cheonan's Byeongcheon sundae is 1 of the 3 best sundaes...)

2192
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,640
(along with Sokcho's abai sundae and Yongin's Baekam sundae.)

2193
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,039
- There are so many sundae places. - There are so many.

2194
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,139
It's a sundae street.

2195
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,340
(Cheonan's food paradise that has all the Byeongcheon sundae places)

2196
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:38,109
- All the places sell sundaeguk. - I know.

2197
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,080
All the places. What? It's this place.

2198
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,749
There's no way the staff did this.

2199
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,579
- This is... - It looks so strange.

2200
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,649
- What's this? - This is...

2201
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,849
- What's this? - It looks strange.

2202
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:48,850
(The place seems off even before they enter.)

2203
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,819
But it'll be hard to set up a place like that.

2204
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,860
It doesn't look like a sundae restaurant.

2205
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,789
It looks like a yogurt ice cream place.

2206
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,130
I want some ice cream.

2207
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,699
- They sell ice cream too. - You're right.

2208
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,299
Is it sundae-shaped ice cream?

2209
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,030
It says, "Sundae bread."

2210
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,799
- Is it a dessert place? - It says, "Sundae bread."

2211
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,339
- Bread? - Bread.

2212
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,440
- I see. - Sundae bread.

2213
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:11,440
It's so strange.

2214
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,380
Sundae dessert?

2215
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,579
- It's a dessert place. - Traditional walnut cake.

2216
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,580
(There's a sundae dessert place! My goodness.)

2217
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,619
(Byeongcheon Sundae Street)

2218
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,420
(On the Byeongcheon Sundae Street,)

2219
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,690
(Cheonan's popular place stands out.)

2220
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,590
They don't sell sundaeguk.

2221
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,790
It doesn't look like a sundae place.

2222
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,700
When I see it like this...

2223
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,529
It seems real.

2224
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,999
It has to be real.

2225
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,440
- So much work has been done. - Right.

2226
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,069
If it's fake, they must've gotten a new signboard.

2227
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:42,609
- It looks used. - It looks used.

2228
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,310
(The signboard looks aged. Is this place real?)

2229
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:47,010
- What an idea. - My goodness.

2230
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,010
- It makes no... What? - I think this place is real.

2231
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,150
It makes no sense.

2232
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,720
I think this place is real.

2233
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,450
This place seems real.

2234
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,989
(It doesn't look like they sell sundaeguk.)

2235
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,959
It's such an original idea.

2236
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,860
(The interior is neat and pastel-toned.)

2237
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,430
(There's a photo zone Gen Zers love.)

2238
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,129
There's sundae.

2239
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,170
(Sundae-shaped items are all over the place.)

2240
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,199
(What's Sundaeguk At Below 10°C?)

2241
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,700
Is this real or fake?

2242
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,069
Look at this.

2243
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,979
There's a video of how they made this place.

2244
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,109
(In the middle of the place, a video is being played.)

2245
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,779
They have no reason to show...

2246
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,380
the process of making the place.

2247
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,149
What is this video for?

2248
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,189
(A time-lapse video of making the restaurant)

2249
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,989
There's no reason to play the video...

2250
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:31,060
of painting the walls.

2251
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,989
Everyone is wearing a padded jacket.

2252
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,329
Did it happen a few days ago?

2253
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,860
But it doesn't smell like it.

2254
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,230
This paintwork wasn't done a few days ago.

2255
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,739
We need to watch it carefully...

2256
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,069
because the staff sometimes adds a hidden message.

2257
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,469
(The production crew's hidden card to throw off the members?)

2258
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,770
Hold on. Let's take a seat.

2259
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,709
You never know.

2260
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:53,810
The second place seemed so fake.

2261
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:55,809
- But... - But this place seems fake too.

2262
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:57,420
This place seems so fake.

2263
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,679
No way.

2264
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,680
(Their confusion is at its max.)

2265
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,050
It seems so fake.

2266
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,189
I see that it's really confusing.

2267
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,059
- It's confusing, right? - I watched the show and thought,

2268
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,860
- "Why are they confused?" - You called us utter fools, right?

2269
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,359
"Look at those utter fools."

2270
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,329
(Getting mad at themselves)

2271
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:15,330
Viewers go, "How could they not know?"

2272
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,899
But you really don't know when you're on the show.

2273
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,940
You really don't know.

2274
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,469
- You don't have a clue, right? - It's confusing, right?

2275
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,210
- It's confusing, right? - Yes, it's very confusing.

2276
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,040
- Shall we talk to the owner? - Okay.

2277
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,379
Sir.

2278
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,080
(What's Sundaeguk At Below 10°C?)

2279
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,710
He's dressed in pink.

2280
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,809
- Hello. - Hello.

2281
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:30,950
Hello.

2282
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,679
Yes.

2283
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,719
(Sundaeguk At Below 10°C, Lee Gyeong Min)

2284
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,889
This is what I wear to work.

2285
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,849
That's such a bright top.

2286
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:37,859
(The brightest in Cheonan)

2287
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:38,860
- Hello. - Sir.

2288
01:17:38,861 --> 01:17:41,959
- I think you opened that top today. - What?

2289
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,859
The wrinkles on the arms tell me that it's new.

2290
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,559
- Yes, it seems new. - It seems new.

2291
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,899
- Does it... Does it show? - Yes.

2292
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,469
What was it?

2293
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:50,330
It got... What was it?

2294
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,800
(Why is he stuttering?)

2295
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,839
My top got dirty from sundae,

2296
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,579
- so I took out a new one. - A new one.

2297
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,909
You had another top.

2298
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:02,410
(Is the owner nervous? Or was it an unexpected question?)

2299
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,320
I see characters here too. You put a lot of thought into it.

2300
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,820
Yes. I chose...

2301
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,319
this particular interior design...

2302
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,759
so that customers could come...

2303
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,189
and make good memories by taking photos.

2304
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,729
- You designed it that way. - Yes.

2305
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,299
Customers actually love it.

2306
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,500
(Customers' reactions are very good!)

2307
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:23,399
Why did you decide to play this video here?

2308
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,699
When the time-lapse video is getting played,

2309
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,370
customers stare at it.

2310
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,240
- That was why. - Yes, they watched it intently.

2311
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,980
I played it because they seemed to enjoy it.

2312
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,749
- I see characters over there. - Yes.

2313
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:36,849
Did you come up with them?

2314
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,680
Yes, I made characters...

2315
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,949
in the shape of sundae.

2316
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,819
Those characters are quite popular...

2317
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,559
among children.

2318
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,920
(He even made merchandise since they were so popular.)

2319
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,989
I think this place is real.

2320
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:52,599
I heard about sundaeguk that was below 10°C.

2321
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,930
That's right.

2322
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,199
We sell sundaeguk that's below 10°C.

2323
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,700
(Sundaeguk that's below 10°C is actually on sale.)

2324
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,010
It's just sundaeguk in shape.

2325
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:05,240
We sell sundaeguk bingsu.

2326
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,380
Really?

2327
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:10,620
It's a dessert.

2328
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,650
Byeongcheon is famous for sundae.

2329
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,149
There are about 20 sundae places.

2330
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:17,690
There are multiple sundae places.

2331
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,189
But the Sundae Street...

2332
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:25,399
didn't have a dessert cafe that sold something cold.

2333
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,629
Families in their 20s and 30s...

2334
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:31,800
and couples are my target customers.

2335
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,809
(It's in the shape of sundaeguk.)

2336
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,139
Sundaeguk bingsu...

2337
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,880
was incredibly popular in summer.

2338
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:44,250
(The place went viral on social media for its concept.)

2339
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,990
(It grabbed the attention of men and women of all ages.)

2340
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,350
Sixth Sense members,

2341
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:52,089
is this place real?

2342
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,960
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

2343
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,130
How fascinating.

2344
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,529
Do many people order it?

2345
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:00,530
They love it.

2346
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:02,870
- Does it taste like sundaeguk? - What?

2347
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,669
- Well, - Is it just the shape?

2348
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,939
you should try it later.

2349
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,270
There's sundae bread too.

2350
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,809
May we try it?

2351
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:10,410
- Of course. - Okay.

2352
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,810
This place is fake.

2353
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,609
This place is fake.

2354
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:15,979
Isn't there someone in this season...

2355
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:19,120
- who makes characters? - Yes.

2356
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,920
I think that person made fake characters again.

2357
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,619
I bet Sixth Sense did a collaboration with that artist...

2358
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,890
and put a lot of effort into this place.

2359
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,960
It's so suspicious that they are tumblers as well.

2360
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:33,830
(Did he make the characters and merchandise?)

2361
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:35,599
It's so hard.

2362
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,200
While the characters are cute...

2363
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,299
(What?)

2364
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,540
What? What's this?

2365
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,639
What? What's this?

2366
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,739
(What? What's this?)

2367
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,979
- No way. - What's this?

2368
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,379
(Impressed)

2369
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,649
What's this radish kimchi?

2370
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,249
- What's this? - Here is...

2371
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,250
- a sundaeguk meal. - There's radish kimchi too.

2372
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,820
- No way. - No way.

2373
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,889
This is...

2374
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:55,919
(This is sundaeguk bingsu.)

2375
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,020
- It's a work of art. - This is incredible.

2376
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,589
- It's a work of art. - This is incredible.

2377
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,490
This is... Hold on. What's this?

2378
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,629
We have to take photos.

2379
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,899
It's a work of art.

2380
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,700
- What's this? - We have to take photos.

2381
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,640
I rarely take photos.

2382
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,169
We should upload it as an Instagram story.

2383
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,469
- This is... - My goodness.

2384
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,410
(What's the dessert that calls for a photo on social media?)

2385
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,809
When you get a sundae meal,

2386
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,009
it's quite traditional.

2387
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,779
To reinterpret it in a modern way,

2388
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,380
I made it sweet.

2389
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,350
I add the sweet red bean paste and shaved milk ice to the bingsu.

2390
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:34,390
I top it with sticky rice cake instead of sundae.

2391
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,760
It's a traditional bingsu.

2392
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,330
Instead of rice, I serve popped rice.

2393
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,670
Instead of radish kimchi, I serve mango cubes...

2394
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,069
that are covered in strawberry powder.

2395
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,209
There's a way to color it.

2396
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:51,010
That's how I make what appears to be radish kimchi.

2397
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:54,109
Chili peppers are...

2398
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,480
green tea chocolate.

2399
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,380
Then I serve peanut butter instead of doenjang.

2400
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,290
That's the tasty sundaeguk bingsu.

2401
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,459
(Sundaeguk bingsu)

2402
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,030
People would come here.

2403
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:12,730
He made bingsu in the shape of sundaeguk.

2404
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,700
These chili peppers are chocolate.

2405
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,029
- Really? - Yes.

2406
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,399
They're shaped like chocolate.

2407
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,500
- How is it? - My goodness.

2408
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,700
It's so tasty.

2409
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,910
Is it milk?

2410
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,269
It's rice cake, right?

2411
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,369
- It's rice cake... - This is...

2412
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:24,410
that looks like sundae.

2413
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,409
Inside...

2414
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:27,410
It makes sense.

2415
01:22:27,411 --> 01:22:29,209
(Gosh, it's so tasty.)

2416
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,550
It's so tasty.

2417
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,720
Let's say...

2418
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:35,019
it was developed by a chef.

2419
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,290
(It makes her eyes go wide.)

2420
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:39,359
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - I should move some to my plate.

2421
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,329
You're eating the most right now.

2422
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,730
I should move some to my plate.

2423
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,959
- It's really tasty. - It's tasty.

2424
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,060
(A standing ovation)

2425
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,999
- It's a real deal. - The taste makes you clap.

2426
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
- Seriously. - It's tasty.

2427
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:51,270
This is incredible.

2428
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,299
It's a work of art.

2429
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,640
(An artistic dessert that's based on a unique idea)

2430
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,579
(A bite of radish kimchi)

2431
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,639
- Isn't it radish kimchi? - What is it?

2432
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,079
Is it rice cake?

2433
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,280
Is it spicy?

2434
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:03,580
It's mango.

2435
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,219
- Mango. - It must be cold.

2436
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,220
It's sherbet.

2437
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,690
(An amazing transformation of the cold mango)

2438
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,460
It looks just like radish kimchi.

2439
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,160
It's tasty.

2440
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,460
(It settles his stomach.)

2441
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,729
It's the highlight of our food journey of the day.

2442
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:22,969
- Yes. Totally. - It's so tasty.

2443
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,030
- It settles my stomach. - Yes.

2444
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,700
The owner said...

2445
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,570
with confidence, "Many customers come."

2446
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,440
I doubted it, but now that I've seen the food...

2447
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,009
- Many customers would come. - Many customers would come.

2448
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,509
- They'd come. - Think about it.

2449
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:34,909
Children would love it.

2450
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:37,179
- People would take photos. - Right?

2451
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,280
(The atmosphere and taste of a popular place)

2452
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,349
We finished a bowl of sundaeguk.

2453
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,049
(They finished a bowl of sundaeguk.)

2454
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,460
- That sundaeguk was nice. - You know,

2455
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,359
I love that this place is on the Sundae Street.

2456
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,629
It'll be nice to enjoy this dessert after eating sundaeguk.

2457
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,730
(Dessert after sundaeguk will be like killing 2 birds with 1 stone.)

2458
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,569
This is...

2459
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:56,029
sundae bread.

2460
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,400
It's sundae bread.

2461
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,840
This is incredible. A round of applause.

2462
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,409
My goodness.

2463
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,540
Look at this.

2464
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,439
This is incredible.

2465
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,480
(The Cheonan sundae meeting is going smoothly.)

2466
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,879
For the Byeongcheon sundae bread,

2467
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,019
we use a custom-made mold.

2468
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,019
After heating up the mold,

2469
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,620
we add a batter.

2470
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,759
We also run a sundae restaurant.

2471
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,060
(The sundae filling comes from a sundae restaurant right next to it.)

2472
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:20,719
We make sundae filling.

2473
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,990
(Sundae filling)

2474
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,900
We add the sundae filling.

2475
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,970
Then we bake the bread for 5 to 7 minutes.

2476
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,999
The outside becomes crunchy...

2477
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,040
and the inside becomes pillowy for this sundae bread.

2478
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,710
Do you smell it?

2479
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:39,839
- It smells like sundae. - It smells like sundae.

2480
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,879
- Really? - Yes.

2481
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,610
- Does it taste like sundae? - It smells like sundae.

2482
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,450
It smells like white sundae.

2483
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:47,120
(Impressed)

2484
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,450
What's this?

2485
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,020
Right? Doesn't it smell like sundae?

2486
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:54,020
Does it taste like sundae?

2487
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,930
It tastes like sundae.

2488
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,260
There's sundae inside this bread.

2489
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,129
The aftertaste is good.

2490
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,200
- This isn't the work of a chef. - No.

2491
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,570
Chefs don't make it like this.

2492
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,540
I think this place is real.

2493
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,669
- This place is real. - This place is real.

2494
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:11,140
This bread...

2495
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,139
wasn't developed by a chef.

2496
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,179
(There isn't a special reason.)

2497
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,180
- It has a smell of sundae. - You know,

2498
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:17,050
these two make the best combination.

2499
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:20,649
(After eating a bite of the sundae bread,)

2500
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:23,450
(cleanse the palate with sundae bingsu!)

2501
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,290
Then which place is fake? The second one?

2502
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,219
(It's this one.)

2503
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,390
Is this one fake?

2504
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,400
How could you say that after praising the food so much?

2505
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,759
Is this place fake?

2506
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,859
(Nearly crying)

2507
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,600
Is the second place real?

2508
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,939
- I think it's real. Yes. - Really?

2509
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,100
But you and I...

2510
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,799
cooked in the kitchen.

2511
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,040
She said she wasn't used to cooking a lot.

2512
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,479
She said she only accepted 2 or 3 teams a day.

2513
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,640
Are you saying that this place is fake?

2514
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,449
Are you saying that this place is fake?

2515
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:49,750
(Are you saying that this place is fake?)

2516
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,520
- This place is fake. Totally. - Why?

2517
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,480
There's too much emphasis on the characters.

2518
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,719
The characters take the spotlight, not the food.

2519
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,419
(The characters take the spotlight, not the food.)

2520
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,059
There's no reason to make tumblers with them.

2521
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,360
(The merchandise is too diverse!)

2522
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,860
- It's too much. - He made these characters.

2523
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,559
You can't take it.

2524
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,699
Why not?

2525
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,329
- "Why not?" - "Why not?"

2526
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,099
- "Why not?" - Of course, you can't take it.

2527
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,599
I won't take it.

2528
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,770
These characters...

2529
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,669
weren't made haphazardly.

2530
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,739
You can't take it.

2531
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,110
I won't, okay?

2532
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,810
I won't take it!

2533
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,510
I've been in the show business for over 30 years.

2534
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,350
If I steal it,

2535
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,419
- my career will end. - You can't take it.

2536
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,350
- Why would I take it? - You can't take it.

2537
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,889
Do I look like someone who'll take it? I don't.

2538
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,459
You do look a bit like someone who'll take it.

2539
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,829
(You do look a bit like someone who'll take it.)

2540
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:37,459
(Just a little bit, not a lot.)

2541
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,629
- You saw him correctly. - You look like that a bit.

2542
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:40,760
For goodness' sake.

2543
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,999
I feel like these characters are...

2544
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,399
the work of the production crew...

2545
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,199
- and the designer. - And this character...

2546
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,439
- The one who made Mallangi. - Look.

2547
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,110
It looks a bit like Jae Seok.

2548
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:51,939
- What? - It's cute.

2549
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:55,480
(The character looks like Jae Seok.)

2550
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,249
They leave clues like that! You're right.

2551
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,319
- They do that, right? - Yes. They leave clues like that.

2552
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,549
Even if it looks like me,

2553
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,819
you can't take it.

2554
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,690
(Even if it looks like me, you can't take it.)

2555
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,890
Since it looks like you, I definitely won't take it!

2556
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:08,289
Even if it looks like me...

2557
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,460
Since it looks like you, I definitely won't take it.

2558
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,560
Your observation on its resemblance to Jae Seok was sharp.

2559
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:13,730
- Right. - You're right!

2560
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:15,329
I was sharp for pointing out that it looked like Jae Seok, right?

2561
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,900
It had to have glasses on all of a sudden?

2562
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,939
- It's so hard, Mimi. - Right. It's hard.

2563
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,640
I have no idea.

2564
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:22,970
You think it's the third place?

2565
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,380
The third place.

2566
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,139
I have no idea, to be honest.

2567
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,379
You guys take care of it.

2568
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,609
(I'm done for.)

2569
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,320
As for today,

2570
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,650
choose without my opinion.

2571
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,889
Gosh, it's so hard.

2572
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,620
You choose Si An.

2573
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,759
Give me a moment, please.

2574
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,789
Whenever you went to a fake place,

2575
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,629
were there many times when it felt obvious?

2576
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:46,699
They were barely obvious.

2577
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,070
- It's hard to tell. - It's hard to tell.

2578
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,270
These people are very meticulous.

2579
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:52,669
If it's number two,

2580
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:55,339
I wonder if it would really be served that sloppily.

2581
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,369
- Number two? - Yes.

2582
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:57,640
If it really happens to be a fortune teller's place.

2583
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,880
(Possessed Korean Set Menu)

2584
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:06,519
(A place of fortune telling...)

2585
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:10,520
(and Korean set menus?)

2586
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,920
(You bought something big recently, haven't you?)

2587
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,760
(Sorry?)

2588
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:23,570
(He signed a deal for an electric car?)

2589
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,539
(The nymph guessed right about his electric car deal...)

2590
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:28,310
(that no one else knew about!)

2591
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:34,650
(The side dishes felt like they were brought from a side dish store.)

2592
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:39,320
(The food felt somewhat sloppy.)

2593
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,920
I found that weird as well.

2594
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,189
That was weird about number two.

2595
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,189
- We went down to eat. - Right.

2596
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,389
"Don't touch this, Mimi."

2597
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:46,390
It felt like she was told to say that by the crew.

2598
01:28:46,391 --> 01:28:47,419
That was weird.

2599
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,459
- Right. - Also...

2600
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,989
That was said to me.

2601
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:51,099
Oh, it was you.

2602
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,199
- Right. - Right.

2603
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,759
(I have to tell you this, Miss.)

2604
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,269
(You can't be touching things at a shrine.)

2605
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:58,399
(My goodness!)

2606
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,739
(The nymph who was cooking on the 1st floor...)

2607
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:04,480
(knew what Si An was doing on the 2nd floor?)

2608
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,109
(The Nymph of the Possessed Korean Set Menu)

2609
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:08,679
(Are her fortune-telling skills real?)

2610
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,009
It can't be number one, can it?

2611
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,919
- Number 1... - I don't think it's number 1.

2612
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,519
- I don't think it's number 1. - I don't think it's number 1.

2613
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,589
Number one is out of my memory now.

2614
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,089
- There's no suspicion at all. - But there's this, Seok Jin.

2615
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:19,289
If we are to think about number one,

2616
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,959
the unit cost doesn't seem right.

2617
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,890
- It was way too cheap, right? - It was way too cheap.

(Squid's Breakaway)

2619
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:29,270
(Tray jjajangmyeon with squid and pork)

2620
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,870
(This is amazing!)

2621
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,309
(Overwhelming size)

2622
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:38,240
(Looks that want you to take photos)

2623
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:41,979
(Isn't it hard to make ends meet like this?)

2624
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,250
(Too many ingredients are used.)

2625
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,379
(Tray jjajangmyeon with squid and pork for 2, 25 dollars)

2626
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,350
(Pollack roe and milt jjamppong, 13 dollars)

2627

(Is Squid's Breakaway fake?)

2628
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,920
It does feel like number one is fake as well.

2629
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,429
They all feel suspicious.

2630
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,260
There's a reason to feel suspicious about number one as well.

2631
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,599
I should go with number one.

2632
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,129
(Kyung Pyo decides to go with number 1 at that moment.)

2633
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,430
What feels weird about number one?

2634
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,499
Just like all the other places...

2635
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,839
- that have been helped until now... - Right.

2636
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,410
- It makes the most sense like that. - Right.

2637
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,439
The food was amazing.

2638
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,680

2639
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,440
The other places seem to have no reason to be made fake.

2640
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:17,079
I really have no idea.

2641
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,249
(It's so hard to find the fake place!)

2642
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,349
I give up.

2643
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:21,750
(The place where they will make the final decision today)

2644
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,490
- The Independence Hall of Korea. - The Independence Hall of Korea.

2645
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,760

2647
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,429
(Will they be able to find the fake place today?)

2648
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,400
It's been so long to visit the Independence Hall of Korea.

2649
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,569
- Gosh. - I have no idea.

2650
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,669
(They all feel especially out of confidence today.)

2651
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:41,269
- I really have no idea. - I really have no idea.

2652
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,369
What do you all think?

2653
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,609
Kyung Pyo said it felt like number one.

2654
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:46,179
I think it's number one right now.

2655
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,179
- Really? - I think it's number one.

2656
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,449
- Gosh. - What about you, Beom?

2657
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,950
It's surely number two for me.

2658
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,449
It's number two for me as well.

2659
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:53,819
- That's the most reasonable choice. - It's number two.

2660
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,820
- I think it's number three. - Same here.

2661
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,349
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

2662
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:58,459
We all have different opinions.

2663
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,019
- The loser will decide. - Will the loser decide?

2664
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,289
- The loser? - The winner should decide.

2665
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,589
- The winner? - The winner?

2666
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,689
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2667

(Bottom three: Paper, Top two: Rock)

2669
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,669
- We both lost. - Number two is out.

2670
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,630
I'll make myself clear.

2671
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:12,999
I will go for number one if I win.

2672
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,200
What number will you go for?

2673
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,839
- I will go for number 2. - Number 2?

2674
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,909
- I will go for number 3. - Number 3?

2675
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:17,910
All numbers are still alive.

01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:24,680
Number one is out!

Number one is out!

2682
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,219
- It's number 2 or number 3. - You should win.

2683
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,590
You have to win, Mimi.

01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,000
- It's fake. - It's fake.

2693
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,639
- It looks real. - Right.

2694

01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:21,270
(So...)

2789
01:35:21,271 --> 01:35:22,310
(we decided to get the help of the local government.)

2790
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:23,341
What?

2791
01:35:23,611 --> 01:35:25,451
Help from the local government?

2792
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:28,450
Is this the section chief...

2793
01:35:28,451 --> 01:35:29,921
of Cheonan's Tourism Division?

2794
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:31,450
Yes. That's me.

2795
01:35:31,451 --> 01:35:33,020
We have something to inquire about.

2796
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:35,020
For regional development,

2797
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:37,320
we are looking for streets that are in need of help.

2798
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:39,290
- For a street? - We will get back to you.

2799
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,530
- The Mural Village? - The Mural Village?

2800
01:35:40,531 --> 01:35:42,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2801
01:35:42,901 --> 01:35:44,261
(The Cheonan City Hall was asked for help to fool the members!)

2802
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:46,731
(A few days later, a recommendation was made.)

2803
01:35:47,301 --> 01:35:48,400
(Minarit-gil)

2804
01:35:48,401 --> 01:35:50,341
- Minarit-gil? - We went there earlier.

2805
01:35:50,471 --> 01:35:52,140
The Mural Village was asked to be helped.

2806
01:35:52,141 --> 01:35:53,410
(Minarit-gil has colorful murals that catch your eye.)

2807
01:35:53,411 --> 01:35:54,911
They were beautiful.

2808
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:57,940
These are all photo spots.

2809
01:35:57,941 --> 01:35:59,311
(A place made to regenerate the old alley and local culture)

2810
01:35:59,851 --> 01:36:01,150
- We saw that one earlier. - We saw that one earlier.

2811
01:36:01,151 --> 01:36:02,281
(It's the mural we saw earlier!)

2812
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:04,721
(However...)

2813
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:07,190
- What? - What?

2814
01:36:07,191 --> 01:36:08,421
(There was a problem with Minarit-gil!)

2815
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,191
(Around the street,)

2816
01:36:11,461 --> 01:36:12,491
(old empty places could be found.)

2817
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:13,831
Deserted houses.

2818
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:16,101
- There were many empty places. - Empty places.

2819
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:19,401
This building is around 45 years old.

2820
01:36:19,801 --> 01:36:23,200
We wanted to make people in need to live here,

2821
01:36:23,201 --> 01:36:26,011
but nothing could be done as we were lacking in funds.

2822
01:36:26,811 --> 01:36:27,940
A new place was put together?

2823
01:36:27,941 --> 01:36:28,941
(This area has been chosen to be transformed!)

2824
01:36:28,942 --> 01:36:30,641
- This place was made? - This place was made?

2825
01:36:31,181 --> 01:36:32,450
- That's amazing. - What?

2826
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:33,811
They did so well to put it together.

2827
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:36,921
So my head felt heavy because of my blood pressure.

2828
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:39,821
Right.

2829
01:36:39,991 --> 01:36:41,490
It was because of his blood pressure.

2830
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:42,861
What was that?

2831
01:36:43,321 --> 01:36:45,030
Why make us confused because of your heavy head?

2832
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:46,830
- What? - I really felt it.

2833
01:36:46,831 --> 01:36:47,961
(Let's make sure to take good care of our blood.)

2834
01:36:48,461 --> 01:36:50,061
What would be a good idea for Minarit-gil?

2835
01:36:50,801 --> 01:36:53,270
There are many fortune tellers in that area.

2836
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:54,271
(There are many fortune tellers in that area.)

2837
01:36:54,671 --> 01:36:58,770
(Minarit-gil was already known as a fortune teller area in Cheonan.)

2838
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,881
How would it be to make a fake fortune teller?

2839
01:37:02,981 --> 01:37:05,481
Won't that not be enough?

2840
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:08,381
After reading one's fortune,

2841
01:37:08,451 --> 01:37:11,421
turning into a restaurant could be a good idea.

2842
01:37:11,721 --> 01:37:14,790
So when water energy can be sensed, this sort of meal will be made.

2843
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:15,791
- That's amazing. - That's a good idea.
That's truly amazing.

2844
01:37:17,021 --> 01:37:18,491
Hello.

2845
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:20,231
- Hello. - It's her.

2846
01:37:20,591 --> 01:37:22,860
I'm currently an actress.

2847
01:37:22,861 --> 01:37:24,300
I've been acting for nine years.

2848
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:25,971
- She's an actress! - She's an actress!

2849
01:37:26,201 --> 01:37:28,370
That was why I asked if she went to Daehak-ro often.

2850
01:37:28,371 --> 01:37:30,370
(She appeared in different shows like "Still 17" and "Kill Heel.")

2851
01:37:30,371 --> 01:37:32,841
She really felt like an actress.

2852
01:37:32,971 --> 01:37:36,610
This is what we have in mind for this episode.

2853
01:37:36,611 --> 01:37:40,110
- You have to read fortunes. - She was given a tough role.

2854
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:42,181
Right. That wasn't an easy role.

2855
01:37:42,281 --> 01:37:43,620
- That wasn't easy to do. - But...

2856
01:37:43,621 --> 01:37:45,320
- she did a great job. - It's tough to be a fortune teller.

2857
01:37:45,321 --> 01:37:46,491
She did really well.

2858
01:37:47,021 --> 01:37:50,091
(The lesson to make her a cooking fortune teller begins.)

2859
01:37:50,321 --> 01:37:54,561
(Chapter 1: Fortune Telling)

2860
01:37:55,031 --> 01:37:57,430
(The 3rd-generation fortune teller after her grandmother and father)

2861
01:37:57,431 --> 01:37:58,470
Who is that?

2862
01:37:58,471 --> 01:38:00,431
She must've learned from those acts.

2863
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:03,941
Hello. I'm Han Su Hyeon, a fortune teller.

2864
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:07,371
Be strong with the fan. Spread it out at once.

2865
01:38:07,811 --> 01:38:10,310
She looks really natural.

2866
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:11,410
(The basic methods on how to use the ritual tools)

2867
01:38:11,411 --> 01:38:12,951
She learned from her?

2868
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:16,621
Has someone got a new car recently?

2869
01:38:17,021 --> 01:38:18,821
(I have no idea.)

2870
01:38:19,151 --> 01:38:21,321
I see a shiny car.

2871
01:38:21,491 --> 01:38:23,360
I think it's someone with quite a lot of money.

2872
01:38:23,361 --> 01:38:24,361
(This is a personal opinion of a fortune teller...)
(that hasn't been scientifically proven.)

2873
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:27,430
(What?)

2874
01:38:27,431 --> 01:38:29,030
She read our fortunes at that moment.

2875
01:38:29,031 --> 01:38:30,760
- I mentioned that earlier. - That's amazing.

2876
01:38:30,761 --> 01:38:32,671
Right. We said it could've been someone else.

2877
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:34,501
- We were right. - We were right.

2878
01:38:34,871 --> 01:38:35,971
What?

2879
01:38:36,671 --> 01:38:41,171
(But it was hard to be sure about a fortune read in advance.)

2880
01:38:41,371 --> 01:38:42,380
(That was why we looked.)

2881
01:38:42,381 --> 01:38:44,140
Could there be any secrets that haven't been revealed...

2882
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:46,180
that only his close friends would know?

2883
01:38:46,181 --> 01:38:47,910
- That's my company. - Did you mention it?

2884
01:38:47,911 --> 01:38:49,051
You must've talked about it.

2885
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:51,450
Could there be any secrets about Beom?

2886
01:38:51,451 --> 01:38:52,551
It's CEO Chung Young Joon.

2887
01:38:52,691 --> 01:38:54,490
- He has compulsive spending. - Compulsive spending?

2888
01:38:54,491 --> 01:38:56,090
- He has compulsive spending. - They did their research on them.

2889
01:38:56,091 --> 01:38:58,360
Do you know what kind of investments he makes?

2890
01:38:58,361 --> 01:39:00,230
I believe he doesn't make any investments.

2891
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:02,400
- He just spends his money. - He spends without investments?

2892
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:03,761
This guy is crazy.

2893
01:39:04,971 --> 01:39:08,701
What is Beom's goal?

2894
01:39:09,271 --> 01:39:12,040
He has currently signed a deal for a car.

2895
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:13,340
- He knew about it! - He knew about it!

2896
01:39:13,341 --> 01:39:14,711
He's waiting for it.

2897
01:39:15,441 --> 01:39:17,640
(You told him about your car!)

2898
01:39:17,641 --> 01:39:18,780
- You told him. - What?

2899
01:39:18,781 --> 01:39:20,510
He was the only person I talked about it with...

2900
01:39:20,511 --> 01:39:22,081
because he knew a lot about electric cars.

2901
01:39:22,751 --> 01:39:24,920
- Hello? - Hello!

2902
01:39:24,921 --> 01:39:26,090
Hello!

2903
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:28,890
We called you as we were told that Si An was close to you, Ji Won.

2904
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:30,520
- What? - Do you know Si An's secrets...

2905
01:39:30,521 --> 01:39:32,330
that only her friends might know about?

2906
01:39:32,331 --> 01:39:34,830
When she fights with her boyfriend,

2907
01:39:34,831 --> 01:39:37,361
- she drinks alone. - Me? No way!

2908
01:39:37,961 --> 01:39:39,770
- Me? No way! - She brought that up!

2909
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:40,870
Hey, Si An!

2910
01:39:40,871 --> 01:39:43,371
- She gave everything away. - Come on, Si An!

2911
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:46,741
She has a lot of business cards for dermatologists.

2912
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:48,410
I see.

2913
01:39:48,411 --> 01:39:50,140
We trusted you, Si An.

2914
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:52,110
- What's right? - That's false information.

2915
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,451
That's not true!

2916
01:39:53,911 --> 01:39:56,180
- Am I making her sound weird? - No.

2917
01:39:56,181 --> 01:39:57,181
(We're very close.)

2918
01:39:57,182 --> 01:39:59,921
You have to know how to read this if you are to consult someone.

2919
01:40:00,551 --> 01:40:02,160
You have to ask this.

2920
01:40:02,161 --> 01:40:04,961
"Jae Seok, can you tell me your birthday?"

2921
01:40:05,091 --> 01:40:07,460
- Gosh, that must've been tough. - She memorized all of that?

2922
01:40:07,461 --> 01:40:09,160
- You will be able to do it then. - Are you serious?

2923
01:40:09,161 --> 01:40:10,461
(All of their information is in her hands!)

2924
01:40:10,561 --> 01:40:14,330
(What's left now is the grand cooking lesson.)

2925
01:40:14,331 --> 01:40:16,200
- She learned so many things. - She went through so much.

2926
01:40:16,201 --> 01:40:17,841
She did so many things.

2927
01:40:17,941 --> 01:40:22,381
(What's the secret of her fake dishes?)

2928
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:24,511
I knew the food was made with meal kits.

2929
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:28,850
- The food was made with meal kits? - No wonder. It suited my taste.

2930
01:40:28,851 --> 01:40:31,150
- It was good. - Meal kits suit my taste.

2931
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:32,921
Why are meal kits so good these days?

2932
01:40:33,021 --> 01:40:34,851
I never imagined that meal kits were used.

2933
01:40:36,391 --> 01:40:37,460
(The side dishes were bought from a side dish store in Cheonan.)

2934
01:40:37,461 --> 01:40:40,661
- Right. They felt store-bought. - Right.

2935
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:43,930
(She practiced hard to work on the extra toppings.)

2936
01:40:43,931 --> 01:40:47,430
- She went through so much. - Right. She really did.

2937
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:48,871
- That's amazing. - Right.

2938
01:40:50,141 --> 01:40:52,340
She went through so much.

2939
01:40:52,341 --> 01:40:54,411
(Two months of hard training to become a cooking fortune teller)

2940
01:40:54,511 --> 01:40:57,080
I will do my best to fool the members.

2941
01:40:57,081 --> 01:40:58,280
(All preparations are done.)

2942
01:40:58,281 --> 01:40:59,411
Please give me your support.

2943
01:41:00,081 --> 01:41:03,081
(Everyone...)

2944
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:05,120
- What? - Remember what?

2945
01:41:05,121 --> 01:41:06,251
It's scaring me again.

2946
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:10,261
(The nymph was definitely cooking on the 1st floor.)

2947
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:11,361
(How did she know about the 2nd floor?)

2948
01:41:11,362 --> 01:41:13,330
Right. She knew everything about what went on upstairs.

2949
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:14,360
How did she know?

2950
01:41:14,361 --> 01:41:15,830
- Right. - Was she wearing in-ear monitors?

2951
01:41:15,831 --> 01:41:16,960
(How on earth did she know?)

2952
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:19,931
(There's another secret about her?)

2953
01:41:20,431 --> 01:41:24,841
(Her secret?)

2954
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:30,111
- What? - What?

2955
01:41:31,681 --> 01:41:34,081
(There are two nymphs?)

2956
01:41:34,581 --> 01:41:36,851
- My gosh! - What?

2957
01:41:36,981 --> 01:41:39,851
(In terror)

2958
01:41:40,151 --> 01:41:42,521
(Shocked)

2959
01:41:42,961 --> 01:41:46,061
(Save me!)

2960
01:41:46,331 --> 01:41:47,760
(Going wild)

2961
01:41:47,761 --> 01:41:49,100
- What's going on? - What's going on?

2962
01:41:49,101 --> 01:41:50,430
- What's going on? - That's so scary.

2963
01:41:50,431 --> 01:41:52,100
- That's so scary! - Gosh!

2964
01:41:52,101 --> 01:41:54,630
I'm tearing up! Oh, gosh!

2965
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:55,640
(What's the secret about the nymph?)

2966
01:41:55,641 --> 01:41:57,770
(Who are you two?)

2967
01:41:57,771 --> 01:41:58,941
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps!

2968
01:42:02,611 --> 01:42:05,681
(There are two nymphs?)

2969
01:42:06,651 --> 01:42:08,110
- What? - Are you serious?

2970
01:42:08,111 --> 01:42:09,480
- That's so scary! - Gosh!

2971
01:42:09,481 --> 01:42:10,680
(Nymph Ssanghwa, two flowers and two nymphs)

2972
01:42:10,681 --> 01:42:13,621
- Gosh, I got really surprised. - That was so scary!

2973
01:42:14,721 --> 01:42:16,390
- Hello. - Hello.

2974
01:42:16,391 --> 01:42:17,960
- This is Jeong Yeo Roo. - This is Jeong Ae Ran.

2975
01:42:17,961 --> 01:42:19,230
- We are twins! - We are twins!

2976
01:42:19,231 --> 01:42:20,630
(Twins)

2977
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:22,261
They were two different people?

2978
01:42:22,731 --> 01:42:25,400
- One did the cooking and... - No way!

2979
01:42:25,401 --> 01:42:28,641
The one who did the fortune telling on the second floor was me, Yeo Roo.

2980
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:33,971
The one who made the nice meals on the first floor was me, Ae Ran.

2981
01:42:34,171 --> 01:42:35,380
Let's see.

2982
01:42:35,381 --> 01:42:41,050
(They split up the roles as they were short on time.)

2983
01:42:41,051 --> 01:42:42,680
- Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps. - Gosh!

2984
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:44,720
I'm getting goosebumps right now.

2985
01:42:44,721 --> 01:42:46,320
Why did she appear like that?

2986
01:42:46,321 --> 01:42:47,651
(The two were given the twin mission.)

2987
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:50,720
(Why did she appear like that? It scared me so much.)

2988
01:42:50,721 --> 01:42:52,391
The one on the first floor was someone else?

2989
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:58,061
(When they were all on the 2nd floor to get their fortunes read,)

2990
01:42:58,731 --> 01:43:00,270
(the cooking nymph was already hiding on the 1st floor.)

2991
01:43:00,271 --> 01:43:01,331
Gosh!

2992
01:43:02,201 --> 01:43:03,671
- I will begin. - No way!

2993
01:43:04,341 --> 01:43:06,841
(The fortune telling ends.)

2994
01:43:07,071 --> 01:43:09,441
(The fortune teller nymph heads out.)

2995
01:43:09,581 --> 01:43:11,540
So the fortune teller went to the third floor.

2996
01:43:11,541 --> 01:43:12,550
(She hid on the 3rd floor.)

2997
01:43:12,551 --> 01:43:16,481
(Second floor, first floor)

2998
01:43:16,721 --> 01:43:20,991
(Mimi and Beom went to 1st floor to help with the food.)

2999
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,890
This is insane.

3000
01:43:22,891 --> 01:43:23,920
(Denying reality)

3001
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:25,021
This is truly insane.

3002
01:43:25,191 --> 01:43:28,731
(The first encounter with the cooking nymph)

3003
01:43:29,061 --> 01:43:30,730
(As she's down here...)

3004
01:43:30,731 --> 01:43:32,331
(Feeling nervous)

3005
01:43:32,671 --> 01:43:35,841
(She seems like a school dietitian.)

3006
01:43:36,071 --> 01:43:40,670
(Beom heads to scoop the rice without noticing.)

3007
01:43:40,671 --> 01:43:43,081
She was dressed like that on the first floor.

3008
01:43:43,281 --> 01:43:45,310
The fortune teller and the cook were two different people.

3009
01:43:45,311 --> 01:43:48,921
(The members waited on the 2nd floor without knowing anything.)

3010
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:52,590
She heard everything we said.

3011
01:43:52,591 --> 01:43:56,421
(The fortune teller nymph saw everything on the 3rd floor.)

3012
01:43:56,591 --> 01:43:57,760
- No way. - Gosh.

3013
01:43:57,761 --> 01:43:59,130
That was why she said, "You can't be touching things."

3014
01:43:59,131 --> 01:44:00,131
(Feeling goosebumps)

3015
01:44:00,132 --> 01:44:02,331
(The cooking nymph got done with preparing for the meal.)

3016
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:04,800
(She crouched down to move in secret.)

3017
01:44:04,801 --> 01:44:06,270
The one who cooked went back up!

3018
01:44:06,271 --> 01:44:07,401
This is unbelievable.

3019
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:08,701
That's amazing.

3020
01:44:09,641 --> 01:44:11,540
(Switching with the fortune teller on the 3rd floor)

3021
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:13,370
Twins tend to look slightly different from each other,

3022
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:14,510
but these two looked identical.

3023
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:16,740
- We didn't notice at all. - Right.

3024
01:44:16,741 --> 01:44:17,780
(The fortune teller nymph heads out while knowing about everything.)

3025
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:22,221
(She returns to the 1st floor in just 20 seconds.)

3026
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:26,550
(She manages to fool the Sixth Sense members!)

3027
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:29,061
This was the most thrilling experience I've had this year.

3028
01:44:30,321 --> 01:44:32,730
It was scarier than a horror movie.

3029
01:44:32,731 --> 01:44:34,260
- Same here. - Right.

3030
01:44:34,261 --> 01:44:36,001
I lost my voice because all of the screaming.

3031
01:44:36,261 --> 01:44:37,900
- Gosh. - I was so nasty earlier.

3032
01:44:37,901 --> 01:44:39,871
I leaned toward Si An so much.

3033
01:44:40,931 --> 01:44:43,401
(Let me hide behind you.)

3034
01:44:44,141 --> 01:44:45,171
This was 20 days before the shoot?

3035
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:48,170
Gosh, they went this far for this?

3036
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:49,411
(Filling the area with many different props)

3037
01:44:49,641 --> 01:44:52,450
(This old place wasn't used for 8 years.)

3038
01:44:52,451 --> 01:44:54,681
(How has it changed?)

3039
01:44:54,881 --> 01:44:56,420
(The main shrine area on the 2nd floor)

3040
01:44:56,421 --> 01:44:58,550
- That's amazing. - Gosh.

3041
01:44:58,551 --> 01:44:59,790
(Full of fortune teller vibes)

3042
01:44:59,791 --> 01:45:01,021
Gosh, they did a great job.

3043
01:45:02,221 --> 01:45:05,291
(Lastly, the walls on the outside get worked on.)

3044
01:45:06,191 --> 01:45:08,700
(It now has the perfect look of a fortune teller's place.)

3045
01:45:08,701 --> 01:45:09,800
Awesome.

3046
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:11,361
(The residents of the village came to see the change.)

3047
01:45:11,531 --> 01:45:13,671
- It's much cleaner now. - It has changed so much.

3048
01:45:13,871 --> 01:45:15,100
Gosh.

3049
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:17,770
How does it feel to have a kitchen for our Women's Association?

3050
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:19,440
- It's great! - It's great!

3051
01:45:19,441 --> 01:45:21,340
- It's great, isn't it? - Yes!

3052
01:45:21,341 --> 01:45:22,940
It became a home for the residents of the village.

3053
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:25,181
It became a place of shelter.

3054
01:45:25,351 --> 01:45:26,980
I'm feeling goosebumps all over!

3055
01:45:26,981 --> 01:45:28,010
(They all were fooled today.)

3056
01:45:28,011 --> 01:45:30,820
Were there things that felt tough while preparing for this?

3057
01:45:30,821 --> 01:45:32,191
Gosh, can I start?

3058
01:45:33,091 --> 01:45:37,120
I wasn't able to sleep because of the rattling sounds.

3059
01:45:37,121 --> 01:45:38,121
I knew nothing about fortune telling.

3060
01:45:38,122 --> 01:45:40,160
- Was she the fortune teller? - I had to fool people with this.

3061
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:42,000
- I think it's the one on the right. - That was tough.

3062
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:43,431
- I'm sorry for fooling you all. - Really?

3063
01:45:44,501 --> 01:45:46,700
Sixth Sense,

3064
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:48,400
- this place is fake! - This place is fake!

3065
01:45:48,401 --> 01:45:49,641
(Possessed Korean Set Menu, fake)

3066
01:45:50,041 --> 01:45:51,840
(Clapping)

3067
01:45:51,841 --> 01:45:53,341
Today's episode was great!

3068
01:45:54,341 --> 01:45:56,710
Gosh, you've all gone through so much work.

3069
01:45:56,711 --> 01:45:58,010
- Gosh! - That was amazing.

3070
01:45:58,011 --> 01:45:59,681
- That was amazing. - That was shocking.

3071
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:02,320
- You've got it wrong. - We have a penalty.

3072
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:04,980
I think I will feel better if I get picked.

3073
01:46:04,981 --> 01:46:07,021
- Si An should pick one. - Right.

3074
01:46:07,251 --> 01:46:09,490
The penalty is uploading a cringeworthy post...

3075
01:46:09,491 --> 01:46:10,920
on social media without any explanations for 24 hours.

3076
01:46:10,921 --> 01:46:12,991
It can't be me.

3077
01:46:13,191 --> 01:46:15,430
- I have no social media account. - You don't?

3078
01:46:15,431 --> 01:46:16,530
If you don't have a social media account,

3079
01:46:16,531 --> 01:46:17,730
you have to send a cheesy text to a close friend.

3080
01:46:17,731 --> 01:46:19,000
- I don't have any. - I sent a text.

3081
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:20,771
If I get picked, I'll have to send a text.

3082
01:46:20,971 --> 01:46:22,070
- As long as it's not me... - Who is it?

3083
01:46:22,071 --> 01:46:23,140
I haven't looked at it yet.

3084
01:46:23,141 --> 01:46:24,171
- Take a look. - I picked one.

3085
01:46:24,871 --> 01:46:25,910
Did you pick one?

3086
01:46:25,911 --> 01:46:27,671
(Curious)

3087
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:29,411
- It's Beom. - It's Beom.

3088
01:46:29,641 --> 01:46:30,681
Goodness.

3089
01:46:30,841 --> 01:46:33,451
Beom, Beo, Beo, Beo, Beom

3090
01:46:34,081 --> 01:46:36,021
I will dominate all

3091
01:46:36,851 --> 01:46:38,920
Send a text to your CEO...

3092
01:46:38,921 --> 01:46:40,550
- I should do that. - later.

3093
01:46:40,551 --> 01:46:41,621
Okay.

3094
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:44,021
(The text recipient, Comedian Lee Chang Ho)

3095
01:46:44,061 --> 01:46:45,260
(Chang Ho, I exist because of you.)

3096
01:46:45,261 --> 01:46:46,590
(You exist because of me. As long as we encourage...)

3097
01:46:46,591 --> 01:46:48,160
(and support each other, we'll find ourselves at a high place.)

3098
01:46:48,161 --> 01:46:50,130
(Oy, oy!)

3099
01:46:50,131 --> 01:46:53,801
(A cucumber lover)

3100
01:46:54,514 --> 01:46:56,413
(For Sixth Sense: City Tour 2's finale)

3101
01:46:56,414 --> 01:46:57,614
(The tenth City Tour)

3102
01:46:58,714 --> 01:47:01,013
(The city of taste and style, Gangnam)

3103
01:47:01,014 --> 01:47:02,053
(Delicious food)

3104
01:47:02,054 --> 01:47:03,183
(Fashion)

3105
01:47:03,184 --> 01:47:05,353
(The center of popular places in Seoul)

3106
01:47:05,354 --> 01:47:08,093
(And visiting Gangnam...)

3107
01:47:08,094 --> 01:47:10,664
(A huge star?)

3108
01:47:11,494 --> 01:47:13,964
(Actress Park Shin Hye)

3109
01:47:14,064 --> 01:47:16,864
(The arrival of someone sharp in the world of blunt members)

3110
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:19,434
Shin Hye isn't ordinary either.

3111
01:47:19,774 --> 01:47:21,534
(Detective Shin Hye full of cleverness)

3112
01:47:21,574 --> 01:47:22,703
In this small space,

3113
01:47:22,704 --> 01:47:23,943
there are two air conditioners.

3114
01:47:23,944 --> 01:47:25,713
(Her lethal weapon 1: Keen observation)

3115
01:47:25,714 --> 01:47:28,273
(Her lethal weapon 2: Relentless persistence)

3116
01:47:28,274 --> 01:47:31,314
I've known Shin Hye for a long time.

3117
01:47:31,544 --> 01:47:32,983
One of her many strengths...

3118
01:47:32,984 --> 01:47:34,613
(She's very good at this.)

3119
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:36,854
(Detective Shin Hye's last lethal weapon?)

3120
01:47:36,954 --> 01:47:37,954
What's this?

3121
01:47:37,955 --> 01:47:39,553
(The Sixth Sense members' reasoning radar is on.)

3122
01:47:39,554 --> 01:47:41,293
(Endless shocks...)

3123
01:47:41,294 --> 01:47:42,963
(and unprecedented difficulty level)

3124
01:47:42,964 --> 01:47:44,593
(Determined to succeed even if it takes supernatural connections)

3125
01:47:44,594 --> 01:47:46,564
(Detective Shin Hye is very satisfied.)

3126
01:47:46,664 --> 01:47:48,294
(However...)

3127
01:47:48,364 --> 01:47:49,604
(Never let your guard down.)

3128
01:47:49,634 --> 01:47:51,063
This is insane.

3129
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:53,203
(What's the ultimate fake that shocks the members?)

3130
01:47:53,204 --> 01:47:55,103
Sixth Sense is really scary.
