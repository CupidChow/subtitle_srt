1
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:16,974
Jae Seok, hello.

2
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,374
Kyung Pyo isn't late.

3
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,244
Hello.

4
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,414
We're in Incheon today.

5
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:25,884
Kyung Pyo.

6
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:28,484
Tell me you didn't get a new manager because of what happened last week.

7
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:31,494
(It happened on the filming day of Episode 3.)

8
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:33,353
(Kyung Pyo arrived late...)

9
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:35,663
(due to his manager's mistake.)

10
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:37,464
(Hurried)

11
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:40,834
(Kyung Pyo appeared like a guest.)

12
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,263
No, that manager is in Busan...

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,934
because of a schedule there.

14
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:47,174
- We thought you got a new manager. - That's right.

15
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:50,174
I can see why you had that thought.

16
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:53,114
(Thankfully, there isn't a problem.)

17
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:54,544
My goodness.

18
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:56,484
We're in Incheon today.

19
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:59,084
(The 4th city of City Tour)

20
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,683
(Incheon)

21
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,323
(It connects the sea...)

22
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,554
(and the land.)

23
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:09,224
(It's the number 1 port city near the capital.)

24
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,594
(K-concert)

25
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,794
(K-tradition)

26
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:17,333
(K-fun)

27
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,633
(And...)

28
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,004
(the K-fake that's hidden in Incheon)

29
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:23,803
(Between what's fake...)

30
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,944
(and real)

31
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,314
Seriously, this is just...

32
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:28,913
(Full of things they've never seen before)

33
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,583
(Hold on!)

34
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:34,054
(Today's fake place will make everyone feel betrayed.)

35
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:36,623
(Will you be able to find the hidden K-fake?)

36
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:37,993
You know, Shim Hyung Rae...

37
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,623
looked like this when he did comedy skits in the past.

38
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:40,963
- What do you mean? - I'm talking about her hairstyle.

39
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:42,364
Yeong Gu isn't here!

40
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:43,664
(Laughing)

41
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,593
- You know the comedy skits. - That's all I know.

42
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,404
Your hair is at an awkward length.

43
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:48,963
- Why? It's very pretty. - Really?

44
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:50,834
- Is it very pretty? - It's the Gen Z style.

45
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:53,233
- It should be shorter or... - It's just right.

46
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,373
Is it just right?

47
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:55,903
You dressed young again today.

48
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:58,644
Those studs are a bit...

49
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,014
They're the key point.

50
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:01,383
- Do you know what's surprising? - Okay.

51
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,183
I can pull off these pants.

52
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,184
(I see.)

53
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:07,623
Seok Jin, they filmed you from afar earlier.

54
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:09,123
(Nervous)

55
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:10,253
You were looking at your phone like this.

56
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:11,553
(His phone was practically attached to his face.)

57
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:12,754
(His phone was too close.)

58
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,324
- He looked at it like this. - No.

59
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:16,564
- I needed to see something closely. - But...

60
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,034
What's Seok Jin doing?

61
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,263
- Look at him. He wants to be young, - Yes.

62
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,604
But he has bad eyesight.

63
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:23,904
It's close to his face.

64
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,133
You held your phone like this.

65
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,204
(Like this)

66
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:29,003
(That's so funny.)

67
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:30,913
It didn't match his aesthetic goal at all.

68
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:32,974
- There are limitations. - While wearing studded pants...

69
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:34,714
There are limitations, Mimi.

70
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,413
But...

71
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:38,083
You came back to Incheon since Sixth Sense: City Tour 1.

72
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:40,553
- Incheon. - Incheon is nice.

73
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:41,853
- Incheon is nice. - Yes.

74
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,053
I visit Incheon sometimes for fun.

75
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:45,024
Weirdos of Incheon's sea.

76
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:48,293
(Weirdos of Incheon's sea?)

77
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,794
Pig With Eggs.

78
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:51,964
Monkfish That Loves Idols.

79
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:54,164
Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms.

80
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:57,133
Unknown weirdos have appeared...

81
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,904
at Incheon's sea.

82
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:00,773
The sudden appearance of the weirdos...

83
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:03,404
is expected to confuse the Sixth Sense members.

84
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:05,213
(A quite nest of eggs that's protected by...)

85
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:07,014
(a pig?)

86
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:10,313
(Whose egg is this?)

87
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,913
(A chicken egg?)

88
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,084
(A duck egg?)

89
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:14,654
(Is it an ostrich egg?)

90
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:18,154
(A pig with unidentified eggs)

91
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,124
(Uncle.)

92
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:23,823
(Bring that to me.)

93
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,134
(Is it a glow stick for idol singers instead?)

94
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:27,904
(Found at a music show)

95
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,834
(A monkfish that fell in love with idols)

96
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:33,734
(Monkfish That Loves Idols)

97
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:37,003
(A class that's hard to understand)

98
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:38,074
(Is it a mulhoe student who's taking it?)

99
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,984
(I don't understand anything.)

100
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:46,084
(Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms)

101
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:49,754
(Among them, which one is the fake weirdo?)

102
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:52,053
What is "Pig With Eggs?"

103
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:53,224
Pig With Eggs.

104
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:56,863
- Pork and some types of eggs. - Eggs...

105
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,393
- like ostrich eggs. - It must be something like that.

106
00:03:58,394 --> 00:03:59,793
Monkfish That Loves Idols.

107
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,033
- That's very obvious. - Monkfish?

108
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,034
How so?

109
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:04,604
It must like idol singers. This is the OH MY GIRL glow stick.

110
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:06,333
It's their fan glow stick.

111
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,644
Could it be someone who's OH MY GIRL's fan?

112
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:10,803
(Full of anticipation)

113
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:11,814
A member of MIRACLE?

114
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,213
You have guests five minutes away from here.

115
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,214
- Is that so? - Really?
- Shall we go? - Yes.

116
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,754
- It's nice how cool the weather is. - I love it.

117
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:23,224
(This is the central park at the heart of Guwol-dong.)

118
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:25,053
(Nearby, there are City Hall of Incheon...)

119
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:27,324
(and Incheon Culture and Arts Center.)

120
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:31,034
(A downtown oasis for the residents of Incheon)

121
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,834
(Sixth Sense members set off along the central park.)

122
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:36,133
It was hot when I was sleeping last night.

123
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,633
- At night? - Wasn't it hot at night?

124
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,073
I turned on the air conditioner.

125
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,074
It was hot at night.

126
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,343
Do you sleep in your pajamas?

127
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:43,004
- Me? - He sleeps in his underwear.

128
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,413
Underwear? Did you see him?

129
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:47,013
- I bring it up everywhere. - How do you know?

130
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:48,014
Underwear Jee.

131
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:51,553
- Both your wife and Hyun Woo... - Right.

132
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:53,553
- dress well. - Of course. They dress well.

133
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:56,054
- Why are you in your underwear? - That's so strange.

134
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:57,423
Are you the only one...

135
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:58,953
- completely naked? - Completely.

136
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,553
- Really? - That's so funny.

137
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:02,464
It's strange that you asked.

138
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,363
- That's so funny. - Is it strange?

139
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:06,794
- It would look like... - Is it really strange?

140
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:08,763
Do you dress uncomfortably like this at home?

141
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:11,133
No, I wear shorts at home.

142
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:13,433
- I don't even take off my top. - I also wear shorts at home.

143
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,673
Don't you have a problem with taking off your top?

144
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,014
- My goodness. - He can't take off his top.

145
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,443
What problem?

146
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,943
- That was in the past. - In front of my family,

147
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,244
that's not a problem.

148
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:24,183
- You know, right? - What a bold thing to say.

149
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:25,714
Just imagine that he has three belly buttons.

150
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:28,323
(Left, belly button, right)

151
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,254
- You're laughing really hard. - Isn't it about right?

152
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:31,653
While holding the camera...

153
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:32,794
(Laughing loudly)

154
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,164
(I couldn't resist laughing at the 3 belly buttons.)

155
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,393
- That was totally embarrassing. - Just think of it that way.

156
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:38,763
I guess it is a problem.

157
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:39,863
Of course.

158
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:41,563
- It was really fun. - My guess is correct every time.

159
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:42,903
- I'll guess which one is fake. - Really?

160
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,904
The person who works at the place.

161
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:46,134
He makes it obvious.

162
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,873
Actually, I'm a mind reader.

163
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,944
I really want to win the coffee truck.

164
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,943
- Me too. - Really?

165
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,114
The coffee truck sounds meaningful.

166
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:55,444
On the second floor of this building,

167
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,413
- there's a coffee shop. - Over here...

168
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,084
With a view.

169
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,383
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast today.

170
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,153
- Why did you have breakfast? - You had breakfast again?

171
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,793
- Jae Seok, you're amazing. - Kyung Eun woke up early today.

172
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:07,353
- Did she make you breakfast? - She...

173
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:09,294
- Your wife... What? - Goodness.

174
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,434
- Cicada. - Hello.

175
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:13,163
- It's Dong Hyun. - Hello.

176
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,134
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Long time, no see.

177
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,303
- Hello. - Hello.

178
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:17,364
Chuu.

179
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:19,533
- I haven't seen you in a long time. - Hello, nice to meet you.

180
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,374
- I really missed you. - Have a seat.

181
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:25,474
(Positive energy and a lovely voice)

182
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:29,244
(Popular among the MZers and leading trends on social media)

183
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:31,284
(Now she's venturing into acting.)

184
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:34,054
(Chuu who has conquered everything from singing to acting)

185
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:36,384
(A legendary UFC fighter)

186
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,254
(From Cicada Kim...)

187
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,253
(Hey, no strength)

188
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:43,463
(He transformed into a variety show cheat code.)

189
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,664
(Kim Dong Hyun, a man who has strength and goofy charms)

190
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,293
Cicada, are you still hanging?

191
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:48,704
Yes, I'm hanging.

192
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,834
Recently, Cicada entered a competition called Hyrox.

193
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,173
- Have you heard of CrossFit? - I know what that is.

194
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,274
It's a long version of that.

195
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:57,844
- Really? - He's still...

196
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,714
I entered the competition and did a good job.

197
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:02,883
- In that field, - He's at the top.

198
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:04,213
He's still at the stop.

199
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,153
He's the number one player whose abilities could...

200
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:09,523
seamlessly continue after his retirement.

201
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:10,584
That's right.

202
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:11,693
(Feeling proud)

203
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:12,894
Really?

204
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:15,523
Or you could think of him as someone who still longs...

205
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:16,924
for his glory in the past.

206
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:18,633
- No, I don't. - He's living in the past.

207
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:19,664
Yes, in the past.

208
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,334
He's so caught up in the past that he denies the present.

209
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:25,773
- Gosh, you haven't changed. - I'm still attached to the past.

210
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:27,973
Did you hear what Chuu just said?

211
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,704
"Gosh, you haven't changed."

212
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:33,113
- Dong Hyun is always the same. - No.

213
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:35,043
- He hasn't changed. - If I had reached...

214
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:37,783
my peak back then, I could let it go.

215
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:39,113
As I feel unsatisfied,

216
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,123
I keep doing it with some resentment.

217
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:44,024
My goal is placing 1st in the world among people in their 50s.

218
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:47,093
- So do you know what he said to me? - What?

219
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:48,863
When I brought up Hyrox with him,

220
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:51,133
he said, "If you enter, you will win first place."

221
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:52,893
- He'll definitely win first place. - I said that I didn't believe him.

222
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,134
He said, "No one is in their 50s over there."

223
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,533
- Each age group is awarded. - Is it by age group?

224
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,173
- You'd also win first place. - Me too?

225
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:00,773
- As long as you complete it. - You'll definitely win first place.

226
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:01,774
- Anyone in his 60s... - You'll definitely win.

227
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,673
- I'm not in my 60s. - When you run, everyone will clap.

228
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:04,714
Hey, you brat.

229
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,573
- I'm not in my 60s. - Just for your participation.

230
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:09,113
Everyone will applaud you with tears in my eyes.

231
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,253
I wish I could, but I can't enter as someone in his 60s.

232
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:13,383
Chuu, how do you know Mimi?

233
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:16,483
I am her junior.

234
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:17,754
- She's my junior idol. - Yes.

235
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:20,393
- We have no point of contact. - She's your junior idol?

236
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:22,823
Right, but we both know Arin.

237
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,093
Arin...

238
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:25,134
What's Arin?

239
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:26,894
One of the members named Arin...

240
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,134
One of the members.

241
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,134
What's Arin? Do you mean "child?"

242
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,444
She's one of the members in her group.

243
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:36,044
Seok Jin.
(He's disappointed for him.)

244
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,473
Oh, Arin?

245
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,973
- She's one of my fellow members. - Arin, not child.

246
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,044
Right.

247
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:42,443
We both know Arin.

248
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:43,584
(I was slightly surprised.)

249
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:46,113
- Let's order some drinks. - Let's order them.

250
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:47,114
(Shall we drink something?)

251
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:49,724
Three mild, decaffeinated Americanos.

252
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:53,194
- Are we getting desserts? - Yes.

253
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:57,524
(This place that's located on an alley in Guwol-dong)

254
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:01,834
(A paradise for pretty and delicious desserts)

255
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,204
(Every season, it presents a variety of desserts.)

256
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,514
(A popular place in Guwol-dong with real reviews)

257
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:14,043
Here it is.

258
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,884
- It's here. - My gosh.

259
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:17,114
Desserts.

260
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:18,483
What is this?

261
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:19,714
It's so pretty.

262
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:22,254
This must be another hip place.

263
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:27,194
(The desserts look captivating as it's a popular spot.)

264
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:31,764
(You can't wait to taste the desserts.)

265
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,293
Is this peach cake?

266
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:35,333
Is this Earl Grey?

267
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,633
And these are figs.

268
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,403
Figs? I know that they're figs.

269
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:40,974
Really? I'm sorry.

270
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,774
He's quite sensitive at the moment.

271
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,204
I know what they are.

272
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:45,744
- This one? - Chuu.

273
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:47,774
I was asking about this one.

274
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:54,484
(When you're sensitive, take a bite of some sweet financier.)

275
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:58,593
(He takes a bite of the financier.)

276
00:09:58,594 --> 00:09:59,654
Gosh, it's delicious.

277
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:05,233
(Surprised)

278
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,434
It's very crunchy.

279
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:09,063
It's crunchy outside and moist inside.

280
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:14,844
(The financier's surface is crunchy, and it's moist inside.)

281
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:17,944
(Humming)

282
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:20,374
(Exclaiming)

283
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:23,113
You must be a financier expert.

284
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:24,114
(What?)

285
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,514
- It's so delicious. - What did you say?

286
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:28,284
A financier expert?

287
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:29,954
I finally understand you.

288
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,123
I'm starting to understand you now that it's our fourth episode.

289
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,124
(He understands Mimi's language better after 3 episodes.)

290
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,294
Let's try this one.

291
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:37,694
Isn't it made of peach? Or is it simply shaped like a peach?

292
00:10:39,494 --> 00:10:40,563
(It's filled with yogurt and pulp instead of a pit.)

293
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:42,234
It has no pit.

294
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,974
(The taste makes you smile automatically.)

295
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,904
What's this?

296
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,213
- It's granola. - What?

297
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,973
- Granola. - It's granola.

298
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,113
- Yes. - It's really delicious.

299
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,913
- You didn't know that, did you? - Gosh, it's delicious.

300
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:58,184
It's tiramisu.

301
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,584
Hey, I know things too.

302
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,053
Let's see how well you guess today.

303
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:05,453
You got upset.

304
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:06,554
No way.

305
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:09,423
- I don't get upset. - Really?

306
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:11,023
- I don't get upset. - But you look upset.

307
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:12,633
You already got upset.

308
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,033
He got upset by Chuu a few times.

309
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,303
You don't seem to know much about it.

310
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:16,304
(What?)

311
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,873
- How many times are you checking? - I'm at peace.

312
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:20,234
Chuu already forgot about it.

313
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:22,444
My mind is quiet and peaceful.

314
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,074
- Quiet and peaceful. - I don't get upset.

315
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:29,343
(We look forward to Chuu and Peaceful Seok Jin's interaction.)

316
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,353
The first place we're going is called Pig With Eggs.

317
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,483
Pig With Eggs.

318
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,784
It must be eggs inside pork.

319
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:38,094
But that's too simple.

320
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,794
(My goodness)

321
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,224
You're upset again.

322
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:46,433
- He got upset. - No.

323
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:49,004
Even if I hit him during the shoot, pretend that you didn't see it.

324
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:53,133
- I surprised Dong Hyun once. - How?

325
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:54,703
I clenched my fist in front of him.

326
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,474
- I hit him once. - On TV...

327
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:58,274
I saw it on TV.

328
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,844
When he saw your fists, he laughed at them.

329
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:02,684
(What about me?)

330
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:03,914
(Jae Seok...)

331
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:07,514
(You held your fists like this.)

332
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:11,284
(Cute little fists)

333
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,794
- When did I do that? - Like this.

334
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,824
Isn't this adorable?

335
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,394
You don't know how to hold fists, do you?

336
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,333
Hey, take a look at Seok Jin's.

337
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,204
- Take a look. - I can tell from how you hold them.

338
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,433
- You hold your fists... - I can tell from how you hold them.

339
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:28,443
Hold your fists.

340
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:29,503
(Floppy)

341
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,243
What are these?

342
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:32,673
He can't even hold fists.

343
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:34,444
(Fully satisfied)

344
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,114
You look like a LEGO character.

345
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:37,513
Dong Hyun.

346
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,053
This is how an amateur holds his fists.

347
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:41,823
Professionals hold this position.

348
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:43,524
When they throw a punch, they close the fist.

349
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:44,853
- Doesn't it hurt your joints? - What?

350
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:46,324
Straight out.

351
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:49,524
Like this. This is it.

352
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,734
He always holds out his pinkie like this.

353
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:55,133
While stretching out their fist,

354
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,204
they also make a promise.

355
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:00,133
"Don't punch me." This is what you do.

356
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:01,404
He's never hit anyone.

357
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,373
- I can tell. - Have you gotten hit?

358
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:04,504
He's gotten hit before.

359
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,444
How do you know?

360
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:08,844
I blocked it like this.

361
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:11,953
(He blocked the opponent's punch with his face.)

362
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,454
So now...

363
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,083
By the way, I don't get what today's items are.

364
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,123
- First... - I know.

365
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,153
We're here.

366
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:19,793
- Look at the takeout. - Let's go.

367
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:21,464
- Is this the place? Or is it not? - Go.

368
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:23,194
This must be it. Tuna...

369
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:27,234
(Do they see a popular place as soon as they get out?)

370
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:29,133
Is this it? Tuna and salmon...

371
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,903
- Seok Jin, it's this way. - Where?

372
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:32,574
- Seok Jin. - We have to walk a little.

373
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:33,903
- Gosh. - We were looking the wrong way.

374
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,044
- We have to walk. - Goodness.

375
00:13:36,204 --> 00:13:38,444
Why did they drop us off here?

376
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,613
Is this that place?

377
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:41,883
We're in Guwol-dong.

378
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,243
- Guwol-dong in Incheon? - Yes.

379
00:13:43,244 --> 00:13:44,914
It's Guwol-dong Rodeo Street.

380
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:46,913
(Guwol-dong Rodeo Street)

381
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,654
(A hub for shopping and gourmet in Namdong-gu, Incheon)

382
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,524
(Every alley is packed with tasty restaurants.)

383
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:55,694
(Filled with popular spots on social media)

384
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:58,994
(One of Incheon's most bustling districts)

385
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,363
By pronouncing Guwol fast,

386
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:03,533
people call it Gwolridan Street. Is this the same place?

387
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:04,903
(Screaming)

388
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:06,233
(Startled)

389
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:07,234
What's wrong?

390
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,303
(It's just a pigeon.)

391
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:10,444
It's a pigeon.

392
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,114
- Dong Hyun. - Goodness.

393
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,573
You're one of the top fighters in the world.

394
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:14,943
It was alive.

395
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,543
- It was alive. - It wasn't doing anything.

396
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,283
- My goodness. - I didn't know it was a pigeon.

397
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:19,583
He enters...

398
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,053
international competitions for strength.

399
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,053
- "Oh, my." - Seriously.

400
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,253
- What's wrong with you? - It was something black.

401
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,853
As it was wet, I thought that it was a rat.

402
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:26,993
- Goodness. - A huge rat.

403
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:28,223
- Why do you even enter... - Even if it was a rat...

404
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:29,964
- such competitions? - What is that big rat called?

405
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,963
He has a big build, but he's a scaredy-cat.

406
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,163
- What? - Nothing.

407
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,193
You're right.

408
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:35,903
- You're a liar. - I'm not.

409
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:37,104
All you say is a lie.

410
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:39,074
As soon as you saw Jae Seok today,

411
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:40,104
you said, "I missed you so much."

412
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,773
I really did miss him.

413
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:43,373
- Who wouldn't miss someone... - By the way,

414
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:44,604
- like Jae Seok? - I felt it.

415
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:47,014
By the way, I felt it.

416
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,183
Honestly,

417
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,213
Chuu really missed me.

418
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:50,344
- That's not true. - Yes.

419
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,254
I really did miss you.

420
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:54,084
Did you miss me?

421
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,654
(Did you also miss me?)

422
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:57,853
Of course.

423
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,354
- Stop lying. - That's a lie.

424
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:00,923
- She's lying. - She's a liar.

425
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:03,163
- That's a lie. - She's a liar.

426
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:04,293
When Chuu saw him earlier,

427
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,434
- she was very startled. - Why?

428
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:07,364
She wondered why he was here.

429
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:08,933
That's not true.

430
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,364
(Laughing dubiously)

431
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,404
We're here. This is it.

432
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,704
- What's this? - Heureum.

433
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:17,644
What? It's a meat restaurant.

434
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,113
But it's called Pig With Eggs.

435
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,914
This is Pig With Eggs.

436
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,813
Water parsley pork belly.

437
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:25,984
(Why is there water parsley pork belly?)

438
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,024
(A few blocks away from the center of the Rodeo Street)

439
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,454
(A small and intimate barbecue restaurant)

440
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:37,824
(It looks like they sell water parsley pork belly.)

441
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:41,604
(Is there Pig With Eggs here?)

442
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,064
From the start...

443
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,803
- so early in the morning, - Are we eating meat?

444
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,834
- are we eating pork belly? - We're eating meat.

445
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:50,343
Pig with Eggs? What do the eggs mean?

446
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,714
- Go in. - Go inside.

447
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:56,984
(Looking around)

448
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,184
(It looks so ordinary.)

449
00:15:58,185 --> 00:15:59,854
Doesn't it look so ordinary?

450
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:06,994
(It's small yet clean inside.)

451
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,263
Nothing stands out in particular...

452
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:10,624
based on its appearance.

453
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:12,733
(Nothing seems unusual on the menu.)

454
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,463
It's just gochujang pork belly.

455
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:15,533
Gochujang pork belly.

456
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,633
What's this about?

457
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:17,764
(It looks like an ordinary barbecue place.)

458
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:21,974
(What could Pig With Eggs be?)

459
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,374
By the way,

460
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,414
it seems a little...

461
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,814
There's no strong smell of cooking.

462
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:30,184
- You're right. - Doesn't it look so ordinary?

463
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,784
Usually, at a pork belly restaurant,

464
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:35,384
there's an intense smell.

465
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:38,023
It doesn't smell like barbecue here,

466
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:39,593
- does it? - It's not very strong.

467
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:40,654
(A barbecue restaurant without the smell of barbecue?)

468
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:42,623
As you can see,

469
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,133
there's nothing on the walls...

470
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,264
or the windows.

471
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,833
It's completely new.

472
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,604
(The exterior looks way too clean.)

473
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:51,233
This is new.

474
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,404
Right? There's something...

475
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,273
This is new.

476
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,304
(The cast iron pot lids aren't worn-out at all.)

477
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:56,504
(Could it be...)

478
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:59,244
(a fake space that the production crew made?)

479
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,273
It's very new.

480
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:02,744
(At the moment when everything looks suspicious, )

481
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,784
(the restaurant owner greets Sixth Sense members.)

482
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:08,114
- Hello. - Hello.

483
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,353
- He looks very ordinary. - Hello.

484
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:11,484
Hello.

485
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,393
The type of vibe...

486
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:15,064
that the restaurant owner has...

487
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,364
That looks real.

488
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:20,763
(Hidden behind his big smile)

489
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,863
(An extraordinary vibe)

490
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,133
(Laughing)

491
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,474
The vibe of his pants?

492
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,633
Please excuse me,

493
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,444
- but his shorts look worn-out. - Exactly.

494
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,003
He didn't dress up to be on TV.

495
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,714
He didn't put them on purpose.

496
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:35,143
We came here for Pig With Eggs.

497
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,314
What does it mean?

498
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:38,953
We season...

499
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:42,254
pork belly with salted pollack roe.

500
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,353
It's salted pollack roe.

501
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,394
(Salted pollack roe to pork belly?)

502
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:47,753
Hello.

503
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:50,493
I sell pollack roe pork belly in Guwol-dong, Incheon.

504
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:52,164
I'm Lee Kang In, and I'm 33 years old.

505
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,404
I used to work at Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market.

506
00:17:56,604 --> 00:18:00,034
At a pork belly restaurant there, pollack roe was always served.

507
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:04,474
(A barbecue place near Noryangjin that served salted pollack roe)

508
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:07,444
When I tried it with salted pollack roe, it was so good.

509
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,013
I thought, "Instead of having it on the side,"

510
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:10,544
"why don't we apply it on the meat instead?"

511
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:12,114
That's how I started my business.

512
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:15,354
(A combination of two ingredients that's hard to imagine)

513
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:19,394
(Is pollack roe pork belly a real dish on the menu?)

514
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:22,824
(It sounds suspicious.)

515
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:23,963
- Do you have a hunch? - What?

516
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:24,964
Do you have a hunch?

517
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,764
You said that you could tell by looking at the restaurant owner.

518
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,964
Do you sense something?

519
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,504
He said that he could tell by looking at the restaurant owner.

520
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,533
I've spent my whole life reading people's eyes...

521
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:33,803
and playing mind games.

522
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:34,834
(Grunting)

523
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:37,103
- Seriously, I... - You know what?

524
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,773
After playing so many mind games,

525
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,543
you got scared by a pigeon?

526
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:41,673
(Crying)

527
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:43,344
You lost to a pigeon.

528
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,953
Dong Hyun doesn't seem very sharp either.

529
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,553
Could you invite someone sharp?

530
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:49,424
All of us are blunt already.

531
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:50,683
He's very clumsy.

532
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:51,993
- Seriously, I... - I know him.

533
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:52,994
(It will be blunt again today.)

534
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,523
Okay, could we get some pollack roe pork belly?

535
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:56,894
- Would you like to order it? - Yes.

536
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:57,994
Gosh, thank you.

537
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:03,464
(Their investigation is in full swing.)

538
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,474
You know what I find strange?

539
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,904
This is a pollack roe pork belly restaurant,

540
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:11,713
but it isn't emphasized in the name of the restaurant.

541
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:13,244
Shouldn't it be emphasized?

542
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,343
It says "water parsley pork belly."

543
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,043
Why is this the only one...

544
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:18,784
- That's what's weird. - I agree.

545
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:22,023
Maybe it used to be a water parsley pork belly restaurant.

546
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:23,183
He said that it was water parsley.

547
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,454
(Is it actually a water parsley pork belly restaurant?)

548
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:27,324
Let's reason this out logically.

549
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:28,523
Based on the design,

550
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,324
- it looks terrible. - Doesn't it look strange?

551
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:33,333
(The poster is so colorful that it looks suspicious.)

552
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,463
It looks strange.

553
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,763
How shall I put it?

554
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:36,804
(The poster is so colorful that it looks suspicious.)

555
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,933
- Why is a dog holding that? - Exactly.

556
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,333
It's strange.

557
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,404
(And a dog all of a sudden?)

558
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,604
There's no relationship between dogs and salted pollack roe.

559
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:48,074
That dog could belong to the restaurant owner.

560
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:49,944
His name could be Salted Pollack Roe.

561
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:52,083
The name of the dog?

562
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:53,154
Yes.

563
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,713
Sir.

564
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,183
By the way,

565
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:58,154
who designed this poster?

566
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,353
I did.

567
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:00,823
- Really? - How about the dog?

568
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,863
- Is it your dog? - It's my dog.

569
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:03,093
What did I tell you?

570
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:04,523
- What did I tell you? - Right.

571
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:05,763
Isn't the name Salted Pollack Roe?

572
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:06,893
No, it's Winter.

573
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:07,894
(It's Winter.)

574
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:10,163
A dog's name can't be Salted Pollack Roe.

575
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,263
Winter.

576
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:13,874
(Winter, not Salted Pollack Roe)

577
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:16,704
- So you made the poster yourself? - Yes.

578
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,643
He said that he made it as soon as he came back.

579
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,043
I was just checking.

580
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:21,074
(Laughing)

581
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:22,914
They're like a married couple.

582
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,854
(Meanwhile, the pollack roe pork belly appears.)

583
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:29,884
(Surprised)

584
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,383
The salted pollack roe looks amazing.

585
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:32,723
- Take a look. - Seriously.

586
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:35,164
(The salted pollack roe looks amazing.)

587
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:36,623
(Covered with salted pollack roe)

588
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:37,763
That's incredible.

589
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:40,293
(Covered with salted pollack roe)

590
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:41,433
My goodness.

591
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:42,734
(Covered with salted pollack roe)

592
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:47,004
(It tastes salty by looking at it.)

593
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:48,773
(His jaw drops.)

594
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:49,843
Amazing.

595
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,103
Seriously,

596
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:52,974
I've never seen anything like it.

597
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,043
(The land...)

598
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:56,144
(and the sea)

599
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:58,554
(Both in one dish.)

600
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:04,824
(Pollack roe pork belly)

601
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:08,194
When the meat comes in, I age it for three days.

602
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:12,663
I make cuts so that it turns tender when cooked.

603
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:14,364
(Make cuts for the tender texture)

604
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:16,834
(The essence of pollack roe pork belly)

605
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:19,473
(Low sodium white pollack roe)

606
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:21,633
I buy it every morning at Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market...

607
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:23,303
and use it for seasoning.

608
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:25,144
(Fresh pollack roe from Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market)

609
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:31,114
(After bursting all the roe from the sacs)

610
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:36,084
(It's over once it's applied.)

611
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:42,894
(Pollack roe seeping into the knife cuts)

612
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:47,434
(This is Pig With Eggs.)

613
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:51,863
(It's already known as a popular place on social media.)

614
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:53,603
People really like pollack roe pork belly.

615
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,134
It's become quite famous.

616
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:56,873
We sell...

617
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,374
about 800kg per month.

618
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:02,113
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

619
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,384
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

620
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:06,353
- This place is real. - Is it real?

621
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,513
- It's real. - Wouldn't you come here?

622
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,653
- This place is real. - Seriously.

623
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:11,153
- It's real. - I'd actually come here.

624
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,423
- It looks delicious. - I know.

625
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:13,993
- I love salted pollack roe. - It's real.

626
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:15,364
- Really? - Yes, it's delicious.

627
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:16,723
This is real. Look at this.

628
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,763
(I'll put it right on the grill.)

629
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:21,064
(Amazed)

630
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:25,274
(A thick piece of pollack roe pork belly on the cast iron pot)

631
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,604
(As soon as it's heated, )

632
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:31,044
(pollack roe turns white as it gets cooked.)

633
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,013
- Gosh. - This is unbelievable.

634
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,714
It looks...

635
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:36,383
- incredible. - This is a tasty restaurant.

636
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:37,544
- It smells great. - Gosh.

637
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,953
(Kimchi that's a must with pork belly)

638
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,424
Bracken is delicious.

639
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:45,454
- It looks delicious. - This is amazing.

640
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,923
As we know, pollack roe is nicely salty.

641
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,293
Yes, it's perfect.

642
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:52,534
(A pile of pollack roe like snow on top of pork belly)

643
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:54,363
It looks delicious.

644
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:55,364
(Gulping)

645
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:57,133
It smells incredible.

646
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:58,834
(The salty smell makes your mouth water.)

647
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:01,403
- There are so many types of combos. - Right.

648
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,044
Some people grill pork belly in butter.

649
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:08,474
(Dong Hyun is the only one who looks serious.)

650
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:10,614
Here's what I sensed a moment ago.

651
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,353
The restaurant owner made a mistake.

652
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:15,354
How so?

653
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:18,954
When he handed me this plate,

654
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,554
I smelled raw fish on his hands.

655
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,894
- Really? - Yes, I smelled raw fish.

656
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:25,793
(A little while ago)

657
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,264
(The owner handed Dong Hyun a plate.)

658
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:32,034
(Why does it smell like raw fish?)

659
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,233
I used to work at Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market.

660
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:35,474
(The owner used to work at a fish market.)

661
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:38,874
(It could be a coincidence, but a sushi bar is next door.)

662
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:43,744
(Could it be a sushi bar and not a barbecue restaurant?)

663
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,584
This seems like a sushi bar to me.

664
00:23:47,214 --> 00:23:48,723
That's because he deals with roe.

665
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,984
He serves pork belly covered in roe.

666
00:23:52,324 --> 00:23:53,453
That's what you smelled.

667
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:54,754
- Is it the roe? - Yes.

668
00:23:55,524 --> 00:23:57,023
- I can smell it even now. - Even now?

669
00:23:57,024 --> 00:23:58,594
It smells fishy.

670
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:01,164
Try not to make mistakes yourself.

671
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:03,664
- There's the roe. - Watch what you say, okay?

672
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,064
(Laughing)

673
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:07,103
- "Watch what you say." - Watch what you say.

674
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:08,234
Sorry about that.

675
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,103
- How many of them are real? - What?

676
00:24:10,104 --> 00:24:11,503
How many of them are real?

677
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:12,544
(Unbelievable)

678
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:14,013
- Seriously? - You came here not knowing that?

679
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,044
- Anyone can be confused. - Only one is fake.

680
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,584
One is fake, and the others are real?

681
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:18,884
I can't believe him.

682
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:20,784
You've got to be kidding me.

683
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:23,954
(Kyung Pyo has doubts.)

684
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,654
Does anyone grill pollack roe like this?

685
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:29,293
- I've seen it grilled whole. - That's right.

686
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:30,494
But this?

687
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:35,034
(The pollack roe was mashed and then slathered on pork belly.)

688
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:37,034
It's easy to burn pollack roe.

689
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:38,433
Did you see how the owner...

690
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:39,873
- Will it be like scorched rice? - wore his pants?

691
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:40,934
(They're back to doubting it.)

692
00:24:41,204 --> 00:24:43,674
I'm starting to think the staff...

693
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:47,444
created something similar to butter pork belly.

694
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,813
(Butter pork belly amazed the members...)

695
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:53,254
(both visually and in flavor.)

696
00:24:53,454 --> 00:24:56,083
Maybe they came up with a similar dish...

697
00:24:56,084 --> 00:24:58,224
by drawing inspiration from the butter pork belly.

698
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:01,523
Wouldn't we have seen something like this...

699
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:03,324
- on social media? - That's it, Chuu.

700
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:06,034
Out of everyone here, I've lived the longest.

701
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,234
However, I've never heard of this before.

702
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:10,504
- This idea never came up. - Really?

703
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,674
Didn't they have this after the Liberation of Korea?

704
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:15,704
- Wasn't it a thing? - The Liberation of Korea?

705
00:25:15,844 --> 00:25:17,473
- No, not after the liberation. - Wasn't it a thing?

706
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,704
- It never existed. - The Liberation of Korea?

707
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,243
What about when pollack roe was easily caught in Incheon?

708
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,714
It was never a thing.

709
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,684
Even one of my friends who was a royal inspector...

710
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,653
- It could've existed. - He lived during that time.

711
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:29,384
(Anyway, he's saying it was never a thing.)

712
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,823
- Let me check on the meat. - Sure.

713
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:33,154
(The pollack roe pork belly gets grilled nicely.)

714
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:36,324
(What's this?)

715
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:37,994
(The pork belly is flipped...)

716
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:40,534
(revealing a golden brown surface.)

717
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:46,134
(The pollack roe has gotten crispy, like scorched rice.)

718
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:49,403
(A layer of pollack roe thickly coating the pork belly)

719
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:51,074
I can't wait to see what this tastes like.

720
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,574
That looks really good.

721
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,044
(Gulping)

722
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:58,543
Won't the pollack roe burn?

723
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,984
That's why we grill the meat for the customers.

724
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:03,154
Grill?

725
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,524
- Grilling. - I see.

726
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:07,654
He cooks the meat himself.

727
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:09,823
Why couldn't he have just said that?

728
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:11,494
(Sulking)

729
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:12,794
This is fake!

730
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:15,603
Those trying to mask their true identities...

731
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:16,863
- use fancy words. - They use English words.

732
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:17,934
That's right.

733
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:21,003
It must be because of the pollack roe,

734
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,844
but we're not seeing a lot of melted fat.

735
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:25,273
- There aren't any oil spatters. - We're not getting splashed by oil.

736
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,774
(Clean and free of oil splatter, the pollack roe pork belly)

737
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:28,913
- Everything's so clean. - Right?

738
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,214
You're right.

739
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:32,384
(Will it be dry since there isn't any fat?)

740
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:38,584
(Juicy meat is under the layer of pollack roe.)

741
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:43,764
(Crunchy pollack roe meets juicy pork belly)

742
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:48,534
(Crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside)

743
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:50,033
(Topped with water parsley)

744
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:51,864
- It's topped with water parsley. - So that's why.

745
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:53,773
(A whole plate of pollack roe pork belly is ready.)

746
00:26:53,774 --> 00:26:54,834
This looks good.

747
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:58,344
Sir, can we eat this now?

748
00:26:58,504 --> 00:26:59,714
Yes, dig in.

749
00:27:01,014 --> 00:27:03,344
- It smells good. - This smells so good.

750
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:07,384
(A salty smell that makes your mouth water)

751
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,153
- Let's try it. - Can we eat now?

752
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:11,354
(How will it taste?)

753
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:15,323
(Kyung Pyo tries one first.)

754
00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:16,324
(Humming)

755
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,193
How is it?

756
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:19,394
(Curious)

757
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:20,833
It's really good.

758
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,034
- Really? - Yes!

759
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,903
(Let me try one.)

760
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:25,773
(Munching)

761
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:27,404
(Exclaiming)

762
00:27:27,674 --> 00:27:29,304
It's salty and delicious.

763
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,744
No way.

764
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:32,073
(Seok Jin tries a big piece.)

765
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:33,774
(Munching)

766
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,213
(Exclaiming)

767
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:36,443
- Is it good? - It's incredible.

768
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:37,544
- It's really good. - Seriously.

769
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,353
It's not exactly pork belly,

770
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:41,014
and it's not exactly pollack roe, but it's so good.

771
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:43,224
(Is it really that good?)

772
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,284
(A mouthful)

773
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,754
Right? Isn't it surprising?

774
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:50,724
(You can't help but smile.)

775
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:53,163
(Dong Hyun tries a piece as well.)

776
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:54,164
(Wow!)

777
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:55,764
It's really good.

778
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:56,934
- This is insane. - It's so good.

779
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:58,703
The pollack roe...

780
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:00,504
sits in the grooves cut into the pork belly strip.

781
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,544
The texture of the roe and its saltiness...

782
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,374
sing in perfect harmony.

783
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:08,144
I already swallowed my piece, but the umami still lingers.

784
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:10,244
The umami's throwing a party in my mouth.

785
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:12,884
- I mean... - Wait, that expression.

786
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,524
- That was good. - This is so good that I'm angry.

787
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:19,054
It even tastes like croaker.

788
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:20,693
- Yes, it tastes like croaker! - Right.

789
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:22,094
The saltiness reminds me of it.

790
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:25,594
It's a mixture of meat and seafood.

791
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:28,863
It's safe to say this pork belly...

792
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:30,404
has its own roe.

793
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:33,003
Shouldn't this place be more famous?

794
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,304
This is the real deal.

795
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:36,203
(Sniffing)

796
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:38,143
- No way. - It's the real deal.

797
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:39,144
(The smell is enough to send him into bliss.)

798
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:42,073
The pollack roe suck up the fat from the meat.

799
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:43,244
(The juiciness of the meat is trapped between the pollack roe.)

800
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:45,884
Imagine how much oil is trapped inside this piece.

801
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:47,983
No wonder the juices start flowing in your mouth.

802
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:49,923
(Dipping)

803
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,383
Yet, you're dipping it in more oil.

804
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:52,593
(Busted)

805
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:53,924
(She dips it in more oil!)

806
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:55,523
Dip a piece of meat in oil.

807
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:56,694
(Oil meets oil. How can it not taste good?)

808
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:58,193
They're not playing individually.

809
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,194
- Right? - Yes.

810
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,334
They pair well together.

811
00:29:00,464 --> 00:29:02,933
No way. How can it stay so juicy?

812
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,864
The juices are released the second you eat it.

813
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,974
This is a game-changer.

814
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:08,304
Here.

815
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:10,273
(A bit mouthful)

816
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:11,274
(Yummy)

817
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:13,343
(Looking behind her)

818
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,444
(It's the best.)

819
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:16,943
This is insane. It's so good.

820
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:17,944
Seriously.

821
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:20,484
Has a dish this tasty ever turned out to be fake?

822
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,824
- Of course. - Those are just as delicious.

823
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,454
You've been at this for a while. What's your gut telling you?

824
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:28,854
It's hard for this to be fake.

825
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:32,164
I became a true believer after eating this.

826
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,664
Aren't you automatically craving rice?

827
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:36,534
Yes, let's have some rice.

828
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,974
Check this out. It's a full bowl of rice.

829
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,444
This pork belly...

830
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:44,004
- Here you go. - Sure.

831
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:46,014
This must be pollack roe rice.

832
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,514
(What Gyeo Ul was promoting)

833
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:51,044
(Pollack roe rice)

834
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,113
(In a stone pot coated with a drizzle of sesame oil)

835
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:54,783
(Rice)

836
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:56,423
(Sour kimchi)

837
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:57,854
(Pickled radish)

838
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:00,494
(And a generous amount of salted pollack roe)

839
00:30:02,924 --> 00:30:04,023
(After being topped...)

840
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:05,423
(with dried laver flakes and perilla leaves, )

841
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:06,494
(it's brought to a boil.)

842
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,593
(Pollack roe rice with a popping texture)

843
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:10,764
The pollack roe rice looks incredible.

844
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:13,774
(Try it.)

845
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,474
(Mimi tries it first.)

846
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:19,974
It's so good.

847
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,914
- The pollack roe rice is amazing. - Is it good?

848
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,413
- It's delicious. - It's really good.

849
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:24,713
- Seriously. - Especially the scorched rice.

850
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:25,714
Exactly.

851
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:29,283
(The rice was scorched on the bottom in sesame oil.)

852
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:30,524
The pollack roe rice is insane.

853
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:33,154
Even the rice tastes amazing.

854
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:36,164
(Gazing)

855
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:38,694
(Lifting)

856
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:40,694
Thank you.

857
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,603
I mean, I'd like some.

858
00:30:42,604 --> 00:30:44,134
You want some? Which one?

859
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:45,404
The pollack roe rice?

860
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:48,134
Stop being so greedy. You'll become addicted to carbs!

861
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:50,303
You have rice here and also here.

862
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:52,344
(Rice 1, Rice 2)

863
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,374
I should try the pollack roe rice.

864
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:56,244
It's really good. I'm not kidding.

865
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,744
The pollack roe rice is delicious.

866
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:00,484
Everything's good. This place is amazing.

867
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:03,124
(And...)

868
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:07,393
(Someone who's enjoying the food more than anyone)

869
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:09,024
You guys sure eat a lot.

870
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:12,423
Wasn't MIYEON on the show last week?

871
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:14,164
- Yes. - That's right.

872
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:15,903
I asked what she had been up to,

873
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:17,963
- and she said she filmed this show. - That's right.

874
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:19,703
When I asked if she could still have dinner...

875
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:21,033
after eating at three places earlier,

876
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:22,373
she said you finished early...

877
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:24,644
and that she was slightly hungry.

878
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:26,543
- Really? - We shared four portions among us.

879
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:28,043
- On that day? - Yes.

880
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,044
On that day?

881
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:30,544
It's hard to eat anything more after filming this show.

882
00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:32,484
- She ate a lot that day. - She ate a lot.

883
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:34,413
(What MIYEON had that day: Whole pork belly, )

884
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:35,883
(Chapaghetti, )

885
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:37,823
(rotisserie chicken, )

886
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:39,823
(taco, )

887
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,153
(jjamppong ramyeon, )

888
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:42,794
(croffle...)

889
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,493
(Then she had shabu-shabu for dinner.)

890
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:45,764
(I was full, so we only ate 4 portions.)

891
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,333
Before filming that day, she already had two rolls of gimbap.

892
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:48,434
- Exactly! - That's right.

893
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:49,663
She's a big eater.

894
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:52,104
- Yes, she said that. - She has a big appetite.

895
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:55,334
Chuu seems to have a big appetite as well.

896
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:58,273
Food fighters tend to be skinny.

897
00:31:58,274 --> 00:31:59,274
No way.

898
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:01,943
It's not like MIYEON and Chuu are food fighters.

899
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:05,014
(They're not exactly food fighters.)

900
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,383
I'm not saying that they are.

901
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,883
- Why did you mention it, then? - I'm just saying...

902
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:10,684
that food fighters tend to be skinny.

903
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:13,323
Look at you pronouncing your Fs.

904
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:14,923
- That I should. - "Food fighter."

905
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:16,223
I'll lose sleep if it sounds like a P.

906
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:17,423
It's food fighter.

907
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:18,523
If this restaurant doesn't exist,

908
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:20,193
does that mean the staff created this dish?

909
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:21,833
- That's right. - That doesn't make sense.

910
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,003
- Right? - That isn't possible.

911
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,204
There's no way this dish doesn't exist.

912
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:28,234
This dish exists for sure.

913
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:30,074
I'd like one more.

914
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:32,714
This neighborhood is packed with delicious restaurants.

915
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:34,473
- This place... - It's packed.

916
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,883
- Look over there. - He's the son of Incheon.

917
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:39,114
- It's packed with restaurants. - Isn't this a main street?

918
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:41,484
It's changed so much though.

919
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,823
It's the Guwol-dong Rodeo Street.

920
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:45,623
We're filming in September which is why we're in Guwol-dong.

921
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:47,993
We made sure the words rhymed.

922
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:49,563
- As if that made sense. - What?

923
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:50,894
Will we go to Siwol-dong in October, then?

924
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,964
- That's absurd. - It's true.

925
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:56,334
(Guwol-dong, a neighborhood that's even better in September)

926
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:59,163
This is like the downtown area...

927
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:00,173
- of Incheon. - Here?

928
00:33:00,174 --> 00:33:01,503
Guwol-dong in Incheon is well-known.

929
00:33:01,504 --> 00:33:02,534
That's right.

930
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:08,214
(The streets get even livelier at night.)

931
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,514
(The hottest street in Incheon)

932
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,183
We have such good weather today.

933
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:15,814
- It's such nice weather. - Yes.

934
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:17,223
It's just nice for filming.

935
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:18,683
(The perfect weather to tour the city)

936
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:19,753
- It's just nice. - It's cool.

937
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:21,853
- Fall is my favorite season. - It's so nice.

938
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:23,264
- Me too. - Really?

939
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,624
What about you, Cicada?

940
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:26,494
I like summer.

941
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:28,033
- Really? - I hate the cold.

942
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:29,703
When it starts getting cold,

943
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:31,604
I get that feeling when I run outside.

944
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,073
The feeling of catching a cold.

945
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:36,673
- He catches a cold very easily. - Yes.

946
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,003
That happens to muscular people.

947
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:40,474
- Jong Kook catches a cold easily. - He catches a cold easily too.

948
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:43,043
Because we always work out to our limits.

949
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:44,343
What limits?

950
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:45,543
So our immune system is low.

951
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:46,983
If you work to your limits,

952
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,314
why are you so scared of pigeons?

953
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,554
I feel awkward around them.

954
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,293
- Dong Hyun, show us your punch. - Punch.

955
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:55,553
My gosh.

956
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:56,563
(The members spotted a boxing machine.)

957
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,294
- Punch it. - Gosh, this...

958
00:33:58,624 --> 00:34:01,064
(Street fighters' way of measuring their combat power)

959
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:03,304
(Show us what you've got, Stun Gun.)

960
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:05,363
- Dong Hyun, punch it. - Gosh, this...

961
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,833
- Let's see Dong Hyun's punch. - Really?

962
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,033
- I'll definitely break the record. - He...

963
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:10,973
- I can do it. - By right you should.

964
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:13,243
- Throw a punch. - I'll definitely break the record.

965
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:15,314
It's my first time seeing Dong Hyun punch.

966
00:34:15,814 --> 00:34:17,413
Let me show you.

967
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,484
(Stun Gun starts warming up.)

968
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,283
- Here. - Let's do this.

969
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:22,314
Select this.

970
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,324
You can do that?

971
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:26,824
You can pay like this.

972
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,224
- It's done. - It's done.

973
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:29,563
Okay!

974
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:30,564
(Let's go!)

975
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:31,664
Why isn't it coming down?

976
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:34,193
- It's automatic. - It's automatic.

977
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:35,833
- It comes down on its own. - It says here not to pull.

978
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,103
"Don't touch it."

979
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,303
- It's written here. - You go first.

980
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:39,573
- It looks fun. - Who wants to go first?

981
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:40,603
You should go last.

982
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:41,903
- Go first. - Who wants to go first?

983
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:43,174
You want to go first, Weak Seok Sam?

984
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,704
(I'm not weak.)

985
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:47,043
(Laughing)

986
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,144
Seok Jin, you have ten seconds!

987
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:49,783
- Ten seconds? - Punch it quickly.

988
00:34:49,784 --> 00:34:51,143
I'll put my weight behind the punch.

989
00:34:51,144 --> 00:34:54,184
- Punch it now. Five, four, three. - Five, four, three, two.

990
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:56,923
That was weak.

991
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:58,584
I could hit it harder with my head.

992
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,724
I put my weight behind it.

993
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,763
(But the score keeps going up.)

994
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:04,194
It's going up so high.

995
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:06,763
(What is Seok Jin's score?)

996
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:07,894
It's 9,419.

997
00:35:08,894 --> 00:35:10,903
- It's 9,419. - It's 9,419.

998
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,833
- Who next? - Should I go?

999
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:13,834
- Chuu. - Me?

1000
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:15,204
- Hit it, Chuu. - Let's go.

1001
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,403
One, two... How should I punch it?

1002
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:19,744
How can I punch it with power?

1003
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,973
- Like this? - You don't have to hold your wrist.

1004
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:23,013
Just punch it.

1005
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,783
- You need to hit the upper part. - The upper part?

1006
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:25,883
(Stun Gun's tip: Aim for the upper part)

1007
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:27,813
Four, three, two.

1008
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:29,054
(She hit based on Dong Hyun's advice!)

1009
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:30,824
Nice.

1010
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:32,323
- That was strong! - Really?

1011
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:33,324
You're strong.

1012
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,894
(What's her score?)

1013
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:39,324
- I thought it's higher than yours. - My goodness.

1014
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:40,764
I thought I'd lose.

1015
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:42,364
You guys are similar.

1016
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:44,503
How did you score so high?

1017
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:45,934
I work out at the gym too.

1018
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:48,504
Why... It's my turn now.

1019
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:50,573
I'll go.

1020
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:51,973
Let's go.

1021
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:53,114
I'll show you.

1022
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:56,114
I'll show you what a punch is.

1023
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:58,744
- Clench your fist like this. - Like this.

1024
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:00,653
- Like this. - A weak fist.

1025
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:01,684
(Zero expectation)

1026
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:02,883
(Mantis boxing, cat boxing)

1027
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:03,924
A weak punch.

1028
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,883
Like this.

1029
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:07,724
(But he alone is very serious.)

1030
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:08,993
(The punch makes him wail.)

1031
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,023
My goodness.

1032
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:11,963
- You didn't hit it right. - I hit it well.

1033
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,164
I won.

(Seok Jin wins.)

1037
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:22,204
- I beat you. - You're at Chuu's level.

1038
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:24,843
- I beat you. - Did Chuu beat me?

1039
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,743
- Chuu beat you. - That can't be true.

1040
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:27,814
I won, right?

1041
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,343

- I'll do it. - You learned boxing, right?

1045

You have a good posture.

1046

I'll do it.

That was weak for someone who learned boxing.

1075
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:44,124
Yes!

1076
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,284
- Currently in first place. - How is he so strong?

1077
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:48,524
I'm in second place, next to Kyung Pyo.

1078
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,693
Do I start?

1079
00:37:50,694 --> 00:37:52,194
Should I do a hook or a straight?

1080

(He won 13 games, the highest record in Korean UFC history.)

1081

(Ranked 6th in the world before for welterweight)

1082
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:01,274
(He knocks down his opponents with his fists.)

1083
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,874
(Stun Gun, Kim Dong Hyun)

1084
00:38:04,204 --> 00:38:06,844
(Here he comes.)

1085

Here he goes.

1086
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:09,413
(All eyes on him)

1087
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,743
You need to push with your body when you punch.

1088
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:12,883
- Yes. - It's the same.

1089

1106
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:54,829
(What?)

1107
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,499
He's acting like he's unwell.

1108
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,969
- What's with the acting suddenly? - My shoulder hurts.

1109
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,208
I have a bad shoulder.

1110
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,208
Kyung Pyo...

1111
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:08,109

1112
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,408

00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,429

1122
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:25,858
This doesn't make sense. I lost?

1123
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:26,859
(For Dong Hyun, who feels very wronged...)

1124
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,859
Shall we try again with this?

1125
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:31,828
Dong Hyun had an injured shoulder just now.

1126
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:32,869
Exactly.

1127
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:34,238
I mean...

1128
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,968
This is shocking.

1129
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:37,409
I normally don't lose in a boxing machine game.

1130
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,709
Back in my days, we used this machine.

1131
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:41,939
- This one. - This is the original one?

1132
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,909
- That's fake. - Fake.

(Kyung Pyo, the champion, starts.)

1136

Watch out for your wrist, Kyung Pyo.

1137
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,959
Kyung Pyo, don't push yourself too hard.

1138
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:56,159
(He makes Stun Gun nervous.)

1139

His punch... It's 931.

1143
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,239
It's 931.

1144
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:13,179
You're strong. Kyung Pyo...

1145
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,879
He's so strong.

1146
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,609
You're good at this.

(Dong Hyun has become the challenger now.)

1148
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,579
Dong Hyun, you...

1149
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:22,579
You shouldn't just beat Kyung Pyo. You should beat that too.

1150
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,848
You need to punch the lower part for this.

1151
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:26,988
- How do you do it? - And push it with your body.

1152
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:30,159
- So... - Two seconds.

1153
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:33,328

1154
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:34,429

1155
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,169
(It hit right on the mark.)

1156
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,398
He's strong.

1157
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,468
(Impressed)

1158
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,199
It hit the right spot.

(925 points, 6 points less than Kyung Pyo's)

1162
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:51,849

(He won both matches.)

1165
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,518
(His shoulder starts to ache again.)

1166
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,788
Stop acting like you're in pain.

1167
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:01,919
- Stop acting. - Hey.

1168
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,928
Why are you doing that?

1169
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,289
What's with you, Stun Gun?

1170
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,299
Stun Gun's battery has died.

1171
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,728
You have a weak fist.

1172
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:11,598
- It's strange. - Weak fist.

00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,579
- I... - You're so strong.

1177
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,839
- There's a soccer machine too. - You startled me.

1178
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,509
- It's a soccer machine. - Let's play it.

1179
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,778
- Let's play soccer. - Soccer machine.

1180
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:27,948
- Your ankle will snap. - I want to play it.

1181
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:29,148
- You might hurt your ankle. - Really?

1182

- You might get hurt. - You might snap your ankle.

1183

Yes, more than a hundred.

00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:37,979
- that's not seasoned much... - I see.

1243
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:39,378
And you eat something that's a little bit spicy,

1244
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:40,678
your stomach refuses it.

1245
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,549
- It must be the same for Jong Kook. - Your stomach weakens.

1246
00:43:43,149 --> 00:43:45,018
- That's right. - You guys are weak.

1247
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:46,249
- When you eat stuff like that... - Both Jong Kook and you.

1248
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,259
We push ourselves to the limits when we work out.

1249
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,328
- What limits? - I mean it.

1250
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,128
- I always push myself to my limits. - Stop it now.

1251
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,028
- What limit are you talking about? - It's not limits.

1252
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:55,358
- It's just one. - Just one.

1253
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,359
Just a single thing.

1254
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,468
Just one.

1255
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,898
I always push myself to my limits.

1256
00:43:58,899 --> 00:43:59,968
Considering that,

1257
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:02,368
- your punch wasn't that strong. - Exactly.

1258
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:04,709
I always work out on Mondays, so on Tuesdays,

1259
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,278
- my whole body aches. - You ache?

1260
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:09,108
When I'm totally beat, I think to myself,

1261
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:10,178
"I worked out hard."

1262
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:11,878
- You have a pimple... - Exactly.

1263
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,478
- on your face because you're tired. - Yes.

1264
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:14,878
- I saw it too. - This...

1265
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:15,948
- I saw it too. - A pimple.

1266
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:17,648
I'm grateful for it. It's proof that I worked out until I hit my limits.

1267
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:18,748
- That's why I have it. - What limits?

1268
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:19,818
- It's just a pimple. - Just one.

1269
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,458
Didn't your immune system weaken too much?

1270
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,659
Immune system...

1271
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:24,529
Look at this.

1272
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:25,859
He has very firm arms.

1273
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:27,459
It's no joke, right?

1274
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,199
He has very firm arms.

1275
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:31,068
Really? I was born this way.

1276
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:32,368
- I don't need to work out for this. - I see.

1277
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,369
Your hands too.

1278
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,639
- The way they're structured. - My hands too.

1279
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,198
Dong Yeob also has...

1280
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,208
- So... - very nice hands.

1281
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:39,169
Jong Kook can't treat me roughly when we play the name tag game.

1282
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:40,608
That's not true.

1283
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:41,709
He just...

1284
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,939
removes it with ease.

1285
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:45,149
(Laughing)

1286
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:46,448
- You're born muscular. - That's how...

1287
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:47,518
I was born.

1288
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,019
Some people are just built that way.

1289
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,588
- I think we're going to Songdo. - I think so too.

1290
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,618
- Really? - Songdo?

1291
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,218
Yes, this is Songdo.

1292
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:56,088
Look at the sky.

1293
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,358
It's so cool.

1294
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,658
- It's the autumn sky. - It's so pretty.

1295
00:44:58,659 --> 00:44:59,788
How is it so pretty?

1296
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:01,028
It's a nice, clear sky.

1297
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:02,929
- The season of clear sky. - The season of clear sky.

1298
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,669
(Songdo, an international city)

1299
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:09,639
(Placed in the midst of the grand building forest)

1300
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:14,209
(Songdo's landmark, Central Park)

1301
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,108
- We're finally here. - We've arrived.

1302
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:18,109
- Is this the place? - We're in Songdo.

1303
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:19,648
It's finally fall.

1304
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:20,818
It's the California weather.

1305
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,748
- The weather is so nice. - California.

1306
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:24,419
We should do this, Seok Jin.

1307
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:26,319
- This. - Let's go.

1308
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,189
This.

1309
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:29,688
(From Episode 3)

1310
00:45:29,689 --> 00:45:31,329
(There's a movement which only young people can do?)

1311
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:34,099
(The symbol of youth, two steps)

1312
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,229
(Very confident)

1313
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:40,469
(Something looks off.)

1314
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:42,099
- That's not it, Seok Jin. - You can't do it.

1315
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,198
- This is it. - No.

1316
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,509
(In the end, he failed to do the MZ step.)

1317
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,738
This.

1318
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:48,908
- You can't do it. - Seok Jin...

1319
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,048
- can't do it. - Seok Jin.

1320
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:51,478
- Seok Jin can't do it. - Like this.

1321
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:52,508
- I can do it. - No, you can't.

1322
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:53,819
- No. - You can't do it.

1323
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,248
Jae Seok, you can't do it either.

1324
00:45:56,249 --> 00:45:57,348
Isn't this it?

1325
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:58,788
That's not it.

1326
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,318
- How do you do it? - Two steps.

1327
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,659
This is how you do it.

1328
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:03,929
- That's it. - Right?

1329
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,328
That's it.

1330
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,598
- Dong Hyun, two steps. - This is it.

1331
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,628
- You can't do it, can you? - That's right.

1332
00:46:07,629 --> 00:46:09,228
- I can do it. - Am I not doing it right?

1333
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:10,299
You're wrong.

1334
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,939
Hello.

1335
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,199
(Hello.)

1336
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:18,769
Yes, I'm who you think I am.

1337
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,178
- Here it is. - Here it is.

1338
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:22,208
- It's here. - Why did you go there?

1339
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:23,808
- It's here. - This way.

1340
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,008
- Where? - Here.

1341
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:26,679
Braised monkfish.

1342
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,619
It really is braised monkfish.

1343
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:30,819
(Looking similar)

1344
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,919
(Placed next to Central Park, Songdo's landmark)

1345
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:37,128
The entrance of both restaurants look fake.

1346
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:38,829
It's a monkfish restaurant.

1347
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:42,199
"Braised monkfish is my restaurant's pride."

1348
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:45,229
Why do they all feel fake at first?

1349
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:46,499
I opened the door.

1350
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:47,538
My gosh.

1351
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:48,598
"Water splash?"

1352
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:49,739
It feels strange.

1353
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:54,279
(When you look inside the restaurant, )

1354
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:58,449
(it's filled with traces of a monkfish restaurant.)

1355
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,819
(What does this have to do with Monkfish That Loves Idols?)

1356
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:04,748
Hello.

1357
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:05,888
"Splash monkfish?"

1358
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,059
It's Sang Yeol.

1359
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,858
Sang Yeol was here.

1360
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:11,159
He must've visited.

1361
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,799
(Hung up on one side of the wall)

1362
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,198
(It's me, Sang Yeol.)

1363
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,528
If that's the case...

1364
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:19,898
Should I call him and ask?

1365
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:21,438
- It's a bit... - I think...

1366
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,368
I find stuff like this suspicious.

1367
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:25,438
- Right? It looks so fake. - This looks fake.

1368
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,038
- Sang Yeol... - Everyone knows he's from Incheon.

1369
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:30,178
- He isn't the only one. - This must be fake.

1370
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:31,179
- Who else is here? - There are more?

1371
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,478
There are so many. There's Rose too.

1372
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:34,149
- Byung Jae? - Byung Jae is here too?

1373
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:35,719
Rose?

1374
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:39,349
(The singer of APT. which took over the Billboard chart)

1375
00:47:39,749 --> 00:47:43,059
(Rose came to this shop?)

1376
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,159
Hold on. Lee Eong Ja?

1377
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,059
Woo Byung Jae?

1378
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:49,158
- Yoo Byung Jae... - It isn't "Yoo Byung Jae."

1379
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,328
- It's written "Woo Byung Jae." - It's supposed to be "Yoo."

1380
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:51,898
- That's strange. - They're all a bit off.

1381
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,298
Is it a lookalike?

1382
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:55,199
- Woo Jae Seok? - Woo Jae Seok?

1383
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,438
- You're here too. - It's your signature.

1384
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:58,439
- They copied my signature. - It looks similar.

1385
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:01,439
(At a glance, they look the same.)

1386
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:04,179
(But they're fake autographs, Lee Eong Ja and Woo Byung Jae.)

1387
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,049
This is Monkfish That Loves Idols.

1388
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,349
- Shall we sit? - But...

1389
00:48:09,649 --> 00:48:11,089
This braised monkfish...

1390
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:12,218
- What? - Braised monkfish.

1391
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:13,958
If you cover both sides, it looks like Gucci.

1392
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:15,189
How should I say this?

1393
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:16,488
It's fake.

1394
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:18,489
- Knockoffs? - They're fake.

1395
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,859
They look like they were printed recently.

1396
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,869
Monkfish That Loves Idols.

1397
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:26,768
- That's the name. - Maybe...

1398
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:29,299
those autographs are fake,

1399
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,638
and the owner hung them up with the names slightly altered...

1400
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:34,439
- hoping idols will visit the shop. - Is that it?

1401
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,439
This looks real.

1402
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:37,748
That looks real.

1403
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,209
In April, 2025.

1404
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,079
It's April, but he's wearing short sleeves.

1405
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:43,518
This place is fake.

1406
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,988
- This is fake. - Something seems off.

1407
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,548
- You're right. - This place is fake.

1408
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:47,889
It's April, and yet...

1409
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:50,389
- It's fake. - It's strange here, isn't it?

1410
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,829
Something's fishy.

1411
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:54,259
- The meat and collagen... - Here he comes.

1412
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,628
- Hello, sir. - Are you the owner?

1413
00:48:55,629 --> 00:48:57,398
- Hello. - Hello.

1414
00:48:57,399 --> 00:48:59,299
- Let me set the table. - It's not him, right?

1415
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,898
It's not the man in the picture.

1416
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:02,698
- Is this you? - Yes, it's me.

1417
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:03,738
- You're the man in the picture? - Yes.

1418
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:05,438
- He took off his glasses. - Did you take off your glasses?

1419
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:06,879
Yes, I'm wearing contacts today.

1420
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:09,908
- Why did Sang Yeol come here? - Exactly.

1421
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:11,348
Ji Sang Yeol...

1422
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,748
- came last time... - Yes.

1423
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,448
- and had a meal. - Really?

1424
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,179
- Did he visit once? - Yes.

1425
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:19,588
Then did Rose come too?

1426
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,419
Well, that's...

1427
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,789
(Did Rose visit the restaurant?)

1428
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:26,458
- I hoped she'd come one day. - Right?

1429
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:27,998
- So I copied her signature. - That's it, right?

1430
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:29,229
- You wrote your wish. - You guessed it right.

1431
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:31,128
(When you look at the autograph closely...)

1432
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:32,368
(Please come.)

1433
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,498
(His wish)

1434
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:35,738
- But... - It was your wish.

1435
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,838
My signature...

1436
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,268
looks similar, but it isn't me.

1437
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:39,538
You wrote "Woo Jae Seok."

1438
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:40,838
Yes. I also wrote that...

1439
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:42,539
hoping you'd come.

1440
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:43,678
And he's here.

1441
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,648
- He came. - Your wish came true.

1442
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,118
I know Jae Seok's handwriting.

1443
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,178
It looks very similar.

1444
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,518
- Woo Byung Jae and Lee Eong Ja too? - Lee Eong Ja.

1445
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,948
- Yes, I wish they'd visit. - You wish they'd visit.

1446
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:53,188
That's interesting.

1447
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:56,559
Why is this place Monkfish That Loves Idols?

1448
00:49:56,789 --> 00:49:58,988
One of the signature menus...

1449
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:01,059
is rose braised monkfish.

1450
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,658
That's why...

1451
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:04,169
(Rose braised monkfish?)

1452
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,628
(The whole world goes wild...)

1453
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,069
(for Rose.)

1454
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,969
(And the owner is in love with Rose.)

1455
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:12,839
(Monkfish...)

1456
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:17,649
(dipped in rose)

1457
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,408
(Rose and monkfish, a rare combination)

1458
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:21,379
(Is this an actual menu?)

1459
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,519
(Rose braised monkfish...)

1460
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:27,488
- It would taste quite plain. - Or...

1461
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:29,588
- too greasy or fishy. - Too greasy.

1462
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:31,358
- It's supposed to be very spicy. - Fishy...

1463
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,898
Monkfish is quite oily.

1464
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:35,058
Monkfish itself.

1465
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:37,028
Monkfish is quite light.

1466
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:38,429
It has almost no fat.

1467
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,898
You know nothing.

1468
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:41,269
Why don't you know anything?

1469
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,668
How did you come up with rose braised monkfish?

1470
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:44,768
Initially,

1471
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:47,539
we were doing quite well as an ordinary braised monkfish shop.

1472
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:49,838
I became ambitious...

1473
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,378
and thought about what young people would like.

1474
00:50:54,379 --> 00:50:57,519
I found that rose sauce is most compatible with monkfish.

1475
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:00,288
(He found the perfect MZ combination.)

1476
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:01,618
We will try...

1477
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,218
rose braised monkfish.

1478
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:05,229
Is there any other dish you recommend?

1479
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:10,098
It's hard to find this in other restaurants.

1480
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,398
We deep-fry monkfish like fried chicken.

1481
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:13,798
- We have fried monkfish. - I saw it on the menu.

1482
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:14,998
- Fried monkfish? - Yes.

1483
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:16,198
I want to try that.

1484
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,808
I want to try fried monkfish.

1485
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:18,868
- It sounds delicious. - It sounds delicious.

1486
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,378
- Like deep-fried fish. - Let's try it.

1487
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:22,309
(How will monkfish deep-fried like fried chicken taste?)

1488
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:23,778
I got hooked on pork cutlet recently.

1489
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,078
- What do I do? - Why?

1490
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,648
It tastes amazing when they cook it well.

1491
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,248
You don't eat it right after it's deep-fried...

1492
00:51:28,249 --> 00:51:30,388
That's a no-brainer.

1493
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:31,849
It tastes amazing when they cook it well.

1494
00:51:32,449 --> 00:51:33,518
(I'm at a loss for words.)

1495
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,358
His face is so annoying.

1496
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,288
- Of course it tastes amazing. - You're so annoying.

1497
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:38,488
- That's a given. - Of course.

1498
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:39,828
Just keep it in your head.

1499
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:40,998
Why must you say it out loud?

1500
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:42,798
- Of course it tastes amazing. - You know,

1501
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,069
the shops that serve when it's freshly fried aren't good.

1502
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:46,868
- It... - I like it cooked well-done.

1503
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:47,898
- Do you like it less cooked? - Me too.

1504
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:49,168
- You guys are nothing alike. - We are nothing alike.

1505
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:51,268
- You have terrible taste buds. - Seok Jin and I are nothing alike.

1506
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:53,509
You don't know what's good food.

1507
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:55,108
- Really? - Komimi.

1508
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:56,238
I know a really good restaurant.

1509
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,378
- Really? - Yes.

1510
00:51:57,379 --> 00:51:58,749
Where is "Komimi?"

1511
00:51:58,779 --> 00:51:59,809
What?

1512
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:02,078
You'll go to Komimi? Is that in Japan?

1513
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,319
- "Come with me." - "Come with me."

1514
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:05,119
(Clapping and laughing)

1515
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:07,118
- You heard it as "Komimi." - This is...

1516
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,718
- Komimi. - Your ears.

1517
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:10,688
- I thought... - Open your ears wide.

1518
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:11,858
I was a bit sleepy.

1519
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:12,988
- "Let's go to Komimi?" - But...

1520
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,958
I was wondering where that was.

1521
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:15,959
Let's end up in despair.

1522
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,568
- Let's end up in despair. - Let's end up in despair.

1523
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:18,729
Despair is what we want.

1524
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:20,498
- I'm quite curious though. - Right.

1525
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:23,198
The reason I have braised monkfish...

1526
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,469
is to enjoy its spiciness...

1527
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,539
- with rice and bean sprouts. - A refreshing taste.

1528
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,009
(The usual refreshing and spicy braised monkfish...)

1529
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:37,248
(is perfect with rice.)

1530
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:38,988
With rose sauce...

1531
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:39,989
- Gosh! - Are those fritters?

1532
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,358
- Excuse me. - It's rose sauce!

1533
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,858
- Here's the rose braised monkfish. - Gosh.

1534
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:43,859
Wait for just a minute without eating.

1535
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,928
Okay.

1536
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,688
- It looks delicious. - It looks like dakgalbi.

1537
00:52:46,689 --> 00:52:48,098
- Right. - It looks really good.

1538
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:49,099
Right.

1539
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,669
It doesn't feel like braised monkfish like this at all.

1540
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,769
(Rose braised monkfish)

1541
00:52:56,969 --> 00:53:00,109
It's cooked with just the trunk and tail of the monkfish.

1542
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:04,709
The meat and intestines that are prepared are boiled first.

1543
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:07,178
When the bean sprouts are added in,

1544
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:08,379
(The key ingredient of braised monkfish, bean sprouts)

1545
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:10,949
sausages, Chinese glass noodles,

1546
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:13,789
and wheat rice cakes are added in as well.

1547
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:17,858
Our special cream sauce, seasoning,

1548
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:19,588
and additional spices are added in.

1549
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:20,759
(The owner's special rose sauce)

1550
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:22,859
It's then stir-fried together.

1551
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,339
(Mixing well so that the rose sauce covers all of the ingredients)

1552
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:31,309
(A generous amount of cheese powder is sprinkled.)

1553
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:35,339
(Crispy fried dumplings are stuck in to complete the dish.)

1554
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,308
- It looks delicious. - It looks like dakgalbi.

1555
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:39,078
- Right. - It looks really good.

1556
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:40,108
- Exactly. - It looks great.

1557
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:42,079
- Dakgalbi or jjimdak. - It looks really good.

1558
00:53:42,249 --> 00:53:44,989
It doesn't feel like braised monkfish like this at all.

1559
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,448
It smells good too.

1560
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:47,858
- It looks really good. - Right.

1561
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:49,358
There are rice cakes too.

1562
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,588
- Excuse me. - There are glass noodles too.

1563
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:51,929
- What is this? - What is this?

1564
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:53,358
- What is that? - Ice cream?

1565
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,829
- What? - This is a bit...

1566
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,999
(Eyes opening wide)

1567
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:03,099
(What is the mysterious bucket the owner is holding?)

1568
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:06,269
(Solid cream)

1569
00:54:06,769 --> 00:54:08,778
There's a reason the cream sauce is added in twice.

1570
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,178
I thought there was a need of a performance...

1571
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:12,549
in front of the customers.

1572
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:16,449
(Braised monkfish with solid cream on top)

1573
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:20,589
(It's already a famous hot place on social media.)

1574
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,058
(It got a wild response on social media.)

1575
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,659
Our highest monthly sales was 63,000 dollars.

1576
00:54:27,259 --> 00:54:29,428
(Rose braised monkfish)

1577
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:32,198
Sixth Sense, is this menu real?

1578
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:34,768
(Sixth Sense, is this menu real?)

1579
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:37,108
It already has cream sauce in it.

1580
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:38,839
This is the sauce that has been solidified.

1581
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,138
This doesn't feel right.

1582
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:42,309
Hold on!

1583
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,978
Hold on!

1584
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:45,848
- This doesn't feel right, sir. - Hold on!

1585
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,848
We have our own preferences as well.

1586
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,118
- What was this again? - Fresh cream?

1587
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,518
- Cream. - It's the cream sauce...

1588
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:51,948
- that has been solidified. - Cream sauce is added here?

1589
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:54,658
This should be squished with the braised monkfish...

1590
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,088
and it will taste much better when mixed together.

1591
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:57,588
- This doesn't feel right. - Enjoy your meal.

1592
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:58,659
Thank you.

1593
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,328
- I get his intention, but... - But...

1594
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:01,329
Gosh.

1595
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,098
It does look unique.

1596
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,798
I got curious all of a sudden. How would it taste?

1597
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,568
- But... - It looks a bit...

1598
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:08,869
- Gosh. - Was that necessary?

1599
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,269
Isn't rose sauce a bit more beige than this?

1600
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,179
(It isn't the usual color of rose sauce?)

1601
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:17,248
I'll mix it as these chopsticks haven't been used.

1602
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:18,249
Okay.

1603
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,678
The cream is mixed together with it as well?

1604
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:21,019
We were told to do that.

1605
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:22,319
(Worried)

1606
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:24,419
- Gosh! - Must it be mixed?

1607
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:27,718
(Mix it up.)

1608
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,018
It should be mixed just for those who want it that way.

1609
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:30,218
Seok Jin,

1610
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:31,688
- this is the taste of Gen MZers. - Gosh.

1611
00:55:31,689 --> 00:55:32,788
- Gen MZers. - Is that so?

1612
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:33,829
- It feels like... - The taste of Gen MZers.

1613
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:36,428
This was brought from the cafe we went to earlier.

1614
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:37,898
The fresh cream was added on top all of a sudden.

1615
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,169
Gosh, it's changing color!

1616
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:40,498
You're right.

1617
00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:42,069
It's the color of rose sauce now.

1618
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,138
- Is this okay? - It's the color of rose sauce now.

1619
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:45,439
It's the color of rose sauce!

1620
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:49,939
(As the solid cream was mixed well with the braised monkfish, )

1621
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:55,779
(its true colors start to show.)

1622
00:55:57,849 --> 00:55:59,218
It looks tasty all of a sudden.

1623
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:00,348
- What? - Is this how it's made?

1624
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:01,559
It looks tasty all of a sudden.

1625
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:04,488
- I can smell the rose sauce now. - Right.

1626
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,189
So this is how rose sauce is made.

1627
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,958
- With the cream sauce on top. - But...

1628
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:09,759
I feel quite hesitant to try this.

1629
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:12,128
- I feel the same way. - It wasn't cooked together.

1630
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:13,199
Should I give it a try?

1631
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:17,608
(He tries a bite while feeling worried.)

1632
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:18,909
- This is... - Okay.

1633
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,109
- It's good. - Really?

1634
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:23,039
It's good?

1635
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:24,679
It's good.

1636
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,978
(Mimi tries a bite of the Chinese glass noodles.)

1637
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:29,418
(Startled)

1638
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,518
(Surprised)

1639
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:32,888
- It's good. - It tastes like rose tteokbokki.

1640
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,018
- It brought up my appetite. - Right.

1641
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,118
It brought up my appetite all of a sudden...

1642
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,518
and my stomach opened up.

1643
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,028
Everyone might think it's a lie,

1644
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:39,359
- but it's really good. - It's good.

1645
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,859
- It's really good! - It's quite spicy.

1646
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,629
- It's better than the regular ones. - Right. It's good.

1647
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:44,799
I prefer this one a lot more.

1648
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,099
It brings up my appetite right away.

1649
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,568
- It doesn't feel greasy. - It doesn't feel greasy.

1650
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:48,938
- It doesn't feel greasy. - As the monkfish...

1651
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,908
has quite firm meat,

1652
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:53,468
- Right. - the texture is preserved well...

1653
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:54,478
and it tastes great.

1654
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,879
(The chewy texture goes well with the rose sauce.)

1655
00:56:57,979 --> 00:56:59,648
It tastes great with the bean sprouts.

1656
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,778
How does this taste good?

1657
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:01,779
(Shouting)

1658
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,548
- It's really good. - It's amazing.

1659
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,088
The intestines taste amazing! Give them a try!

1660
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,189
- The intestines. - It tastes a bit like...

1661
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:07,918
It melts in the mouth. Gosh.

1662
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:09,059
(She tries a bite after hearing from Jae Seok.)

1663
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,359
This is the real deal.

1664
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,158
(Have you tried the intestines with rose sauce?)

1665
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:18,369
(The intestines are the best here.)

1666
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,099
(Intestines)

1667
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:23,699
(He devours the intestines.)

1668
00:57:24,939 --> 00:57:26,138
- Right. - Right.

1669
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:27,739
(Rummaging)

1670
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:28,909
What are you looking for?
Did someone eat all of the intestines?

1671
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:31,979
- The intestines. - Gosh.

1672
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,748
- I haven't touched any of them. - There are some right here!

1673
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:35,249
(Feeling guilty)

1674
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:37,648
There's something like pork rind. What's this?

1675
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:39,619
- It's the glass noodles. - The glass noodles?

1676
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:41,258
It's good.

1677
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:42,259
(Embarrassed)

1678
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,789
I was wondering why it had pork rind.

1679
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:45,228
Oh, come on!

1680
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:46,229
- I'm serious. - What?

1681
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,598
- Gosh. - You have no right...

1682
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,158
to eat the food of Gen MZers..

1683
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:50,428
Isn't this pork rind?

1684
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:52,268
It's surely the glass noodles.

1685
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,468
Glass noodles look like this?

1686
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:55,869
- How are they pork rinds? - Chinese glass noodles.

1687
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,668
(Coughing)

1688
00:57:57,669 --> 00:57:59,209
(What's wrong with him now?)

1689
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:00,678
- It's spicy. - It's quite spicy.

1690
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,538
- It's spicy. - It's too spicy for me.

1691
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:03,939
I thought he was a laggy computer.

1692
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:05,609
Gosh, this is spicy.

1693
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:07,379
It's too spicy for me.

1694
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:09,248
- It is too spicy. - It's spicy.

1695
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:11,088
I think it tastes better because it's spicy.

1696
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:12,719
(We will not let go of its spicy taste.)

1697
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,958
Based on my intuition, this place is totally fake.

1698
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,118
- It's fake? - Why?

1699
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,459
If this was real,

1700
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,928
this would have been made by other places...

1701
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:23,599
while the rose sauce was very popular.

1702
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:26,829
(Unique rose dishes shook up Korea.)

1703
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:28,468
(Chuu's point of suspicion)

1704
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:30,769
(This would've already been famous if it was a real dish!)

1705
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,939
To be honest, I think I've seen this before.

1706
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:36,238
- This dish? - Yes.

1707
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:37,708
I think I've seen it,

1708
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:39,909
but I'm afraid that nightmare might happen again.

1709
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:42,119
Your social media has been polluted, so it can't be trusted.

1710
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:43,878
(What is the truth about the rose braised monkfish?)

1711
00:58:43,879 --> 00:58:45,089
This is hard.

1712
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:46,818
- Excuse me. - Gosh!

1713
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:49,158
- It's the fried monkfish! - Fried monkfish!

1714
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,859
- It's fried monkfish. - This is perfect.

1715
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:53,028
- Look at the sauce. - There are two different sauces.

1716
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,359
You can enjoy the fritters a lot more with these sauces.

1717
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,669
(The hidden card of this restaurant)

1718
00:58:58,169 --> 00:59:00,399
The salted monkfish meat gets seasoned.

1719
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,038
The frying mix then gets applied.

1720
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,309
(Applying the frying mix to the monkfish meat)

1721
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,479
Chicken powder is then applied all over it.

1722
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:12,809
Next, it's fried for 3 minutes at 165°C.

1723
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:22,889
(Fried monkfish)

1724
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,258
Let's try the fried monkfish.

1725
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:27,459
(Trying the freshly fried monkfish)

1726
00:59:27,629 --> 00:59:28,659
Gosh.

1727
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:31,169
(Amazed)

1728
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:33,298
- Is it good? - The fried monkfish is amazing.

1729
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:34,439
Try this!

1730
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:35,969
- It's so good. - Gosh!

1731
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:37,739
Why didn't you eat it with the sauce?

1732
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:39,409
(A taste that makes you laugh automatically)

1733
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:40,909
Give it a try.

1734
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:43,509
Hey!

1735
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:46,148
It's so good! This is a cheat code!

1736
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,308
- It's so good! - Hey!

1737
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:48,448
Really?

1738
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:50,549
- Hey! This is good enough... - Gosh!

1739
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,288
- to be sold on its own! - It's amazing, isn't it?

1740
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:53,289
Really?
It's so good!

1741
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,518
Is it better than fried chicken?

1742
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,688
It's better than fried chicken.

1743
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:58,088
- Gosh, look at this! - Gosh.

1744
00:59:58,089 --> 00:59:59,129
What?

1745
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:01,729
(When you open up the crunchy outside, )

1746
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:07,669
(it's full of chewy monkfish meat.)

1747
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:09,898
Hurry up and give it a try!

1748
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:11,069
- It's amazing. - Gosh!

1749
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:12,538
(She quickly takes a bite before Seok Sam goes wild.)

1750
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:14,238
- This is insane. - This is insane.

1751
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,379
- It's really... - It's fried fish.

1752
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:17,678
It's much better than regular fried fish.

1753
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,248
This is great for athletes, isn't it?

1754
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,049
- It's the best. - Right?

1755
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:22,518
It's so good.

1756
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,649
(Clapping)

1757
01:00:24,349 --> 01:00:25,388
It's great.

1758
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:26,548
Why is it so soft?

1759
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:28,118
This definitely must be something that was already existing.

1760
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:30,418
It feels like a sensational taste that was made...

1761
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,889
- with a lot of effort. - Right.

1762
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:34,928
Out of all of the fried fish dishes I've tried,

1763
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:36,298
- the fried monkfish is the best. - Gosh.

1764
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,169
It's the same for me. It's absolutely delicious.

1765
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:39,699
This is a big hit.

1766
01:00:41,299 --> 01:00:43,568
(A taste that is hard to be suspicious of)

1767
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:45,869
(Is this place real?)

1768
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,678
The one who came up with this should be awarded.

1769
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:48,978
- Right. It's so good. - This is amazing.

1770
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,848
- How is this so good? - Excuse me.

1771
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:52,178
You all seemed to be struggling with the spiciness,

1772
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:54,419
- so I'll give you some freebies. - Will he stir-fry rice for us?

1773
01:00:54,649 --> 01:00:56,449
- Enjoy. - No way.

1774
01:00:56,649 --> 01:00:57,989
What is it? It was cold.

1775
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,819
I'll open it. What?

1776
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,059
- What is that? - What is that?

1777
01:01:01,459 --> 01:01:02,659
It's dirt.

1778
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:04,928
- What? - "It's dirt."

1779
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,929
- Wasn't it cold? - "It's dirt."

1780
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:08,529
- It smells like chocolate. - Hold on.

1781
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:10,058
- It's a tiramisu cake. - Right.

1782
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:12,199
- It's served in a rice bowl? - "It's dirt." Are you serious?

1783
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,929
"It's dirt."

1784
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,569
(When the lid of the rice bowl gets opened, )

1785
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:20,538
(something has grown out from the dirt.)

1786
01:01:20,539 --> 01:01:22,508
(Water parsley)

1787
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:24,079
So it was a tiramisu cake.

1788
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:26,179
The tiramisu cake is served in this?

1789
01:01:26,279 --> 01:01:27,578
Tiramisu cake in a rice bowl?

1790
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:29,478
It's perfect though, isn't it?

1791
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:31,788
Tiramisu cake after having a spicy dish.

1792
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,248
Right. It's perfect.

1793
01:01:33,249 --> 01:01:34,418
But why a rice bowl?

1794
01:01:34,419 --> 01:01:35,588
- This is unusual. - But...

1795
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:36,589
Right.

1796
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,158
This is something that chefs would do.

1797
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:39,958
Right. This is what they would do.

1798
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:41,298
Things of the past...

1799
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:43,498
mixed up with modern things.

1800
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:44,828
It's a unique idea.

1801
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:46,828
- Right. A chef's idea. - Listen to this.

1802
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,668
When a chef gets asked to do something,

1803
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:50,938
they won't make it seem normal.

1804
01:01:50,939 --> 01:01:51,939
Right.

1805
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,969
I didn't consider different things,

1806
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:56,139
but these days,

1807
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:57,948
I can tell what's made by a professional.

1808
01:01:57,949 --> 01:01:58,949
You think so?

1809
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,979
The way things are paired together?

1810
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:03,918
- No. - It's an amazing composition.

1811
01:02:03,919 --> 01:02:05,188
- Like a perfect course meal. - Jae Seok.

1812
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:06,549
May I say something?

1813
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:07,958
The way it tastes,

1814
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:09,018
(Reading the room)

1815
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:10,259
it's made by an amateur.

1816
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:13,629
It wasn't made by a professional. I'm very sorry to say this,

1817
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:15,999
but this isn't something from a specialized tiramisu place.

1818
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:17,669
Try the tiramisu.

1819
01:02:18,399 --> 01:02:20,568
- It isn't that good. - It's like it was just made.

1820
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:21,938
- This was a bit off. - Gosh!

1821
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,069
It doesn't suit his taste.

1822
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:26,038
Really?

1823
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:27,909
(Laughing)

1824
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:32,209
These kind of meal is what a chef would put together.

1825
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:34,078
Right.

1826
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,418
(Is this a fake meal put together by a chef?)

1827
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,618
But the food was amazing.

1828
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:38,788
- It was amazing. - Right.

1829
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,488
- The perfect triangle. - Did these go well together?

1830
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:41,758
The fried dumplings were stuck into the dish.

1831
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,818
Why would they not go well together?

1832
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:44,688
- Weren't they a bad match? - Gosh.

1833
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:45,758
Why would they not go well together?

1834
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,759
They didn't get well together.

1835
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,028
- You didn't even try it. - What have they done wrong?

1836
01:02:48,029 --> 01:02:49,228
- What's wrong? - No one ate them.

1837
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:50,428
We haven't eaten them because we were full.

1838
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:51,668
We would've eaten them if we weren't that full.

1839
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:52,869
I don't think I would've eaten it.

1840
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,129
- But... - In my opinion...

1841
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:55,369
Well, that's what I think.

1842
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,369
It's not what you think. It's what I think.

1843
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:00,109
How can you and I think the same?

1844
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,038
It sounded like you were rapping.

1845
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:03,039
We can't think the same.

1846
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,508
- That is what feels suspicious. - Right.

1847
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:06,108
I don't think he will ever lose in an argument.

1848
01:03:06,109 --> 01:03:09,278
Just as we heard from him, we all have to be like Seok Jin.

1849
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:10,618
- "This is what I think." - "This is what I think."

1850
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:12,819
- Right. - Right. This is what I think.

1851
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,388
Let's head out first. This is really hard.

1852
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:16,389
(Monkfish That Loves Idols: Suspicious fake autographs, )

1853
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,419
(unique rose braised monkfish, professional chef's meal)

1854
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,258
That was really good.

1855
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:21,159
The sign looks so new.

1856
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,369
- The sign looks off. - It feels so new.

1857
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:27,498
Look at the colors. It's blue and yellow.

1858
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:29,798
It does look very neat. There isn't a single fleck of dust.

1859
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:30,799
(A unique color arrangement and overly clean sign?)

1860
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:32,509
Can that be real?

1861
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:35,079
- It feels off, doesn't it? - The sign looks totally off.

1862
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,539
It feels way too new.

1863
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:39,979
(What is the truth of the sign?)

1864
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,879
- It's the third and last place now. - Next is mulhoe!

1865
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,519
The next place is close.

1866
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:47,758
"Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms."

1867
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:48,919
Is that so? Is it close?

1868
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,588
Yes!

1869
01:03:50,589 --> 01:03:54,259
(Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms)

1870
01:03:54,399 --> 01:03:55,999
Gosh, every place seems fake.

1871
01:03:56,529 --> 01:03:57,598
This is how it is here.

1872
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:58,968
Every place feels real at one moment,

1873
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,398
and every place feels fake at another moment.

1874
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:01,499
It's really hard.

1875
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:03,368
Let me say this.

1876
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:04,509
(It's time for Yulock Holmes to step up!)

1877
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:06,938
When professional chefs...

1878
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:09,279
- come to help out, - Yes?

1879
01:04:09,339 --> 01:04:11,508
They often make things with the rose sauce.

1880
01:04:11,509 --> 01:04:12,678
Right.

1881
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:13,749
Things that are in trend.

1882
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,079
Especially to the Gen MZers.

1883
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:18,088
The fried monkfish was the definition of...

1884
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:19,918
crunchy on the outside and moist in the inside.

1885
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:21,218
- It surely was. - Right.

1886
01:04:21,219 --> 01:04:23,519
But it wasn't just a regular fritter.

1887
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:27,998
It was a fritter made by someone who is in Japanese cuisine.

1888
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:29,099
- Right. - Right.

1889
01:04:29,129 --> 01:04:31,699
- Right. It was of that quality. - Right.

1890
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:34,499
Wasn't Chef Jung Ho Young here?

1891
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:36,098
- He even named the chef. - Gosh.

1892
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:37,638
It would be amazing if you got that right.

1893
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,708
It was the taste of the few pieces served in Japanese cuisine.

1894
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,808
- Right. - Right.

1895
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:42,379
(Will Yulock Holmes be right with his deduction?)

1896
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,109
- Let's go! - Thank you.

1897
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,079
Let's go!

1898
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,349
Thank you!

1899
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:55,089
It feels like we're visiting every corner of Incheon.

1900
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,488
- The sky looks great as well. - Right.

1901
01:04:57,489 --> 01:05:00,428
- Incheon is great. - The weather is great today.

1902
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,599
(It's the perfect weather for a tour.)

1903
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:02,799
What is this place now?

1904
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,928
(What kind of place is the last place?)

1905
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:05,228
Sea Friend?

1906
01:05:05,229 --> 01:05:06,929
The last place was a mulhoe place.

1907
01:05:07,229 --> 01:05:08,469
It must be Sea Friend!

1908
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:12,009
(A seafood restaurant that seems to be the last place is found.)

1909
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,839
The last place is Full of Dumb Charms. No.

1910
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,908
- "Dumb Charms?" - Full of Dumb Charms. No.

1911
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:18,208
- Full of Innocent Charms. - "Dumb Charms?"

1912
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,248
(You weren't that far off.)

1913
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,249
"Dumb Charms."

1914
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:23,149
Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms.

1915
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:25,689
(In between many apartments, )

1916
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:27,688
(there's a regular-looking seafood restaurant.)

1917
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,159
This is an actual restaurant.

1918
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,058
Why is it full of innocent charms?

1919
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:33,589
(What kind of mulhoe do they sell here?)

1920
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:35,759
The sea pineapple is swimming!

1921
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:39,828
- I've never seen it swim before! - Me neither!

1922
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:40,898
It's not swimming.

1923
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,099
- It's just being swept away. - It's just being swept away.

1924
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:43,669
I see.

1925
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:46,139
I thought the sea pineapple was swimming.

1926
01:05:46,969 --> 01:05:48,378
This place is just a regular seafood restaurant.

1927
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:49,779
Gosh, there's nothing unusual here.

1928
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,248
This is an actual restaurant.

1929
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:53,148
This is an actual restaurant. This can't be put together.

1930
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,579
The sign itself...

1931
01:05:55,379 --> 01:05:57,248
Why is it full of innocent charms?

1932
01:05:57,249 --> 01:05:58,949
(What are the innocent charms about?)

1933
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:02,019
This place isn't that...

1934
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:05,188
This place is real.

1935
01:06:05,189 --> 01:06:06,788
Nothing feels special about this place.

1936
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:08,599
- It already smells real. - Right.

1937
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:12,969
This is an actual restaurant.

1938
01:06:13,229 --> 01:06:15,768
It already smells like a seafood restaurant.

1939
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:17,499
- This place is definitely real. - I'm 100 percent certain.

1940
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:18,739
This place must be real.

1941
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,968
(No matter how much they look around the place...)

1942
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:23,509
- It's a regular seafood restaurant. - Come on.

1943
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:24,909
It's a relief that we're certain about at least one place.

1944
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:28,479
- "Mulhoe Full of Innocent Charms?" - Why is it called that?

1945
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:31,419
Is the mulhoe served in dongchimi?

1946
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:36,558
The one time I had it was this.

1947
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,388
- Dongchimi mulhoe? - Yes!

1948
01:06:38,389 --> 01:06:40,128
- Really? - It was served in white soup.

1949
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,129
(Chuu recently had something similar?)

1950
01:06:41,629 --> 01:06:44,599
(She said she tried mulhoe just once.)

1951
01:06:45,229 --> 01:06:47,429
(And that was dongchimi mulhoe?)

1952
01:06:47,899 --> 01:06:48,998
(White mulhoe served with dongchimi soup!)

1953
01:06:48,999 --> 01:06:50,938
- White mulhoe with dongchimi soup. - That makes sense then.

1954
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:53,068
- It was really good though. - Really?

1955
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:54,779
I tried it in Mangwon.

1956
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:57,378
The broadcasting station producers said that...

1957
01:06:57,379 --> 01:06:59,978
it was a white mulhoe that just started getting attention.

1958
01:06:59,979 --> 01:07:01,518
It's over with the last place.

1959
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:03,518
- This place is real then. - I just threw it out...

1960
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,749
- and it turned out to be real. - Right.

1961
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:07,819
I think I've already tried it.

1962
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:11,258
Everything is hard to believe while being in Sixth Sense.

1963
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,358
They infiltrate even our daily lives.

1964
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,929
- Hold on! - Right.

1965
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:16,558
- It can't be! - Chuu...

1966
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:17,658
Who did you have it with again?

1967
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,898
- Well, - Producers?

1968
01:07:18,899 --> 01:07:22,339
They were from another... But they were from tvN as well!

1969
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:25,768
- Then it's surely possible. - tvN?

1970
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:27,239
- Yes. - They got onto her beforehand?

1971
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:30,538
- This is what drives me crazy. - Hold on.

1972
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:31,779
(The seed of suspicion is suddenly planted.)

1973
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:33,948
We were having a meeting for a show...

1974
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,848
and it was done at a seafood restaurant.

1975
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:38,618
- It's true then! - Right. It's part of their plan.

1976
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,748
How did it happen?

1977
01:07:39,749 --> 01:07:40,948
What's the name of the show?

1978
01:07:40,949 --> 01:07:42,088
Well...

1979
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:44,859
- I'm not sure if I can say this. - As nothing is certain yet?

1980
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:46,888
This show was in plan.

1981
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:48,058
(A new show was being planned.)

1982
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:50,528
- Then it's real then. - But as I couldn't find the time,

1983
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:52,598
we just decided to eat together while we were there.

1984
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:55,168
- That makes sense then. - I was just invited to a meal.

1985
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:56,199
I said I would love to.

1986
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,338
That show is perfect with mulhoe.

1987
01:07:58,339 --> 01:07:59,469
- Right. - Definitely.

1988
01:07:59,739 --> 01:08:02,979
The producers of that show might've known about this first.

1989
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,308
- They hinted Sixth Sense? - They hinted Sixth Sense...

1990
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:08,448
as this dish could feel like a fake dish.

1991
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:10,618
They could've given that idea to trick us.

1992
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:11,819
- Or... - The other way around.

1993
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:15,788
If she tries something real and talks about it here,

1994
01:08:15,789 --> 01:08:16,889
it would feel fake to us.

1995
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:18,758
- We would feel that way... - Right!

1996
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:19,988
Even though it's a real dish.

1997
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:21,228
It's a twist from the previous episode.

1998
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,999
- It's a twist of another twist. - Right!

1999
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:25,368
- They went for that! - Right.

2000
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:28,698
But they would go that far to make me try mulhoe?

2001
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,798
That would be quite difficult to do.

2002
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,339
It's hard to tell if they were producers.

2003
01:08:33,469 --> 01:08:35,878
But there's this.

2004
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,908
Chuu had it in Mangwon.

2005
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:40,008
- Right. That's what I'm saying. - But we're in Incheon.

2006
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:41,718
- They're very far away. - Right.

2007
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:42,919
- Hello. - Hello.

2008
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:44,748
- Hello. - Hello.

2009
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:46,888
- Sir... - He's a true owner.

2010
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,988
- He's surely an owner. - He's surely an owner.

2011
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:52,129
(He just looks like a real owner.)

2012
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,629
What made this place famous?

2013
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:57,659
Our place is known for its white mulhoe.

2014
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,128
Right. It's white mulhoe.

2015
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:00,129
(It's white as mentioned.)

2016
01:09:00,329 --> 01:09:01,369
White mulhoe...

2017
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:04,339
(What is it made of?)

2018
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:07,239
- is made with dongchinmi. - Right!

2019
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,908
- Right! - Right!

2020
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:11,409
I really enjoyed it until the end.

2021
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,908
As dongchimi is white,

2022
01:09:13,909 --> 01:09:15,478
it was named the white mulhoe.

2023
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:16,978
- That was how it got its name. - Right.

2024
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:19,148
How did you make this?

2025
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:21,858
Our place was known for its mulhoe.

2026
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:24,088
- Right. - Mulhoe was a popular dish here.

2027
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:26,328
As mulhoe isn't wanted that much in the winter,

2028
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:30,099
I thought about making mulhoe with dongchimi...

2029
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:31,469
and it got a great response.

2030
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,799
(The dongchimi with thin ice...)

2031
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,369
(was added to the mulhoe by this weirdo?)

2032
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:41,168
In the winter, when I was young,

2033
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:42,879
my parents scooped up dongchimi soup from the crock...

2034
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:46,649
to make me a bowl of noodles. With that in mind,

2035
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:48,749
I came up with the white mulhoe.

2036
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:52,218
I thought that the refreshing taste of the dongchimi...

2037
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:54,319
would go well with mulhoe.

2038
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:57,388
Before I sold white mulhoe,

2039
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:59,859
just a couple of bowls of mulhoe were sold in the winter.

2040
01:10:00,589 --> 01:10:02,529
Now, regardless of the season,

2041
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,629
many people come to have our mulhoe.

2042
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:06,968
As a result, our sales have doubled.

2043
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,939
(Their sales have doubled.)

2044
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:11,808
I think it'll taste good though.

2045
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:13,508
(White mulhoe, steadyseller in all seasons, will be revealed soon.)

2046
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:14,709
This is making it more confusing.

2047
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:18,549
(Is it the same place Chuu went to?)

2048
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:22,078
Is the white mulhoe sold only here or somewhere else?

2049
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:24,448
This place is called Sea Friend.

2050
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:26,849
The white mulhoe is only sold in Sea Friend.

2051
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,719
Is there one in Mangwon?

2052
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:33,889
That place is run by my friend.

2053
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:36,228
That must be where I went!

2054
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:37,828
That place had "Friend" in it as well.

2055
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:39,398
(What a coincidence this is.)

2056
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:40,729
Was it Sea Friend there as well?

2057
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:42,838
I think it was a similar name.

2058
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:43,999
"Something Friend."

2059
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:47,439
I worked with my friend...

2060
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:49,679
and I opened up my own place here.

2061
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:52,248
- How did you end up going there? - Exactly!

2062
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,479
- You just happened to go there? - Yes.

2063
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,749
Gosh, it's so hard today.

2064
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,389
- May we have some? - Sure.

2065
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:01,249
He seems like a real owner.

2066
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:03,188
He feels like someone who worked here forever.

2067
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:06,328
- Surely. - He worked for over 30 years.

2068
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:07,358
He's surely an owner.

2069
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,558
This restaurant feels real as well.

2070
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:12,828
What's confusing us so much is what Chuu brought up.

2071
01:11:12,829 --> 01:11:13,829
Right.

2072
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,869
(What's the truth about Chuu's story?)

2073
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,698
But if you think about it,

2074
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:20,708
all of the places we've been to...

2075
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,208
certainly feel fake.

2076
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:24,409
- Right. - As it's so clear,

2077
01:11:24,809 --> 01:11:25,809
it's driving me crazy.

2078
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,919
We went to a water parsley pork belly place,

2079
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:30,149
and had pollack roe pork belly.

2080
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,418
- I was sure that was fake. - Right.

2081
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:33,989
But when we went to the next place,

2082
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,359
there was rose sauce?

2083
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:37,318
- With braised monkfish. - That felt fake as well.

2084
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:39,589
It certainly felt fake and felt like it was made by a chef.

2085
01:11:40,289 --> 01:11:41,558
After coming here,

2086
01:11:41,559 --> 01:11:43,928
there was a suspicious situation...

2087
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,298
- we always went though. - Right.

2088
01:11:45,299 --> 01:11:46,368
It's driving me crazy.

2089
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:49,468
There's something we can do when we are confused like this.

2090
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:52,108
- What can we do? - When we're confused like this,

2091
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:54,038
we can try to track the pattern of the previous answers.

2092
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:56,409
What number was it for the first episode?

2093
01:11:56,509 --> 01:11:58,578
- It was number 1. - It was number 1.

2094
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:00,678
- What about the 2nd episode? - It was number 2.

2095
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:02,278
- It was number one. - Was it?

2096
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:03,548
Was it number 1 again for the 2nd episode?

2097
01:12:03,549 --> 01:12:06,189
- What about the 3rd episode? - It was also number 1.

2098
01:12:06,549 --> 01:12:08,289
Really? It was number 1 for all 3 episodes?

2099
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:10,388
- Really? - The fake places?

2100
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:12,189
They must be going all in for number one.

2101
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:14,389
I don't think it'll be number one.

2102
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:16,428
- Maybe it won't be number 1 today. - Number 1 again?

2103
01:12:16,429 --> 01:12:17,528
Should we exclude number one?

2104
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:18,529
Most people would go with number three.

2105
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:19,929
- Number three? Then it's here. - Yes.

2106
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:21,899
- It's so hard. - It's confusing.

2107
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:26,768
(At that moment, mulhoe enters.)

2108
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:28,039
It looks amazing.

2109
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:30,339
No way. It looks like bingsu.

2110
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:32,208
- What's this? - It really looks like bingsu.

2111
01:12:32,209 --> 01:12:33,248
Bingsu.

2112
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:34,948
- I can smell dongchimi. - Right?

2113
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:36,479
(This mulhoe looks like bingsu.)

2114
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:40,019
(It's full of crushed dongchimi ice.)

2115
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,259
(An exquisite beauty in white)

2116
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:45,859
(White mulhoe)

2117
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:48,999
I fill the mulhoe bowl with chopped vegetables...

2118
01:12:49,259 --> 01:12:52,898
and scoop out the white mulhoe broth...

2119
01:12:52,899 --> 01:12:54,528
that's kept as crushed ice.

2120
01:12:54,529 --> 01:12:56,199
(Dongchimi broth)

2121
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,138
Then I pour in the icy broth...

2122
01:12:58,139 --> 01:13:00,939
so that it covers the vegetables.

2123
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:05,279
I usually use halibut for raw fish.

2124
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:08,918
I also chop the aged kimchi I made.

2125
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:10,379
(Chop finely)

2126
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:13,388
Put halibut, aged kimchi,

2127
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,259
and flying fish roe on top of the icy broth.

2128
01:13:15,419 --> 01:13:18,359
(It's 15 dollars per serving. The white mulhoe is complete.)

2129
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:22,299
(It's famous as raw fish bingsu on social media.)

2130
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,869
(It's the rising mulhoe restaurant in Incheon.)

2131
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:28,938
Sixth Sense members, is this menu real?

2132
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:31,499
(Sixth Sense members, is this menu real?)

2133
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:33,838
(The refreshing smell makes him take a sniff.)

2134
01:13:33,839 --> 01:13:35,009
Gosh, this dish...

2135
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:37,579
- It contains aged kimchi. - Yes.

2136
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:39,778
It smells amazing.

2137
01:13:39,779 --> 01:13:42,719
(The kick of the white mulhoe, aged kimchi)

2138
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,118
Take this...

2139
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:47,148
- and pour it over the dish. - We should pour it.

2140
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:48,488
- Then it'll taste good. - Okay.

2141
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:50,558
- What's this? - It's a sauce...

2142
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,688
that's made with Cheongyang chili and oil.

2143
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:53,889
(Sauce that's made with Cheongyang chili and oil)

2144
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,829
I made it for the customers who wanted something spicy.

2145
01:13:58,929 --> 01:14:00,869
I blanch chives in boiling water...

2146
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:02,498
and rinse them in cold water.

2147
01:14:02,499 --> 01:14:03,699
(Blanch chives in boiling water and rinse them in cold water.)

2148
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:07,109
I blend chives, Cheongyang chili, and cooking oil...

2149
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,409
and sieve the mixture.

2150
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,548
Then I mix in sesame oil.

2151
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,749
(Add sesame oil.)

2152
01:14:15,019 --> 01:14:17,049
(A sauce that gives a piquant taste)

2153
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:19,849
(Cheongyang oil sauce)

2154
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:23,358
You don't eat it as it is.

2155
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,419
(They pour the sauce as the owner has instructed.)

2156
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:25,788
We get the broth as it melts.

2157
01:14:25,789 --> 01:14:26,958
It'll melt.

2158
01:14:26,959 --> 01:14:28,528
(They mix the ingredients well so that the icy broth will melt.)

2159
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:30,498
What's this on the top? Kimchi?

2160
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,699
It's aged kimchi.

2161
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:33,669
Let's see.

2162
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,038
(The eldest takes a bite first.)

2163
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:36,399
- Thank you. - My goodness.

2164
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,108
- It's tasty. - Is it tasty?

2165
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:40,809
- Really? - Really?

2166
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:42,778
(Mimi tries the broth first.)

2167
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:43,978
It's tasty.

2168
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,348
It's tasty, right?

2169
01:14:45,349 --> 01:14:46,709
It's the new world.

2170
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:48,648
This is incredible.

2171
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:52,049
(Upon seeing Seok Jin's enthusiasm, everyone tries the dish.)

2172
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:55,019
- Oh, my. - It's cool.

2173
01:14:55,059 --> 01:14:56,059
It's tasty.

2174
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,259
(He isn't doing a cow impression.)

2175
01:14:57,319 --> 01:14:59,189
- White kimchi is the kick. - Yes.

2176
01:14:59,559 --> 01:15:00,789
White kimchi.

2177
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:02,558
(Chopped aged kimchi is responsible for the first taste.)

2178
01:15:02,559 --> 01:15:04,099
It's sour at first.

2179
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:06,729
But as you chew the halibut,

2180
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:09,339
- the taste turns nutty. - It's nutty.

2181
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,538
It's very sour.

2182
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:13,668
(She takes another bite with a piece of raw fish.)

2183
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:14,909
It's tasty.

2184
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:16,878
Did someone pour sesame oil?

2185
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,508
- Exactly. - How is it so nutty?

2186
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:19,648
It's this sauce.

2187
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:20,808
Pouring it improves the taste.

2188
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:22,319
It's that sauce.

2189
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,418
- It's incredible. - It's tasty.

2190
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:25,519
(Eating)

2191
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:28,958
- It's so tasty with the sauce. - Yes.

2192
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:30,919
It totally provides a kick.

2193
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,329
- Earlier, - A refreshing salad.

2194
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,458
The owner said that we might find the taste bland.

2195
01:15:36,459 --> 01:15:38,228
- But I... - Do you think it's okay?

2196
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:39,298
I like it.

2197
01:15:39,299 --> 01:15:40,729
I like bland tastes.

2198
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:43,498
I bet you prefer this over regular mulhoe.

2199
01:15:43,499 --> 01:15:44,668
- This one is better. - Is it better?

2200
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:45,769
I think this one is better.

2201
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:47,808
There must be so many people like you.

2202
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:48,879
Right?

2203
01:15:49,839 --> 01:15:51,579
Is this the taste? Is it similar?

2204
01:15:51,809 --> 01:15:53,448
I think this place is a bit tastier.

2205
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:54,578
Really?

2206
01:15:54,579 --> 01:15:55,779
(She's cute.)

2207
01:15:55,879 --> 01:15:56,879
It's cool.

2208
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,619
- It's like milmyeon. - I see.

2209
01:15:58,749 --> 01:16:01,488
It has a source of protein and vegetables.

2210
01:16:01,489 --> 01:16:03,159
There's so much cabbage.

2211
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,789
It helps with digestion, so I think I can eat more.

2212
01:16:06,889 --> 01:16:08,459
(He brings out more food.)

2213
01:16:08,959 --> 01:16:10,498
What's this?

2214
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,469
This is the half-and-half mulhoe.

2215
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:15,539
(Their eyes go wide.)

2216
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:17,299
- There's the red mulhoe too. - This is...

2217
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:19,108
the mixed one. Half-and-half.

2218
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:21,409
It really looks like bingsu.

2219
01:16:22,179 --> 01:16:23,909
(Jjamjjamyeon)

2220
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:25,879
(Half-and-half pizza)

2221
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:27,249
(And)

2222
01:16:27,309 --> 01:16:29,879
Another menu that exists only at my restaurant is...

2223
01:16:30,649 --> 01:16:31,989
the half-and-half mulhoe.

2224
01:16:33,019 --> 01:16:36,119
Some people don't like the red mulhoe's strong flavors...

2225
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:39,729
while others think the white mulhoe tastes bland.

2226
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,728
So I mix the red mulhoe and white mulhoe...

2227
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:43,928
for the half-and-half version.

2228
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:46,369
Some customers say that this one has a balance.

2229
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:47,869
(Half-and-half broth)

2230
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,699
(Half-and-half flying fish roe)

2231
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:51,809
It's the half-and-half version.

2232
01:16:51,969 --> 01:16:54,539
Sir, it's really refreshing, nutty, and tasty.

2233
01:16:54,969 --> 01:16:56,878
- I think I'll prefer this. - Right?

2234
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:58,338
- It's your style. - Half-and-half.

2235
01:16:58,339 --> 01:17:00,248
It has a bit of spicy flavor.

2236
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:01,249
(Mix the two broths well.)

2237
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:03,448
It's like slushy.

2238
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:04,519
Right?

2239
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:07,519
(Chuu tries the third mulhoe in her life.)

2240
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:10,618
- It's very tasty. - Is it very tasty?

2241
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:11,789
- This one is tastier, right? - Yes.

2242
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:16,729
Is this one much tastier?

2243
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:19,499
It's totally tasty.

2244
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:20,928
I like this much better.

2245
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,369
(I like this much better.)

2246
01:17:22,469 --> 01:17:24,368
- The raw fish... - It's really tasty.

2247
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:25,939
It's tasty indeed.

2248
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:28,208
Which one is fake?

2249
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:30,079
It's so confusing.

2250
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:32,248
Which one is fake? This one can't be fake.

2251
01:17:32,249 --> 01:17:33,578
- It's so tasty. - There's no way of knowing.

2252
01:17:33,579 --> 01:17:34,909
(Eating)

2253
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:38,318
Does the fact that Chuu had this menu a week ago...

2254
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:39,948
make this place seem more real or fake?

2255
01:17:39,949 --> 01:17:41,119
That's what I'm confused about.

2256
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:42,819
I don't know either.

2257
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:44,618
That happening is...

2258
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:45,789
what makes this place seem fake.

2259
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:47,658
- She met the producer. - That meeting...

2260
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:49,629
- Was it done to make it seem real? - Yes.

2261
01:17:49,759 --> 01:17:52,428
I don't think the production crew would go that far.

2262
01:17:52,429 --> 01:17:54,428
- That'd be stranger. - That'd be stranger.

2263
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:55,498
Really?

2264
01:17:55,499 --> 01:17:58,068
When they did some background work on Mimi and Seok Jin,

2265
01:17:58,069 --> 01:18:00,568
- the situation was natural. - It was very natural.

2266
01:18:00,569 --> 01:18:02,439
The situation was natural.

2267
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,839
But in your case,

2268
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:07,309
the production crew was determined.

2269
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,848
It required more than words.

2270
01:18:08,849 --> 01:18:10,848
- They had to plan a team dinner. - That's right.

2271
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:12,688
- They had to set aside some time. - They wouldn't have done that.

2272
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:14,088
- That's right. - Wouldn't they have done that?

2273
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,958
It would've required asking another producer for help.

2274
01:18:15,959 --> 01:18:17,089
It would've been too much trouble.

2275
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:18,889
They wouldn't have done that.

2276
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:21,288
Can the production crew change the signboard...

2277
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:23,898
- so that a real place looks fake? - They can do that.

2278
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,498
The signboard of the second place...

2279
01:18:25,499 --> 01:18:26,829
was totally fake.

2280
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,069
The signboard of the second place...

2281
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:30,899
was made yesterday.

2282
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,368
It came out yesterday.

2283
01:18:32,369 --> 01:18:33,708
- I'm serious. - Seriously.

2284
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,638
I took a photo of the signboard.

2285
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:36,838
Seriously. I think the same.

2286
01:18:36,839 --> 01:18:38,138
Hey, look at the signboard.

2287
01:18:38,139 --> 01:18:39,909
- That's... - It looks strange.

2288
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:41,648
It looks strange. It doesn't belong at a restaurant.

2289
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:43,079
It looks like a set.

2290
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:46,148
A restaurant appears tastier if the signboard has...

2291
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:47,518
- signs of age. - Yes.

2292
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:48,588
- Look at this. - It was made yesterday.

2293
01:18:48,589 --> 01:18:50,089
It doesn't even go with the yellow color.

2294
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:53,259
It doesn't look like a tasty braised monkfish place.

2295
01:18:53,289 --> 01:18:54,788
If it's real, I'm sorry.

2296
01:18:54,789 --> 01:18:56,459
(If it's real, I'm sorry.)

2297
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:57,859
I mean...

2298
01:18:57,929 --> 01:18:59,069
I became absorbed.

2299
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:01,868
- If it's real... - I have no idea.

2300
01:19:01,869 --> 01:19:03,138
- If it's real, I'm sorry. - It's so hard.

2301
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:04,438
Shall we go?

2302
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:05,439
(Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms)

2303
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,608
(1. The realistic-looking owner 2. The perfect taste)

2304
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:07,639
(3. The menu Chuu had a week ago?)

2305
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:10,139
I thought it'd be easy, but it's very hard.

2306
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:12,508
Let's see if we'll tie with the production crew today.

2307
01:19:12,509 --> 01:19:13,548
You're right.

2308
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,248
- I really don't know. - Let's take a seat.

2309
01:19:15,249 --> 01:19:16,319
This is...

2310
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:19,749
- It's really hard. - I have no idea.

2311
01:19:19,849 --> 01:19:21,688
I feel so full when I sit down.

2312
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:22,719
(Laughing)

2313
01:19:23,489 --> 01:19:24,688
What's up with the skinny jeans?

2314
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:26,028
My stylist, thank you.

2315
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:27,159
(You gave me skinny jeans, but thank you!)

2316
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:28,728
Every single place seems fake.

2317
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:30,158
Today, every single place seems fake.

2318
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,398
But the rose braised monkfish with three dumplings...

2319
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:33,568
(Laughing)

2320
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:34,798
Everyone is hung up on different things.

2321
01:19:34,799 --> 01:19:35,838
You're right.

2322
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:37,669
- Kyung Pyo, how about you? - My choice is number one.

2323
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:39,768
- What's your reason? - Here's my reason.

2324
01:19:39,769 --> 01:19:41,338
The name of the restaurant...

2325
01:19:41,339 --> 01:19:44,379
has nothing to do with the pollack roe pork belly.

2326
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:48,949
(Number 1, Pig With Eggs)

2327
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:52,089
(Pollack roe pork belly is the main dish.)

2328
01:19:52,549 --> 01:19:54,819
(But no matter where you look in the restaurant, )

2329
01:19:54,889 --> 01:19:59,989
(you only see water parsley pork belly.)

2330
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:02,398
I'm suspicious about the tiramisu we got at the second place.

2331
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:03,459
Tiramisu.

2332
01:20:04,129 --> 01:20:06,598
(Monkfish that loves the rose sauce!)

2333
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:09,868
(Number 2, Monkfish That Loves Idols)

2334
01:20:09,869 --> 01:20:11,268
This is on the house.

2335
01:20:11,269 --> 01:20:13,068
- Will he stir-fry some rice? - Ice cream.

2336
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:14,568
(Curious)

2337
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:15,639
What's this?

2338
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:19,049
(Tiramisu in a rice bowl?)

2339
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:21,278
(Deduction 1 for number 2, Concept-heavy tiramisu...)

2340
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:23,949
(that seems like the work of a chef)

2341
01:20:24,049 --> 01:20:26,218
The signboard of the second place is downright strange.

2342
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:27,219
- It's strange. - Right?

2343
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,548
- They put it up yesterday. - Yesterday,

2344
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:29,659
Seriously.

2345
01:20:29,889 --> 01:20:31,288
(Deduction 2 for number 2,)

2346
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:33,028
(Signboard that's too clean...)

2347
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,559
(and doesn't suit the restaurant)

2348
01:20:35,759 --> 01:20:37,598
- How about you, Mimi? - I'm torn...

2349
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,868
- between number 1 and number 2. - Not number 3?

2350
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,228
- Is it a double twist? - I think it's a double twist.

2351
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:42,438
I agree with that. I don't think it's number three.

2352
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:43,538
I think it's a double twist.

2353
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,698
How about you, Seok Jin?

2354
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:45,968
I'm suspicious about the last place.

2355
01:20:45,969 --> 01:20:47,938
- It's strange that Chuu has had it. - I know.

2356
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:48,978
(Deduction for number 3)

2357
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:50,179
(How is it that Chuu has had white mulhoe?)

2358
01:20:50,539 --> 01:20:52,378
(The counterattack of the white dongchimi!)

2359
01:20:52,379 --> 01:20:54,649
(Number 3, Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms)

2360
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,148
The mulhoe I had once was...

2361
01:20:57,149 --> 01:20:58,318
- White mulhoe. - Does it really exist?

2362
01:20:58,319 --> 01:20:59,849
- White mulhoe with dongchimi. - Then it's this place.

2363
01:20:59,949 --> 01:21:01,218
- That's it. - That's it.

2364
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:02,819
- They set you up. - That's it.

2365
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,929
(Is the white mulhoe Chuu had in advance...)

2366
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:09,659
(the production crew's white lie?)

2367
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:10,729
Chuu, how about you?

2368
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:11,899
Seriously,

2369
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,269
I'm suddenly torn between number 2 and number 3.

2370
01:21:14,299 --> 01:21:15,538
The way my manager looked at me...

2371
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:16,698
was strange just now.

2372
01:21:16,699 --> 01:21:18,099
(The way my manager looked at me was strange just now.)

2373
01:21:18,569 --> 01:21:21,509
(Why did Chuu's manager suddenly avoid eye contact?)

2374
01:21:21,839 --> 01:21:23,639
(What's going on?)

2375
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:25,609
It's so confusing because of that mulhoe.

2376
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,079
You have a point.

2377
01:21:27,909 --> 01:21:29,578
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2378
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:31,578
As always, the answers are divided.

2379
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:33,219
- I don't want to be the one. - The winner will choose.

2380
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,349
I want to lose.

2381
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,489
- What should I do? - All right.

2382
01:21:37,289 --> 01:21:38,659
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2383
01:21:39,789 --> 01:21:41,529
- That startled me. - Rock...

2384
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:42,799
We won.

2385
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,099
I hope Seok Jin wins.

2386
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:47,369
I hate this so much. I don't want to win.

2387
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:49,368
(Chuu is trembling.)

2388
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:51,439
All right. Let's go.

2389
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:53,108
Rock-paper...

2390
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:55,108
(Who will win and be responsible for today's outcome?)

2391
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:56,178
(Who will it be?)

2392
01:21:56,179 --> 01:21:57,379
I won!

2393
01:21:57,409 --> 01:21:58,538
Rock-paper-scissors!

2394
01:21:58,539 --> 01:21:59,749
I won! Gosh!

2395
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,648
Gosh, I didn't want to win.

2396
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:03,719
(A memorable ceremony)

2397
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:05,618
- He didn't want to win. - I didn't want to win.

2398
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:07,149
I envy him.

2399
01:22:07,249 --> 01:22:08,688
Seok Jin, why do you always win...

2400
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:10,158
- when it's something like this? - Why did I win?

2401
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,388
Why do I lose when I need to win and win when I need to lose?

2402
01:22:12,389 --> 01:22:13,889
Seok Jin, what's the answer?

2403
01:22:14,089 --> 01:22:16,328
- No matter which one you choose... - I really don't know.

2404
01:22:16,329 --> 01:22:18,828
- We can't do anything about it. - I really don't know.

2405
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:21,099
The owner, unreasonable price,

2406
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,839
tiramisu, and the last one, Chuu...

2407
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,239
No, Chuu...

2408
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:27,738
The fact that Chuu went to the same restaurant a week ago...

2409
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:29,008
- is so strange. - I know.

2410
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:31,779
I find it strange too. The taste was the same.

2411
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:33,779
- Is your choice number three? - Maybe not.

2412
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,208
(Number 3, white mulhoe?)

2413
01:22:35,209 --> 01:22:36,919
- To pick that... - The signboard.

2414
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:39,548
The signboard seemed so fake.

2415
01:22:39,549 --> 01:22:41,288
The owner seemed so fake.

2416
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,458
"Monkfish Restaurant."

2417
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,019
- "Monkfish Restaurant." - "Monkfish Restaurant."

2418
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:45,859
"Monkfish Restaurant."

2419
01:22:46,089 --> 01:22:47,488
- The restaurant... - How is the restaurant name...

2420
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:48,588
"Monkfish Restaurant?"

2421
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,098
It's so strange.

2422
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:51,528
The yellow signboard too.

2423
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:52,769
(He's mad about the monkfish restaurant.)

2424
01:22:52,929 --> 01:22:55,098
Number two seems so fake.

2425
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:57,199
Let's go with number 2. I'll go with number 2.

2426
01:22:57,399 --> 01:22:58,839
- Number 2. - I'll go with number 2.

2427
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:01,038
It's so hard.

2428
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:02,379
We can't get it right now.

2429
01:23:02,539 --> 01:23:04,278
If we get it right today, the score will be...

2430
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,509
- It'll be a tie. - It'll be a tie.

2431
01:23:06,679 --> 01:23:08,648
(Sixth Sense)

2432
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:09,649
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

2433
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:11,678
(The fourth city, Incheon)

2434
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:12,749
Incheon.

2435
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:19,089
(Weirdos have appeared here at Incheon's sea.)

2436
01:23:19,589 --> 01:23:21,829
(Is it fake or weird? Weirdos of Incheon's sea)

2437
01:23:22,089 --> 01:23:23,758
Which one is it?

2438
01:23:23,759 --> 01:23:25,528
- Which one is it? - Please.

2439
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:27,099
(Say no to ordinary pork belly!)

2440
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:28,328
That's suspicious.

2441
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:29,738
- Everything is suspicious today. - Everything was tasty.

2442
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:31,669
- That has to be an item. - It was so tasty.

2443
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,509
- Rose. - That was tasty too.

2444
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:36,138
Number two is definitely something...

2445
01:23:36,139 --> 01:23:37,439
- a chef would make. - Number two.

2446
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,249
I really don't know.

2447
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:40,878
(What's...)

2448
01:23:40,879 --> 01:23:42,619
(red?)

2449
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:44,178
(They took out chili powder...)

2450
01:23:44,179 --> 01:23:45,179
(and added dongchimi!)

2451
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,018
- Doesn't the dish seem real? - It seems so real.

2452
01:23:47,019 --> 01:23:48,859
- Right? It seems so real. - Yes.

2453
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:52,559
(Is it weird or fake?)

2454
01:23:52,929 --> 01:23:54,829
- Please. I'm nervous. - Please.

2455
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:56,829
It needs to be correct so that the score will be a tie.

2456
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,929
Please.

2457
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:00,569
Please.

2458
01:24:00,929 --> 01:24:01,929
(Which one is fake?)

2459
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,838
Please let it be number two.

2460
01:24:03,839 --> 01:24:06,238
- Which one is it? - Number two.

2461
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,839
(They put their hands together and send a signal.)

2462
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:09,739
Number 2. Let it be number 2.

2463
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,149
Number two. Both the tiramisu and dumplings were strange.

2464
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:15,548
That startled me.

2465
01:24:15,549 --> 01:24:19,819
(Which one is fake?)

2466
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,480
Please.

2467
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,080
Please.

2468
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:24,839
(Which one is fake?)

2469
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,678
Please let it be number two.

2470
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:29,248
- Which one is it? - Number two.

2471
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:30,808
(They put their hands together and send a signal.)

2472
01:24:30,809 --> 01:24:32,619
Number 2. Let it be number 2.

2473
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,189
Number two. Both the tiramisu and dumplings were strange.

2474
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:38,349
That startled me.

2475
01:24:38,489 --> 01:24:43,489
(Which one is fake?)

2476
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,158
(Number 3, Mulhoe That's Full of Innocent Charms)

2477
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:47,299
- Is it fake? - Is it fake?

2478
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:50,699
(Fake)

2479
01:24:51,069 --> 01:24:52,268
(Number 3...)

2480
01:24:52,269 --> 01:24:53,438
(is fake?)

2481
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:55,569
- You twisted it three times, right? - Hold on.

2482
01:24:56,009 --> 01:24:57,969
- Hold on. - They twisted it three times.

2483
01:24:58,269 --> 01:24:59,879
But that dish seems real.

2484
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:03,249
It does seem real. I thought that dish existed.

2485
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:04,648
Is it fake?

2486
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:05,779
(No one expected it to be fake.)

2487
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:08,678
(Despite the rowdy atmosphere, )

2488
01:25:08,679 --> 01:25:10,288
(she can't hear anything.)

2489
01:25:10,289 --> 01:25:11,388
Hold on a second!

2490
01:25:11,389 --> 01:25:12,618
What's this?

2491
01:25:12,619 --> 01:25:14,259
- But... - What happened?

2492
01:25:14,419 --> 01:25:16,088
- What's this? - Hold on.

2493
01:25:16,089 --> 01:25:17,659
- What? - Seventy-five days ago.

2494
01:25:18,389 --> 01:25:19,598
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2 Group Chatroom)

2495
01:25:19,599 --> 01:25:20,798
(There's this trend on Twitter these days!)

2496
01:25:20,799 --> 01:25:23,498
(The production crew found a post while searching for trendy items.)

2497
01:25:23,499 --> 01:25:25,098
(This is my mom's restaurant. Please help.)

(Someone's promotional post for their parent's restaurant)

2499
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,268
- This is my mom's restaurant. - That's right.

2500
01:25:27,269 --> 01:25:28,998
There were so many posts like that.

2501
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:30,238
(Someone's promotional post for their parent's restaurant)

2502
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,608
(I live in Suwon, so I'll visit. Good luck, business owners.)

2503
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:32,708
I got goosebumps.

2504
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:34,609
(Many people rooted for the family warmly.)

2505
01:25:36,609 --> 01:25:37,979
- Two hundred million views. - Two hundred million?

2507
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:42,448
(of business owners' children became a trend.)

2508
01:25:42,449 --> 01:25:44,888
These days, there are many social media posts like that.

2509
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,418
- That's right. - The online filial act relay.

2510
01:25:46,419 --> 01:25:48,519
- Saving the parents' businesses. - That's right.

2511
01:25:49,159 --> 01:25:51,388
(The production crew was looking for a restaurant...)

2512
01:25:51,389 --> 01:25:53,829
(when one post caught their eyes.)

2513
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:57,099
- It's the place we saw earlier. - You're right. That's the place.

2514
01:25:57,869 --> 01:25:59,538
(It's my father's restaurant, but there are no customers.)

2515
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:01,039
(A sincere post that promotes the father's sushi bar)

2516
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:02,198
(The production crew contacted the person who made the post.)

2517
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:03,269
No way.

2518
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:06,709
Hello, this is the production crew of Sixth Sense.

2519
01:26:06,809 --> 01:26:08,378
What kind of a situation...

2520
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:10,379
made you upload that post?

2521
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:12,148
When my father comes home,

2522
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:13,678
he says that the business is slow.

2523
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:14,848
- Oh, no. - He's having a hard time.

2524
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:17,519
Things are hard on the business owners these days.

2525
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:21,089
My father's mulhoe is the tastiest.

2526
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,628
(In a photo that got uploaded as well)

2527
01:26:25,629 --> 01:26:28,599
Mulhoe is the signature dish.

2528
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:31,069
- It was so tasty. - It was tasty.

2529
01:26:31,569 --> 01:26:34,169
- It was so tasty. - You know, it was seriously tasty.

2530
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:35,669
Will it be tasty?

2531
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,468
I don't know if it's a good idea to believe a social media post.

2532
01:26:38,469 --> 01:26:40,408
(Thus, the production crew members went to eat that mulhoe.)

2533
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:41,508
- It's tasty. - Yes.

2534
01:26:41,509 --> 01:26:43,448
(Original mulhoe that's full of crushed ice)

2535
01:26:43,449 --> 01:26:44,579
Original mulhoe.

2536
01:26:45,509 --> 01:26:47,818
(They trust the owner's daughter and try it.)

2537
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:48,918
(Impressed)

2538
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:50,119
- It's so tasty. - Yes.

2539
01:26:50,389 --> 01:26:52,118
It's no wonder his daughter bragged about it.

2540
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:54,189
- It was so fresh. - It was seriously tasty.

2541
01:26:54,589 --> 01:26:55,929
It was so tasty.

2542
01:26:56,729 --> 01:26:58,089
Hello, sir.

2543
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,559
We're actually a production crew for a show.

2544
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:04,469
We saw your daughter's post on the internet and...

2545
01:27:05,799 --> 01:27:07,738
That's how an interview begins for "Want to Know."

2546
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:08,739
(That's right.)

2547
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:11,168
If people say that they're from a broadcasting station,

2548
01:27:11,169 --> 01:27:12,409
anyone will be suspicious.

2549
01:27:12,509 --> 01:27:13,779
- That's right. - I bet he was surprised.

2550
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:16,749
We saw your daughter's post on the internet and...

2551
01:27:18,409 --> 01:27:20,449
My daughter wouldn't do something like that.

2552
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:22,989
- "My daughter wouldn't do that." - "My daughter wouldn't do that."

2553
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:24,919
Of course, he was worried.

2554
01:27:25,289 --> 01:27:26,888
Let's talk for a second.

2555
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:28,088
(Flustered by an unexpected reaction)

2556
01:27:28,089 --> 01:27:29,119
Okay?

2557
01:27:30,559 --> 01:27:31,759
Thank you.

2558
01:27:33,059 --> 01:27:35,228
(To the owner who is on guard, )

2559
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:36,828
Please take a look at this.

2560
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:38,829
(they show the post in question.)

2561
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:42,469
It's his daughter's post.

2562
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,209
It's my daughter.

2563
01:27:45,269 --> 01:27:47,239
It's his daughter's post.

2564
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:51,509
My daughter isn't the type to post something like this.

2565
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,348
How did she do it?

2566
01:27:53,349 --> 01:27:54,349
(Laughing)

2567
01:27:55,949 --> 01:27:57,548
(Not my daughter versus My daughter)

2568
01:27:57,549 --> 01:27:59,759
Despite his looks,

2569
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:02,319
- my dad is a good man. - His facial expression changed.

2570
01:28:02,589 --> 01:28:03,888
Seriously.

2571
01:28:03,889 --> 01:28:06,099
That's right. There's a deep connection.

2572
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:08,998
He has worked in this field for many years.

2573
01:28:08,999 --> 01:28:10,699
- He's the rightmost one. - I see.

2574
01:28:10,799 --> 01:28:13,239
Since he has worked hard, I want him to become successful...

2575
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,298
and smile.

2576
01:28:15,299 --> 01:28:17,369
I don't want him to be depressed at home.

2577
01:28:18,839 --> 01:28:20,178
(A support from the daughter who grew up well thanks to him)

2578
01:28:20,179 --> 01:28:22,209
- My goodness. - It makes me happy.

2579
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:24,848
When I go home without serving any customers...

2580
01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:26,279
I try not to show it,

2581
01:28:27,519 --> 01:28:29,219
but she can tell that I'm down.

2582
01:28:29,419 --> 01:28:31,449
- Of course. - Of course.

2583
01:28:31,989 --> 01:28:33,918
(Thanks to his daughter's support, )

2584
01:28:33,919 --> 01:28:35,959
(his appearance on the show becomes finalized!)

2585
01:28:36,059 --> 01:28:37,588
(In that case, what's his biggest worry?)

2586
01:28:37,589 --> 01:28:40,199
Businesses in the area declined a lot this year.

2587
01:28:41,059 --> 01:28:42,258
Since it's surrounded by apartments,

2588
01:28:42,259 --> 01:28:44,068
only regulars come.

2589
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:45,069
That's right.

2590
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,399
Unless there's a menu people are determined to try...

2591
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:49,608
Except for the ones who come due to a recommendation,

2592
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:51,168
new customers are rare.

2593
01:28:51,169 --> 01:28:52,908
So my business is declining.

2594
01:28:52,909 --> 01:28:54,539
(A signature dish must be developed!)

2595
01:28:55,479 --> 01:29:00,318
(Thus, the show invited a special expert.)

2596
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:01,349
Hello.

2597
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:03,718
I'm the master in the foodservice industry...

2598
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:05,348
- in Korea, - She's the master.

2599
01:29:05,349 --> 01:29:06,959
Park Mi Hee.

2600
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:08,759
She's the master.

2601
01:29:10,729 --> 01:29:12,428
That explains the use of dongchimi.

2602
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:14,129
(Godmother of kimchi with the annual sales of 44.3 million dollars)

2603
01:29:14,799 --> 01:29:16,268
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2 and Master Park Mi Hee)

2604
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:17,368
I see.

2605
01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:18,769
She's the kimchi master.

2606
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:22,239
We recruited a sushi bar.

2607
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:25,738
We thought of developing the white mulhoe.

2608
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:26,739
White mulhoe.

2609
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,239
If we add the tangy dongchimi brine,

2610
01:29:29,349 --> 01:29:33,018
we'll be able to maintain the sour and sweet taste of mulhoe.

2611
01:29:33,019 --> 01:29:35,118
- That's right. - It'll be tasty mulhoe.

2612
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,348
- It was sweet and sour. - It was tasty.

2613
01:29:36,349 --> 01:29:39,288
I blended Cheongyang chilis and green onions...

2614
01:29:39,289 --> 01:29:40,718
- with regular dongchimi... - It was tasty.

2615
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,559
So that the aftertaste became spicy.

2616
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:45,888
- I created that taste. - Cheongyang chilis...

2617
01:29:45,889 --> 01:29:47,559
- made it spicier. - That's right.

2618
01:29:47,859 --> 01:29:48,998
- It was tasty. - It's perfect.

2619
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:52,368
If you do this, the taste will be richer.

2620
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:53,398
That's incredible.

2621
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:55,268
- Chefs are incredible. - Seriously.

2622
01:29:55,269 --> 01:29:57,409
How do they develop such dishes?

2623
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:59,638
Although the owner of the restaurant...

2624
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:01,278
had been in the business for 40 years,

2625
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:03,479
- he was open to a collaboration. - That's right.

2626
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,748
That's how a new menu comes out.

2627
01:30:05,749 --> 01:30:06,849
- That's right. - Yes.

2628
01:30:07,849 --> 01:30:08,949
White mulhoe.

2629
01:30:09,649 --> 01:30:11,388
(It became popular among the regulars customers...)

2630
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:13,218
I'm shocked that it's fake.

2631
01:30:13,219 --> 01:30:14,258
I know.

2632
01:30:14,259 --> 01:30:15,319
(as well as young customers.)

2633
01:30:15,519 --> 01:30:20,759
(The unique look made it go viral on social media.)

2634
01:30:21,059 --> 01:30:23,468
- It was tasty. - It was cold and tasty.

2635
01:30:23,469 --> 01:30:25,529
(It doesn't end here!)

2636
01:30:26,029 --> 01:30:27,398
(Chuu, )

2637
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:29,438
(didn't the white mulhoe look familiar?)

2638
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:30,468
- No way. - I mean...

2639
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:31,838
- Chuu! - She was set up.

2640
01:30:31,839 --> 01:30:33,678
- Chuu. - I'm getting goosebumps.

2641
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,279
- Seriously. - She was set up.

2642
01:30:35,709 --> 01:30:37,408
- Chuu. - I'm getting goosebumps.

2643
01:30:37,409 --> 01:30:38,478
Was it a strategy?

2644
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:39,579
Seriously...

2645
01:30:39,919 --> 01:30:41,079
Was it...

2646
01:30:41,849 --> 01:30:43,548
- Seriously, I got goosebumps. - My hair stood.

2647
01:30:43,549 --> 01:30:45,719
- Was it a strategy? - Was it a preparation?

2648
01:30:46,519 --> 01:30:48,159
- I mean, we... - No way.

2649
01:30:48,559 --> 01:30:50,689
- The producer... - What happened?

2650
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:53,429
(A week before the shoot)

2651
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:55,458
(A sushi bar with the same name...)

2652
01:30:55,459 --> 01:30:56,828
(in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul?)

2653
01:30:56,829 --> 01:30:59,229
It's the same signboard.

2654
01:30:59,499 --> 01:31:00,569
I got goosebumps.

2655
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:04,039
(Someone enters the restaurant)

2656
01:31:05,309 --> 01:31:07,179
- Hello. - This is incredible.

2657
01:31:07,309 --> 01:31:08,979
(Chuu is here!)

2658
01:31:09,139 --> 01:31:11,078
- I mean... What? - It's Chuu!

2659
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:12,148
It's you!

2660
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:13,748
You're the main character of the unexpected twist.

2661
01:31:13,749 --> 01:31:15,419
(It's Chuu.)

2662
01:31:15,879 --> 01:31:17,248
Gosh, Chuu.

2663
01:31:17,249 --> 01:31:18,918
How is the white mulhoe? Is it okay?

2664
01:31:18,919 --> 01:31:20,559
I like it. The taste is clean.

2665
01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:22,218
You're eating a lot.

2666
01:31:22,219 --> 01:31:23,788
- It was a strategy. - You're eating with gusto.

2667
01:31:23,789 --> 01:31:24,789
(Chuu, was the white mulhoe tasty?)

2668
01:31:25,259 --> 01:31:26,899
(You fell for the trick of Sixth Sense: City Tour 2.)

2669
01:31:27,229 --> 01:31:28,628
It was a strategy.

2670
01:31:28,629 --> 01:31:29,868
- They planned a month ago. - No way.

2671
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:32,199
For the concept of the fake place in Episode Four,

2672
01:31:32,269 --> 01:31:34,469
shall we do 1 of the 3 major missions?

2673
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:36,838
Are there more? There are two more major missions.

2674
01:31:36,839 --> 01:31:37,909
(What are those?)

2675
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:40,079
Which 1 of the 3 shall we use?

2676
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:42,239
How about number three?

2677
01:31:43,179 --> 01:31:44,778
"Fake a guest's experience."

2678
01:31:44,779 --> 01:31:46,818
Our guess was correct.

2679
01:31:46,819 --> 01:31:48,219
(Fool Chuu into experiencing what's fake in advance.)

2680
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:51,489
(Major mission number 3, Chuu is shocked.)

2681
01:31:51,549 --> 01:31:53,589
Numbers 1 and 2 have been blurred. We don't know them yet.

2682
01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:55,459
What are those?

2683
01:31:55,959 --> 01:31:57,628
(In Chuu's vicinity, )

2684
01:31:57,629 --> 01:31:58,629
(let's make one more fake restaurant!)

2685
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:00,398
They made one more restaurant to fool her.

2686
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:01,828
(They thoroughly searched the area near the broadcasting station.)

2687
01:32:01,829 --> 01:32:03,969
- How is that even possible? - Seriously.

2688
01:32:04,799 --> 01:32:07,339
We'll be able to use it if we remove the signboard.

2689
01:32:07,839 --> 01:32:09,769
- The signboard? - Is that the place you went to?

2690
01:32:09,869 --> 01:32:11,468
- Hello. - It's the exact same place!

2691
01:32:11,469 --> 01:32:14,278
- We're a production crew. - Is it the exact same place?

2692
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:16,848
Yes. He's the owner I saw.

2693
01:32:16,849 --> 01:32:19,618
Would you cooperate for the shoot?

2694
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:21,318
- Of course. - "Of course."

2695
01:32:21,319 --> 01:32:23,248
Would you be okay with us changing the signboard?

2696
01:32:23,249 --> 01:32:24,849
- I mean... - They took off the signboard too.

2697
01:32:25,449 --> 01:32:26,718
- We're in your care. - The owner said earlier,

2698
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,158
- "He's my friend." - That's right.

2699
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,588
They look like they're about the same age.

2700
01:32:29,589 --> 01:32:30,858
Seriously.

2701
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:31,859
(Since the 2nd branch is ready, )

2702
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,899
(let's set things up in earnest!)

2703
01:32:34,499 --> 01:32:36,929
- Did they really go that far? - Did they really go that far?

2704
01:32:37,499 --> 01:32:39,739
- I mean... - Was that the original signboard?

2705
01:32:39,839 --> 01:32:40,868
(The signboard went on a long journey.)

2706
01:32:40,869 --> 01:32:42,099
Did it go to the other restaurant?

2707
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:45,038
Our guess was right.

2708
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:48,039
- Such a coincidence is rare. - You're right.

2709
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,239
(They took down the original signboard.)

2710
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,409
They even took down the signboard.

2711
01:32:50,949 --> 01:32:52,208
(Let's install the fake signboard.)

2712
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:54,419
They remodeled the restaurant to fool her once.

2713
01:32:54,749 --> 01:32:56,688
- It's so... - My goodness.

2714
01:32:56,689 --> 01:32:57,889
You had no idea, right?

2715
01:32:58,019 --> 01:32:59,288
- That's right. - They even took down the menu.

2716
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:00,289
They went so far.

2717
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:03,858
We did think that it was strange.

2718
01:33:03,859 --> 01:33:04,859
- Yes. - Yes.

2719
01:33:05,559 --> 01:33:06,858
(They refuse to miss the smallest details!)

2720
01:33:06,859 --> 01:33:07,899
I got goosebumps.

2721
01:33:10,129 --> 01:33:11,998
It's the exact same signboard.

2722
01:33:11,999 --> 01:33:13,438
- It's exactly the same. - Yes.

2723
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:14,499
(The 2nd branch was ready.)

2724
01:33:14,969 --> 01:33:16,038
(The problem was bringing Chuu to the restaurant.)

2725
01:33:16,039 --> 01:33:18,239
"Bringing Chuu to the restaurant." Isn't this too much?

2726
01:33:19,409 --> 01:33:20,738
(Since the fake menu is mulhoe)

2727
01:33:20,739 --> 01:33:21,809
Isn't this too much?

2728
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:23,849
- "Fresh off the Sea." - "Fresh off the Sea."

2729
01:33:24,609 --> 01:33:27,218
Hello.

2730
01:33:27,219 --> 01:33:29,178
- Did you meet that producer? - Yes.

2731
01:33:29,179 --> 01:33:30,548
The thing is,

2732
01:33:30,549 --> 01:33:33,258
Chuu will be a guest on Sixth Sense: CityTour 2.

2733
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:36,058
Would you tell Chuu that you're planning a spinoff...

2734
01:33:36,059 --> 01:33:37,929
of "Fresh off the Sea" with the male members?

2735
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:39,489
What's that?

2736
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:41,358
Hey, that's...

2737
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:42,899
(Staggering)

2738
01:33:42,999 --> 01:33:45,328
You guys are swindlers!

2739
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:47,998
When Chuu has a schedule in Sangam,

2740
01:33:47,999 --> 01:33:49,398
- would you ask her... - Did they have to go that far?

2741
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:51,008
- to have a quick meal with you? - They swindled her.

2742
01:33:51,009 --> 01:33:53,609
- Hey, that's swindling. - You guys are swindlers.

2743
01:33:53,909 --> 01:33:56,979
Well, if you need me to do that...

2744
01:33:57,149 --> 01:33:59,048
- Sure. - A spinoff of "Fresh off the Sea."

2745
01:33:59,049 --> 01:34:01,018
- Thank you. - It sounded plausible.

2746
01:34:01,019 --> 01:34:03,049
- Spinoffs are common. - Yes.

2747
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:04,518
(Chuu, the much-anticipated heroine)

2748
01:34:04,519 --> 01:34:05,649
How did this happen?

2749
01:34:06,959 --> 01:34:08,018
(Why don't we say it's a meal the production crew planned...)

2750
01:34:08,019 --> 01:34:09,019
(even though she won't appear on the show due to her schedule?)

2751
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:10,129
She trusts her manager.

2752
01:34:10,689 --> 01:34:11,788
Seriously.

2753
01:34:11,789 --> 01:34:12,929
She must've been excited.

2754
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:14,299
I should've known.

2755
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:17,329
(They succeeded in recruiting Chuu!)

2756
01:34:17,429 --> 01:34:19,899
It was my first time hearing about a meal with the producer...

2757
01:34:20,299 --> 01:34:22,798
- when the recruitment fell through. - Exactly.

2758
01:34:22,799 --> 01:34:25,069
(Chuu came after finishing off her work nearby.)

2759
01:34:25,269 --> 01:34:27,678
We ordered some food in advance.

2760
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:28,709
Okay.

2761
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:32,149
- Here you go. - Thank you.

2762
01:34:32,749 --> 01:34:34,378
Try it. It's really tasty.

2763
01:34:34,379 --> 01:34:35,518
It looks so tasty.

2764
01:34:35,519 --> 01:34:37,219
- White mulhoe looks cool, right? - Yes.

2765
01:34:38,019 --> 01:34:39,789
(Chuu picked some up with her chopsticks.)

2766
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:41,458
- It was tasty. - Yes.

2767
01:34:41,459 --> 01:34:42,918
It was so tasty.

2768
01:34:42,919 --> 01:34:44,758
After all, it's easy to believe that such a dish exists.

2769
01:34:44,759 --> 01:34:45,789
It was the best.

2770
01:34:46,259 --> 01:34:47,858
How is the white mulhoe? Is it okay?

2771
01:34:47,859 --> 01:34:49,498
- I like it. The taste is clean. - Look at that.

2772
01:34:49,499 --> 01:34:50,699
Of course, she was obsessed.

2773
01:34:50,899 --> 01:34:52,298
It was a strategy.

2774
01:34:52,299 --> 01:34:54,269
(Chuu completely fell into the production crew's trap.)

2775
01:34:54,599 --> 01:34:57,109
Chuu, the second branch is fake.

2776
01:34:57,809 --> 01:35:00,779
- And the white mulhoe is fake. - No way.

2777
01:35:01,009 --> 01:35:02,039
No way.

2778
01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:04,248
(Everyone exclaims.)

2779
01:35:04,249 --> 01:35:05,648
- Seriously. - She's having a mental breakdown.

2780
01:35:05,649 --> 01:35:07,019
- She's... - I have a really bad headache.

2781
01:35:08,379 --> 01:35:09,379
(It's understandable.)

2782
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,418
Of course, you do.

2783
01:35:10,419 --> 01:35:12,589
- Why didn't we think about... - I mean...

2784
01:35:12,989 --> 01:35:15,158
Why would a producer eat with someone who wasn't recruited...

2785
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:16,319
- for the show? - Exactly.

2786
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:18,888
- I've never seen such a thing. - I know.

2787
01:35:18,889 --> 01:35:19,898
Such things are rare.

2788
01:35:19,899 --> 01:35:21,059
Gosh, this is so...

2789
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:24,269
- The fake mulhoe was so tasty. - It was tasty.

2790
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:27,698
If a guest comes and says...

2791
01:35:27,699 --> 01:35:29,708
that he or she has heard about something,

2792
01:35:29,709 --> 01:35:31,409
that place should be singled out.

2793
01:35:31,639 --> 01:35:33,238
That place should be singled out.

2794
01:35:33,239 --> 01:35:34,738
- We can't trust it. - It's fake.

2795
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:36,848
- It has to be fake. - It should be singled out.

2796
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:37,849
(My goodness)

2797
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:39,978
If he or she has heard about it or seen it...

2798
01:35:39,979 --> 01:35:41,119
- It's fake. - It's fake.

2799
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:43,148
- She's scratching her head. - You're exhausted, right?

2800
01:35:43,149 --> 01:35:44,448
(Otherwise, this will happen.)

2801
01:35:44,449 --> 01:35:46,988
Is the signboard of the second place real?

2802
01:35:46,989 --> 01:35:48,059
Is it real?

2803
01:35:48,289 --> 01:35:49,388
- Is it real? - It's real.

2804
01:35:49,389 --> 01:35:51,459
(The biggest plot twist of the day)

2805
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:52,988
- Are you serious? - Yes.

2806
01:35:52,989 --> 01:35:53,998
(Are you saying that this is real?)

2807
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:55,728
- Sir. - Sir, we're so sorry.

2808
01:35:55,729 --> 01:35:56,729
(The man who claimed that it was fake backpedals.)

2809
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:58,929
We've lived that way.

2810
01:35:59,169 --> 01:36:00,569
It's just that we aren't trendy.

2811
01:36:00,669 --> 01:36:02,169
I'm sorry about tiramisu.

2812
01:36:03,469 --> 01:36:04,538
It's time for the penalty.

2813
01:36:04,539 --> 01:36:05,739
For goodness' sake.

2814
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:09,139
You need to upload a post on social media before this airs.

2815
01:36:09,749 --> 01:36:11,808
- I never imagined it. - That producer...

2816
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:12,879
That producer kept...

2817
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:15,278
- I hope you pick Dong Hyun. - No.

2818
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:17,118
Let me see Dong Hyun make a cringe-worthy post.

2819
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:18,318
I can't do it.

2820
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:19,319
Jee Seok Jin!

2821
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:21,118
Yes!

2822
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,158
(Seok Jin gets the penalty.)

2823
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,728
(Happy)

2824
01:36:24,729 --> 01:36:27,059
I hate cringe-worthy posts!

2825
01:36:27,799 --> 01:36:29,768
- I hate them so much. - No.

2826
01:36:29,769 --> 01:36:31,768
The owner of the second restaurant is cheering the loudest.

2827
01:36:31,769 --> 01:36:34,198
(The owner of the 2nd restaurant is happy.)

2828
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:37,068
Dong Hyun and Chuu who joined us today,

2829
01:36:37,069 --> 01:36:38,138
thank you so much.

2830
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:39,468
- Thank you. - It was so much fun.

2831
01:36:39,469 --> 01:36:41,338
We'll look forward to your sentimental post.

2832
01:36:41,339 --> 01:36:43,108
- Okay, I'll do my best. - Okay.

2833
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:44,909
(Check out Seok Jin's penalty on social media.)

2834
01:36:45,062 --> 01:36:47,301
(The fifth city tour, Mapo)

2835
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,442
(Full of unique charms and youth)

2836
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,442
(At the city of style, Mapo, )

2837
01:36:52,672 --> 01:36:54,141
(did the new world open?)

2838
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,771
(Shocked)

2839
01:36:55,772 --> 01:36:57,381
(The hidden secrets inside the new world...)

2840
01:36:57,382 --> 01:37:01,081
(makes the members struggle.)

2841
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:03,012
(The popular celebrities of Mapo are here!)

2842
01:37:03,112 --> 01:37:05,122
(Kim Won Hun, Eom Ji Yoon)

2843
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:08,021
(I don't understand why you can't get it right.)

2844
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:09,651
(I become so frustrated when I watch the show.)

2845
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:12,161
(The popular celebrities of Mapo are full of confidence.)

2846
01:37:12,162 --> 01:37:14,591
(We ate and drank here every day. We did everything!)

2847
01:37:14,592 --> 01:37:15,831
(His nose is bigger than mine.)

2848
01:37:15,832 --> 01:37:17,361
(Won Hun, why is your nose peeled?)

2849
01:37:17,362 --> 01:37:18,861
(I went a skin care clinic yesterday.)

2850
01:37:18,862 --> 01:37:20,431
(He just got a pimple extraction on his nose.)

2851
01:37:20,432 --> 01:37:22,971
(His nose turns red when he receives attention.)

2852
01:37:22,972 --> 01:37:24,402
(Is there a strawberry ade?)

2853
01:37:24,842 --> 01:37:26,102
(His nose looks like a strawberry today.)

2854
01:37:26,372 --> 01:37:27,572
(He has a strawberry nose.)

2855
01:37:27,612 --> 01:37:30,182
(Aren't you talking about strawberries too much?)

2856
01:37:30,242 --> 01:37:31,641
(It's hard to make a moon jar.)

2857
01:37:31,642 --> 01:37:33,411
(You should take one and use it as a chamber pot.)

2858
01:37:33,412 --> 01:37:35,182
(Strawberry Nose attacks Big Nose.)

2859
01:37:35,512 --> 01:37:36,751
(Seok Jin, are you 60?)

2860
01:37:36,752 --> 01:37:37,951
(No!)

2861
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:40,452
(Big Nose and his Mapo juniors make fun of each other.)

2862
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:43,222
(And today's theme is as difficult as always.)

2863
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:47,931
(What's the new world of Mapo that surprised everyone?)

2864
01:37:47,932 --> 01:37:49,132
(You're lying!)
