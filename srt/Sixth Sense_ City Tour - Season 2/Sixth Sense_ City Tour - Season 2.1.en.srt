00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,899
Is Jae Seok not here yet?

3
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,469
He's not here.

4
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:34,729
Hello.

5
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,469
Hello, director. It's good to see you.

6
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:37,939
(Interjecting with joy)

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,508
(Skipping happily)

8
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,539
Finally, Sixth Sense Season Two.

9
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,338
Thank you, everyone.

(The return of Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

11
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,109
Thanks to your support,

12
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,848
Season Two is finally here.

13
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,118
(Amidst the public's anticipation, Season 2 is open.)

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,589
(Oh, yes)

15
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,718
As they say, you reap what you say...

16
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,918
(The youngest Sixth Sense member, Mimi)

17
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,388
You reap what you say...

18
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,059
What's the phrase? You reap...

19
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:01,628
You reap what you sow.

20
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:02,729
Right.

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,559
"You reap what you sow" is different.

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,258
What I already said...

23
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:07,668
- I'm in trouble from the start.
- Hey, Mimi.

24
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:09,369
Mimi is already here.

25
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,139
Jae Seok.

26
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,369
Yes, I'm coming.

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,369
Jae Seok.

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,208
Gosh, Mimi. Have you been well?

29
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:19,239
Yes.

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,579
- Jae Seok, have you been well?
- Look at her.

31
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,648
After not being able to sleep,

32
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,649
she's pretending to be energetic.

33
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:27,588
Hello.

34
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:28,988
(Hello)

35
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,059
- Gosh, hello.
- Jae Seok.

36
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,758
- It's so good to see you.
- Why do you look so fancy?

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,928
I made an effort today. I put on dress shoes.

38
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,058
(She made an effort to dress up.)

39
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,428
- I'm also wearing lipstick.
- By the way,

40
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,329
you're wearing more jewelry than before.

41
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,928
- It's because...
- Are you...

42
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,339
(Bling-bling)

43
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,339
Did you invest in Bitcoins?

44
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,978
- What?
- I got all my money together.

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,409
- Really?
- Yes.

46
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:53,378
Anyway, Mimi.

47
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,708
(It's good to see you, Mimi.)

48
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:55,878
- Yes.
- Jae Seok.

49
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,348
Our first episode will take place...

50
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,149
in Seongsu-dong, the most trendy place these days.

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,948
Seongsu-dong has always been trendy.

52
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,149
It's a popular place.

53
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,059

(What is today's fake hidden in Seongsu?)

74
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,568
By the way, Eun I...

75
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,608
Right.

76
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,908
She appears in "Problem Child in House" now.

77
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,579
- Really?
- You didn't know?

78
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,279
- Is that why she can't come?
- That's why she can't come.

79
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,949
Come on, Eun I.

80
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,489
The day of the shoot is the same as ours.

81
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,459
It's also aired on the same day.

82
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,118
She had to pick one of the shows.

83
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,659
She didn't really pick.

84
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,128
From Eun I's perspective, she's a regular member on that show.

85
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,129
(She's a regular member on that show.)

86
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,698
- She had to be there.
- Really?

87
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,538
It's unfortunate. We started the show with Eun I.

88
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,568
Right.

89
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:25,998
- Gosh.
- She should be with us.

90
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,869
Someone will replace Eun I.

91
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,808
It was published in articles.

92
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,179
- Right.
- Seok Sam is joining us...

93
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,348
- He's the one.
- Isn't it Seok Jin?

94
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,478
Where's Kyung Pyo?

95
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,578
- Right.
- He sent me a text yesterday.

96
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,818
- Really?
- Yes.

97
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,678
Seok Jin and Kyung Pyo have never met each other.

98
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,218
- Right.
- They're doing something...

99
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,019
- to get to know each other.
- Is that so?

100
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,858
- Where should we go?
- You'll walk there.

101
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,019
Okay, shall we go?

102
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,728
- Jae Seok, the weather is...
- It's so hot.

103
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,199
(They go to meet Sixth Sense members.)

104
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,728
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

105
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,398
- Is it our first time meeting?
- Yes.

106
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,528
We're meeting for the first time.

107
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,298
- I have always been...
- I'm your big fan.

108
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,838
You can feel at ease with me.

109
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,208
- Okay.
- Be at ease.

110
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,679
You look slimmer than you do on-screen.

111
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:07,178
Me? I've been losing weight.

112
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,309
- Right?
- Yes.

113
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,118
I saw you on the show with Tae Hyun.

114
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,579
Back then, you were very chubby.

115
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,648
I'm in the middle of a drama shoot,

116
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,959
so I've been watching my weight.

117
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,228
You joined the show as a new member.

118
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:22,958
I heard that...

119
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,029
you appeared in the season before I was on the show.

120
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,828
- I was on the show once.
- Weren't you on the show twice?

121
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,128
- Wasn't it once?
- I heard that it was twice.

122
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:30,499
Was I on the show twice?

123
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:31,938
- Every time, - I don't remember.

124
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,199
didn't you guess correctly?

125
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,669
(Feeling proud)

126
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,508
There were things that were absurd...

127
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,238
when you think about it logically.

128
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,939
I don't miss the smallest details.

129
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:44,678
There were layers of pork belly and butter.

130
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,979
What did you think about that?

131
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,689
It's totally absurd.

132
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,459
When it's absurd, it's always fake.

133
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,889
But that was real.

134
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:54,989
- Was it real?
- It was real.

135
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,429
(Laughing)

136
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,959
So this is how you do it.

137
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,629
Was that real?

138
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,169
I didn't watch how it ended.

139
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,328
(Here comes someone even more blunt than the blunt ones.)

140
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:03,838
I only watched the process...

141
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,338
(People's comments on articles about Seok Jin joining the show)

142
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,638
Did you sleep well last night?

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,008
Maybe I slept too well.

144
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,138
(What will happen on Sixth Sense: City Tour 2?)

145
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,509
It's beautiful here.

146
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,239
Is this a popular place?

147
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,449
Age under 19 is prohibited.

148
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:16,308
- Isn't age under 19 prohibited?
- "Adults only."

149
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,848
- "Adults only." - "Adults only."

150
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,479
- Only adults can enter.
- Right.

151
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,319
- They must be here.
- Yes.

152
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,388
- It's noisy.
- Right. It must be Mimi.

153
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,519
The one with a pouty mouth.

154
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,359
- I hear people talking.
- Where?

155
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,488
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

156
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:30,798
- Hello.
- Hello.

157
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,398
- Kyung Pyo.
- Hello.

158
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,998
- Live like Ko Kyung Pyo.
- Hello.

- Mimi.
- Live like Ko Kyung Pyo.

160

- Hello.
- Mimi.

161
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,038
- Hello.
- Have you been well?

162
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,039
Yes.

163
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,669
What's the matter?

164
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,008
- What are you trying to nitpick?
- While everyone...

165
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,948
- What's wrong?
- While everyone's dressed normally,

166
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:47,949
why are you...

167
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,878
- What do you mean?
- You look so hip.

168
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,448
What's wrong? Doesn't it look nice?

169
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,818
Why are you saying that I'm not dressed normally?

170
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,388
Your clothes look nice,

171
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,419
but they look like a straw mat on you.

172
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,818
- This is crazy.
- Your outfit is hip.

173
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,128
What? A straw mat?

174
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,358
(Laughing)

175
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,098
- A straw mat?
- There's a zipper too.

176
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,528
Yes, it's a real zipper.

177
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:06,999
- What's wrong with your eyebrows?
- Hey.

178
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,769
How do they look?

179
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,969
Are they drawn terribly?

180
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,268
I don't know what my eyebrows look like.

181
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,269
(Peekaboo)

182
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,439
(As soon as they see a close friend, they tease him endlessly.)

183
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,979
Seok Jin, did you get a tattoo?

184
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,308
No, I got it done at a beauty salon. How do they look?

185
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,149
- How do my eyebrows look?
- Take a look at them.

186
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,619
- Take a look at them.
- Do they look strange?

187
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,148
They look a little dark.

188
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,089
- It's okay. I can remove them.
- They're dark.

189
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,689
I can make them light again.

190
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:32,518
- Don't remove them.
- No.

191
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,828
- Why not?
- It'd make you look strange.

192
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,558
- You look great.
- Sit down.

193
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,358
- Seok Jin.
- What?

194
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,628
You took the available position at perfect timing.

195
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:40,899
I know.

196
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,598
When the position became available...

197
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:44,138
Gosh, I'm so...

198
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,439
How did you feel when you found out that Seok Sam was joining us?

199
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,109
I was surprised.

200
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,878
It's not that I was shocked...

201
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,078
Why were you surprised?

202
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,238
- Tell me.
- So you were surprised.

203
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,648
- Let me hear it 1 by 1.
- Why?

204
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,448
- Seok Jin, you're a veteran to me.
- Right.

205
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,119
I thought, "Sixth Sense must be getting much bigger."

206
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,519
(Laughing reluctantly)

207
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,788
- That's positive.
- Are you saying...

208
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,059
that he's too old for the show?

209
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,859
- How could you say that?
- Isn't that what she means?

210
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,429
It's about to become a regular show.

211
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,198
- A regular show.
- Is that what you thought?

212
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,568
(Sixth Sense must be becoming a regular show.)

213
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,168
- Is that what you thought?
- Yes.

214
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,439
- Seok Jin is on many regular shows.
- Can you understand...

215
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:21,568
- what she's saying?
- Of course.

216
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:22,639
I can understand everything.

217
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,608
I don't know how it happened.

218
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,139
(Quietly)

219
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,879
He took away the spot from many people.

220
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,409
- Gosh, hello.
- Hello.

221
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,418
- Are we starting already?
- We can't be starting.

222
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,648
This is another popular place in Seongsu-dong...

223
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:35,388
- Really?
- for its unique desserts.

224
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,488
Aren't these cigarettes?

225
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,559
- Cigarettes?
- Right.

226
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,688
- I don't smoke.
- I'm not a smoker.

227
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,889
(There's something strange about the ashtray and the cigar.)

228
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,458
- What's this?
- Aren't these cigarettes?

229
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,528
Cigarettes...

230
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,568
- It's an ashtray-shaped tart.
- What?

231
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,699
(The main dish, tart shaped like an ashtray)

232
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,939
(On top of it are meringue sticks shaped like cigarette butts.)

233
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,008
And a financier shaped like a cigar.

234
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,538
- A financier?
- A financier that looks like this?

235
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,709
(Main dish 2, financier shaped like a cigar)

236
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,609
(An adults only dessert set)

237
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,949
- Why the cigarette shape?
- I know.

238
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,849
The theme of our store is...

239
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,088
what adults like. We sell desserts...

240
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,218
that are for adults only.

241
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,418
That's why it said "adults only" on our way in.

242
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,328
- Age under 19 is prohibited.
- "Adults only?" Was it written?

243
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,389
- It was written.
- Only age over 19.

244
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,529
(A popular place for adults only)

245
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,098
A place that sells ice cream for adults only.

246
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,068
(- A cigar of financier. - I love whiskey. I should save it.)

247
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,368
(- Whiskey ice cream is good. - Whiskey gelato is groundbreaking.)

248
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:27,509
(Full of real reviews)

249
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:34,349
(The opening segment starts at a real popular place in Seongsu.)

250
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,909
Are we starting now?

251
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,518
- No, this isn't it.
- No?

252
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,079
Don't be startled.

253
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,888
I came prepared to be surprised. This is surprising.

254
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,958
- Wait, this is also...
- How do we eat this?

255
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,389
- This is a financier.
- Gosh.

256
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,259
I should eat it like this.

257
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,358
(Considering)

258
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,058
That's indirect smoking.

259
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,528
(A dessert filled with adults' desires)

260
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,199
- Shall I eat some ash?
- This is...

261
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,069
I'll try some ash.

262
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,069
(Eating)

263
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,509
It tastes like breadcrumbs.

264
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,039
How do they make this?

265
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:10,079
It's also tasty.

266
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:13,578
(Eyes widening)

267
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,649
- It's good.
- It's really good.

268
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,059
Why would you make the effort...

269
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,059
- This is totally...
- The chef is over there.

270
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,229
(The pastry chef who made an effort to make it)

271
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,229
I'm sorry.

272
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,598
He reminds me of myself in the last season.

273
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,628
- I said it without realizing it.
- That happens often on the show.

274
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:28,899
I said it without realizing it.

275
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,439
It's to get people's attention...

276
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:34,039
- with something unique.
- Right.

277
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,479
Without the cigarette butts, it looks pretty.

278
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,108
Seok Jin is laughing alone.

279
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,908
(He's being scary.)

280
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:41,948
Seok Jin, are you drunk?

281
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:42,949
(What's wrong with him?)

282
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,348
Have you tried this?

283
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,278
- Try this. It's really funny.
- Why are you laughing alone?

284
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,518
Seriously, try this. It's funny.

285
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,049
- Try this, Mimi.
- I will.

286
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:51,919
(Eating)

287
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,259
(Exclaiming)

288
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,699
If it's only shaped like this without tasting good,

289
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,498
- people wouldn't come back.
- Right.

290
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,468
- This is delicious.
- It's good.

291
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,439
- The chocolate is rich.
- That must be why it's popular.

292
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,139
- The chef knows how to bake.
- Goodness.

293
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,209
This is so good.

294
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,339
Seok Jin repeats exactly what Jae Seok said.

295
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,938
(He's saying the same thing.)

296
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,639
He's a parrot on my shoulder.

297
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,609
(His pet, Parrot Seok)

298
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,249
Sometimes, I repeat his words without realizing it.

299
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,889
I was hearing the same thing simultaneously.

300
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:23,688
A parrot?

301
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,859
- He's a parrot on my shoulder.
- Goodness.

302
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,888
Seok Jin is a new member who joined the show.

303
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,528
- A guest is waiting for us.
- Really?

304
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,628
- Really?
- I'll tell you where he is...

305
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,498
- and today's mission theme.
- Okay.

306
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:36,869
Here is today's theme.

307
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,969
Today's theme is Time Machine.

308
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,709
- "Time Machine in Seongsu." - Yes.

309
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,678
(In Seongsu-dong,)

310
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,849
(there's a time machine?)

311
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:51,319
For the future... What's a chef without a heart?

312
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,649
"Present: Built-in sandwich?"

313
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,519
"Past: Feast of a primitive tribe."

314
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,629
(Which one is fake?)

315
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,059
(Time Machine in Seongsu)

316
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,829
(The heart that makes humans breathe)

317
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,399
(Is there a chef without a heart?)

318
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,939
(Is it a chef without emotions like a machine?)

319
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,909
(Or a chef with an artificial heart?)

320
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,279
(There are so many types of sandwiches.)

321
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:23,108
It's a type of sandwich that's popular abroad lately.

322
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,349
(Is there a built-in sandwich?)

323
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,078
(Small enough to carry around)

324
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,789
(Is it a miniature sandwich?)

325
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,349
(Or a sandwich that's built in somewhere?)

326
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,788
(Music and dance)

327
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,529
(Full of food)

328
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,229
(A primitive tribe came to Seongsu.)

329
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:38,829
(They're holding a party.)

330
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,869
(A feast of a primitive tribe)

331
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,799
(Only one of them is fake.)

332
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,908
(What will be the 1st fake in Season 2?)

333
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:51,108
At first glance, the fake one seems to be...

334
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,408
the feast of a primitive tribe.

335
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,779
It's what people at a TV station would typically make.

336
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,779
It's hackneyed.

337
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,449
A primitive tribe?

338
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:02,748
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

339
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:03,749
We have a guest.

340
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,159
You have to go to the meeting place.

341
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,688
- It's a two-minute walk.
- Really?

342
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:07,788
It's nearby.

343
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,029
(Sixth Sense Tour is in full swing.)

344
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,699
In the past, this place...

345
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,268
- I hate talking about this.
- What is it?

346
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,999
A long time ago, when he asked me to invest in this place...

347
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,039
It was someone my junior.

348
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,909
(It was someone my junior.)

349
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,609
If you had invested back then...

350
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,908
Back then...

351
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,038
(I missed it.)

352
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,779
Back then, Seongsu-dong wasn't popular like now.

353
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,049
(Old Seongsu wasn't as busy as it is now.)

354
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,348
This place used to be full of shoe factories.

355
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,258
(In the early 90s, the street was a mecca for handmade shoes.)

356
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,558
- By the way, - Yes?

357
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,129
in the past, there were...

358
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,958
- factories and handmade shoes.
- Exactly.

359
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,059
A place like this.

360
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,898
- Here?
- It used to be a factory.

361
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,199
Handmade shoes?

362
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,939
(A factory that was a rice mill and warehouse in 1970...)

363
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,609
(has now become the most iconic cafe in Seongsu.)

364
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:03,279
(Buildings from that time remain and became diverse cultural spaces.)

365
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,249
If you had invested back then...

366
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,578
Back then...

367
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,419
(The present and the past coexist on the streets in Seongsu-dong.)

368
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,089
Who is today's guest?

369
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,419
I wonder.

370
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,689
(Waiting at the meeting place)

371
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,958
(The guest is nervous.)

372
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,099
(Exhaling)

373
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:20,558
- Where is he?
- Is this the place?

374
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,868
Are we finally meeting him?

375
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:22,928
(Huge anticipation)

376
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:23,929
Hello.

377
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,938
(A few seconds before they meet the guest)

378
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,139
This place is also...

379
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,108
- Who is it?
- Hello.

380
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,209
Hello.

381
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,108
- Who is it? From the back...
- It's a man.

382
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,178
Yes, it's a man.

383
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,208
(Playing dumb)

384
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,148
(Who could it be?)

385
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,148
- Isn't it Jun Young?
- Hello.

386
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,048
(Guest on Episode 1, Lee Jun Young)

387
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,119
- Hello.
- You...

388
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,618
(As Yeong Beom in "When Life Gives You Tangerines...")

389
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:48,659
(he made the viewers laugh and cry.)

390
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,498
(As Geum Seong Je in "Weak Hero Class 2,")

391
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,929
(he made the viewers furious.)

392
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:01,809
(Lee Jun Young, an actor whose popularity skyrocketed)

393
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,368
- Hello.
- Jun Young.

394
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:04,639
- It's been a long time.
- Hello.

395
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,238
- Hello.
- We have a popular star with us.

396
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,378
It's been a long time.

397
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,478
(Welcoming the popular star)

398
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,318
- You're so popular these days.
- Have a seat.

399
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,619
- Sit here.
- Sit down.

400
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:15,489
Why didn't you say anything during the shoot yesterday?

401
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:17,688
I just didn't.

402
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,758
(Really?)

403
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,989
Why are you scolding him?

404
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,029
- Was it bothersome to tell me?
- That's not it.

405
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,929
- I bet the staff told him not to.
- Is that so?

406
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,928
Do you know him well, Kyung Pyo?

407
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,398
Yes, we worked together in a drama called "D.P."

408
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,399
(They both appeared in "D.P.")

409
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,468
That's right.

410
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:34,508
We weren't in a scene together,

411
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,268
but at a dinner party after the shoot,

412
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:37,578
Jun Young was very friendly.

413
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,009
He said hello to me first.

414
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,909
- He approached me.
- Right.

415
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:42,648
After that, we exchanged our phone numbers.

416
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,248
Do you stay in touch?

417
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,048
I haven't called him after the shoot,

418
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:48,219
but I have his phone number.

419
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,048
- As you know...
- They're acquainted.

420
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:51,658
In this line of work,

421
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,288
- that happens often.
- Right.

422
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,528
- Everyone is busy.
- Of course.

423
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,958
- What about you, Mimi?
- Me?

424
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,228
He was a member of U-KISS, so he's a big senior of mine.

425
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,728
- That's right.
- Right.

426
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,268
- So you know him.
- Yes.

427
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,768
(A K-pop senior and junior bow to each other.)

428
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,568
You don't have to bow so low.

429
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,968
Jun Young is...

430
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:08,938
- Is he a shy boy?
- He's a shy boy.

431
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,538
(Shy Jun Young)

432
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:12,879
This is another popular cafe in Seongsu.

433
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,308
This place too?

434
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,948
What's famous at this place?

435
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,109
Do you mean here?

436
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,318
(Located at the heart of Seongsu)

437
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,018
(A stylish trendy spot)

438
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,748
A forest cafe in the middle of the city.

439
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:24,958
With a touch of chic flavor,

440
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,189
it has the ultimate, trendy Berlin vibe.

441
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,088
There must be a special menu here.

442
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,288
Something new...

443
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,858
Something that gets uploaded often...

444
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,058
on social media.

445
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,898
There must be a menu like that.

446
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,769
I bet this place is known for its coffee.

447
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,268
Do you want some coffee?

448
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,369
Yes. Am I right?

449
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,909
Since earlier, Seok Jin has been...

450
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:45,179
pretending to guess.

451
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,309
He's trying to look sharp.

452
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,648
Just wait and see how much I guess correctly.

453
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,519
"Just wait and see how much I guess correctly."

454
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,678
- It's here.
- It's here.

455
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,779
- It's something...
- What's this?

456
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:56,089
What's this?

457
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,359
This is our signature milk bingsu.

458
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,758
(Milk is shaved thin.)

459
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,859
Melon flavor.

460
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,699
Strawberry flavor.

461
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,969
We also have soda flavor.

462
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,638
You can make a mix...

463
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,468
based on your preference.

464
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:15,409
(The signature bingu you sprinkle based on your preference)

465
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,068
You can make a mix...

466
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:18,678
based on your preference.

467
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,009
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

468
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:22,109
She seems familiar.

469
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,278
I heard that she appeared...

470
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,318
- on "You Quiz on the Block." - Is that...

471
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,789
- Isn't that right?
- Really?

472
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,348
Excel.

473
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,388
- Right?
- Yes.

474
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,889
- You were an Excel expert.
- I was on the show.

475
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,489
(She appeared as the deity of Excel on "You Quiz on the Block.")

476
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:41,599
(Sung Hee showed a new world of Excel.)

477
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,068
Why are you here?

478
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,468
I told you last time.

479
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,398
I run a cafe in Seongsu-dong because I'm lonely.

480
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,438
Oh, right.

481
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,008
- Is this the cafe?
- Yes.

482
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,438
- Are you the cafe owner?
- Yes.

483
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,439
So this is the place.

484
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,978
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

485
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,138
It's been five years.

486
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,508
I was wondering if I had met you somewhere.

487
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,518
Instead of approaching normally...

488
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,649
(Guess who I am.)

489
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:01,818
(You know me, right?)

490
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:03,288
You know me, right?

491
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,518
You have to recognize me.

492
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,759
You must recognize me.

493
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:06,918
(It's impossible not to recognize her.)

494
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:07,928
Goodness.

495
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,288
- It's good to see you.
- Likewise.

496
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,058
So this is the place.

497
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,299
I feel so honored.

498
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,999
Could you teach me Excel next time?

499
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:17,129
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

500
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,298
I'd like to...

501
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,998
learn how to use Excel.

502
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,068
- We should ask her to teach us.
- Yes, I should learn.

503
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,138
I can't imagine either of you learning it.

504
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,238
You should learn.

505
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,708
- What's good about knowing...
- What?

506
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:27,709
how to use Excel?

507
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,048
It's just hip.

508
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,619
(It's just hip.)

509
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,789
Excel isn't hip.

510
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,889
- It's not hip at all.
- Yes, it is.

511
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,218
Everyone uses Excel these days.

512
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,618
It's hip when you use Excel without using the mouse.

513
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,359
- Without using the mouse.
- Right? Excel.

514
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,128
- See you later.
- Thank you.

515
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,559
- Thank you for the bingsu.
- See you.

516
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,158
Is this milk bingsu?

517
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,299
What's this?

518
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:49,768
(Exclaiming)

519
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,898
There's something at the bottom.

520
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,139
This is powerful.

521
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,399
Wait a minute.

522
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,569
(Humming)

523
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,279
- It's good.
- It's intense.

524
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,178
(Licking off his fork)

525
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,579
It's tasty.

526
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,278
- It's really good.
- It tastes like cheesecake.

527
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,949
- Right.
- How does it taste like this?

528
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,779
The cafe owner must earn a lot of money.

529
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,989
(Laughing)

530
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,418
It makes you explode with dopamine.

531
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,689
(He loves it.)

532
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,718
The cafe owner...

533
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,128
(He keeps worrying about the cafe owner earning a lot.)

534
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:16,688
She must earn...

535
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:17,959
a lot of revenue from this.

536
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,059
In Seongsu.

537
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,298
(If I had invested back then,)

538
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,169
(would I also be a cafe owner?)

539
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,839
What is today's theme?

540
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,208
Today's theme is Time Machine in Seongsu.

541
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,038
You said it earlier, but...

542
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,078
It's either in the past...

543
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,809
- Future, Present, Past.
- Future, Present.

544
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,049
Future is a chef without a heart.

545
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,508
Here's my guess.

546
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:37,948
A chef without a heart could be...

547
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,848
a restaurant that's run by a machine.

548
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:40,918
(A restaurant that's run by a machine?)

549
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,088
- A chef without a heart?
- Yes.

550
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,789
A place where everything is automated.

551
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,758
- Could it be this?
- What?

552
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,888
In the past,

553
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:48,358
there was a group called 8Eight.

554
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,559
- I know. Without a heart - Without a heart

555
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,498
- What?
- Why not? Right?

556
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,798
- The members stopped being singers.
- No way.

557
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,268
- They became chefs.
- No.

558
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,298
- Why not?
- It's possible.

559
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,568
- Isn't it possible?
- Yes.

560
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,938
- They were 1 woman and 2 men.
- Right.

561
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,338
Now they're no longer singers.

562
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,769
They still sing.

563
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,878
- They could be chefs now.
- They're still singers.

564
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:06,938
"Without a Heart."

565
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,008
- That's amazing.
- Doesn't it sound right?

566
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,748
Isn't it reasonable?

567
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,848
But is it related to the future?

568
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,119
It's their future.

569
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,688
It's their future.

570
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,549
Do you know what each other is talking about?

571
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,119
It's hard to understand what she's saying.

572
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:22,088
- Let's move to the next location.
- Okay.

573
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:23,628
(Stop reasoning and get a move on.)

574
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,259
We're bad at reasoning.

575
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,298
Jae Seok, what are we going to eat?

576
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,898
We're going to the future, the first one.

577
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,399
- Yes.
- Let's go.

578
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,798
- Let's run.
- All right.

579
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,139
(The light turned green. Let's run.)

580
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,039
- Let's go. Ten, nine, eight.
- Let's go.

581
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,008
It's nice to run in the morning.

582
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,179
Right?

583
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,549
(Run, Genie.)

584
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,948
(Jumping with excitement)

585
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,749
- Isn't his jump very low?
- It's low.

586
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:48,818
Isn't this...

587
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,718
how you do it?

588
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,859
- Jun Young, how do I kick?
- Jun Young, please show him.

589
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:53,919
How...

590
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,288
(Light Jun Young)

591
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:56,458
That's right.

592
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,698
- That's how it's done.
- Gosh.

593
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:58,959
- He's light.
- You're light.

594
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,228
I can't do that.

595
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,629
You should be able to do it.

596
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:03,799
You should jump at least this high.

597
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:06,269
Goodness.

598
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,738
- I can't do it.
- When you come down...

599
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,408
- Your landing is...
- I can't do it.

600
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,568
(Take a rest, Genie.)

601
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:11,878
By the way,

602
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,378
it's very difficult...

603
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,978
to figure out which one is fake.

604
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,048
It's hard.

605
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,478
Do you have a sixth sense?

606
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,579
No, I don't.

607
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:22,188
Even when I watch this show,

608
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:23,749
my guesses are mostly wrong.

609
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:25,459
That's a relief.

610
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,188
- Most of them are...
- I don't have a sixth sense either.

611
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:29,758
quite blunt.

612
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,459
- We don't know much.
- Kyung Pyo pretends to be sharp,

613
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,359
but he's wrong all the time.

614
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,398
He's wrong a lot.

615
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,039
Did you hear how he laughed?

616
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,438
(Kyung Pyo)

617
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,638
It's nice to walk around outside after a long time.

618
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,408
- It's nice and cool outside.
- It's great.

619
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,008
This is what Seok Jin must be thinking...

620
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:48,648
while walking in the neighborhood.

621
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:49,948
"Gosh, in the past..."

622
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,048
One of my colleagues suggested buying something here.

623
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,278
I heard him ask Seok Jin.

624
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,548
He said to Seok Jin,

625
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,518
"Would you like to go to Seongsu-dong with me this weekend?"

626
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,758
- Yes, do you remember that?
- I remember.

627
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,018
- Gosh.
- He wanted me to invest with him.

628
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:02,458
- If you had invested with him, - I should have.

629
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,288
- you wouldn't have to work now.
- Exactly.

630
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,599
I'd be traveling and going on cruises with my wife.

631
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:07,998
Going on cruises?

632
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,698
- You wouldn't have to work.
- Gosh.

633
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:11,569
(Dreaming of being rich without working for a moment)

634
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:12,898
Where is...

635
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:14,268
- the future at this place?
- The future...

636
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,509
Where's the future?

637
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,708
Future?

638
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,639
- Where's the future?
- This can't be it.

639
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,908
This can't be it.

640
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:20,909
(Isn't it a construction site?)

641
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,809
- A restaurant without a heart?
- What?

642
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:24,409
What is it?

643
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,249
What is it?

644
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,289
- What's this?
- Isn't this it?

645
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,588
(Hiding next to the construction site)

646
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:32,718
What's this?

647
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,529
(A long alleyway hiding next to the construction site)

648
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,628
What's this?

649
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,098
(At a place like this...)

650
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:44,869
(is the future of Seongsu?)

651
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,798
What's this?

652
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,509
(What's this?)

653
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,209
Wait, is this the place?

654
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,008
It can't be "Without a Heart" by 8Eight.

655
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,708
There's no heart.

656
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,848
It says "coffee, beer, food."

657
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,979
This is the place.

658
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,178
- Bean.
- Is this it?

659
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,319
I think so.

660
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,148
It doesn't look futuristic at all.

661
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:05,219
(It doesn't look futuristic at all.)

662
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,619
- Look. It's the future.
- But...

663
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,058
- It's a robot.
- Really?

664
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,059
This is a robot.

665
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,999
(The future of Seongsu is a robot?)

666
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:16,099
(When you walk along the long alleyway)

667
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,168
It's a robot.

668
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,469
- It's a robot, isn't it?
- Yes.

669
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:24,108
This is something...

670
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,408
that the staff can set up.

671
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,209
It's small enough, isn't it?

672
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,409
(Peekaboo)

673
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:32,849
(Who are you?)

674
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,489
Why doesn't it have a heart?

675
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,048
Because it's a robot.

676
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,018
I can't get used to this.

677
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,889
They definitely told us that it was the future.

678
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,789
- Tofu dishes?
- A tofu course meal.

679
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:47,129
(Hanging prominently at the entrance)

680
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,398
(Tofu course meal)

681
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,069
(Posters of tofu dishes)

682
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,909
(Is the future a tofu restaurant?)

683
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,838
Don't they look so new?

684
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,608
Right. How shall I put it?

685
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:01,578
For a popular restaurant, the posters...

686
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,749
Something is off.

687
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,148
- It has a vibe...
- I think it's fake.

688
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:07,219
Right?

689
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:09,418
This is...

690
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:10,889
(They go inside the restaurant.)

691
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:12,958
I don't think...

692
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,959
it has anything to do with the future.

693
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:16,829
How is this the future?

694
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,629
(Carefully)

695
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:20,158
(How is this place related to the future?)

696
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,399
How is it related to the future?

697
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:28,039
(At first glance)

698
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,468
(It looks like a hip restaurant in Seongsu.)

699
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:31,679
Shall we sit down?

700
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:34,338
Nothing matches with the future so far.

701
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:35,379
Wait.

702
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:38,219
Is it okay to find out in the beginning?

703
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,049
(Laughing)

704
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,418
Seok Jin found the answer already.

705
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,049
- This is...
- What do you mean?

706
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,089
The place lacks one thing.

707
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,389
The heating isn't good.

708
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,358
- Do you mean air conditioning?
- Air conditioning.

709
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,429
Air conditioning.

710
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,428
Why don't you take this off instead?

711
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:55,468
(Why don't you take this off instead?)

712
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,499
(Shaking)

713
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,898
It was built so quickly...

714
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,139
that the air conditioning is lacking.

715
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,598
Am I the only one feeling hot?

716
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,669
- Yes.
- Yes.

717
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:03,609
Take it off.

718
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,509
I feel so much better.

719
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,109
Gosh, I feel so much better.

720
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,878
(Everyone in Seongsu smiles thanks to the oldest feeling hot.)

721
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,608
What is...

722
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:13,218
How is this related to the future?

723
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,888
This restaurant became very popular...

724
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,488
in Seongsu with a very special menu.

725
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,519
Really?

726
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,718
I'll call the restaurant owner.

727
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,789
- Okay.
- Okay.

728
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,129
- Hello.
- Hello.

729
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,389
She looks different from the photo.

730
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,028
(Yoo Hyun Joo, a futuristic restaurant owner?)

731
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,298
- Hello.
- By the way,

732
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,368
we were told that this place has...

733
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,698
- a chef without a heart.
- Yes.

734
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,768
- How so?
- I don't have a heart.

735
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:34,839
- What?
- What?

736
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,538
(Completely unexpected)

737
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:41,679
(A shocking story of the restaurant owner)

738
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,479
I'm just kidding.

739
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,419
You startled me.

740
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,848
(What a relief)

741
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:47,918
She startled me.

742
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,348
You really startled me.

743
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:50,588
(What kind of joke is that?)

744
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,219
I apologize. We use artificial intelligence...

745
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,688
to serve course meals.

746
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:56,788
(AI course meal?)

747
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:57,889
- What?
- What?

748
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,428
- It's on the menu.
- The ingredients are...

749
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,098
- What's on the menu?
- AI course meal.

750
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,429
Reservations are necessary.

751
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:05,839
(Many types of tofu dishes)

752
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,909
On top of other dishes, this is on the menu.

753
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:13,008
Usually, many of our customers are office workers.

754
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,548
We serve the course meal only on weekends.

755
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,348
What is an AI course meal? How does it work?

756
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:22,148
Once you go into the AI booth...

757
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:23,718
(AI booth?)

758
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:26,318
- You can get an InBody scan.
- I see.

759
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,858
After an InBody scan,

760
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,328
you can enter your information.

761
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,858
Then it will take a photo of your face.

762
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,028
Based on the photo of your face,

763
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:36,368
it tells you your health condition.

764
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,668
Based on the result,

765
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,998
AI recommends you...

766
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:42,039
a Korean cuisine course.

767
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,878
Just by looking at your face?

768
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:45,879
(Thinking)

769
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,378
- Based on the result...
- If you lack protein,

770
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,578
- it'll recommend protein.
- Right.

771
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,708
(AI gives recommendations based on our health?)

772
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,148
When hungry customers come here,

773
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,179
won't it be inconvenient to get a health checkup?

774
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,489
But it's only one day.

775
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:59,258
You get a health checkup only once.

776
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,318
Think of it as an event.

777
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,028
- Like going to an omakase.
- Right.

778
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,459
Do you work here part-time?

779
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,599
Your outfit...

780
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,728
Their outfits look similar too.

781
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:10,628
Like an omakase, we have it prepared.

782
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:11,869
She's perfect.

783
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,939
- She's perfect.
- She's perfect.

784
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,508
We'll just pick two of you.

785
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,338
- Okay.
- One who looks the healthiest...

786
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,708
and one who looks the least healthy.

787
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:23,379
Why don't Jun Young and Seok Sam do it?

788
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,019
Is he the healthy one, and am I the unhealthy one?

789
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,919
We're the opposite of each other.

790
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:30,718
(Polar opposites)

791
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,818
- I'm unhealthy.
- No.

792
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,418
- You're obviously the healthy one.
- Seok Jin.

793
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,389
You're also healthy anyway.

794
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:37,288
- I'm not unhealthy.
- You also exercise.

795
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,429
- Yes, I do.
- Try it with Jun Young.

796
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,658
Let's go.

797
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:42,069
I don't know how it will turn out.

798
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,439
This seems a little absurd.

799
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,038
It seems inconvenient.

800
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,768
I can't imagine customers coming here...

801
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:52,078
- Right.
- to do this.

802
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,739
It checks your condition today.

803
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,709
- Gosh.
- What's this?

804
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,218
(The secret door opens.)

805
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,249
- Gosh.
- What's this?

806
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,189
What's this?

807
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:10,659
(The future of Seongsu that was once a mystery)

808
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,398
(Artificial Intelligence robot...)

809
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,869
(and InBody)

810
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,839
(AI course meal)

811
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:23,808
Hello, I run...

812
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,338
an AI course meal restaurant in Seongsu-dong.

813
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:27,609
My name is Yoo Hyun Joo.

814
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,309
What is an AI course meal?

815
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,079
With an InBody machine,

816
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,778
we check BMI, body fat percentage,

817
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,689
visceral fat level, skeletal muscle mass,

818
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,118
and abdominal fat percentage.

819
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,788
(The 1st health assessment with InBody)

820
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,199
Using a tablet for facial recognition,

821
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:47,529
we measure pulse, respiration rate,

822
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,299
heart conditions, and stress levels.

823
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,338
Through a Q and A session with a robot,

824
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,468
your physical condition, health, and potential diseases are...

825
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:57,968
checked for every stage.

826
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:01,009
The health data obtained from these tests are combined...

827
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:04,049
to offer the most suitable menu for the customer.

828
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,248
It's a personalized course meal...

829
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:09,949
based on the customer's health.

830
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,419
The course meal consists of five dishes.

831
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,989
By differing the main ingredient of each dish,

832
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,328
I wanted to evenly distribute the necessary nutrients...

833
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,359
based on the person's health condition.

834
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,539
Knowing that I can take care...

835
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,009
of my customers' health makes me feel proud.

836
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,538
(As a result of the restaurant owner's efforts,)

837
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,309
(it became the talk of the town on social media.)

838
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:34,948
(Comments on social media)

839
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:36,409
(I almost passed out with happiness after my first bite.)

840
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,248
(A new paradigm...)

841
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,949
(that will be the future of Seongsu)

842
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:41,618
(A meeting...)

843
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,489
(of AI and Korean cuisine)

844
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,459
Viewers of Sixth Sense.

845
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:48,928
Is this real?

846
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:51,558
(Viewers of Sixth Sense, is this real?)

847
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,429
How did you start AI course meal?

848
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,598
When the construction started in front of the restaurant,

849
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,669
the few customers I had stopped coming.

850
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,338
It was a chance for me to get more customers,

851
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,108
but it got blocked.

852
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:09,509
(Due to the construction, people rarely came.)

853
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,148
So I wanted to do something special.

854
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:14,679
A part-timer who works here is an engineering student.

855
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,248
He told me about a robot expo...

856
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:19,089
and suggested that I go with him.

857
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,689
At the expo, I saw many things.

858
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:24,258
I found that people in the medical field...

859
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:26,558
used a program like this.

860
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,168
I also thought about using it...

861
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,868
at the restaurant.

862
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,838
So I worked with a robotics company.

863
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,198
- You worked with a company?
- Yes.

864
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,168
(To overcome difficulties,)

865
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:38,409
(was it a collaborative work between the restaurant and an AI company?)

866
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,138
Let's give it a try.

867
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:42,448
- You have to go up barefoot.
- You have to be barefoot.

868
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,178
- Put on these slippers.
- Put on the slippers.

869
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:45,419
- Go, Jun Young.
- Okay.

870
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,848
Here you go, Jun Young.

871
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,119
- Thank you.
- Wait.

872
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,719
Are these too new?

873
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,158
These look new.

874
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,258
(New slippers stand out to Big Nose Conan.)

875
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,029
The soles are a little...

876
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,099
- They're used.
- Yes.

877
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:01,529
Are they used? These are used.

878
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,368
I was wondering if you'd gotten them in a hurry.

879
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,068
Are you sharp?

880
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,639
I'm pretending to be sharp, but it's not working out.

881
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,709
(Laughing)

882
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,439
Stand on it barefoot.

883
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,148
- Stand here and hold these.
- Yes.

884
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,848
Please hold them later.

885
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,219
(Please hold them later.)

886
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,248
- Yes.
- He keeps getting scolded.

887
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:22,818
Why are you scolding me?

888
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,688
- For now...
- Maybe I don't know.

889
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:25,988
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe I don't know.

890
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:27,058
For now...

891
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,358
(They feel bad for him.)

892
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,989
I know how to use it, so I'll help him.

893
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,929
- Your height.
- It's 177cm.

894
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,298
- Isn't it...
- It's 177cm.

895
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,399
- Isn't it more like 175cm?
- It's definitely 177cm.

896
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,138
- Age.
- It's 60.

897
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,238
It's 50...

898
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,539
(Sixty?)

899
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,739
(Fifty)

900
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:46,279
What's wrong with you?

901
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:47,908
My age is 58.

902
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,979
- It's 59. Your birthday...
- You're right. It's 59.

903
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,318
- You can't be 59 forever.
- Hey.

904
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,679
You've been 59 years old for 2 to 3 years.

905
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:56,319
(Laughing)

906
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,058
- I'm 59 years old.
- Why don't you get older?

907
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,119
That's done.

908
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,958
He's a vampire.

909
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,658
He's been 59 since 3 years ago.

910
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:04,859
(His age has remained the same for 3 years.)

911
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,499
(The 59-year-old Seok Jin doesn't mind the attack on his age.)

912
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,199
I've been curious about this.

913
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:15,108
I've been curious about this.

914
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,338
(Zipper on)

915
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,079
(Zipper off)

916
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,339
I've been curious about this.

917
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,779
You can't say anything when you're being measured.

918
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,419
Seok Jin, it's possible to open it.

919
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,149
That's hip.

920
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,118
I didn't expect it to open like this.

921
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,659
I'm jealous.

922
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:35,528
I should wear that next time.

923
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,959
This is nice.

924
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,898
The result comes out right away.

925
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,129
It came out.

926
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,868
(How healthy is 59-year-old Seok Jin?)

927
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,528
(Standing still)

928
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,769
- Seok Jin, the result is out.
- The test is over.

929
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:48,708
Is it out?

930
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,469
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

931
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:51,838
(Welcome to being blunt)

932
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,478
I couldn't talk,

933
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,048
- This time...
- so I was deep in thought.

934
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,249
- Here you go.
- Let's take a look.

935
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,618
I'm not so bad.

936
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,448
(InBody Score: 73 out of 100)

937
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:02,718
My body fat percentage is a bit high.

938
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:03,749
(Except the body fat percentage, the score is good.)

939
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,158
Jun Young.

940
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,389
(What about Jun Young?)

941
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,758
That's nice. He's 185cm tall and 29 years old.

942
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,759
(185cm, 29 years old)

943
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:14,298
(Exclaiming)

944
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,798
- I'm jealous.
- Are you 185cm tall?

945
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,368
He's 185cm tall and 29 years old.

946
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,369
(Embarrassed)

947
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,468
I'm jealous.

948
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,569
Do you want to switch with me? I'll give you all my money.

949
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,269
Goodness.

950
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,378
I don't have much, but let's exchange our bodies.

951
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,578
Don't exchange with him.

952
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,278
- I'd like to exchange with him.
- He bought nothing in Seongsu,

953
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,048
so you shouldn't exchange with him.

954
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,179
That's unfortunate.

955
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:35,149
Jun Young.

956
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,589
What's his score?

957
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,458
- It's 77.
- It's 77.

958
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,918
(InBody Score: 77 out of 100)

959
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,328
Everything about Jun Young is average.

960
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,489
(The perfect balance)

961
00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:44,958
Average.

962
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,228
His body fat percentage is higher than average.

963
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:48,329
(1. After entering InBody information)

964
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:49,829
- Your face.
- My face.

965
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,168
(2. Facial recognition)

966
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:53,999
(Smiling)

967
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,268
You have a very generous smile.

968
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,969
Yes, my image is important.

969
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,509
(Laughing)

970
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:03,409
Please wait until the result comes out.

971
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,748
(Pulse, respiration rate, stress level...)

972
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:08,379
It tells you your pulse and stress level.

973
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:10,788
- Please be quiet for a moment.
- Okay.

974
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,018
Please talk to the robot.

975
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,159
- With this?
- Yes.

976
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,258
(3. Q and A with the robot)

977
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,289
Hello.

978
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,598
(Information that's impossible to measure is...)

979
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,429
(obtained through a conversation.)

980
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,168
- Say something.
- Hello.

981
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,698
- It's nice to meet you.
- Okay.

982
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,598
I'm the AI course meal assistant,

983
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,899
Romi.

984
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,138
(By getting info that's impossible to measure through a conversation,)

985
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,869
(it recommends the final menu for the course meal.)

986
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,178
Do you have any conditions...

987
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,279
like diabetes, high blood pressure, or low blood pressure?

988
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,278
Diabetes, high blood pressure, and low blood pressure.

989
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,548
I have none of those.

990
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:42,889
Now, could you tell me how tired you are at the moment?

991
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,019
Actually, I'm in good condition.

992
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:47,588
I'm not tired.

993
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:49,828
(The 59-year-old Seok Jin is still energetic.)

994
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,999
He keeps pretending that he's completely fine.

995
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,358
You are not tired.

996
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,498
It sounds like Romi is teasing him.

997
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,698
(Laughing)

998
00:33:56,699 --> 00:34:00,738
Is there anything you want to add to the chef?

999
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,438
Actually, I've been tired lately.

1000
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:05,279
You just said that you weren't tired.

1001
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,409
I will take that into account and summarize.

1002
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,149
First, you are not allergic to anything.

1003
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:13,978
Second, you don't have conditions...

1004
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,718
such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or low blood pressure.

1005
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,148
- No.
- Third,

1006
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:18,759
you're slightly tired these days.

1007
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,218
In a few moment, on the tablet next to you,

1008
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,588
you will see the recommended menu.

1009
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,528
- Okay.
- I'll end the conversation.

1010
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,099
After thinking a lot about it,

1011
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,729
even though it requires a reservation...

1012
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,228
It doesn't seem efficient.

1013
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:32,469
- Exactly.
- I mean...

1014
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,339
- It might be bothersome, - People wouldn't do this.

1015
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,708
but it's a good way to check your health...

1016
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,008
and know what food you should eat.

1017
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,478
- Of course.
- It provides that information.

1018
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,178
- You see...
- She has a point.

1019
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,809
We live in an age of wellness.

1020
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,778
- I'd choose to come here.
- Of course.

1021
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:46,979
I focus a lot on my health.

1022
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,449
(Is it real? A custom course meal that focuses on wellness?)

1023
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:54,288
First of all, are you allergic to anything?

1024
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,389
No.

1025
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:58,928
- Cut that acting tone.
- "No."

1026
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,028
(Don't channel Yeong Beom.)

1027
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:01,898
Do you feel tired?

1028
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,229
I'm a little tired.

1029
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,439
He's an honest young man.

1030
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:08,439
Meanwhile, Seok Jin lied.

1031
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:11,238
- His is ready.
- Is it?

1032
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,178
He'll be served a custom course meal.

1033
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,708
I see it shows right here.

1034
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,208
Go ahead and tap "done."

1035
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:17,778
Tofu avocado...

1036
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:19,648
Was this meal recommended by an AI?

1037
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:20,679
(A recommended meal based on the nutrients he lacks)

1038
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:25,188
- There's a receipt.
- Here you go.

1039
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,488
Why you must eat this meal...

1040
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:27,889
- is thoroughly explained.
- Here's everything.

1041
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,589
(Protein, healthy fats, invigorating, vitamins...)

1042
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,858
If only I could eat like this at home.

1043
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:35,669
(A Korean course meal tailored to Seok Jin's health profile)

1044
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,769
This is fascinating.

1045
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:39,968
How is this not fascinating?

1046
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,939
(What was recommended for the slightly tired Jun Young?)

1047
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,539
(Jun Young's meal is mainly high in protein.)

1048
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,909
- From someone who's done this, - That's so weird.

1049
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:49,308
it is bothersome in some way.

1050
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:51,379
But it's a selling point that will keep attracting customers.

1051
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,548
This place seems a bit forced.

1052
00:35:55,549 --> 00:35:56,619
(Does the AI-designed Korean course meal really exist?)

1053
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,588
- What now? We got something.
- It's bothersome.

1054
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:00,788
- We got something.
- What is it?

1055
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,789
- We have something from Robean.
- Yes, Robean.

1056
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:07,229
(A new AI robot?)

1057
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:08,999
Why is this here?

1058
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,728
We can talk to it.

1059
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:11,869
Robean?

1060
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,599
(Talking to a robot?)

1061
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,509
Robean, recommend a tasty dish.

1062
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,408
- You turned it off.
- You killed it.

1063
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:21,839
You turned off its heart.

1064
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:26,819
(Robean was a good robot.)

1065
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,178
Did it get turned off?

1066
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:29,318
- It did. Mimi turned it off.
- It got turned off.

1067
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,949
Allow me to help.

1068
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,388
- Did you press the heart button?
- She did.

1069
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:37,559
Pressing that button sends him into eternal sleep,

1070
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,198
- so I'll turn him back on.
- Eternal sleep?

1071
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,328
- Eternal sleep?
- Are you the engineering student...

1072
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:42,868
the owner mentioned?

1073
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,969
That's right.

1074
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:45,228
He's that engineering student.

1075
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:47,738
Is everything she said true?

1076
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,509
- Of course it is.
- I see.

1077
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:53,638
Can I ask what you majored in?

1078
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,179
Computer science.

1079
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,878
Do you create programs?

1080
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,618
- Yes, I do.
- You do.

1081
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:01,219
Lucky you.

1082
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:04,148
- From here on out...
- I envy people who studied that.

1083
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:06,088
You must be interested in AI at the moment.

1084
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:07,789
It's such a hot topic these days,

1085
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:09,988
- so of course.
- You have a bright future ahead.

1086
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:13,458
Why don't I show you how to talk to Robean?

1087
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,628
This is how you talk to him.

1088
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:17,569
Robean, can you introduce yourself?

1089
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,838
- Say your name and talk to it.
- Hi, I'm Robean.

1090
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,168
- It'll answer you.
- I'm a cute and cheerful robot.

1091
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:23,508
(You can call Robean and talk to it.)

1092
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:24,509
Robean.

1093
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,508
Tell me about Jee Seok Jin.

1094
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:31,249
Jee Seok Jin is widely loved as an entertainer.

1095
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,349
Liar.

1096
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:36,348
(Robean, you liar.)

1097
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:39,588
Who are you calling a liar? Look how smart it is.

1098
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:40,689
This place is for real.

1099
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:42,188
- It's a liar.
- This place exists!

1100
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:43,258
- It's fake.
- What a smart robot.

1101
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,328
- This place is real.
- It's a liar.

1102
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,529
This place is for real.

1103
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,059
- What a liar.
- It's a smart robot.

1104
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,399
It has the correct sources.

1105
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:50,228
- This place is real, Jun Young.
- What?

1106
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,429
It only tells the truth.

1107
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,639
- Here we go.
- Here's your appetizer.

1108
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:56,968
- Thank you.
- What's our appetizer?

1109
00:37:56,969 --> 00:37:59,139
This is sweet potato tofu soup.

1110
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,879
Sweet potato and tofu were blended and then cooked.

1111
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:07,019
(An appetizer to awaken their palates)

1112
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,848
The idea of this is already healthy.

1113
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:11,988
(Sweet potato tofu soup, AI-recommended appetizer)

1114
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,558
(Stirring)

1115
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,219
- You shouldn't stir.
- What?

1116
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,958
(He already stirred his.)

1117
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,388
- Just scoop it up as is.
- Really?

1118
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:20,398
- Without disturbing the cream.
- I stirred mine.

1119
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,559
(Another one who stirred his)

1120
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:23,168
We're getting scolded by her a lot today.

1121
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:24,269
(His hand has lost its purpose.)

1122
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,839
(He stirred it the second he received his.)

1123
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,739
(Oh no...)

1124
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:34,579
- Please enjoy.
- I'll enjoy it.

1125
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:42,788
- It's really good.
- It tastes healthy.

1126
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:44,388
- It's good.
- This is good.

1127
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,389
(It's good even stirred.)

1128
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,759
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

1129
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:48,688
- Isn't it tasty?
- It's good.

1130
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:49,789
It's delicious.

1131
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,759
I'd love to come here...

1132
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:56,029
since I always look for restaurants that serve healthy food.

1133
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,398
They promote healthy cuisine.

1134
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:03,508
(A warm meal that promotes good health)

1135
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,509
(Pondering)

1136
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,409
Earlier, I carefully looked at the photos over there.

1137
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,349
Many have already eaten here.

1138
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,218
Before I opened my restaurant here,

1139
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,048
I ran a rice cup place outside...

1140
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,548
the School of Performing Arts Seoul.

1141
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:19,419
- Are they the students?
- The students from back then...

1142
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,018
- came by.
- Did they come here to eat?

1143
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:23,729
I put up the photos after opening my restaurant here.

1144
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:27,159
She said she ran a rice cup place,

1145
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:30,628
but the photos weren't taken there...

1146
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:31,729
but here.

1147
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,539
(Were the photos taken at this restaurant?)

1148
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,939
- She said they came here to eat.
- They came by.

1149
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,509
They came by.

1150
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,778
(Laughing)

1151
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:47,619
Kyung Pyo, you're dense, aren't you?

1152
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,788
(Laughing)

1153
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,949
- Is that so?
- You're quite dense.

1154
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:55,159
I bet you thought you were clever.

1155
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,659
(Embarrassed)

1156
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:58,999
Here we go.

1157
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,828
- This is it. Goldongmyeon.
- This looks tasty!

1158
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:02,869
That's right.

1159
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:04,368
This looks tasty!

1160
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,739
(Eyes wide)

1161
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:07,898
- What's that?
- It's a bibim noodle dish...

1162
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:09,038
enjoyed by the royal family.

1163
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,139
(Goldongmyeon enjoyed by the royal family)

1164
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:14,279
"Goldong" means a mixture of ingredients.

1165
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:18,049
Buckwheat noodles rich in fiber, which is healthy for the gut,

1166
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,449
are topped with beef and bracken that boost the immune system,

1167
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:23,518
as well as bamboo shoots rich in potassium...

1168
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,249
that help regulate blood pressure.

1169
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:29,389
(Goldongmyeon: Seok Jin's course, a royal favorite)

1170
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,029
I'm really excited for this.

1171
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:45,169
(No way...)

1172
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:46,809
This is incredible.

1173
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:48,379
Try some.

1174
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:52,579
- It's really good.
- Isn't it incredible?

1175
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,979
(He absolutely lives for noodles.)

1176
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:57,489
Isn't it amazing?

1177
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,989
The goldongmyeon is so good. No way.

1178
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:04,629
- A seasoned chef made this.
- The food was made by a real chef.

1179
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,158
Everyone focuses...

1180
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,358
- on wellness these days.
- Exactly.

1181
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,658
- That's why.
- I know.

1182
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:10,668
That's why this restaurant could exist.

1183
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,128
(Just right for Seok Jin, who needed a pick-me-up)

1184
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:13,869
(First course: Goldongmyeon)

1185
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:15,269
- Jun Young.
- Yes?

1186
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,009
Aren't you crazy about noodles?

1187
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,509
- How did you know that?
- You're known for that.

1188
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,208
I know all about you. I've been watching you from afar.

1189
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:22,609
(What's the first dish for noodle-lover Jun Young?)

1190
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:25,348
Perilla oil, rich in unsaturated fat...

1191
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,619
that nourishes the body,

1192
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,788
topped with dried laver that's good for bone and gut health.

1193
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,459
(Even laver, rich in iodine, calcium, and fiber)

1194
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:36,129
(Perilla oil noodles: Jun Young's Korean cuisine course)

1195
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:37,829
These two dishes are different.

1196
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,159
How is it?

1197
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:40,929
How is it?

1198
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:42,928
It tastes like it was...

1199
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,098
- mass produced.
- Really?

1200
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,128
It feels that way.

1201
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:47,669
- That's what you love, Jae Seok.
- He didn't waste any time.

1202
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:52,008
- He's already sold on it.
- You'd definitely love this.

1203
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,139
Would I?

1204
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,508
- Let's see.
- It's so good.

1205
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:55,949
- Was a flavor enhancer added?
- Try it.

1206
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:57,749
It's like perilla oil makguksu.

1207
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,319
(The frown of truth)

1208
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,819
I absolutely enjoy food that tastes mass produced.

1209
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:11,658
Mass-produced food from big companies...

1210
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,229
hits the right taste buds.

1211
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:16,429
It's perfect.

1212
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,969
(Can you taste success in the perilla oil noodles?)

1213
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,538
It's really good.

(Sniffing)

1215
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,838
The perilla oil smells great.

1216
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,639
(The aroma of perilla oil tickles the tip of his nose.)

1217
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:31,848
- It's so good.
- Isn't this amazing?

1218
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:32,849
- It is.
- I told you it was good.

1219
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,879
(Eyes wide)

1220
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,519
(Is he stunned?)

1221
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:38,249
Perilla oil noodles,

1222
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:40,318
if not done properly,

1223
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,858
- will be greasy and heavy.
- Exactly.

1224
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:42,889
That's not the case.

1225
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,388
If this is actually served here, I'd come again often.

1226
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:46,398
(Tasty and healthy perilla oil noodles)

1227
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,399
(Jun Young's first Korean cuisine course)

1228
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,168
This is the best version of this dish I've had.

1229
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:52,128
This was made by someone who has cooked for years.

1230
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:53,239
Absolutely.

1231
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:54,838
Next...

1232
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,108
(Pulling out his paper)

1233
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:57,508
(He marches to a different beat.)

1234
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:58,768
Try to guess if this place is real or not.

1235
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:00,278
You keep going back to look at the receipt.

1236
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:01,839
- I know.
- You can't help it.

1237
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:03,809
This place is entertaining.

1238
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:05,349
- It's good.
- I like it.

1239
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:06,948
I'm gradually being drawn in.

1240
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:07,949
(Captivating the Sixth Sense members even more)

1241
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,979
What's that?

1242
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,419
It's boiled pork.

1243
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:13,989
(Second course: Boiled pork)

1244
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,388
Pork, rich in protein and vitamin B1,

1245
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,599
helps with muscle growth and boosts energy.

1246
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:23,469
It's served with tofu that helps with weight loss.

1247
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,168
(Boiled pork, Seok Jin's second Korean cuisine course)

1248
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,339
That looks really good.

1249
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:28,999
- Check out the color.
- Check out the color.

1250
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:31,169
This... You know the cut.

1251
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:32,879
This is blade-end fatback.

1252
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,039
It's a cut I enjoy.

1253
00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:38,709
How did it know? Was it the AI?

1254
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,419
Check this out.

1255
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,918
- How did it know I liked this cut?
- It matched your tastes.

1256
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:44,988
- Like this.
- Hold on.

1257
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,119
Can we have some?

1258
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:48,259
- What?
- Check out his grip.

1259
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,589
- What?
- Check out his grip.

1260
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:52,699
(Gripping hard)

1261
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:55,729
You know, I...

1262
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,369
- You know me.
- "All mine!"

1263
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,939
This was served just for me.

1264
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,108
Still, since you asked with such aggression...

1265
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,709
- What can I do but share?
- He's right!

1266
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,308
(We'll share even the smallest amount.)

1267
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:09,408
He's right.

1268
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:10,679
With the tofu.

1269
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,309
No way.

1270
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,749
Look at this.

1271
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,679
How sweet of a combo is that?

1272
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:18,549
That looks really good.

1273
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,489
That's really good.

1274
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:23,359
- Is the kimchi good?
- It's delicious.

1275
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,999
I think they made the kimchi here.

1276
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:28,729
The kimchi's incredible.

1277
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,398
(The kimchi they made is very savory with the special sauce.)

1278
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:33,299
This is so delicious.

1279
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:35,698
The food here is amazing.

1280
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:37,639
Their food is incredible.

1281
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:39,008
It's quite interesting.

1282
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,678
Rather than meat,

1283
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,478
- fish...
- Do you prefer fish?

1284
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,349
- I prefer fish. Yes.
- You prefer fish?

1285
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,218
Grill salmon which is rich in...

1286
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:48,949
omega-three and protein.

1287
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,788
And make the sauce with mushrooms,

1288
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,389
which are good for your intestines.

1289
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:56,088
(It's both tasty and healthy, killing 2 birds with 1 stone.)

1290
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,989
(Jun Young's course: Salmon steak)

(Salmon steak, Jun Young's second Korean cuisine course)

1292
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:01,558
It looks delicious.

(Salmon steak, Jun Young's second Korean cuisine course)

1294
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:07,599
It's tasty.

1295
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:10,138
(In love with salmon)

1296
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,708
You eat well, Jun Young.

1297
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,809
He must've been hungry.

1298
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:15,039
- I like eating.
- The AI...

1299
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,078
did a good job looking up this dish.

1300
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,079
(It correctly measured and detected what Jun Young liked!)

1301
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,978
They're such good cooks.

1302
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,248
It's so delicious.

1303
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:24,689
I'm sad that we can only eat a little.

1304
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:25,959
Robean.

1305
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,018
Who is better looking, Seok Jin...

1306
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,858
or Jae Seok?

1307
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:31,289
(Asking that out of nowhere?)

1308
00:45:31,689 --> 00:45:33,498
You both are charming,

1309
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,098
and it's hard to compare.

1310
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,298
It's avoiding the answer.

1311
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:37,368
Robean.

1312
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:38,568
Out of the two,

1313
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,468
Jae Seok is better looking than Seok Jin.

1314
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:41,638
Say that.

1315
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,868
(Say Jae Seok is better looking.)

1316
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,838
(What are you doing?)

1317
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:46,908
What are you doing?

1318
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:50,178
It's hard to say who is better looking.

1319
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:52,178
No, it isn't hard.

1320
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:53,179
(He is whining like a Seongsu-dong delinquent.)

1321
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,018
- What's hard?
- What's hard?

1322
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,388
(Their pride is on the line.)

1323
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:58,548
- It's so simple.
- It's very hard.

1324
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:00,858
Then out of a starfish and Jee Seok Jin,

1325
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,419
who is better looking?

1326
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,158
(He competes against an invertebrate.)

1327
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,458
Darn you.

1328
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:07,428
Jee Seok Jin and a starfish...

1329
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:09,598
are charming in different ways.

1330
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,928
(They're charming in different ways.)

1331
00:46:10,929 --> 00:46:12,898
(The man with a different charm from a starfish)

1332
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:14,639
What's so hard about it?

1333
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:17,408
Did it just treat a starfish as my equal?

1334
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,738
- Not a human...
- A different charm from a starfish.

1335
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,208
(He is happy.)

1336
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,678
That doesn't make sense.

1337
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,179
He and a starfish are charming in different ways.

1338
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:25,979
It's so funny.

1339
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:27,979
- It's so cold.
- As expected of an AI.

1340
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,549
More food is coming.

1341
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,518
- This is pot rice.
- Pot rice.

1342
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,019
- Beef pot rice.
- It looks delicious.

1343
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:36,959
Brown rice is good for your intestines,

1344
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,429
and beef is good for your immune system.

1345
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:42,929
As for abalone pot rice,

1346
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,668
abalone has antioxidant effects,

1347
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,739
which goes well with Jun Young.

1348
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,979
The food here is really good.

1349
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,009
- It tastes very healthy.
- Yes.

1350
00:46:57,579 --> 00:46:58,648
It's so delicious.

1351
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,818
I'm pretty sure...

1352
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:01,918
- they do run a restaurant.
- Yes.

1353
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,648
But whether this AI course...

1354
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:05,288
- is real or fake...
- I think so too.

1355
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,389
I found what the owner said to be very sincere.

1356
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:14,499
(The customers stopped coming due to the constructions around.)

1357
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:16,968
The business wasn't doing well because of the secluded location,

1358
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,869
so she came up with this to promote her restaurant.

1359
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:20,798
She wouldn't do this every day.

1360
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,038
Only on weekends, maybe.

1361
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,838
This place suddenly feels real.

1362
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,208
- Why?
- I suddenly have the feeling too.

1363
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,239
Just because.

1364
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,678

1365

00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:32,678
It's fake here, right?

(Robean, this restaurant is fake, right?)

1368
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:35,119
I was thinking of doing that too.

1369
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,949
Is this restaurant fake?

1370
00:47:38,206 --> 00:47:39,275
It's fake here, right?

Is this restaurant fake?

1374
00:47:43,546 --> 00:47:44,615
It isn't.

1375
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:45,986
It's a real restaurant.

1376
00:47:46,316 --> 00:47:48,915
It's a Korean cuisine course menu restaurant...

1377
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:50,256

- input this in advance.
- They could've.

1383
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:06,735
They could've.

1384
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:07,936
They could've.

(They head to the second "present.")

1392
00:48:18,346 --> 00:48:20,355
- The restaurants are opening now.
- Exactly.

1393
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,055
That looks good too. A French toast.

1394
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:23,956
The French toast looks delicious.

1395
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,555
- It looks delicious.
- The owners look cool too.

1396
00:48:26,556 --> 00:48:28,025
They are...

1397
00:48:28,026 --> 00:48:29,325
- She's so cool.
- Her outfit.

1398
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:30,725
- Her fashion...
- It sure is cool, isn't it?

1399
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:31,825
- Yes.
- They're different.

1400
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,865
- They're different.
- They wear...

1401
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:34,935
- a flannel vest when it's hot.
- Exactly.

1402
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:35,936
They're different.

1403

- It startled me.
- Be careful.

1407
00:48:44,706 --> 00:48:46,045
Look where you're going, old man.

1408
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:47,515
What was that about? It wasn't dangerous.

1409
00:48:47,516 --> 00:48:49,215
- What?
- Be careful.

1410
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:50,245
- He...
- It's all the way there.

1411
00:48:50,246 --> 00:48:51,246
Old man.

1412
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:52,385
- Look where you're going.
- Who are you calling...

1413
00:48:52,386 --> 00:48:53,555
an old man, old man?

1414
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,856
Your feet...

1415
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:57,186
You stumbled like ten times.

1416
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,326
"My gosh."

1417
00:48:59,996 --> 00:49:00,996
(Bursting out laughing)

1418
00:49:00,997 --> 00:49:02,726
I thought you were tap dancing.

1419
00:49:03,596 --> 00:49:06,195
(Cute tap dancing)

1420
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,496
Jun Young, you're laughing so loud.

1421
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:10,406
Was there fire under your feet?

1422
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:11,766
"My gosh."

1423
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:13,075
Was that the dance competition?

1424
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:14,275
- That's right.
- That was the dance competition.

1425
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:15,405
Dance competition.

1426
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:17,175
(Look forward to his participation in a dance competition.)

1427
00:49:17,176 --> 00:49:19,005
This place is popular in Seongsu.

1428
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:21,146
They make T-shirts out of photos you take in the photo booth.

1429
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:24,285
Yes, I know this.

1430
00:49:24,286 --> 00:49:25,545
They make T-shirts out of photos...

1431
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,115
- you take in the photo booth.
- They print them on the spot.

1432
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:28,385
Shall we make group T-shirts?

1433
00:49:28,386 --> 00:49:29,386
- Yes.
- Let's make group T-shirts.

1434
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:30,756
I hate it.

1435
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:31,985
Why?

1436
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:33,395
What's bad about group T-shirts?

1437
00:49:33,396 --> 00:49:34,525
I hate it.

1438
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:36,795
(Impressed)

1439
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:37,966
It's nice.

1440
00:49:37,996 --> 00:49:39,325
It's so nice.

1441
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:40,996
(A customization store)

1442
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:42,635
You want to make something like that?

1443
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:44,006
(You make your own merchandise as you like.)

1444
00:49:44,906 --> 00:49:46,906
You can make your own T-shirt.

1445
00:49:47,676 --> 00:49:49,505
Since Jae Seok hates it, let's make one.

1446
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:50,946
Yes, let's use this chance to make one.

1447
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:52,705
- Shall we?
- Let's make one.

1448
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:55,016
When else can we not, can we make it?

1449
00:49:55,146 --> 00:49:57,546
We need to make it now since Jae Seok doesn't like it.

1450
00:49:57,616 --> 00:50:00,156
- But I really...
- Yes.

1451
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:02,826
Honestly speaking...

1452
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:04,985
- Why?
- Do you really like it?

1453
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:06,555
Do you like making T-shirts with your face printed on them?

1454
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:07,995
How do you personally find it?

1455
00:50:07,996 --> 00:50:10,895
- I have one at home.
- I...

1456
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:12,196
I have one at home. I made it.

1457
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:14,035
- With your face?
- Yes.

1458
00:50:14,036 --> 00:50:15,366
Really?

1459
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:17,165
- What about you, Mimi?
- I don't do it.

1460
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,065
I've never thought that I wanted to do it.

1461
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:20,736
- What about you, Jun Young?
- Me neither.

1462
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:23,206
Now is the chance.

1463
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:24,875
Then let us...

1464
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:27,016
- make one.
- Yes, let's do it.

1465
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:28,545
- I'll be at the bottom.
- You come here.

1466
00:50:28,546 --> 00:50:29,586
Yes, like that.

1467
00:50:29,716 --> 00:50:30,716
Here we go.

1468
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,085
- Is it taking?
- No.

1469
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:33,715
- It's taking.
- It's taking.

1470
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:36,015
Seven, six, five.

1471
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,086
It's taking.

1472
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:39,355
Scan the QR code.

1473
00:50:39,356 --> 00:50:41,056
- It's complicated.
- It's complicated.

1474
00:50:41,256 --> 00:50:42,655
(They fail to hold back their laughter.)

1475
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:44,565
I thought things would get simpler in the Future Society,

1476
00:50:44,566 --> 00:50:46,336
but things seem to get more complicated.

1477
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:47,766
It's not my cup of tea.

1478
00:50:48,096 --> 00:50:49,436
I'll try.

1479
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:50,766
Our dear elders...

1480
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,976
It's difficult.

1481
00:50:53,406 --> 00:50:55,105
Come here.

1482
00:50:55,106 --> 00:50:56,205
Unisex.

1483
00:50:56,206 --> 00:50:57,875
Since it's fall now, let's get long-sleeved T-shirts.

1484
00:50:57,876 --> 00:50:59,375
- Shall I select long sleeves?
- Yes.

1485
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:00,516
Long sleeves and...

1486
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:02,345
Just make one.

1487
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:03,415
- One.
- Why?

1488
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,585
- We should get five.
- Give it to Jun Young.

1489
00:51:04,586 --> 00:51:06,045
I'm fine without it. Just print three.

1490
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:07,916
- Print four.
- No, I'm fine without it.

1491
00:51:08,156 --> 00:51:09,355
Why do you all refuse to get it?

1492
00:51:09,356 --> 00:51:10,955
- I...
- I'll take them then.

1493
00:51:10,956 --> 00:51:12,656
- I'll take them.
- You will?

1494
00:51:12,756 --> 00:51:13,856
- No?
- Will you take it?

1495
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:15,055
Kyung Pyo likes stuff like this.

1496
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:16,265
- I like it.
- Yes.

1497
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:17,666
- Then just get two.
- Okay.

1498
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:19,395
Mimi, get five.

1499
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:20,495
(Mimi, get 5.)

1500
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:21,666
No.

1501
00:51:21,836 --> 00:51:23,606
- No, don't get five.
- Five... Goodness.

1502
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:25,235
- No, matching...
- No.

1503
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:27,436
I want to wear a matching T-shirt with you guys.

1504
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:28,905
You won't... Goodness.

1505
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:30,005
You won't end up wearing it anyway.

1506
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:31,505
(You won't end up wearing it anyway.)

1507
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,016
Please wear it.

1508
00:51:33,576 --> 00:51:35,075
- No, this...
- Our penalty.

1509
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:36,586
- As a penalty, wear this...
- I think...

1510
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:39,386
Wear this and take a picture.

1511
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:41,286
- That sounds like a great idea.
- My goodness.

1512
00:51:41,356 --> 00:51:43,185
(They get the penalty T-shirts.)

1513
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,585
The T-shirts will take some time to print,

1514
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:45,985
so we'll deliver it to the next location when ready.

1515
00:51:45,986 --> 00:51:47,255
(Let's go to the second popular place.)

1516
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:49,195
- The next place is...
- It's a bit...

1517
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:50,865
- For Present...
- Yes.

1518
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,725
is built-in sandwich. What's this now?

1519
00:51:52,726 --> 00:51:53,865
Built-in sandwich?

1520
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:55,465
- In as in innards?
- They add innards to it?

1521
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:56,666
Built-in?

1522
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:58,866
A sandwich with innards doesn't sound nice.

1523
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:03,505
(Located next to an apartment complex)

1524
00:52:03,506 --> 00:52:04,905
(Past, Present, Future)

1525
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:06,576
(The second location of the time travel)

1526
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:08,416
- What's this?
- "The first sandwich..."

1527
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:09,686
It's the first?

1528
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,486
What? The first?

1529
00:52:12,386 --> 00:52:15,155
(In the banner in front of the shop)

1530
00:52:15,156 --> 00:52:16,625
(The promotional slogan catches their attention.)

1531
00:52:16,626 --> 00:52:17,925
(The first shop in Korea to specialize in sandwiches)

1532
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,226
"The first shop in Korea to specialize in sandwiches?"

1533
00:52:21,296 --> 00:52:22,496
- It can't be.
- The first?

1534
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:24,926
The owner is too young for that.

1535
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:26,225
"The first shop in Korea."

1536
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,435
(The owner looks too young to be the first to open the shop.)

1537
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:29,295
- Shall we go in?
- Yes.

1538
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,505
It's cool.

1539
00:52:30,506 --> 00:52:31,965
(Shall we go in?)

1540
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:35,976
(They enter the shop with their suspicions.)

1541
00:52:36,376 --> 00:52:37,445
This place also...

1542
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,876
Why does it look so fake?

1543
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:40,845
- Hey.
- It looks so fake.

1544
00:52:40,846 --> 00:52:42,116
It looks so fake.

1545
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:49,255
(It looks normal, though?)

1546
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:50,525
(A poster of the owner's face in a sandwich shop?)

1547
00:52:50,526 --> 00:52:52,886
- It looks so fake.
- It looks so fake.

1548
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:55,795
Could they have exaggerated...

1549
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:56,866
(The owner's face on the mural too)

1550
00:52:57,326 --> 00:52:59,266
There are vinyl records too.

1551
00:52:59,866 --> 00:53:01,165
(Old vinyl records in the shop which represents Present?)

1552
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:03,505
The songs are from my generation.

1553
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:05,206
(Time machine in Seongsu)

1554
00:53:05,236 --> 00:53:06,506
- This at the back.
- This is...

1555
00:53:06,906 --> 00:53:08,976
- Matteo Kim.
- Come on.

1556
00:53:09,706 --> 00:53:11,575
Why did they put it up like this?

1557
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:12,806
(The owner's profile is put up on the wall as well!)

1558
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:14,575
- It looks too fake.
- It's way too fake.

1559
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:15,676
Is everything fake?

1560
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:18,016
Seriously.

1561
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,585
He was born in 1982?

1562
00:53:20,586 --> 00:53:21,856
No way.

1563
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:23,555
He was born in 1982?

1564
00:53:23,556 --> 00:53:25,525
(Flustered and surprised)

1565
00:53:25,526 --> 00:53:27,526
His nationality is Korean.

1566
00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:31,896
(From his birth to his religion)

1567
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:36,536
(Even the records of his childhood)

1568
00:53:36,806 --> 00:53:39,935
(A profile with too much information about his personal life)

1569
00:53:39,936 --> 00:53:41,435
It even states his MBTI.

1570
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:42,636
(Religion: Catholic, MBTI: ENTJ)

1571
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:45,005
He is ENTJ. He must be nasty.

1572
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:46,376
He looks like an emotional person.

1573
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:47,945
Emotional.

1574
00:53:47,946 --> 00:53:49,785
How can he be a thinker with this face?

1575
00:53:49,786 --> 00:53:50,916
(His face doesn't look like that of someone without emotions.)

1576
00:53:51,116 --> 00:53:52,846
(Rubbing)

1577
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:55,986
- The paper feels too new.
- Exactly.

1578
00:53:56,886 --> 00:53:58,385
I can't tell.

1579
00:53:58,386 --> 00:54:00,396
(The poster looks very clean as if it was made recently.)

1580
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:02,456
Why is this a built-in sandwich?

1581
00:54:02,796 --> 00:54:04,125
- Why built-in?
- I wonder why.

1582
00:54:04,126 --> 00:54:05,366
(World's first built-in sandwich is full of mysteries.)

1583
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:08,236
I really don't think it makes sense.

1584
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:10,835
The owner was born in 1982.

1585
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:12,306
It's impossible that this is...

1586
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:14,906
the first restaurant in Korea that specializes in sandwiches.

1587
00:54:15,036 --> 00:54:16,305
The menu is amazing.

1588
00:54:16,306 --> 00:54:20,076
"Pork offal fillings cooked in oil with patty buns."

1589
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,145
(The menu is written in somewhat awkward grammar.)

1590
00:54:23,146 --> 00:54:24,316
I think...

1591
00:54:24,746 --> 00:54:28,155
they used a translation app to translate Italian. Right?

1592
00:54:28,156 --> 00:54:31,185
But his wife...

1593
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:32,826
- is Korean.
- She's Korean.

1594
00:54:33,456 --> 00:54:37,565
(His wife is Korean. Is there a need to use an app to translate?)

1595
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,066
- This is hard.
- Then...

1596
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:41,766
- Is the owner coming?
- Shall we call him?

1597
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:44,665
- Sir.
- Will someone with that face come?

1598
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:46,236
Mr. Matteo Kim.

1599
00:54:46,976 --> 00:54:49,306
- Hello.
- It's someone else.

1600
00:54:50,476 --> 00:54:51,505
- It's not him.
- Is he the son?

1601
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:52,546
His son.

1602
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:55,316
(Flustered)

1603
00:54:55,616 --> 00:54:58,645
(Who is the owner that surprised everyone?)

1604
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:00,186
- It's someone else.
- It's not him.

1605
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,585
- He...
- His son.

1606
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:03,656
(Are they the same people?)

1607
00:55:03,826 --> 00:55:04,885
It's strange.

1608
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:06,596
The man in the photo should come out.

1609
00:55:06,996 --> 00:55:09,825
(What on earth is this place?)

1610
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:11,226
You're not the owner.

1611
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:13,836
- Yes, I am the owner.
- What?

1612
00:55:14,636 --> 00:55:15,966
He is...

1613
00:55:16,706 --> 00:55:19,036
a fictional character that I projected...

1614
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:21,605
my personal stories, with some sensitive issues...

1615
00:55:21,606 --> 00:55:22,936
altered.

1616
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:26,676
- So he's not a real person?
- No.

1617
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,476
Why did you do this?

1618
00:55:30,016 --> 00:55:33,115
I'm sure it's the same for all self-employed nowadays.

1619
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:36,415
How can I make the customers remember the shop?

1620
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,555
- Be unique.
- Yes.

1621
00:55:37,556 --> 00:55:41,455
How can I leave a lasting impression?

1622
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:43,126
And I thought they would remember it longer...

1623
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:45,696
if I turned my story into something like this.

1624
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:48,466
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?

1625
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,335
- I think...
- Which year were you born in?

1626
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:51,865
I was born in 1999.

1627
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:53,605
So the year of birth stated as 1982 is fake too?

1628
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:55,236
I'm 26 years old.

1629
00:55:55,706 --> 00:55:59,275
These kinds of ideas and the kitschiness...

1630
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:01,845
are those of young generations.

1631
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:04,686
(The MZ owner's selling point, a profile of a fictional character)

1632
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:06,115
It makes you think about a lot of things...

1633
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,956
- as you eat a sandwich.
- Exactly.

1634
00:56:07,986 --> 00:56:09,686
- It's not "Surprise," is it?
- Exactly.

1635
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:10,825
"Surprise."

1636
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,125
Like the show "Surprise."

1637
00:56:13,126 --> 00:56:15,596
People who visit here will definitely remember it.

1638
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:18,065
Then about this place being the first in Korea...

1639
00:56:18,066 --> 00:56:19,965
to specialize in sandwiches...

1640
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:21,995
is made up too?

1641
00:56:21,996 --> 00:56:23,566
- No, that's real.
- It is?

1642
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:26,305
This is the first shop in Korea.

1643
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:28,436
It's a one-and-only shop...

1644
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,776
- that sells offal sandwiches.
- Really?

1645
00:56:31,276 --> 00:56:33,345
What do you mean by offal sandwiches?

1646
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:35,375
Such as beef lung...

1647
00:56:35,376 --> 00:56:36,716
(Such as beef lung)

1648
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:38,185
There's beef tripe...

1649
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,485
that is used to make haejangguk.

1650
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:41,816
- You use that to make sandwiches?
- Yes, we do.

1651
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:45,386
As for pork, pork stomach that's used for gukbap.

1652
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:48,355
- You use pork stomach?
- Not just meat?

1653
00:56:48,356 --> 00:56:51,425
You really use the innards to make sandwiches?

1654
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:52,426
Yes, that's right.

1655
00:56:52,427 --> 00:56:54,066
(He really uses the innards to make sandwiches?)

1656
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:56,666
Beef lungs and tripe,

1657
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:01,306
and pork lungs and stomach are used.

1658
00:57:01,736 --> 00:57:03,575
(The most popular place in Seongsu now)

1659
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:08,046
(Offal sandwiches)

1660
00:57:08,276 --> 00:57:11,286
I get them from a supplier...

1661
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:14,016
in Majang-dong.

1662
00:57:14,816 --> 00:57:17,085
I boil them for about an hour first.

1663
00:57:17,086 --> 00:57:19,826
(Pre-cook it for one hour.)

1664
00:57:20,856 --> 00:57:22,826
I add various spices and pork lard...

1665
00:57:23,596 --> 00:57:26,195
with other ingredients and cook them for the second time.

1666
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:27,536
(Cook it the 2nd time with ingredients that'll add the flavor)

1667
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:30,036
Fill grilled baguettes...

1668
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:32,406
with green sauce...

1669
00:57:33,436 --> 00:57:35,205
and red onions...

1670
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:37,676
marinated in dill.

1671
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:41,715
And add grilled beef patty.

1672
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:43,116
(Beef patty to add the zest)

1673
00:57:44,016 --> 00:57:49,926
(The finishing touch, heaps of offal)

1674
00:57:51,026 --> 00:57:52,456
In a way,

1675
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:55,826
the keyword might make you feel repulsed.

1676
00:57:57,396 --> 00:57:58,866
But for those who like it,

1677
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:02,666
they could really enjoy the uniqueness.

1678
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:04,165
(The first Italian offal burger in Seongsu-dong)

1679
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:05,866
A lot of people find my shop on social media...

1680
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:08,306
and come to try it from afar.

1681
00:58:09,176 --> 00:58:11,906
Italians come occasionally as well,

1682
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:13,876
and they enjoy my food.

1683
00:58:14,846 --> 00:58:17,515
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

1684
00:58:17,516 --> 00:58:21,256
(Is the first offal sandwich in Korea real?)

1685
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:22,655
Why did you make...

1686
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,485
- offal sandwiches...
- Exactly.

1687
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:25,826
instead of ordinary ones?

1688
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:27,795
I found out about it...

1689
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,856
from an acquaintance who likes to travel around the world.

1690
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:33,065
There's a dish called pani ca meusa in Sicily.

1691
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,066
Yes.

1692
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:35,996
(Sliced beef spleen and lungs...)

1693
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,435
(are added in between various types of bread.)

1694
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:41,335
(Pani ca meusa, Sicily's offal burger)

1695
00:58:41,336 --> 00:58:44,776
And in Florence, there's a dish called lampredotto.

1696
00:58:45,246 --> 00:58:47,916
(Lampredotto, Florence's offal burger)

1697
00:58:48,146 --> 00:58:51,045
I developed this idea based on those dishes.

1698
00:58:51,046 --> 00:58:54,555
They're called offal burgers in Korea.

1699
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:55,655
It's fake.

1700
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,426
- When I saw it, - It's fake.

1701
00:58:57,586 --> 00:58:59,756
I found it very interesting.

1702
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:01,725
One was Sicily, where was the other place?

1703
00:59:01,726 --> 00:59:03,056
Florence.

1704
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:04,565
- But...
- Fake...

1705
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:06,126
- he's talking.
- Exactly.

1706
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:07,535
- It's fake.
- Let's listen to his explanation.

1707
00:59:07,536 --> 00:59:09,396
That's ill-mannered. We...

1708
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,506
- That's ill-mannered. We...
- He didn't see it.

1709
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:12,905
- He didn't see it.
- We're supposed to doubt it,

1710
00:59:12,906 --> 00:59:13,936
but still.

1711
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:16,275
He's right next to you.

1712
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:18,346
- I'm sorry.
- You...

1713
00:59:18,776 --> 00:59:21,276
- You're so ill-mannered.
- But still...

1714
00:59:21,446 --> 00:59:25,016
It's what the show is about.

1715
00:59:25,086 --> 00:59:26,646
- Because...
- We need to be doubtful.

1716
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,685
- It...
- But honestly...

1717
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:29,756
I'm sorry.

1718
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:31,785
If it's fake, why would they go so far...

1719
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:33,255
and come up with something so complicated?

1720
00:59:33,256 --> 00:59:35,225
- It's so complicated and confusing.
- It's way too complicated.

1721
00:59:35,226 --> 00:59:37,025
- Don't you think so, Jun Young?
- I think it's real.

1722
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:39,996
I had an acquaintance who did a business like this.

1723
00:59:40,296 --> 00:59:42,896
It was a ramen restaurant, and they made...

1724
00:59:43,196 --> 00:59:44,665
- They made a story.
- a story...

1725
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,276
and designed the restaurant to match it.

1726
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:49,105
My acquaintance really did that.

1727
00:59:49,106 --> 00:59:51,305
I've never seen such a restaurant before.

1728
00:59:51,306 --> 00:59:52,775
- I didn't know...
- Me too.

1729
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:55,045
shops do storytelling like this.

1730
00:59:55,046 --> 00:59:56,516
May I share my opinion?

1731
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,015
(Well-mannered and polite)

1732
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,586
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1733
00:59:59,886 --> 01:00:01,055
I feel bad.

1734
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,715
(Big Nose Conan sets off.)

1735
01:00:02,716 --> 01:00:03,955
I find it a bit suspicious.

1736
01:00:03,956 --> 01:00:05,325
If I may ask,

1737
01:00:05,326 --> 01:00:07,525
why did you place the vinyl records there?

1738
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:11,666
(What do sandwiches have to do with vinyl records?)

1739
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:14,335
Matteo was born in 1982.

1740
01:00:14,336 --> 01:00:17,606
He was raised by a Korean mother,

1741
01:00:17,936 --> 01:00:19,636
and his wife is Korean too.

1742
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:21,375
So I thought,

1743
01:00:21,376 --> 01:00:24,306
"Wouldn't he have naturally become familiar with Korean culture?"

1744
01:00:24,546 --> 01:00:27,846
And since I projected my life onto him,

1745
01:00:27,946 --> 01:00:29,776
I got the vinyl records of the songs I like.

1746
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:33,285
They're the results...

1747
01:00:33,286 --> 01:00:35,415
- of your story.
- That's right.

1748
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,155
- Do you like Byun Jin Sub's songs?
- Yes, I do.

1749
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:38,156
Then...

1750
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:39,426
Laura

1751
01:00:39,756 --> 01:00:41,396
- Laura - "Laura."

1752
01:00:41,696 --> 01:00:45,066
(If it's true, you must know this song.)

1753
01:00:45,326 --> 01:00:48,436
My beloved Laura

1754
01:00:48,766 --> 01:00:51,006
You just wanted to sing, didn't you?

1755
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:54,036
(You might be right.)

1756
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:59,345
(The second song quiz while enjoying himself)

1757
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:00,475
Next?

1758
01:01:00,476 --> 01:01:02,915
I only like certain songs.

1759
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:04,286
- He's fake.
- Which songs?

1760
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,445
Which songs?

1761
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,315
"Like the Birds," for example.

1762
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:10,085
(In the open spice)

1763
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:12,085
"Space."

1764
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:13,525
- Not "spice." - "Spice."

1765
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:15,726
- I heard "spice" too.
- The lyrics...

1766
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:17,225
- Isn't he strange?
- I mean...

1767
01:01:17,226 --> 01:01:18,896
- When did I say "spice?" - "Open spice..."

1768
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:21,395
Why would you say "spice" instead of "space?"

1769
01:01:21,396 --> 01:01:22,765
When did I say "spice?"

1770
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:23,965
- He said "spice," right?
- You said "spice."

1771
01:01:23,966 --> 01:01:25,035
I heard "spice" too.

1772
01:01:25,036 --> 01:01:27,836
Across the open space

1773
01:01:28,236 --> 01:01:32,705
(Running across the open space)

1774
01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:33,875
(Cars)

1775
01:01:33,876 --> 01:01:34,976
He's real.

1776
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:37,515
He is. He knows the song.

1777
01:01:37,516 --> 01:01:39,445
I found something conclusive.

1778
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,815
I'll share after he leaves.

1779
01:01:40,816 --> 01:01:43,155
Can we order now?

1780
01:01:43,156 --> 01:01:44,226
Yes.

1781
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,725
What's your signature menu?

1782
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:48,955
We have three sandwiches.

1783
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:51,665
- I'll get you one each.
- Okay.

1784
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,065
(How will Korea's first offal sandwiches taste?)

1785
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:56,195
- And...
- What's that one thing?

1786
01:01:56,196 --> 01:01:58,835
That one thing. The owner...

1787
01:01:58,836 --> 01:01:59,836
(Sighing)

1788
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:02,135
(What about...)

1789
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:04,106
(the owner?)

1790
01:02:04,306 --> 01:02:05,706
I was close to him.

1791
01:02:06,176 --> 01:02:08,176
I smelled a familiar pain relief spray.

1792
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:10,415
- Mosquito spray?
- Pain relief spray.

1793
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:11,545
Pain relief spray.

1794
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:13,116
- The one you can spray?
- Yes.

1795
01:02:13,816 --> 01:02:16,785
(Jae Seok smelled pain relief spray from the owner.)

1796
01:02:16,786 --> 01:02:18,556
He has a very sharp nose, you know.

1797
01:02:18,726 --> 01:02:20,026
He smells like a dog.

1798
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:22,126
"Hold on."

1799
01:02:22,356 --> 01:02:23,966
"Ji Hyo passed by here."

1800
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:27,065
Ji Hyo passed by five minutes ago.

1801
01:02:27,066 --> 01:02:28,666
And he smelled her perfume.

1802
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:30,265
Based on the smell,

1803
01:02:30,266 --> 01:02:32,035
the business is doing so well that...

1804
01:02:32,036 --> 01:02:34,205
- That's it.
- He's working too hard.

1805
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:36,036
But on the flip side,

1806
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,445
because he's not used to doing the business...

1807
01:02:39,446 --> 01:02:41,045
- That could be true.
- He's using parts he didn't use.

1808
01:02:41,046 --> 01:02:42,145
That's it.

1809
01:02:42,146 --> 01:02:45,585
(It's fake here! Muscle cramps from making unfamiliar dishes?)

1810
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:46,955
(Thinking)

1811
01:02:46,956 --> 01:02:49,115
It's cheating to look up the restaurant name, right?

1812
01:02:49,116 --> 01:02:51,456
(It's cheating to look up the restaurant name, right?)

1813
01:02:51,556 --> 01:02:53,895
(Do you even have to ask?)

1814
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:56,226
- Because...
- You have no intention to guess.

1815
01:02:56,426 --> 01:02:58,566
- I really think...
- He's very sure it's fake here.

1816
01:02:58,866 --> 01:03:00,265
You think it's fake here, right?

1817
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:03,095
Jun Young as a guest must've been so frustrated.

1818
01:03:03,096 --> 01:03:04,905
That's not how the show works.

1819
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,375
(That's not how Sixth Sense works, Seok Jin.)

1820
01:03:07,376 --> 01:03:09,575
(Seok Jin, please.)

1821
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:10,875
(Jee Seok Jin, 59, a regular member)

1822
01:03:10,876 --> 01:03:12,105
(Remark: He needs to be taken care of)

1823
01:03:12,106 --> 01:03:14,246
He knows less than you.

1824
01:03:14,576 --> 01:03:16,115
Do you need coffee?

1825
01:03:16,116 --> 01:03:17,285
- Yes, I'm desperate.
- Why are you going crazy?

1826
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:18,386
(Lack of caffeine)

1827
01:03:18,746 --> 01:03:20,085
Do you think it's fake too... You think it's real?

1828
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:22,316
(His conversation topic follows his train of thoughts.)

1829
01:03:22,486 --> 01:03:23,985
- I think...
- You're conflicted, right?

1830
01:03:23,986 --> 01:03:25,456
I should try the food first.

1831
01:03:25,586 --> 01:03:27,926
- But they always tasted good.
- They taste good.

1832
01:03:28,256 --> 01:03:29,256
It's here.

1833
01:03:29,257 --> 01:03:30,666
(The offal sandwich they've been waiting for appears.)

1834
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:33,366
They look tasty.

1835
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:35,296
What's this?

1836
01:03:37,236 --> 01:03:39,936
(Korea's first offal sandwich is here!)

1837
01:03:40,136 --> 01:03:43,476
This is a sticker for trippa sandwich.

1838
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:44,706
(Trippa sandwich contains cow lung and tripe.)

1839
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:46,306
It has cow entrails.

1840
01:03:47,816 --> 01:03:49,375
- Pork sandwich has pork entrails.
- Pork.

1841
01:03:49,376 --> 01:03:51,546
(Pork sandwich contains pork lung and stomach.)

1842
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:55,585
(They use the original recipes with 100 percent entrails.)

1843
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:57,125
It looks tasty.

1844
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:59,286
(3 kinds of offal sandwiches with 3 tastes)

1845
01:03:59,386 --> 01:04:02,495
Honestly speaking, I've never had an offal sandwich.

1846
01:04:02,496 --> 01:04:03,896
- I know.
- I don't know how they'd taste.

1847
01:04:03,926 --> 01:04:05,865
It's funny because none of us...

1848
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:08,636
- are reaching for the food.
- That's right. Firstly...

1849
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:12,106
(Oh, my!)

1850
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,406
They look like...

1851
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:16,706
- beef sandwiches.
- Beef.

1852
01:04:17,006 --> 01:04:18,675
But when you look at them up close,

1853
01:04:18,676 --> 01:04:22,146
- you see cow lungs.
- Cow lungs and tripe.

1854
01:04:22,976 --> 01:04:27,615
(After the initial hesitation, Kyung Pyo gives it a go.)

1855
01:04:27,616 --> 01:04:29,685
(Oh, my!)

1856
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:30,826
It's really tasty.

1857
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:32,255
It's really tasty.

1858
01:04:32,256 --> 01:04:34,026
- It's so tasty.
- I can taste the offal.

1859
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:36,095
(Seok Jin gives it a big bite.)

1860
01:04:36,096 --> 01:04:39,096
(Mimi follows.)

1861
01:04:39,366 --> 01:04:41,696
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

1862
01:04:41,866 --> 01:04:46,566
(The favorable reactions make him relax and take a bite.)

1863
01:04:48,276 --> 01:04:50,075
It's good. It's really good.

1864
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:51,076
(Humming in approval)

1865
01:04:52,776 --> 01:04:54,346
There's no unpleasant odor.

1866
01:04:55,216 --> 01:04:58,716
It's the taste of offal you get from seonji haejangguk.

1867
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:01,286
- The taste of sundae.
- That's right.

1868
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:04,355
The taste is savory.

1869
01:05:04,356 --> 01:05:05,386
It's tasty.

1870
01:05:05,556 --> 01:05:07,325
I love that the flavors are familiar.

1871
01:05:07,326 --> 01:05:08,826
(It suits his taste.)

1872
01:05:08,956 --> 01:05:10,725
I personally like the pork sandwich better.

1873
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:11,825
- Really?
- Yes.

1874
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:13,766
Pork. Try it.

1875
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:15,066
"Pork."

1876
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:16,566
(Pork. Try it.)

1877
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,766
(What did you call me?)

1878
01:05:18,906 --> 01:05:20,476
Did you call Kyung Pyo "Pork?"

1879
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,906
- Kyung Pyo.
- I became so startled.

1880
01:05:23,176 --> 01:05:24,276
"Pork."

1881
01:05:24,376 --> 01:05:26,305
- Kyung Pyo, don't misunderstand.
- "Pork."

1882
01:05:26,306 --> 01:05:29,375
He should've said, "Hey, this is pork."

1883
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:31,646
"Pork. Hey, pork." What was that?

1884
01:05:31,986 --> 01:05:33,615
- It was in his subconscious.
- Don't misunderstand.

1885
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:35,715
- This is pork.
- It was in his subconscious.

1886
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:38,156
This is pork.

1887
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:41,356
(This is not pork.)

1888
01:05:41,526 --> 01:05:43,825
I had this thought.

1889
01:05:43,826 --> 01:05:45,995
- Young people sure are different.
- Yes.

1890
01:05:45,996 --> 01:05:48,535
I see why this place is the present.

1891
01:05:48,536 --> 01:05:51,706
- Similar restaurants exist.
- That's right.

1892
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:54,176
- Such ideas are so fascinating.
- I know.

1893
01:05:54,476 --> 01:05:58,575
(Meanwhile, one person is busy studying.)

1894
01:05:58,576 --> 01:06:01,376
I think coleslaw will go very well with these sandwiches.

1895
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,646
Cilantro will also go very well with them.

1896
01:06:04,286 --> 01:06:06,585
(There are sides that go well with offal sandwiches.)

1897
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:08,886
(Is it real?)

1898
01:06:08,956 --> 01:06:10,116
- Cilantro?
- Yes.

1899
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:12,786
- I don't like cilantro.
- Really?

1900
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:13,956
He's a simpleton.

1901
01:06:15,256 --> 01:06:17,295
(A simpleton who doesn't like cilantro)

1902
01:06:17,296 --> 01:06:18,426
Hey.

1903
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:20,166
I'll beat you up today...

1904
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:23,466
- for being flippant.
- You know,

1905
01:06:23,696 --> 01:06:25,866
I'm worried that it won't affect me at all.

1906
01:06:27,636 --> 01:06:28,636
(Jun Young takes the blow.)

1907
01:06:28,637 --> 01:06:30,005
(Coughing)

1908
01:06:30,006 --> 01:06:31,145
I'll beat you up.

1909
01:06:31,146 --> 01:06:34,345
Mimi, you look like a woman...

1910
01:06:34,346 --> 01:06:35,875
who is treating her father-in-law to a meal.

1911
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:36,946
(A woman and her father-in-law who are on good terms)

1912
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:39,445
- My daughter-in-law.
- Father.

1913
01:06:39,446 --> 01:06:41,486
- All right.
- My husband ran away, Father.

1914
01:06:41,986 --> 01:06:43,185
- My son did?
- Yes.

1915
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:45,855
- I can't believe that punk!
- He couldn't stand me any longer.

1916
01:06:45,856 --> 01:06:48,225
The skit is... My goodness.

1917
01:06:48,226 --> 01:06:50,695
It's very trendy. It's like a short-form video.

1918
01:06:50,696 --> 01:06:51,865
Yes. It's very dramatic.

1919
01:06:51,866 --> 01:06:52,995
It's like a morning melodrama.

1920
01:06:52,996 --> 01:06:55,035
- It draws you in.
- Yes.

1921
01:06:55,036 --> 01:06:56,336
(Please look forward to Season 2.)

1922
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:58,636
Seriously, these sandwiches are...

1923
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:00,305
tasty.

1924
01:07:00,306 --> 01:07:02,375
- I'll want them again.
- Yes, I'll want them again.

1925
01:07:02,376 --> 01:07:04,275
I had the same experience with sundaeguk.

1926
01:07:04,276 --> 01:07:05,675
One time, I had sundaeguk in Yeouido.

1927
01:07:05,676 --> 01:07:07,716
Two days later, I craved it so much that I went there and ate it alone.

1928
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,375
He went there secretly at night.

1929
01:07:09,376 --> 01:07:10,746
- Secretly?
- He woke up the owner.

1930
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:13,185
I woke up the owner.

1931
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:14,786
- Really?
- I was joking.

1932
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:17,115
Of course, I was joking.

1933
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,125
(A scenario with a twist catches her off guard.)

1934
01:07:18,126 --> 01:07:19,626
The two members of the short-form drama...

1935
01:07:20,556 --> 01:07:22,295
- This short-form drama is no joke.
- Mimi.

1936
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:24,395
Mimi, why would I wake up...

1937
01:07:24,396 --> 01:07:25,596
the sleeping owner?

1938
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:26,996
I wouldn't do that to a friend.

1939
01:07:28,136 --> 01:07:29,595
Hey, Jun Young is eating so much.

1940
01:07:29,596 --> 01:07:31,905
(Jun Young is busy eating no matter what they're doing.)

1941
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:33,536
How many have you had?

1942
01:07:34,776 --> 01:07:37,806
(Eating)

1943
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:41,616
(Inhaling offal sandwiches)

1944
01:07:42,546 --> 01:07:44,216
(Dipping in sauce)

1945
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,985
(He doesn't miss the end.)

1946
01:07:46,986 --> 01:07:48,056
(Humming in approval)

1947
01:07:49,586 --> 01:07:51,225
You look like a swimmer.

1948
01:07:51,226 --> 01:07:53,086
I swam for a short while in the past.

1949
01:07:53,356 --> 01:07:54,725
I see. How did you know?

1950
01:07:54,726 --> 01:07:55,796
I just had a hunch.

1951
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:57,396
Mimi has a good hunch.

1952
01:07:57,996 --> 01:07:59,395
What do you think Seok Jin is good at?

1953
01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:00,666
Do you think I'll be good at swimming?

1954
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:04,635
When you go to a swimming pool,

1955
01:08:04,636 --> 01:08:07,575
old men and women just walk.

1956
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:09,176
(They just walk.)

1957
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:10,336
(Nodding in approval)

1958
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:11,476
It's like physical therapy.

1959
01:08:11,806 --> 01:08:13,006
- That's right.
- You're spot on.

1960
01:08:13,546 --> 01:08:16,175
- He rarely goes into the water.
- When I visit a swimming pool...

1961
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,385
during a trip with my children,

1962
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,415
I keep walking.

1963
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,756
(This is fun.)

1964
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:22,315
Seriously.

1965
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:23,415
(Sixth Sense members filled their stomachs.)

1966
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:24,425
Seriously.

1967
01:08:24,426 --> 01:08:26,625
I'll crave these sandwiches tomorrow if I get addicted to the taste.

1968
01:08:26,626 --> 01:08:27,726
I'll crave them tomorrow.

1969
01:08:27,996 --> 01:08:30,996
- So why do I think this is fake?
- Why do you think this is fake?

1970
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:32,466
Had I been the owner,

1971
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:34,296
I would've sold...

1972
01:08:34,796 --> 01:08:36,996
regular beef sandwiches as well.

1973
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:38,336
I wouldn't have sold offal sandwiches only.

1974
01:08:38,366 --> 01:08:39,436
That's the case...

1975
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:42,405
because the owner wants to have a definite concept.

1976
01:08:42,406 --> 01:08:43,535
I know what you mean.

1977
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,705
- A definite concept is important.
- That's right.

1978
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:47,646
- That's right.
- But had it been me,

1979
01:08:47,746 --> 01:08:50,216
I would've included meat sandwiches in the menu.

1980
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:52,515
Offal sandwiches, meat sandwiches, and half-and-half.

1981
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:54,616
That's why you can't be Generation MZ.

1982
01:08:56,916 --> 01:09:00,425
(That's why you can't be Generation MZ.)

1983
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:04,595
People with preconceived ideas would serve regular sandwiches here.

1984
01:09:04,596 --> 01:09:05,725
- Then...
- No.

1985
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:07,295
Do you think this place is real?

1986
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:09,035
- I'm not sure yet.
- Right?

1987
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:10,036
Jun Young, what do you think?

1988
01:09:10,037 --> 01:09:11,065
(Mimi: Neutral)

1989
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:12,605
I think it's real. I think this place is real.

1990
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,206
- How about you, Kyung Pyo?
- I also think this place is real.

1991
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:16,605
Then it's 2 to 2. We say it's fake, you say it's real.

1992
01:09:16,606 --> 01:09:18,745
- She hasn't decided yet.
- I never said that it was fake.

1993
01:09:18,746 --> 01:09:19,846
- Just say that it's fake.
- But...

1994
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:21,515
If you aren't sure, just say that it's fake.

1995
01:09:21,516 --> 01:09:24,185
My husband ran away because of your tyranny.

1996
01:09:24,186 --> 01:09:25,186
I see.

1997
01:09:25,386 --> 01:09:27,245
I'm sorry, my daughter-in-law. I didn't know that.

1998
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,756
- You should help me.
- Okay.

1999
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,725
(Present: Built-in sandwich)

2000
01:09:30,726 --> 01:09:31,925
(1. Restaurant with the concept of virtual world)

2001
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:33,225
(2. Signature menu that isn't for everyone)

2002
01:09:33,226 --> 01:09:34,596
(3. Interior design that's over the top)

2003
01:09:35,096 --> 01:09:36,525
- Shall we get off?
- Okay.

2004
01:09:36,526 --> 01:09:37,526
- Okay.
- Okay.

2005
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:38,796
(They move to the third location, past.)

2006
01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:41,536
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

2007
01:09:42,336 --> 01:09:44,906
What? I have no idea where this place is located.

2008
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,835
How is this place related to a primitive tribe?

2009
01:09:47,836 --> 01:09:49,235
(Does this empty alley have Seongsu's past?)

2010
01:09:49,236 --> 01:09:50,376
I can't see the connection.

2011
01:09:51,906 --> 01:09:54,776
A modern restaurant in Seongsu-dong with the primitive concept?

2012
01:09:55,076 --> 01:09:57,686
It makes no sense whatsoever.

2013
01:09:58,616 --> 01:10:00,386
(Her eyes go wide.)

2014
01:10:00,716 --> 01:10:02,616
- Is this the place?
- What's this?

2015
01:10:02,756 --> 01:10:04,186
- For real...
- This is the place.

2016
01:10:04,356 --> 01:10:06,556
- What? This is the place.
- It has the primitive concept.

2017
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:08,555
- This is the place.
- What?

2018
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:10,526
(What caught their eyes?)

2019
01:10:11,196 --> 01:10:14,296
(Water flows between the rocks.)

2020
01:10:14,736 --> 01:10:19,065
(Tropical plants crawl down the walls.)

2021
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:21,535
(There's even a strange sculpture!)

2022
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:22,576
This is the place.

2023
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:24,905
(Right next to an ordinary alley,)

2024
01:10:24,906 --> 01:10:27,516
(the world of a primitive tribe unfolds.)

2025
01:10:28,116 --> 01:10:31,986
(Seongsu's Past: Feast of a primitive tribe)

2026
01:10:32,086 --> 01:10:33,146
Is this the actual concept?

2027
01:10:33,716 --> 01:10:35,786
- I guess so.
- I mean...

2028
01:10:36,016 --> 01:10:38,685
- This place is real.
- It's like "Moana."

2029
01:10:38,686 --> 01:10:41,295
- You're right. It's like "Moana." - Yes. "Moana."

2030
01:10:41,296 --> 01:10:44,766
(An oar reminds them of an animated film about a tribe.)

2031
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:47,965
- This place is real.
- I think this place is real.

2032
01:10:47,966 --> 01:10:49,096
(Even the entrance has the vibe of a primitive tribe.)

2033
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:52,136
This place is so well-made.

2034
01:10:54,406 --> 01:10:55,806
- But this...
- But this...

2035
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,806
It'll be hard to set this up for a fake place.

2036
01:10:58,476 --> 01:11:00,275
- It's too big, right?
- It's too big.

2037
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:02,415
- But it can be done.
- It can be done.

2038
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:04,146
- But they'll need to take it off.
- It can be done.

2039
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:06,516
It can be made in no time.

2040
01:11:06,786 --> 01:11:07,815
- This?
- Can it be made in no time?

2041
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:10,486
- This?
- The prop team can do that.

2042
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:12,625
Isn't the scale...

2043
01:11:12,626 --> 01:11:14,125
(Is it a big-scale fake that was set up by the art team?)

2044
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:15,955
- too big?
- Shall we enter?

2045
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:17,695
It looks like it was made on a wall, right?

2046
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:18,726
(They enter the restaurant with questions.)

2047
01:11:20,066 --> 01:11:21,836
This place is real.

2048
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:24,206
- Seriously.
- This place is real.

2049
01:11:24,706 --> 01:11:25,806
This place is real.

2050
01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:27,876
It smells so nice.

2051
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,536
No way.

2052
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,346
(What's this place that makes them exclaim?)

2053
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,576
(Sixth Sense members are welcomed with big eyes...)

2054
01:11:37,146 --> 01:11:40,516
(and a creepy smile.)

2055
01:11:41,016 --> 01:11:42,115
Those are actual rocks.

2056
01:11:42,116 --> 01:11:43,315
(This is the tribal restaurant.)

2057
01:11:43,316 --> 01:11:44,555
This place is real.

2058
01:11:44,556 --> 01:11:48,325
(When you open the door, a mysterious place unfolds.)

2059
01:11:48,326 --> 01:11:49,595
Gosh, this place...

2060
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,695
(When you open the door, a mysterious place unfolds.)

2061
01:11:51,696 --> 01:11:52,896
It's no joke.

2062
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:57,566
(When you cross the bridge)

2063
01:11:58,006 --> 01:11:59,605
This place is so nice.

2064
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:00,905
(You enter the spacious hall for eating.)

2065
01:12:00,906 --> 01:12:03,205
Look over here. It's like Africa.

2066
01:12:03,206 --> 01:12:04,275
(Small tribal members are hiding here and there.)

2067
01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:06,475
- This is incredible.
- It smells so good.

2068
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:08,876
(Even the incense goes well with the atmosphere.)

2069
01:12:09,316 --> 01:12:10,785
This place is real.

2070
01:12:10,786 --> 01:12:12,446
(Welcome to the tribal restaurant.)

2071
01:12:14,486 --> 01:12:16,515
- This is...
- My goodness.

2072
01:12:16,516 --> 01:12:18,186
This place is so nice.

2073
01:12:19,026 --> 01:12:20,225
This is no joke.

2074
01:12:20,226 --> 01:12:22,356
It's so atmospheric and nice.

2075
01:12:22,496 --> 01:12:25,466
- It's a total photo zone.
- I feel like I'm suddenly abroad.

2076
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:27,965
How did they make a place like this?

2077
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:29,496
How does this place exist?

2078
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:33,436
What? There are carps.

2079
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,375
- What?
- There are carps as well.

2080
01:12:35,376 --> 01:12:37,646
(Goldfishes swim leisurely right next to them.)

2081
01:12:37,746 --> 01:12:39,446
Why is its head so bloated?

2082
01:12:40,576 --> 01:12:43,115
It's a very precious goldfish type.

2083
01:12:43,116 --> 01:12:44,746
Really? It's so fascinating.

2084
01:12:45,846 --> 01:12:48,155
- How fascinating.
- This is incredible.

2085
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:49,415
(The place makes them forget about deductions for a second.)

2086
01:12:49,416 --> 01:12:51,686
- You know, seriously...
- This place is real.

2087
01:12:53,356 --> 01:12:54,956
We don't usually take photos.

2088
01:12:55,596 --> 01:12:56,725
I'll take photos.

2089
01:12:56,726 --> 01:12:57,766
(He readily pulls out a camera.)

2090
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:02,565
(They stop deducting for a moment and take photos.)

2091
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:03,836
Appearance check!

2092
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:08,206
(Photos by Mimi at Seongsu's tribal restaurant)

2093
01:13:08,736 --> 01:13:10,205
- Seriously.
- You know,

2094
01:13:10,206 --> 01:13:13,205
if I were to give a reason, the smell is real.

2095
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:14,215
What smell?

2096
01:13:14,216 --> 01:13:16,746
This isn't a smell that has built up in a day or two.

2097
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,615
It's the incense stick.

2098
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:21,015
There's a specific aroma.

2099
01:13:21,016 --> 01:13:22,985
- It's the incense stick.
- There's that smell.

2100
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:23,986
You get that smell right away when you light it.

2101
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:25,055
- Yes.
- Really?

2102
01:13:25,056 --> 01:13:26,656
(Flustered)

2103
01:13:27,626 --> 01:13:30,195
- I see.
- Jun Young is annoyed for real.

2104
01:13:30,196 --> 01:13:31,795
(Jun Young is annoyed for real.)

2105
01:13:31,796 --> 01:13:33,395
Jun Young couldn't suppress it anymore.

2106
01:13:33,396 --> 01:13:34,695
He had had enough.

2107
01:13:34,696 --> 01:13:36,236
He's annoyed.

2108
01:13:37,366 --> 01:13:39,005
Excuse me.

2109
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:40,006
Hello.

2110
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:42,605
Welcome to Tribal Village.

2111
01:13:42,606 --> 01:13:44,476
- Tribal Village?
- Yes.

2112
01:13:44,806 --> 01:13:47,675
It's the welcome tea made with passion fruit.

2113
01:13:47,676 --> 01:13:48,846
Thank you.

2114
01:13:49,016 --> 01:13:51,686
Why does this place have the feast of a primitive tribe?

2115
01:13:52,116 --> 01:13:54,685
We're here to check out Seongsu's past.

2116
01:13:54,686 --> 01:13:56,086
That's right. Here,

2117
01:13:56,456 --> 01:13:58,485
the hidden tribal village...

2118
01:13:58,486 --> 01:14:04,095
welcomes outsiders to a feast.

2119
01:14:04,096 --> 01:14:05,395
That's the concept of the restaurant.

2120
01:14:05,396 --> 01:14:07,326
How did you come up with this concept?

2121
01:14:08,096 --> 01:14:11,736
We wanted to provide people with a special experience,

2122
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:15,036
not just food.

2123
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:20,145
The place has been designed to make people feel...

2124
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:21,976
the excitement of being at a vacation spot.

2125
01:14:22,846 --> 01:14:26,586
Also, to give the smell of a forest,

2126
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:29,556
we light the forest incense.

2127
01:14:30,516 --> 01:14:32,485
(The smell takes people to the jungle.)

2128
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:34,725
So that the visitors of Tribal Village...

2129
01:14:34,726 --> 01:14:36,825
will become more absorbed,

2130
01:14:36,826 --> 01:14:39,125
we wear a uniform.

2131
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:41,335
(All employees wear a jungle-styled uniform.)

2132
01:14:41,336 --> 01:14:43,195
What kind of food...

2133
01:14:43,196 --> 01:14:44,635
do you serve?

2134
01:14:44,636 --> 01:14:46,536
- There's a very popular menu.
- What is it?

2135
01:14:47,006 --> 01:14:49,035
The signature menu is the party plate.

2136
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:50,375
Party plate?

2137
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:51,706
(Party plate)

2138
01:14:51,806 --> 01:14:55,245
It's the food tribal members would've enjoyed at a party...

2139
01:14:55,246 --> 01:14:56,646
on a single plate.

2140
01:14:57,216 --> 01:15:01,155
(Party plate)

2141
01:15:01,156 --> 01:15:03,955
There's porchetta, a traditional Italian barbecue.

2142
01:15:03,956 --> 01:15:05,155
(Traditional Italian barbecue, porchetta)

2143
01:15:05,156 --> 01:15:08,696
There's also polpo, a Spanish grilled octopus.

2144
01:15:09,326 --> 01:15:11,465
Then there's chicken mole,

2145
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:13,666
a Mexican chicken barbecue.

2146
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:18,236
The plate also includes the Chinese-style fried rice.

2147
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:26,245
(Party plate lets you enjoy all the flavors of the tribe.)

2148
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:29,115
The party plate makes up...

2149
01:15:29,116 --> 01:15:31,545
for about 40 to 50 percent of the sales.

2150
01:15:31,546 --> 01:15:33,585
On weekdays, we make about 2,000 dollars.

2151
01:15:33,586 --> 01:15:36,115
On weekends, we make about 5,000 dollars.

2152
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,926
That's how much we make.

2153
01:15:38,286 --> 01:15:40,155
The barbecue plate you'd get...

2154
01:15:40,156 --> 01:15:42,155
at an actual tribal village is the best.

2155
01:15:42,156 --> 01:15:43,755
The spicy and exotic flavors of the meat...

2156
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:46,666
made me feel like I had visited a tribe in the jungle.

2157
01:15:46,726 --> 01:15:48,235
- Sixth Sense members, - Sixth Sense members,

2158
01:15:48,236 --> 01:15:50,035
- is it real?
- is it real?

2159
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:52,636
(Sixth Sense members, is it real?)

2160
01:15:52,706 --> 01:15:55,705
- Nothing here makes me suspicious.
- Nothing.

2161
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:56,775
Seriously.

2162
01:15:56,776 --> 01:15:58,576
(Nodding)

2163
01:15:59,376 --> 01:16:00,946
(My goodness)

2164
01:16:01,016 --> 01:16:02,576
But the fishes are a bit...

2165
01:16:02,676 --> 01:16:04,245
The meat doesn't suit this place?

2166
01:16:04,246 --> 01:16:06,115
I'm talking about the fishes. Have you seen them?

2167
01:16:06,116 --> 01:16:07,185
- Yes, I have.
- Yes, I have.

2168
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:08,416
Tiny goldfishes...

2169
01:16:08,486 --> 01:16:10,086
Tiny goldfishes...

2170
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:11,725
don't suit the Amazon.

2171
01:16:11,726 --> 01:16:13,356
Should there be piranhas?

2172
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,326
(Yes, there should be piranhas.)

2173
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:17,765
I'll bite.

2174
01:16:17,766 --> 01:16:18,925
(I'll bite.)

2175
01:16:18,926 --> 01:16:19,966
Like this...

2176
01:16:20,296 --> 01:16:21,465
(Seok Jin's deduction)

2177
01:16:21,466 --> 01:16:22,895
(It's fake because there are small goldfishes!)

2178
01:16:22,896 --> 01:16:24,236
(Piranhas would've been more fitting!)

2179
01:16:24,406 --> 01:16:26,105
Honestly speaking, when I entered,

2180
01:16:26,106 --> 01:16:28,076
- the aroma was too strong.
- That's right.

2181
01:16:28,236 --> 01:16:29,805
- "It seems fake." - You thought that it seemed fake.

2182
01:16:29,806 --> 01:16:30,876
Yes.

2183
01:16:31,176 --> 01:16:32,345
- The thing is, - Yes?

2184
01:16:32,346 --> 01:16:34,206
not many restaurants use...

2185
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:36,076
intense sticks.

2186
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:38,315
- That's right. Cafes use them.
- Cafes...

2187
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:39,585
and vintage shops use them.

2188
01:16:39,586 --> 01:16:40,715
This aroma...

2189
01:16:40,716 --> 01:16:42,356
(You're sharp.)

2190
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,625
It can get mixed up with the smell of food.

2191
01:16:44,626 --> 01:16:45,926
- You're right.
- The aroma is strong.

2192
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:47,795
It seems like a cafe, right?

2193
01:16:47,796 --> 01:16:49,896
- I think it's a cafe.
- This place?

2194
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:51,726
I think it's a cafe.

2195
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:54,666
- Really?
- Look over there.

2196
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,195
(The table catches Jun Young's eye.)

2197
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,506
Strangers will need to sit across from each other and eat.

2198
01:17:00,236 --> 01:17:03,075
It isn't easy to have a meal across from a stranger.

2199
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,546
(The table arrangement is more suitable for a cafe.)

2200
01:17:04,646 --> 01:17:06,376
I give up. I can't guess correctly.

2201
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:07,975
It's too hard.

2202
01:17:07,976 --> 01:17:09,145
- It's hard.
- So hard. I can't guess correctly.

2203
01:17:09,146 --> 01:17:11,146
- It's too hard.
- It's up to you guys.

2204
01:17:12,146 --> 01:17:13,515
- Here comes the food.
- Here it comes.

2205
01:17:13,516 --> 01:17:14,585
- Here it comes.
- No way.

2206
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:15,615
What's that?

2207
01:17:15,616 --> 01:17:16,616
It didn't take long.

2208
01:17:16,617 --> 01:17:17,685
Is that meat?

2209
01:17:17,686 --> 01:17:18,786
What's that?

2210
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:20,785
What's this?

2211
01:17:20,786 --> 01:17:22,726
(They finally get the tribe's party food.)

2212
01:17:22,896 --> 01:17:24,465
The tribal members caught a pig,

2213
01:17:24,466 --> 01:17:25,696
an octopus,

2214
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,466
and a chicken.

2215
01:17:27,796 --> 01:17:30,665
It's the dish that has all sorts of meat and seafood.

2216
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:32,236
(Tribal party food)

2217
01:17:33,006 --> 01:17:34,305
What's this?

2218
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:36,905
(They can't believe their eyes.)

2219
01:17:36,906 --> 01:17:39,545
Please use the gloves we've provided ahead of time.

2220
01:17:39,546 --> 01:17:41,676
If you look over here, there's an axe.

2221
01:17:41,746 --> 01:17:43,276
Please use this axe...

2222
01:17:43,646 --> 01:17:45,616
to cut the food and eat it with your hands.

2223
01:17:46,246 --> 01:17:48,986
(How unusual)

2224
01:17:49,016 --> 01:17:51,085
Please think of yourself as a tribe member.

2225
01:17:51,086 --> 01:17:53,486
- It's a party.
- That's the concept.

2226
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:56,225
- How much is it?
- This plate?

2227
01:17:56,226 --> 01:17:57,695
It's for 4 to 5 people.

2228
01:17:57,696 --> 01:17:58,795
It's 162 dollars.

2229
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:00,796
- It should be that expensive.
- I know.

2230
01:18:01,066 --> 01:18:02,365
If it's for five people,

2231
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:04,035
the price of 162 dollars isn't expensive.

2232
01:18:04,036 --> 01:18:05,406
- It's for 5 people.
- It's for 5 people.

2233
01:18:05,606 --> 01:18:06,805
(Shall we enjoy the party now?)

2234
01:18:06,806 --> 01:18:08,035
Please enjoy the meal.

2235
01:18:08,036 --> 01:18:09,176
(Shall we enjoy the party now?)

2236
01:18:11,306 --> 01:18:13,275
- Let's use the axe.
- Okay.

2237
01:18:13,276 --> 01:18:14,875
(Let's use the axe!)

2238
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:16,345
Go ahead. You look threatening.

2239
01:18:16,346 --> 01:18:18,245
(Grinning)

2240
01:18:18,246 --> 01:18:19,515
You look so threatening.

2241
01:18:19,516 --> 01:18:21,186
(He ends up threatening them.)

2242
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:23,015
- Take this piece.
- I'll use the axe.

2243
01:18:23,016 --> 01:18:24,316
Octopus.

2244
01:18:24,486 --> 01:18:25,626
Gosh, this is...

2245
01:18:27,056 --> 01:18:28,325
- Hey.
- My goodness.

2246
01:18:28,326 --> 01:18:29,755
(The octopus gets chopped up with a satisfying sound.)

2247
01:18:29,756 --> 01:18:31,866
- It chops food easily.
- Does it chop food easily?

2248
01:18:32,326 --> 01:18:34,466
- It chops food easily.
- Does it chop food easily?

2249
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:36,266
It chops food very easily.

2250
01:18:36,936 --> 01:18:37,965
Shall I try this?

2251
01:18:37,966 --> 01:18:39,206
- Go ahead.
- It's very nice.

2252
01:18:39,336 --> 01:18:42,106
(He puts the entire thing in his mouth.)

2253
01:18:42,206 --> 01:18:43,276
It's tasty.

2254
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:45,276
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

2255
01:18:45,676 --> 01:18:48,476
(Humming in approval)

2256
01:18:48,646 --> 01:18:50,475
(It gets good reactions.)

2257
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,346
(What's this octopus dish?)

2258
01:18:53,146 --> 01:18:54,855
We use steamed octopuses.

2259
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:55,856
(Spanish grilled octopus, polpo)

2260
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:59,085
For two hours, we braise them in sauvignon blanc wine,

2261
01:18:59,086 --> 01:19:01,696
bay leaves, garlic, and peppercorns.

2262
01:19:01,956 --> 01:19:03,055
Braising is...

2263
01:19:03,056 --> 01:19:06,526
a cooking technique that maximizes the flavors of the ingredients.

2264
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:09,335
Then we marinate the octopuses in oil for 24 hours...

2265
01:19:09,336 --> 01:19:10,866
to age them.

2266
01:19:12,136 --> 01:19:13,705
(Firm)

2267
01:19:13,706 --> 01:19:14,775
Afterward,

2268
01:19:14,776 --> 01:19:16,435
we make the sauces.

2269
01:19:16,436 --> 01:19:19,405
Think of this dish as a steak.

2270
01:19:19,406 --> 01:19:20,876
(Polpo is an octopus dish that has been cooked like a steak.)

2271
01:19:21,576 --> 01:19:22,646
Right?

2272
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:24,316
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

2273
01:19:25,816 --> 01:19:26,816
This is...

2274
01:19:26,817 --> 01:19:28,016
Jae Seok.

2275
01:19:29,116 --> 01:19:30,486
I thought you were Tzuyang.

2276
01:19:31,086 --> 01:19:32,255
(He shows the current trend of an eating show.)

2277
01:19:32,256 --> 01:19:34,126
I thought you were Tzuyang eating tripe.

2278
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,796
It's "Oldboy."

2279
01:19:35,996 --> 01:19:37,695
He's Choi Min Sik in "Oldboy."

2280
01:19:37,696 --> 01:19:38,725
It's so tender.

2281
01:19:38,726 --> 01:19:40,466
It's tasty.

2282
01:19:40,896 --> 01:19:42,465
It's so tender.

2283
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:43,666
It's tender.

2284
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:46,135
- Octopus can be very tough.
- That's right.

2285
01:19:46,136 --> 01:19:47,566
It's very tasty.

2286
01:19:47,736 --> 01:19:50,806
(Octopus leg, who are you?)

2287
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:52,945
There are other dishes as well.

2288
01:19:52,946 --> 01:19:55,615
(Seok Jin tries something else.)

2289
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:56,776
Try this!

2290
01:19:57,076 --> 01:19:58,316
It's insane. Try it.

2291
01:19:58,516 --> 01:19:59,546
What's this?

2292
01:20:00,946 --> 01:20:03,015
As for the Italian porchetta,

2293
01:20:03,016 --> 01:20:06,685
we dry age the meat for three days.

2294
01:20:06,686 --> 01:20:07,885
Afterward,

2295
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,796
we fill it up with herbs, spinach, and other ingredients.

2296
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:12,925
Then we roll it up in a cylindrical shape...

2297
01:20:12,926 --> 01:20:16,595
and roast it in the oven at 180°C.

2298
01:20:16,596 --> 01:20:18,506
(It gets pre-roasted in the oven for 2 hours!)

2299
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,375
Then we torch it once more.

2300
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:22,805
The result is the whole roasted pork belly...

2301
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:24,105
that's crispy on the outside...

2302
01:20:24,106 --> 01:20:26,245
and tender on the inside.

2303
01:20:26,246 --> 01:20:27,276
(The inside is moist and juicy.)

2304
01:20:28,676 --> 01:20:29,945
It's tastier.

2305
01:20:29,946 --> 01:20:31,946
(Italian porchetta, whole roasted pork belly)

2306
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:35,185
- The outside is crispy.
- It's crispy.

2307
01:20:35,186 --> 01:20:36,256
Gosh, it's hot.

2308
01:20:36,556 --> 01:20:37,615
- It's tasty.
- Go ahead and eat it.

2309
01:20:37,616 --> 01:20:38,625
Eat it.

2310
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:39,926
(He overcomes the heat and takes a big bite.)

2311
01:20:40,656 --> 01:20:41,656
(My goodness)

2312
01:20:41,726 --> 01:20:42,925
It's really tasty, right?

2313
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:45,166
(The taste makes him exclaim twice!)

2314
01:20:45,366 --> 01:20:48,936
(Kyung Pyo takes a big bite as well.)

2315
01:20:49,336 --> 01:20:51,236
- It's tasty.
- This place...

2316
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:53,735
- must be popular.
- This is the real deal.

2317
01:20:53,736 --> 01:20:56,675
- Eating show YouTubers eat this.
- I know.

2318
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:59,106
- It's crispy pork belly.
- Yes.

2319
01:20:59,176 --> 01:21:00,475
(You're right.)

2320
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:01,776
- It's tasty, right?
- It's tasty.

2321
01:21:02,016 --> 01:21:03,316
The outside...

2322
01:21:03,646 --> 01:21:05,445
- is crispy...
- Yes.

2323
01:21:05,446 --> 01:21:07,645
thanks to the roasted skin. It's so tasty.

2324
01:21:07,646 --> 01:21:09,215
- The inside is very tender.
- Yes.

2325
01:21:09,216 --> 01:21:10,315
Seriously.

2326
01:21:10,316 --> 01:21:11,356
Is this how you eat it?

2327
01:21:11,586 --> 01:21:13,456
Is this how you eat it?

2328
01:21:13,526 --> 01:21:14,526
Do you eat it like a tribal member?

2329
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:16,795
We should eat it as a rice ball.

2330
01:21:16,796 --> 01:21:17,926
It's hot.

2331
01:21:18,296 --> 01:21:19,666
I can't make a rice ball. It's too hot.

2332
01:21:19,826 --> 01:21:20,895
I can't make it.

2333
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,996
- Really?
- Mimi.

2334
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:23,836
Gosh, you're such a weakling.

2335
01:21:24,496 --> 01:21:26,565
(Startled)

2336
01:21:26,566 --> 01:21:28,536
(My goodness)

2337
01:21:28,636 --> 01:21:29,935
(Here's another weakling.)

2338
01:21:29,936 --> 01:21:30,975
Anyone will be startled.

2339
01:21:30,976 --> 01:21:32,375
- Hey.
- It's hot.

2340
01:21:32,376 --> 01:21:34,876
It's like the iron palm training.

2341
01:21:34,946 --> 01:21:36,575
- It's so hot.
- Seriously.

2342
01:21:36,576 --> 01:21:38,116
You can't grab it.

2343
01:21:39,346 --> 01:21:40,785
- Gosh.
- You can't grab it.

2344
01:21:40,786 --> 01:21:42,286
(Kyung Pyo also fails to make a rice ball.)

2345
01:21:42,456 --> 01:21:45,485
(Jun Young carefully gives it a go.)

2346
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:46,655
(He makes a rice ball in 3 seconds!)

2347
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:47,656
It's hot.

2348
01:21:47,657 --> 01:21:49,495
All the places we've visited today had tasty food.

2349
01:21:49,496 --> 01:21:50,656
Hey.

2350
01:21:50,696 --> 01:21:51,895
(The testosterone-rich man distributes the rice balls.)

2351
01:21:51,896 --> 01:21:54,165
He's the man.

2352
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:56,995
(He tastes the pilaf ball thanks to Jun Young.)

2353
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,805
(Moved)

2354
01:21:58,806 --> 01:22:00,365
(His eyes go wide.)

2355
01:22:00,366 --> 01:22:01,706
Anyone will be startled.

2356
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:04,206
Out of the three dishes, this takes the crown.

2357
01:22:04,576 --> 01:22:05,906
It's so tasty.

2358
01:22:06,576 --> 01:22:07,906
It's so tasty.

2359
01:22:07,946 --> 01:22:09,115
Gosh, it's hot.

2360
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:10,675
(He still hasn't gotten a taste.)

2361
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,885
(Struggling)

2362
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,345
Are your hands okay?

2363
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,456
(He takes the rice ball Seok Jin has dropped.)

2364
01:22:16,486 --> 01:22:18,015
The one you dropped is cool.

2365
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,025
(The one you dropped is cool.)

2366
01:22:19,026 --> 01:22:21,426
(They burst out in laughter.)

2367
01:22:21,626 --> 01:22:23,526
The more I dig in, the more insanely hot it gets.

2368
01:22:23,796 --> 01:22:24,866
Why...

2369
01:22:25,296 --> 01:22:26,466
My stomach hurts from laughing.

2370
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:27,526
Let go.

2371
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:29,495
(They fight for a cool rice ball.)

2372
01:22:29,496 --> 01:22:31,505
I'll steal it. It's really cool.

2373
01:22:31,506 --> 01:22:33,706
(Kyung Pyo picks up the bad habit quickly.)

2374
01:22:34,406 --> 01:22:35,906
- I stole it.
- When will I get to eat?

2375
01:22:37,136 --> 01:22:39,546
(He feels bad for Seok Jin.)

2376
01:22:41,646 --> 01:22:43,075
(Mimi makes a rice ball for the oldest member in the end.)

2377
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:44,615
- Try it.
- That made me laugh.

2378
01:22:44,616 --> 01:22:46,146
- It's very tasty.
- It was funny.

2379
01:22:47,316 --> 01:22:49,486
I'll try the rice ball from my daughter-in-law.

2380
01:22:50,356 --> 01:22:52,026
Father, try it.

2381
01:22:52,586 --> 01:22:55,126
(Happy)

2382
01:22:55,926 --> 01:22:57,356
You know,

2383
01:22:57,596 --> 01:22:58,866
it's seriously tasty.

2384
01:22:58,966 --> 01:23:00,626
It's the tastiest food I've had today.

2385
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:02,865
Don't bring down the previous restaurants!

2386
01:23:02,866 --> 01:23:04,165
(Don't bring down the previous restaurants!)

2387
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,236
(Dispirited)

2388
01:23:05,406 --> 01:23:07,636
(Cackling)

2389
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,035
I sincerely apologize.

2390
01:23:09,036 --> 01:23:10,976
(Seok Jin issues a national apology after joining Sixth Sense.)

2391
01:23:11,176 --> 01:23:13,075
The previous restaurants were good as well.

2392
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:14,375
(His nagging mode is on.)

2393
01:23:14,376 --> 01:23:17,115
I made a big mistake.

2394
01:23:17,116 --> 01:23:18,215
Which camera should I look at?

2395
01:23:18,216 --> 01:23:19,315
It's this one.

2396
01:23:19,316 --> 01:23:20,386
I'm sorry.

2397
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,215
(Thinking)

2398
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:23,685
I feel like it's fake.

2399
01:23:23,686 --> 01:23:25,325
Mimi has a good hunch.

2400
01:23:25,326 --> 01:23:26,456
She has a very good hunch.

2401
01:23:27,226 --> 01:23:28,256
Why?

2402
01:23:29,396 --> 01:23:31,125
I'm not sure why,

2403
01:23:31,126 --> 01:23:32,796
but it just feels that way.

2404
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,296
(Chuckling)

2405
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:35,896
Speak with reason.

2406
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:39,236
I always lack that.

2407
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:42,435
(I don't have a specific reason,)

2408
01:23:42,436 --> 01:23:43,936
(but it feels fake!)

2409
01:23:44,376 --> 01:23:45,906
Excuse me.

2410
01:23:46,306 --> 01:23:47,475
Here's the iced Americano.

2411
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:48,745
- The iced Americano.
- Thank you.

2412
01:23:48,746 --> 01:23:50,976
The glass looks pretty!

2413
01:23:52,846 --> 01:23:54,086
It's a cafe.

2414
01:23:54,746 --> 01:23:57,155
- This place is a cafe.
- It's a cafe.

2415
01:23:57,156 --> 01:23:59,856
(A pretty glass that would be used at a cafe?)

2416
01:24:00,056 --> 01:24:01,895
Look at this. It's a cafe.

2417
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:03,695
- It's a cafe.
- This was used here.

2418
01:24:03,696 --> 01:24:04,866
(Seok Jin found another clue.)

2419
01:24:05,526 --> 01:24:07,295
(Clue that this place is fake)

2420
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,866
(There's even a tea coaster that would be used at cafes?)

2421
01:24:10,136 --> 01:24:12,466
But there's this.

2422
01:24:13,766 --> 01:24:15,835
I thought this place might be a cafe as well.

2423
01:24:15,836 --> 01:24:19,906
I agree with what Mimi is saying.

2424
01:24:20,846 --> 01:24:21,846
But...

2425
01:24:21,847 --> 01:24:23,576
(Look at the food!)

2426
01:24:23,776 --> 01:24:27,546
The owner poured out his soul for this.

2427
01:24:29,156 --> 01:24:30,655
(This place is real.)

2428
01:24:30,656 --> 01:24:33,486
(The food is of great quality to call it fake.)

2429
01:24:33,856 --> 01:24:35,656
But on the other hand,

2430
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:37,895
I don't think this will make any profit.

2431
01:24:37,896 --> 01:24:38,925
It won't.

2432
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:40,466
- It's 160 dollars.
- Right.

2433
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:42,195
- Shouldn't this cost more?
- Yes.

2434
01:24:42,196 --> 01:24:44,235
- As for this, - Just the meat would be pricey.

2435
01:24:44,236 --> 01:24:45,536
just the meat would be pricey.

2436
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:48,836
- The octopus is of great quality.
- Right.

2437
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:50,776
It's not just the legs as well.

2438
01:24:51,306 --> 01:24:53,575
When an octopus is ordered at a restaurant,

2439
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:55,016
it's usually just the legs served.

2440
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:56,845
(The Sixth Sense members are completely lost.)

2441
01:24:56,846 --> 01:24:58,385
This is confusing at the end.

2442
01:24:58,386 --> 01:25:00,146
I have no idea. You guys should decide.

2443
01:25:00,316 --> 01:25:02,055
(Feast of a primitive tribe: 1. Cafe tableware)

2444
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:03,755
(2. High-quality food)

2445
01:25:03,756 --> 01:25:05,456
(3. Unbalanced unit cost)

2446
01:25:05,756 --> 01:25:06,925
(They have to make the final decision now.)

2447
01:25:06,926 --> 01:25:08,026
I knew it.

2448
01:25:08,996 --> 01:25:12,495
- Where's Seok Jin?
- Seok Jin isn't out,

2449
01:25:12,496 --> 01:25:14,896
- but no one is looking for him.
- Where is he?

2450
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,296
Do we part ways with him from here?

2451
01:25:16,766 --> 01:25:18,605
- Do we part ways from here?
- Are we done with him?

2452
01:25:18,606 --> 01:25:21,735
Seok Jin uses the restroom of every place.

2453
01:25:21,736 --> 01:25:24,505
This is a secret, but he has a weak prostate gland.

2454
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:27,876
(This is a secret, but he has a weak prostate gland.)

2455
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,446
(With Jae Seok's merciless exposure,)

2456
01:25:30,646 --> 01:25:32,885
(they go wild in front of the restaurant.)

2457
01:25:32,886 --> 01:25:34,286
Pretend you didn't hear that.

2458
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:35,986
It's a secret, everyone!

2459
01:25:36,556 --> 01:25:38,355
The whole country will pretend not to know.

2460
01:25:38,356 --> 01:25:39,686
- It's weak.
- It's weak.

2461
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:41,556
Let's go!

2462
01:25:43,126 --> 01:25:44,296
Were the cameras rolling?

2463
01:25:45,196 --> 01:25:46,395
- Were the cameras rolling?
- Yes.

2464
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,096
- I told them about you.
- About what?

2465
01:25:48,966 --> 01:25:50,365
- What did you tell them?
- That it's a bit weak.

2466
01:25:50,366 --> 01:25:51,535
Oh, my prostate gland?

2467
01:25:51,536 --> 01:25:53,266
(Oh, my prostate gland?)

2468
01:25:55,176 --> 01:25:57,106
I don't feel embarrassed because it isn't true.

2469
01:25:58,076 --> 01:25:59,605
- It's not true.
- It's not true.

2470
01:25:59,606 --> 01:26:02,245
- It's weak.
- It's not weak.

2471
01:26:02,246 --> 01:26:04,415
Didn't you respond to it right away?

2472
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:06,516
- No!
- "No!"

2473
01:26:07,016 --> 01:26:08,455
- "No!" - No!

2474
01:26:08,456 --> 01:26:09,585
It's not weak.

2475
01:26:09,586 --> 01:26:11,656
The weather is great today.

2476
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:14,685
Right. The skies are so clear these days, aren't they?

2477
01:26:14,686 --> 01:26:15,825
Exactly.

2478
01:26:15,826 --> 01:26:17,156
(Looking up at the sky)

2479
01:26:17,396 --> 01:26:18,396
(Impressed)

2480
01:26:18,866 --> 01:26:19,965
It's amazing.

2481
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,496
(The early fall sky feels a lot higher.)

2482
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,665
I'm not sure if we can get it right though.

2483
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:24,866
Gosh, it's hard.

2484
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:27,366
This is the first episode.

2485
01:26:27,736 --> 01:26:28,736
I have no idea.

2486
01:26:28,737 --> 01:26:29,775
(The Seongsu-dong hot place tour comes to an end.)

2487
01:26:29,776 --> 01:26:30,776
(It's time to decide.)

2488
01:26:30,806 --> 01:26:32,176
We're in big trouble though.

2489
01:26:33,406 --> 01:26:34,505
I have no idea.

2490
01:26:34,506 --> 01:26:36,746
I'm losing confidence.

2491
01:26:37,316 --> 01:26:38,915
- This is how it is, right?
- Yes.

2492
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:39,916
Right. This is normal.

2493
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:42,085
You lose yourself while being here.

2494
01:26:42,086 --> 01:26:44,556
I'm sure you know the concept of our City Tour,

2495
01:26:44,886 --> 01:26:47,055
but all three places were actually run.

2496
01:26:47,056 --> 01:26:49,225
- Right.
- So those who are watching...

2497
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:50,825
might say they have been...

2498
01:26:50,826 --> 01:26:52,626
to all three places.

2499
01:26:53,296 --> 01:26:55,135
When I went to the first place,

2500
01:26:55,136 --> 01:26:56,665
I didn't expect to find the fake place right away.

2501
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:57,766
- It seemed fake.
- Right.

2502
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,666
(A secret room hidden in Seongsu)

2503
01:27:01,406 --> 01:27:03,876
(Based on the conversation with the AI robot,)

2504
01:27:04,806 --> 01:27:08,376
(required nutrients are analyzed...)

2505
01:27:08,576 --> 01:27:11,746
(for the perfect Korean course meal for the body.)

2506
01:27:12,146 --> 01:27:13,445
(Do you have any illnesses...)

2507
01:27:13,446 --> 01:27:14,785
(like diabetes, high blood pressure, or low blood pressure?)

2508
01:27:14,786 --> 01:27:16,115
(I do not have...)

2509
01:27:16,116 --> 01:27:17,486
(diabetes, high blood pressure, or low blood pressure.)

2510
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:20,186
(Korean course meal recommended by the AI)

2511
01:27:20,626 --> 01:27:21,756
(This place is fake, isn't it?)

2512
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:22,896
(No.)

2513
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:23,926
(It's a real restaurant.)

2514
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:25,725
(A smart AI robot that can lie?)

2515
01:27:25,726 --> 01:27:27,866
(Has the truth been revealed by the sudden question?)

2516
01:27:28,636 --> 01:27:31,866
(It's the AI course meal fake?)

2517
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:34,466
The Built-In Sandwich was for the Present.

2518
01:27:34,936 --> 01:27:37,736
(Cow and pig innards are put in.)

2519
01:27:38,276 --> 01:27:40,846
(The offal sandwich that was unheard of)

2520
01:27:41,106 --> 01:27:44,346
(Gosh, it's amazing.)

2521
01:27:44,646 --> 01:27:46,216
(They get surprised the second time by its taste.)

2522
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:49,015
(On top of that, the owner...)

2523
01:27:49,016 --> 01:27:51,956
(is an imaginary figure?)

2524
01:27:52,586 --> 01:27:55,396
(Is the Built-In Sandwich fake?)

2525
01:27:55,656 --> 01:27:57,025
(Next to the regular alleyway,)

2526
01:27:57,026 --> 01:28:00,096
(there's a hidden tribe world.)

2527
01:28:00,496 --> 01:28:03,836
(The interior design makes your mouth open wide.)

2528
01:28:04,536 --> 01:28:05,936
(Gosh, what is this?)

2529
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:08,736
(The scale of the food makes your mouth open wide.)

2530
01:28:09,236 --> 01:28:11,946
(What if a primitive tribe holds a festival?)

2531
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:16,616
(A festival of tastes enjoyed by everyone)

2532
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:21,546
(Is the feast of a primitive tribe fake?)

2533
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:24,155
(Time Machine in Seongsu)

2534
01:28:24,156 --> 01:28:26,456
(Which is the fake place out of these three?)

2535
01:28:26,826 --> 01:28:28,086
This is driving me crazy.

2536
01:28:29,056 --> 01:28:30,195
(Thinking)

2537
01:28:30,196 --> 01:28:33,295
I have a feeling that the last place is fake.

2538
01:28:33,296 --> 01:28:34,466
Who was it again?

2539
01:28:34,626 --> 01:28:36,796
Someone said a restaurant would never smell that way.

2540
01:28:38,136 --> 01:28:40,306
(A strong scent was felt right after entering.)

2541
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:44,006
(A scent that doesn't suit the place as if to cover up something?)

2542
01:28:44,336 --> 01:28:45,905
That suddenly popped in my head.

2543
01:28:45,906 --> 01:28:48,746
I have a strong feeling that it's a cafe.

2544
01:28:48,816 --> 01:28:51,176
Back in time,

2545
01:28:51,476 --> 01:28:54,485
that was how food was shared.

2546
01:28:54,486 --> 01:28:55,556
Right.

2547
01:28:55,756 --> 01:28:57,656
But I suddenly feel like the last place is real.

2548
01:28:59,726 --> 01:29:02,625
During the last five minutes,

2549
01:29:02,626 --> 01:29:05,095
you went back and forth so many times.

2550
01:29:05,096 --> 01:29:06,725
(Was I like that?)

2551
01:29:06,726 --> 01:29:09,236
- He's gullible.
- Gosh.

2552
01:29:09,866 --> 01:29:11,695
Right. This is what this show is like.

2553
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:12,935
(Big Nose Conan, the man upset for being gullible)

2554
01:29:12,936 --> 01:29:14,266
I'm already so gullible.

2555
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:16,735
- Please make your decision.
- What do we do?

2556
01:29:16,736 --> 01:29:17,836
This is so hard.

2557
01:29:18,776 --> 01:29:20,345
I've never heard of the offal sandwich.

2558
01:29:20,346 --> 01:29:21,845
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

2559
01:29:21,846 --> 01:29:23,415
But it tasted so good.

2560
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:24,815
(My head hurts.)

2561
01:29:24,816 --> 01:29:26,315
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Right.

2562
01:29:26,316 --> 01:29:27,785
- The loser will decide.
- Let's do that.

2563
01:29:27,786 --> 01:29:29,356
Rock, paper, scissors.

2564
01:29:29,686 --> 01:29:31,085
- The loser will decide?
- Rock, paper, scissors.

2565
01:29:31,086 --> 01:29:32,655
(A match that has their fates on the line!)

2566
01:29:32,656 --> 01:29:33,685
We won.

2567
01:29:33,686 --> 01:29:34,855
(Seok Jin and Jun Yong survive.)

2568
01:29:34,856 --> 01:29:36,026
The winner will decide?

2569
01:29:36,796 --> 01:29:37,956
It's the winner?

2570
01:29:38,126 --> 01:29:39,295
(The rules get changed right away.)

2571
01:29:39,296 --> 01:29:40,696
- The winner decides.
- I want to lose.

2572
01:29:41,196 --> 01:29:42,866
Rock, paper, scissors.

2573
01:29:43,896 --> 01:29:44,965
Gosh.

2574
01:29:44,966 --> 01:29:46,006
(What?)

2575
01:29:47,206 --> 01:29:49,306
I wanted to lose, but I ended up winning.

2576
01:29:49,606 --> 01:29:52,206
I'm usually awful at rock-paper-scissors.

2577
01:29:53,046 --> 01:29:54,546
Why did I have to win today?

2578
01:29:55,516 --> 01:29:57,745
- Can't you do it, Jun Young?
- Rules are rules.

2579
01:29:57,746 --> 01:29:59,286
- Is that so?
- You have to decide.

2580
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:01,955
- What do you think, Jun Young?
- I think it's number 2 or 3.

2581
01:30:01,956 --> 01:30:03,485
I'm leaning toward number 3.

2582
01:30:03,486 --> 01:30:04,855
- I choose number 1.
- Number 1.

2583
01:30:04,856 --> 01:30:05,926
Right.

2584
01:30:06,456 --> 01:30:09,296
It's number 1 for me. I'm sorry. I'll go with number 1.

2585
01:30:09,456 --> 01:30:10,595
Should I go with number one?

2586
01:30:10,596 --> 01:30:12,496
But number 2 feels so fake for me to choose number 1.

2587
01:30:12,626 --> 01:30:13,626
You should go with number two then.

2588
01:30:13,627 --> 01:30:14,795
- I'll go with number two.
- Right.

2589
01:30:14,796 --> 01:30:16,135
I'll go with number two.

2590
01:30:16,136 --> 01:30:17,735
If I move to number 1 when it's number 2,

2591
01:30:17,736 --> 01:30:19,106
- I'll feel very upset.
- Right.

2592
01:30:19,466 --> 01:30:21,335

- Yes.

This one.

2624
01:31:29,376 --> 01:31:31,906
(Futuristic course meal with AI technology)

2625
01:31:32,206 --> 01:31:34,406
(Future: Chef without a heart)

2626
01:31:34,706 --> 01:31:37,076
But as Jun Young mentioned,

2627
01:31:37,846 --> 01:31:39,446
number one feels off as well.

2628
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,456
(A suspicious businessman from Italy)

2629
01:31:44,486 --> 01:31:46,656
- Actual innards were used.
- It was really good

2630
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,896
It tasted perfect.

2631
01:31:50,426 --> 01:31:51,556
It was really good.

2632
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:53,196
I want to have some more.

2633
01:31:54,296 --> 01:31:56,596
(Present: Built-in sandwich)

2634
01:31:56,696 --> 01:31:58,836
- Number two feels off as well.
- Right.

2635
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:03,136
(Primitive vibes right from the entrance)

2636
01:32:03,306 --> 01:32:04,575
This place had great food as well.

2637
01:32:04,576 --> 01:32:06,006
(Land, sea, and air)

2638
01:32:08,046 --> 01:32:10,276
(A feast on one plate...)

2639
01:32:11,146 --> 01:32:13,516
(that is eaten by hand like primitive tribe members?)

2640
01:32:13,846 --> 01:32:15,586
(Past: Feast of a primitive tribe)

2641
01:32:15,686 --> 01:32:17,086
Could it be number three?

2642
01:32:17,886 --> 01:32:19,025
No way!

2643
01:32:19,026 --> 01:32:20,585
(Could it be number 3?)

2644
01:32:20,586 --> 01:32:26,065
(Which is the fake hot place out of the three?)

2645
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:27,095
I have no idea.

2646
01:32:27,096 --> 01:32:29,236
(Which is the fake hot place out of the three?)

2647
01:32:29,396 --> 01:32:31,296
Number one feels really suspicious.

2648
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:33,035
How are we supposed to figure it out?

2649
01:32:33,036 --> 01:32:34,165
(Which is the fake hot place out of the three?)

2650
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:35,406
This is impossible.

2651
01:32:35,474 --> 01:32:37,235
- What could it be?
- Is it number one?

2652
01:32:37,236 --> 01:32:40,375
(What will be the first answer of Sixth Sense: City Tour 2?)

2653
01:32:40,376 --> 01:32:41,546
Number three.

2654
01:32:42,716 --> 01:32:45,916
(It will be revealed now.)

2655
01:32:46,021 --> 01:32:47,620
- What could it be?
- Is it number one?

2656
01:32:47,621 --> 01:32:50,890
(What will be the first answer of Sixth Sense: City Tour 2?)

2657
01:32:50,891 --> 01:32:51,891
Number three.

2658
01:32:53,216 --> 01:32:56,356
(It will be revealed now.)

2659
01:32:57,856 --> 01:32:59,285
(Future: Chef without a heart)

2660
01:32:59,286 --> 01:33:01,286
(Fake)

2661
01:33:03,856 --> 01:33:05,296
(Screaming)

2662
01:33:06,226 --> 01:33:07,566
It felt like number one.

2663
01:33:08,366 --> 01:33:09,796
It's number one!

2664
01:33:10,696 --> 01:33:12,706
(Disappointed)

2665
01:33:13,136 --> 01:33:14,635
Right. It felt like it.

2666
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:15,906
It was number one.

2667
01:33:16,176 --> 01:33:17,506
Seok Jin!

2668
01:33:17,636 --> 01:33:19,046
I also thought it was number one.

2669
01:33:19,546 --> 01:33:21,346
(He neatly keeps his two hands together for now.)

2670
01:33:21,676 --> 01:33:23,516
I even went through the tests.

2671
01:33:23,716 --> 01:33:25,486
(Why have I done that?)

2672
01:33:25,886 --> 01:33:27,586
(Crying)

2673
01:33:27,746 --> 01:33:30,555
(Romi, fake AI course meal assistant)

2674
01:33:30,556 --> 01:33:33,456
(Robean, fake AI course meal receptionist)

2675
01:33:33,786 --> 01:33:35,185
(How did these two end up going undercover?)

2676
01:33:35,186 --> 01:33:37,056
- I did think it felt complicated.
- Right.

2677
01:33:38,596 --> 01:33:40,665
(AI: A computer system that possesses abilities...)

2678
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:41,695
(of human intelligence such as learning, deducting,)

2679
01:33:41,696 --> 01:33:42,736
(adjusting, and demonstration)

2680
01:33:42,896 --> 01:33:48,135
(The world is currently in an "AI war.")

2681
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:53,776
(AI technology advances quickly over time.)

2682
01:33:54,176 --> 01:34:01,785
(AI has even started appearing in shows.)

2683
01:34:01,786 --> 01:34:03,656
- AI is incredible these days.
- Right.

2684
01:34:04,356 --> 01:34:05,456
It's feisty as well.

2685
01:34:06,386 --> 01:34:08,356
(However,)

2686
01:34:08,926 --> 01:34:11,326
(compared to the US and China who are leading the industry,)

2687
01:34:11,696 --> 01:34:14,826
(Korea's AI technology is viewed to be lacking.)

2688
01:34:15,096 --> 01:34:18,835
(AI technology is direct competitiveness.)

2689
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:21,366
(Big movements are needed for a change.)

2690
01:34:21,736 --> 01:34:26,406
(What if a new realm is opened with Korea's AI?)

2691
01:34:27,006 --> 01:34:29,916
(AI omakase?)

2692
01:34:30,116 --> 01:34:31,946
It did feel like an omakase.

2693
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:35,416
- You mentioned that earlier.
- Right.

2694
01:34:36,116 --> 01:34:37,455
(AI omakase developed...)

2695
01:34:37,456 --> 01:34:41,286
(for the first time?)

2696
01:34:41,456 --> 01:34:45,025
(But how is this possible?)

2697
01:34:45,026 --> 01:34:47,096
(D-82 to the 1st shoot)

2698
01:34:47,926 --> 01:34:49,565
- It was 82 days before the shoot?
- It was developed?

2699
01:34:49,566 --> 01:34:51,595
Saying that the place was actually run...

2700
01:34:51,596 --> 01:34:52,835
means it was developed.

2701
01:34:52,836 --> 01:34:54,365
(It means AI omakase was developed.)

2702
01:34:54,366 --> 01:34:55,435
(Amazed)

2703
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:57,076
Gosh, this is amazing.

2704
01:34:57,736 --> 01:35:01,306
(The obsessed staff members went to the hub of AI development.)

2705
01:35:01,476 --> 01:35:03,046
You went to Pangyo?

2706
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:04,745
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing.

2707
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:08,616
(At the place full of various kinds of robots,)

2708
01:35:08,816 --> 01:35:12,356
(who is this person at work?)

2709
01:35:12,656 --> 01:35:14,355
It's that person from earlier!

2710
01:35:14,356 --> 01:35:15,656
The one who served us?

2711
01:35:16,656 --> 01:35:19,195
(I will help you.)

2712
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:21,826
(He naturally explained how to use the robot.)

2713
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:25,196
(He was definitely a college part-timer.)

2714
01:35:25,396 --> 01:35:26,535
(What is going on?)

2715
01:35:26,536 --> 01:35:28,206
- Right. It's him!
- It's him!

2716
01:35:28,366 --> 01:35:33,306
I am not the part-timer of the AI course meal restaurant.

2717
01:35:33,746 --> 01:35:36,945
I am the team leader of the AI innovation development team.

2718
01:35:36,946 --> 01:35:38,676
I'm Researcher Jeon Guk Seong.

2719
01:35:40,086 --> 01:35:42,986
(They got fooled.)

2720
01:35:43,116 --> 01:35:44,656
He's even the team leader.

2721
01:35:45,386 --> 01:35:46,855
I think he can become an actor.

2722
01:35:46,856 --> 01:35:48,555
- Right.
- Right.

2723
01:35:48,556 --> 01:35:49,696
(A great compliment from the popular actor)

2724
01:35:50,056 --> 01:35:54,125
It's a company that develops carebots for vulnerable groups.

2725
01:35:54,126 --> 01:35:55,566
(A company that develops carebots for vulnerable groups)

2726
01:35:55,896 --> 01:35:57,995
We were announced as Korea's Robot Company...

2727
01:35:57,996 --> 01:35:59,105
- of the Year.
- But...

2728
01:35:59,106 --> 01:36:00,465
he did feel like an engineering student.

2729
01:36:00,466 --> 01:36:03,105
Right. It seemed true.

2730
01:36:03,106 --> 01:36:04,335
(A talented AI company that swept away various awards)

2731
01:36:04,336 --> 01:36:08,175
We thought of the AI omakase for the first episode.

2732
01:36:08,176 --> 01:36:11,515
Since we were liberal arts students, we don't know much about technology.

2733
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:12,615
It was based just on our imagination.

2734
01:36:12,616 --> 01:36:15,245
AI would analyze the person's body condition...

2735
01:36:15,246 --> 01:36:18,055
and an omakase meal is served based on that.

2736
01:36:18,056 --> 01:36:21,485
That is the basic concept we have thought of.

2737
01:36:21,486 --> 01:36:24,026
We came here today to ask if this is possible to realize?

2738
01:36:24,496 --> 01:36:27,896
We have some of the features you have mentioned,

2739
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:30,635
but it's quite hard to...

2740
01:36:30,636 --> 01:36:33,406
mix those features together.

2741
01:36:34,036 --> 01:36:36,106
It was never developed before.

2742
01:36:37,276 --> 01:36:40,745
To measure body fat, the InBody feature will be needed.

2743
01:36:40,746 --> 01:36:43,175
To check one's sugar level,

2744
01:36:43,176 --> 01:36:44,745
- blood is required.
- There's no other way to know.

2745
01:36:44,746 --> 01:36:46,145
It won't be accurate.

2746
01:36:46,146 --> 01:36:47,185
Who would get blood collected...

2747
01:36:47,186 --> 01:36:48,245
- to have a meal?
- That doesn't make sense.

2748
01:36:48,246 --> 01:36:49,285
Exactly.

2749
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:52,355
This is our aim with City Tour.

2750
01:36:52,356 --> 01:36:53,985
We want to give hope to small business owners...

2751
01:36:53,986 --> 01:36:55,626
who are struggling.

2752
01:36:56,296 --> 01:36:59,065
In Season Two, we wondered if we could...

2753
01:36:59,066 --> 01:37:00,866
utilize Korea's AI technology.

2754
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:07,306
(They seem torn with the difficult proposal.)

2755
01:37:07,506 --> 01:37:09,976
I think we should come up with a new app.

2756
01:37:10,006 --> 01:37:13,005
Another tablet will be set up...

2757
01:37:13,006 --> 01:37:16,616
to measure and enter one's body fat.

2758
01:37:17,246 --> 01:37:18,475
(Specific dates are set as well.)

2759
01:37:18,476 --> 01:37:20,645
That's a relief. They decided to help out.

2760
01:37:20,646 --> 01:37:22,485
(D-80 to the 1st shoot)

2761
01:37:22,486 --> 01:37:26,226
(A completely new AI technology must be developed!)

2762
01:37:26,386 --> 01:37:28,856
It is currently 4:30am.

2763
01:37:29,456 --> 01:37:30,656
Gosh!

2764
01:37:31,256 --> 01:37:32,395
They worked so hard.

2765
01:37:32,396 --> 01:37:33,466
(They even fell asleep out of exhaustion.)

2766
01:37:33,626 --> 01:37:35,866
They must feel delighted that I got it wrong.

2767
01:37:37,096 --> 01:37:38,396
- Right.
- Right?

2768
01:37:38,966 --> 01:37:40,165
They worked that hard to prepare for this.

2769
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:41,166
(Lucky Big Nose)

2770
01:37:41,167 --> 01:37:43,805
(Will the AI omakase that was only imagined of...)

2771
01:37:43,806 --> 01:37:45,476
(be able to come true?)

2772
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:49,076
(Where will the AI omakase be run?)

2773
01:37:49,876 --> 01:37:52,246
(There are many hot places in Seongsu.)

2774
01:37:52,646 --> 01:37:55,046
(Find a place that suits Sixth Sense.)

2775
01:37:55,586 --> 01:37:58,755
(A small alley by a construction site)

2776
01:37:58,756 --> 01:38:00,325
It was that place by the construction site.

2777
01:38:00,326 --> 01:38:01,486
Right.

2778
01:38:01,756 --> 01:38:02,756
(What is the real identity of this place?)

2779
01:38:02,757 --> 01:38:05,095
We are a handmade tofu restaurant.

2780
01:38:05,096 --> 01:38:07,566
We make tofu based on the traditional method.

2781
01:38:08,326 --> 01:38:10,895
- The owner was a great cook.
- It was a handmade tofu restaurant.

2782
01:38:10,896 --> 01:38:13,166
- The food was really good.
- The food was really good.

2783
01:38:13,736 --> 01:38:15,605
Without using artificial flavor enhancers,

2784
01:38:15,606 --> 01:38:19,105
we ran the place with food made with natural ingredients.

2785
01:38:19,106 --> 01:38:20,746
(The place was run with food made with natural ingredients.)

2786
01:38:21,006 --> 01:38:22,545
(Korea Customer Industry Appraisal, Food Service Industry)

2787
01:38:22,546 --> 01:38:25,615
(The owner was serious about making healthy food...)

2788
01:38:25,616 --> 01:38:28,615
(and received the Excellence Award for 3 consecutive years.)

2789
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:29,756
Do you get a lot of customers?

2790
01:38:30,586 --> 01:38:33,025
There are a lot of people who walk by,

2791
01:38:33,026 --> 01:38:36,096
but it's very hard for them to actually come in.

2792
01:38:36,196 --> 01:38:38,096
- There was a construction site.
- Right. It was in the corner.

2793
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:41,225
There's a lot of noise and vibration.

2794
01:38:41,226 --> 01:38:43,465
Many customers have stopped coming.

2795
01:38:43,466 --> 01:38:46,705
Our sales have dropped by around 50 percent...

2796
01:38:46,706 --> 01:38:47,806
and I am very concerned.

2797
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:50,336
- Her food was great.
- Right.

2798
01:38:50,606 --> 01:38:52,975
It was hard to be suspicious because the food was good.

2799
01:38:52,976 --> 01:38:54,346
- Right.
- The food was amazing.

2800

(A special measure for the owner, "AI Korean cuisine course meal)

2801
01:39:00,246 --> 01:39:01,946
Is there anything you feel worried about?

01:39:02,286 --> 01:39:04,016
"Will I be able to make all of the dishes?"

2803
01:39:04,216 --> 01:39:05,725
There are many ingredients...

2804
01:39:05,726 --> 01:39:07,985
and it's important to take good care of them.

2805
01:39:07,986 --> 01:39:09,355
Keeping ingredients in good condition is important...

2806
01:39:09,356 --> 01:39:10,696
for healthy food.

2807
01:39:10,896 --> 01:39:13,096

(Appeared on "Culinary Class Wars")

2809
01:39:16,036 --> 01:39:17,096

2810
01:39:17,766 --> 01:39:19,735
(The leader...)

(of well-being Korean cuisine)

2812
01:39:22,066 --> 01:39:23,376
It's him!

2813
01:39:24,136 --> 01:39:25,876
- It's him!
- The one with half-closed eyes.

2814
01:39:26,176 --> 01:39:28,045
I run a noodle restaurant called Myeon Seoul.

(Kim Do Yun)

2816
01:39:29,946 --> 01:39:31,346
- It's Chef Kim Do Yun.
- It's Chef Kim Do Yun.

2817
01:39:31,876 --> 01:39:34,545
It has been 33 years since I have cooked.

2818
01:39:34,546 --> 01:39:38,085
I dry-age various ingredients such as seafood...

2819
01:39:38,086 --> 01:39:39,626
to make broths.

(Nutrition)

2825
01:39:50,596 --> 01:39:51,996
- The food was amazing.
- No wonder it was great.

2826
01:39:52,336 --> 01:39:53,835
- The seaweed salad was great.
- It was truly amazing.

2827
01:39:53,836 --> 01:39:54,866
(Not a single mistake will be accepted.)

2828
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:57,475

(Dozens of healthy Korean cuisine dishes)

2830
01:39:59,146 --> 01:40:02,205
I brought different things like vegetables.

2831
01:40:02,206 --> 01:40:03,645
(The two have gathered for the recipes.)

2832
01:40:03,646 --> 01:40:06,085
There are many dishes that have to be made.

2833
01:40:06,086 --> 01:40:07,216
There are around 20 dishes.

2834
01:40:07,446 --> 01:40:10,356
So he taught those dishes to the owner himself.

2835
01:40:10,486 --> 01:40:12,686
But we said it was the taste of a major company.

(Closing his eyes)

2837
01:40:14,187 --> 01:40:15,996
No wonder I enjoyed the food so much.

(Writing)

2839
01:40:19,366 --> 01:40:21,896
It's great that he decided to be on our show,

2840
01:40:22,296 --> 01:40:25,566
but it's even better that he was able to help the owner.

2841
01:40:26,306 --> 01:40:27,436
Not bad.

2842
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:32,075
(She learned the exact recipes from the chef.)

2843
01:40:32,076 --> 01:40:35,075
It's amazing how she learned 20 dishes as well.

2844

(To fool everyone,)

2845
01:40:36,946 --> 01:40:38,975
(something was created from nothing.)

2846
01:40:38,976 --> 01:40:41,845

(Eye-closing skill)

2848
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:47,025
- The salmon was amazing.
- We missed the steamed dish.

Watching this is making me hungry after eating that much.

2854
01:40:57,136 --> 01:40:58,235

2855
01:40:58,236 --> 01:40:59,635
(There's only one thing left.)

2856
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:01,336
Come to Pangyo, Producer.

2857
01:41:01,536 --> 01:41:03,205
It's about the things that will talk about with the robot.

2858
01:41:03,206 --> 01:41:05,375
You should see the demonstration first.

2859
01:41:05,376 --> 01:41:06,505
Right. We will take a look.

2861
01:41:08,276 --> 01:41:10,015
(Around two months of development)

2862
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,716
(Will it be perfectly realized?)

2863
01:41:12,986 --> 01:41:14,985
It will start with the user...

2864
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,356
taking the test at the booth.

2865
01:41:17,716 --> 01:41:19,686
Press the "menu recommendation" button next.

2866
01:41:20,526 --> 01:41:24,696
It will analyze the biometric data of one's face.

2867
01:41:24,796 --> 01:41:27,126
That is how the health information is entered.

2868
01:41:27,426 --> 01:41:29,366
The researchers are amazing.

2869
01:41:29,436 --> 01:41:31,665
So that was what we did earlier.

2870
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:32,806
We went through the InBody test.

2871
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:35,836
Stress and other information.

2872
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:38,135
Do you have any illnesses...

2873
01:41:38,136 --> 01:41:40,276
like diabetes, high blood pressure, or low blood pressure?

2874
01:41:40,506 --> 01:41:42,446
And like so,

2875
01:41:42,576 --> 01:41:44,776
- this is the menu list.
- Right.

2876
01:41:44,976 --> 01:41:46,045
(This was for a test run.)

2877
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:47,446
So the technology was real.

2878
01:41:48,146 --> 01:41:49,216

They came up with the technology like that.

2882
01:41:54,786 --> 01:41:56,355
- I feel truly grateful.
- They made it happen.

(The AI Korean cuisine course meal development was a great success.)

2884
01:41:57,926 --> 01:42:00,465
There are a few that are nice...

2885
01:42:00,466 --> 01:42:02,425
and a few that could be changed.

(Kim Hwi Hyeon, dietitian)

2887
01:42:03,436 --> 01:42:05,096
It would be great if you could tell us those things.

2888
01:42:05,436 --> 01:42:09,735
Mushroom pot rice or pollack roe pot rice would be nice.

2889
01:42:09,736 --> 01:42:11,175
They went that far for this.

2890
01:42:11,176 --> 01:42:12,435
Gosh, this is amazing.

(AI Korean cuisine course meal)

2894
01:42:19,246 --> 01:42:21,315
- Gosh, AI omakase.
- It can be searched for?

2895
01:42:21,316 --> 01:42:22,515
Really?

2896
01:42:22,516 --> 01:42:24,015
- They even got that done.
- It's 55 dollars.

2897
01:42:24,016 --> 01:42:25,255
It has the price as well.

2898
01:42:25,256 --> 01:42:26,526
(Even a course meal is prepared for you.)

2899
01:42:26,886 --> 01:42:31,425
(It became a hit instantly on social media when it opened.)

2900
01:42:31,426 --> 01:42:32,865
(Unbelievable. A personalized meal? I want to go there.)

2901

(Actual comments on social media)

2902
01:42:34,366 --> 01:42:35,625
That's amazing.

2903
01:42:35,626 --> 01:42:37,096
(- This is exactly what I did. - It sounds like a rare experience.)

2904
01:42:37,596 --> 01:42:40,735
(All places were sold out in September and October.)

2905
01:42:40,736 --> 01:42:42,636
- Both months were sold out?
- They were sold out?

2906
01:42:43,036 --> 01:42:45,136
- Both months were sold out?
- They were sold out?

(Impressed)

2908

Seriously?

2909
01:42:48,146 --> 01:42:49,476
That's incredible.

(They opened the first AI Korean cuisine course meal restaurant.)

2911
01:42:54,146 --> 01:42:57,055
Sixth Sense viewers, this menu is...

2912
01:42:57,056 --> 01:42:58,455
It's fake.

2913
01:42:58,456 --> 01:42:59,956

- I didn't expect this.

(Flustered)

2918
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:09,566
I didn't expect this.

2919
01:43:09,896 --> 01:43:12,496
(Did they come up with technology that didn't exist?)

2920
01:43:12,536 --> 01:43:14,706
It seemed real.

2921
01:43:14,966 --> 01:43:16,505
Including the food,

2922
01:43:16,506 --> 01:43:18,135
- this is surprising.
- The food was very good.

2923
01:43:18,136 --> 01:43:19,975

2924
01:43:19,976 --> 01:43:21,805

- My goodness.

(Stunned)

2927
01:43:25,746 --> 01:43:26,945
The t-shirts are here.

2928
01:43:26,946 --> 01:43:28,515
(From the popular store they visited this morning,)

2929
01:43:28,516 --> 01:43:30,415
(the customized group t-shirts arrive.)

2930
01:43:30,416 --> 01:43:31,616
- My size is small.
- Small.

2931
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,656
(Overwhelming)

2932
01:43:34,826 --> 01:43:36,156
- This is...
- Gosh.

2933
01:43:36,196 --> 01:43:37,926
- Jun Young, are you putting it on?
- No.

2934
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:40,466
(What are you saying?)

2935
01:43:40,566 --> 01:43:41,925
Please put it on.

2936
01:43:41,926 --> 01:43:44,665
When I get a chance, I will.

2937
01:43:44,666 --> 01:43:46,005
I don't think...

2938
01:43:46,006 --> 01:43:47,235
- I can guess it.
- All right.

2939
01:43:47,236 --> 01:43:49,035
The one who gets picked will...

2940
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:51,405
write a post on social media a day before the show.

2941
01:43:51,406 --> 01:43:53,245
This is really...

2942
01:43:53,246 --> 01:43:54,305
- Jun Young.
- Yes?

2943
01:43:54,306 --> 01:43:55,306
Please pick one person.

2944
01:43:55,307 --> 01:43:56,346
(Jun Young gets to pick.)

2945
01:43:56,616 --> 01:43:57,616
- Please.
- Please.

2946
01:43:57,617 --> 01:43:58,646
Don't pick my name.

2947
01:43:58,846 --> 01:44:00,746
(The one who got picked the most is the most nervous.)

2948
01:44:00,786 --> 01:44:02,515
(Who will get the penalty?)

2949
01:44:02,516 --> 01:44:03,756
- It's Mimi.
- It's Mimi again.

2950
01:44:04,686 --> 01:44:05,785
It's Mimi again.

2951
01:44:05,786 --> 01:44:08,556
(She defended the title of the most penalized member.)

2952
01:44:08,656 --> 01:44:10,956
(Sixth Sense equation: Mimi minus penalty equals 0.)

2953
01:44:11,056 --> 01:44:14,026
(He feels bad for her.)

2954
01:44:14,126 --> 01:44:17,035
People won't know that you're being penalized.

2955
01:44:17,036 --> 01:44:18,265
- Always...
- They'll think that it's you.

2956
01:44:18,266 --> 01:44:20,005
They'll think that it's what you do.

2957
01:44:20,006 --> 01:44:21,765
It's always me who writes posts.

2958
01:44:21,766 --> 01:44:23,405
I'll write a good post while wearing this.

2959
01:44:23,406 --> 01:44:25,035
Do it while wearing the t-shirt.

2960
01:44:25,036 --> 01:44:26,876
(Check out Mimi's social media now who got the penalty.)

2961
01:44:27,083 --> 01:44:29,782
(The second place, Daejeon)

2962
01:44:29,783 --> 01:44:31,552
(It's hot...)

2963
01:44:31,553 --> 01:44:32,553
(and a lot of fun.)

2964
01:44:32,554 --> 01:44:33,582
(Daejeon)

2965
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:35,282
(A hot guest who makes Daejeon even hotter)

2966
01:44:35,283 --> 01:44:36,552
Forearm muscles, you cut it.

2967
01:44:36,553 --> 01:44:38,193
(Kim Ji Hoon with hot forearm muscles)

2968
01:44:38,393 --> 01:44:40,063
Look at his forearm muscles.

2969
01:44:40,393 --> 01:44:42,593
(Cheering)

2970
01:44:42,863 --> 01:44:44,662
(He makes his fans happy.)

2971
01:44:44,663 --> 01:44:45,933
(Pumping his forearm muscles)

2972
01:44:46,133 --> 01:44:47,362
I want to try it too.

2973
01:44:47,363 --> 01:44:48,463
Ji Hye.

2974
01:44:49,303 --> 01:44:51,172
It doesn't require any strength.

2975
01:44:51,173 --> 01:44:53,173
(Seo Ji Hye knocks down his forearm muscles.)

2976
01:44:53,403 --> 01:44:55,203
In my opinion, the glove...

2977
01:44:55,403 --> 01:44:58,143
(The deity of reasoning who's detailed)

2978
01:44:58,173 --> 01:44:59,412
You wear it on your left hand.

2979
01:44:59,413 --> 01:45:01,082
(Her blunt charm lacks by 2 percent.)

2980
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:02,512
How did she put it on by force?

2981
01:45:02,513 --> 01:45:03,652
(Wrinkled)

2982
01:45:03,653 --> 01:45:05,413
(Ji Hye reasons with force.)

2983
01:45:05,453 --> 01:45:07,122
Isn't this also ready-made?

2984
01:45:07,123 --> 01:45:08,282
Could you say that after the owner has left?

2985
01:45:08,283 --> 01:45:09,323
(The owner)

2986
01:45:09,423 --> 01:45:12,052
(Ji Hoon's shortsighted reasoning)

2987
01:45:12,053 --> 01:45:15,062
(Figuring out which is fake with Ji Hye and Ji Hoon)

2988
01:45:15,063 --> 01:45:18,062
(Daejeon, the city that explodes with bread?)

2989
01:45:18,063 --> 01:45:19,332
(An explosive...)

2990
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:20,803
(taste)

2991
01:45:20,903 --> 01:45:21,962
(Explosive...)

2992
01:45:21,963 --> 01:45:23,302
(curiosity)

2993
01:45:23,303 --> 01:45:25,002
(The blunt members' reasoning gets...)

2994
01:45:25,003 --> 01:45:26,873
(zero points.)

2995
01:45:27,373 --> 01:45:33,583
(Most powerful Daejeon where you laugh endlessly)

2996
