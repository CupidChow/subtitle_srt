1
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:18,411
(A year passed, and the new year 2026 is here.)

2
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:20,011
Happy New Year.

3
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:22,512
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

4
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:24,252
- By the way, - Yes?

5
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:26,752
Our last episode is getting aired on the New Year's Day.

6
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:28,721
- That's odd. - It's odd.

7
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:30,251
If it had been aired on December 31,

8
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:31,821
it would've been perfect.

9
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:33,121
It's New Year's Day for everyone,

10
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,362
- but this is our last episode. - I'm sorry.

11
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:37,131
- Anyway, - Yes.

12
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,101
- we started shooting in the summer. - We started in the summer.

13
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:40,861
The shoot ends in the winter.

14
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:41,871
It ends in the winter.

15
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,531
Let's start shooting Season Three right after this.

16
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:45,672
That sounds good.

17
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:47,201
- You know what's clear? - What?

18
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:48,442
They're young.

19
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:51,742
We're dressed young including me.

20
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:54,241
- We're dressed young including me. - "UCLA?"

21
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,651
You must be entering college.

22
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,251
(A freshman outfit)

23
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:58,582
I grabbed it immediately.

24
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:00,081
It looks trendy in the back too.

25
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:02,491
Are you entering college for senior citizens?

26
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:03,651
(Losing his temper)

27
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,892
I mean...

28
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:08,891
- College for senior citizens? - I'll hit you on New Year's Day.

29
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:11,092
- Did I do something wrong? - I'll scold you.

30
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,102
Did I do something wrong to get hit?

31
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:15,572
(And here...)

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,131
(Kyung Pyo is shrunken due to the cold.)

33
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,371
You look very cold.

34
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:23,172
Yes, I'm only wearing these today.

35
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:25,542
- Gosh, are you okay? - What's this?

36
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:28,242
- What's this? - Didn't you lose weight?

37
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,611
I must lose weight starting from January 1.

38
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,851
- I have this much left to lose. - Right.

39
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:34,372
He'll be on a diet starting next year.

40
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,491
We'll be spending our last time in Gangnam.

41
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:38,862
In Gangnam?

42
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:41,261
(Today's destination)

43
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:43,362
(The center of Seoul, Gangnam)

44
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,532
(Economy)

45
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:49,132
(Shopping)

46
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,072
(Tourism)

47
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,842
(Gangnam is a globally popular place now.)

48
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:59,681
(The ultimate dopamine rush)

49
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,181
(A shocking truth...)

50
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:04,951
(that you won't believe even after seeing it)

51
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:09,492
(A special guest with spectacular hand skills)

52
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:12,262
(What is the fake in Gangnam that's fooling you?)

53
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:14,661
I've been going there a lot for a long time.

54
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,761
- He kept saying, "I should have..." - I have many memories there.

55
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,801
- "bought real estate here." - If Seok Jin...

56
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:19,961
I always say that.

57
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:22,362
If Seok Jin had enough money, he'd have bought all of Seoul.

58
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:25,272
(He can't deny it.)

59
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:27,002
If he had money...

60
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,371
- Here's what I've realized in life. - Yes?

61
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:31,371
If you want to be happy, you can't be greedy.

62
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:33,912
Then why did you say that earlier in the morning?

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,351
I haven't gotten rid of my greed yet.

64
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:36,451
(He's still too greedy to be happy.)

65
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:37,611
I'm not happy yet.

66
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:40,182
Considering your greed, you don't have much.

67
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,692
That's correct.

68
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:46,791
- He regrets it. - There's a huge gap.

69
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,292
- Yes. - Goodness.

70
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:50,391
"BTS in Gangnam."

71
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:52,331
- What? BTS? - Yes.

72
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:54,402
(Is BTS in Gangnam?)

73
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,932
"Beef on Tissue?"

74
00:02:57,872 --> 00:02:59,802
"Lottery Winner's Fiery Trend."

75
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,912
"Space where Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears, and Hands are Busy."

76
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,711
(Number 1, Beef on Tissue)

77
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:07,281
(Eating on a tissue without a plate)

78
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:09,011
(A new concept steak?)

79
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:10,881
(No more ordinary burgers)

80
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,522
(A burger with tissue instead of buns for losing weight?)

81
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:19,062
(Number 2, Lottery Winner's Fiery Trend)

82
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:21,691
(Hidden at a famous lottery spot)

83
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:25,962
(Fiery and trendy food for the MZers?)

84
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:28,931
(Number 3, Space where Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears, and Hands are Busy)

85
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:31,412
(A restaurant for extroverts where the customers participate?)

86
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,301
(Or a virtual reality dining experience made for introverts?)

87
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:37,111
(Three places to decorate the last episode in Gangnam)

88
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:41,342
(Which one is fake?)

89
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,381
They forced it into BTS.

90
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:44,552
- I'm sorry. - It's not BTS.

91
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,282
- I apologize. I love you, BTS. - I'm sorry.

92
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,751
The first one is related to beef.

93
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:51,021
- Beef. - That's great.

94
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,221
- We know most of the places. - Yes.

95
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:54,691
- Famous restaurants in Gangnam. - I know...

96
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,332
Gangnam inside out.

97
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:59,662
Next is "Lottery Winner's Fiery Trend."

98
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,431
There must be many lottery winners at that place.

99
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,792
(A lucky lottery spot in Gangnam?)

100
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:06,372
"Space where Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears, and Hands are Busy."

101
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,971
Where eyes, nose, mouth, and hands are busy?

102
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,942
- We have to go there to find out. - Right.

103
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:11,211
It sounds unusual.

104
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:14,542
Even though I've lived in Gangnam for a long time,

105
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:16,782
I don't know many popular places here.

106
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,151
(A resident in Gangnam who lacks confident)

107
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,721
- You're honest. - I don't walk around much.

108
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,002
Popular places won't welcome us.

109
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,291
- They won't welcome us. - I don't know many places.

110
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,521
We can't mingle with others at popular places.

111
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:27,622
By the way,

112
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,232
there are so many flowers on him today.

113
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,332
They hurt my eyes.

114
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,772
- They hurt my eyes. - I mean,

115
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,171
I don't know how to bring it up.

116
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:40,672
- What do you mean? - I feel uncomfortable around him.

117
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:44,112
He became excessive. He went overboard.

118
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,912
You told me to wear a diaper.

119
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:48,192
I'll give you credit if you wear a diaper.

120
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:50,481
- If you wear a diaper... - And ride a stroller.

121
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,681
I'll push you around in a stroller.

122
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,681
If we get to shoot another season,

123
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,768
I'll push him around in a stroller on the first episode.

124
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:57,951
That's a great idea.

125
00:04:57,952 --> 00:04:59,622
Jee Seok Jin's time flows in reverse.

126
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,461
- It sounds good. - Let's go to the meeting place.

127
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,631
- Okay. - Let's go.

128
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,932
(At that time)

129
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:11,472
(A bakery cafe that's filled with the winter vibe)

130
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,272
I should try the best one.

131
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:17,441
This looks very delicious.

132
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,322
(Today's guest is picking out bread carefully.)

133
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,742

(Who is the guest who knows the Sixth Sense members' tastes?)

135
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,922
This street is familiar.

136
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:29,691
I came here...

137
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:31,521
so many times...

138
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,422
- when I was young. - We went out a lot here.

139
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,462
- This was our living area. - Exactly.

140
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,761
What made this place popular?

141
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,231
Was it a popular place?

142
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,561
It was a hangout...

143
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:41,731
for hip young people.

144
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,201
Don't you know about the Apgujeong Orange Group of rich kids?

145
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,031
Is this where the Orange Group was?

146
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,672
- Of course. - It was packed with them.

147
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:51,472
(The Orange Group that went around everywhere in Apgujeong)

148

(Indian style tied-back hair)

149
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:56,412
Who is today's guest?

150
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,412
Wait, this must be the cafe.

151
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:00,981
- Who is it? Isn't it Shin Hye? - Who is it?

152
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:02,392
- She looks so pretty. - Gosh.

153
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:05,761
- It's Shin Hye. - It's a big star.

154
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:07,021

- We're shooting a drama together. - Yes.

167
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,721
Kyung Pyo told me about it.

168
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,861
Right, we're in a drama together.

169
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:41,891

00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:01,642
(Our Kyung Pyo is also in it.)

180
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,251
Kyung Pyo, are you also in the drama?

181
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:04,452
- He is. - Yes, I am.

182
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:07,122
Kyung Pyo was pretending not to be in it.

183
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:09,521
I had no idea.

184
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:10,591
(They almost didn't know.)

185
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,421
I have to do my main job from time to time.

186
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:13,792
Of course.

187
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,491
Investigating as an undercover sounds fun.

188
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:17,161
We have a lot to say about the IMF crisis.

189
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:19,431
- You and I experienced it. - You experienced it?

190
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,601
We did, but we didn't have money back then.

191
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:22,632
Right.

192
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,602
- I didn't suffer from it. - Really?

193
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:26,301
- We didn't have... - I see.

194
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:27,501
- money to lose. - We didn't have any money...

195
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,371
- to lose. - That's a relief.

196
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:32,582
- Gosh. Look, Seok Jin. - Oh, my.

197
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,581
- It looks good. Christmas... - Look how pretty it is.

198
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:37,411
I shouldn't be tempted, but look at this.

199
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:38,888
(The place where the Sixth Sense members are tempted)

200
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:39,982
It looks delicious.

201
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,821
There's a lot of delicious bread.

202
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,668
(A new popular place that's famous for various salted butter rolls)

203
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,621
(Salted butter rolls' transformation is innocent.)

204
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:48,362
This looks so pretty.

205
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:53,331
(A sacred place for salted butter rolls...)

206
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:55,632
(that's also popular in social media)

207
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,331
Shin Hye already got a lot on the tray.

208
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,401
Shin Hye picked a lot.

209
00:07:58,402 --> 00:07:59,441
- We can eat these. - Mimi likes...

210
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,671
sweets very much.

211
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:03,142
Thank you.

212
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:04,541
This is nice.

213
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,111
I'd like an iced Americano.

214
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,952
- Me too. - It's always iced Americano for me.

215
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,612
I'd also like an iced Americano.

216
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,682
He never learns.

217
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:12,982
(Terrified)

218
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,621
Mister, you're being harsh.

219
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:15,851
He only learns the hard way.

220
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,351
Do you want to get scolded on New Year's Day?

221
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:18,491
You could get frostbite...

222
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,221
from drinking iced Americano.

223
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,321
(Being cheeky)

224
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:22,561
How about you, Shin Hye?

225
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,062
- I'd like a hot Americano. - A hot Americano?

226
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:27,501
Shin Hye, this will be aired on January 1.

227
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:29,971
Could you wish the viewers Happy New Year?

228
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:33,572
Everyone, Happy New Year in 2026.

229
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:36,271
(She's the type who doesn't refuse when asked.)

230
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,712
- The year is already 2026. - I know.

231
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:42,481
- It's disgusting. - It's still 2025 at the moment.

232
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:43,982
- At the moment? - At the moment.

233
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,582
Why are you stating the obvious?

234
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:48,881
I state the obvious a lot.

235
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:50,091
I'll do it 18 more times.

236
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,291
Shall we go upstairs?

237
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:54,722
(Let's go up to the 2nd floor.)

238
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:57,191
Kyung Pyo, tell us about your character.

239
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:59,402
In the drama? I play...

240
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:00,932
the CEO of a securities company.

241
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:03,532
That's amazing.

242
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:04,901
You're successful at a young age.

243
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:05,941
(Ko Kyung Pyo became successful.)

244
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,201
In the drama, I'm not that young.

245
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,842
As the drama takes place during the IMF crisis,

246
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,781
I can't wait to watch it.

247
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,512
During the IMF crisis,

248
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:17,111
KOSPI dropped all the way to 400.

249
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,912
- It's about a securities company. - Right.

250
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,728
- Is it mentioned in the drama? - Did you buy stocks then?

251
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:22,792
No, I didn't.

252
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:24,321
(Flaring up)

253
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,321
I'm sorry. You're here as a guest.

254
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:27,791
I don't want to show this side of me.

255
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,361
He bought stocks when KOSPI was 4,000.

256
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,431
(Purchased when KOSPI was 4,000)

257
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:31,912
He couldn't buy them when it was 400.

258
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,202
So I'm very anxious these days.

259
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,432
I don't know what it will be when this gets aired.

260
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,978
- I'm extremely anxious. - Did you hear what Seok Sam did?

261
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:41,071
This is what top investors do.

262
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:43,088
I'm an expert at buying stocks at the highest price.

263
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,112
He bought them when it was 4,000.

264
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:45,611
I buy stocks at the highest price.

265
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:48,581
I watched "Earth Arcade..."

266
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:51,051
- from start to finish. - Gosh.

267
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:53,182
- I've wanted to meet her the most. - You mean, Mimi?

268
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,222
- Yes. - Why?

269
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,652
- She's so cute. - Right.

270
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,322
- Thank you so much. - Without realizing it,

271
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,938
I almost said hello by saying "Ttorukyu Makto."

272
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:03,492
(Ttorukyu Makto?)

273
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,861
Three, two, one.

274
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:07,131
(Ttorukyu Makto?)

275
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,172
(An uncommon catchphrase that Mimi created)

276
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,842
- I see you. - I see you.

277
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:14,301
(Happy)

278
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:15,642
I'm an alien.

279
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:19,712
She even styled her hair like a character in "Avatar."

280
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:23,782
She's doing it for her.

281
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,221
- Mimi is doing it for her. - You're playing along.

282
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:27,751
She's so lovely.

283
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,851
- Gosh, thank you. - You're right.

284
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,892
You'll see many of my shortcomings.

285
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,461
Your shortcomings?

286
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,462
(Anticipating)

287
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:34,562
It's here.

288
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:38,092
- He looks amazing. - He looks amazing.

289
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:41,232
- Thank you. - Thank you.

290
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:43,031
Look at these.

291
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:44,601
There are so many types of salted butter rolls.

292
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,282
I know. There are so many different types.

293
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:48,472
Gosh, it's full of delicious bread.

294
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,342
(A variety of signature drinks)

295
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,011
What? There's tiramisu on top.

296
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,582
This is the tiramisu drink.

297
00:10:56,852 --> 00:11:01,452
(Tiramisu covering the latte)

298
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:03,792
This is...

299
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:06,062
I'm wearing the same color again today.

300
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,221
(A matching look with matcha)

301
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,762
You're right. You're wearing the pretty color of green tea.

302
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,901
- I've never seen a drink like this. - Me neither.

303
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:14,132
Honestly,

304
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,871
it looks like someone put cake on top of a drink.

305
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,202
(Lost for words)

306
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,342
Right? Have you ever thought...

307
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:22,101
of this idea?

308
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:23,772
If my employee came up with this idea,

309
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,442
I would've said, "Don't be ridiculous."

310
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,041
"It wouldn't work. It's not sirutteok."

311
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,141
(Laughing)

312
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,302
- "Are you kidding me?" - That's what I would've said.

313
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:32,851
How do we drink this?

314
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,121
- Do I stick the straw in here? - No.

315
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:36,021
You probably have to finish...

316
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:38,122
the tiramisu before sticking in the straw.

317
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,162
Do you stick it in directly? Try it.

318
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:43,132
- Gosh, look at that. - Oh, no.

319
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,431
- Goodness. - This is not how it's done.

320
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:47,131
Why are you so clueless?

321
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:48,201
- Tiramisu... - Why are you so clueless?

322
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,771
Seok Jin thought that it was his chance.

323
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:51,301
Why are you so clueless?

324
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:52,302
(Picking)

325
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,823
- Why are you so clueless? - He thought that it was his chance.

326
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,032
- Can't you imagine it? - After eating the tiramisu...

327
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,781
Seok Jin, I'm sorry, but this isn't tissue.

328
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,082
It's a coaster.

329
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:03,781
(Humiliated)

330
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:05,781
- Really? - You added...

331
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,722
unnecessary laundry.

332
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:10,421
You're totally clueless.

333
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,222
I'm not as clueless as you.

334
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:15,062
He's all over the place today.

335
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:17,661
(Taking a bite of the tiramisu after a lot of bickering)

336
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:18,961
- Is it good? - It must be delicious.

337
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:20,232
It's really good. Try it.

338
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:21,962
- For me... - It's amazing.

339
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,171
(Humming)

340
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,201
Is it good?

341
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,942
The cream is excellent.

342
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,102
It tastes very good.

343
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,171
- It's really delicious. - It's to die for.

344
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,182
By the way,

345
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,641
I just heard your real voice.

346
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:35,842
(Fascinated)

347
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:37,612
- "Gosh." - Gosh.

348
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:40,051
- Everything is good at this place. - When Mimi gives credit,

349
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,121
she's being very sincere.

350
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:43,452
- You're a huge fan of desserts. - Right.

351
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:45,691
There are so many types of salted butter rolls.

352
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,892
(This time, he takes a bite of the salted butter roll.)

353
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:49,391
It's so delicious.

354
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,892
It's really good.

355
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,132
It'd be even better if it's warm.

356
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,572
When the butter melts slightly...

357
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:58,131
This is what he means.

358
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,871
- He wants someone to warm it. - Right.

359
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:00,978
(Someone should go and warm it.)

360
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:02,171
It's called Seok Jin's language.

361
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,611
Are you going to eat it like this?

362
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,982
(He means, "Let's warm it.")

363
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,212
(That's so funny.)

364
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:10,782
(Shin Hye also takes a bite of the salted butter roll.)

365
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,581
No way. This Emmental salted butter roll is really good.

366
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:15,921
Gosh, try this.

367
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,021
- Emmental? - Yes.

368
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,622
- Which one? - This is Emmental.

369
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,421
Emmental?

370
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,562
(With salty Emmental and a kick of black pepper)

371
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:24,991
(Kyung Pyo also takes a bite.)

372
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,302
Is that the Emmental roll?

373
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,301
Shall I try the one Shin Hye commented on?

374
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:29,602
Is it black pepper?

375
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,772
It has a slight black pepper taste.

376
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:33,271
It's delicious.

377
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:38,042
(Everyone is absorbed in eating bread.)

378
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:42,212
(They're just eating in silence.)

379
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:45,702
Could you try to figure it out by looking at the map?

380
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,752
What could Beef on Tissue be? Tissue?

381
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,792
Is there beef on top of a tissue?

382
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,492
This is a tissue.

383
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:55,692
Is it grilled on paper?

384
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:56,861
What does T stand for?

385
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:58,861
- Trend. - Trend?

386
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:01,431
What could it be? Is it a lottery place?

387
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,708
(Number 2, Lottery Winner's Fiery Trend)

388
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:03,901
- Tissue... - I can't imagine it.

389
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:05,101
It's impossible to guess.

390
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,641
- "Beef on Tissue?" - By the way,

391
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:09,042
- we're very nice. - How so?

392
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:10,211
Right after what the director said,

393
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:11,242
all of us stopped eating.

394
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:14,141
(Impossible to refute)

395
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,251
- All of us... - We're obedient.

396
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:18,051
All of us get scared easily.

397
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:19,212
We're also very curious.

398
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:21,651
- All of a sudden... - We dropped our fork.

399
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,621
(Guessing mode is on.)

400
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:24,652
That's cute.

401
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,191
I like people like us.

402
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:27,792
We're nice.

403
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:29,931
- Shall we go to the first place? - Yes.

404
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:31,462
Beef on Tissue.

405
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:33,901
My gosh.

406
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:36,802
I say this every time I come here. Apgujeong Rodeo Street was...

407
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:38,901
the best during the 90s.

408
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,101
In the early 2000s.

409
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:41,701
When that street was two-way,

410
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,671
- not one-way, - Exactly.

411
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:44,911
It was the best.

412
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:46,311
- You know about that time? - Yes.

413
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:48,311
Now they can't be played due to copyright,

414
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,112
but we could hear Christmas carols back then.

415
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,521
When the street became one-way, things changed.

416
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,051
- Is there a big difference... - Of course.

417
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:56,551
Between 1-way and 2-way?

418
00:14:56,552 --> 00:15:00,162
(Apgujeong Rodeo Street was packed with cars and people back then.)

419
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,062
When the street was two-way, cars had to slow down...

420
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:04,791
while passing each other.

421
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,472
You end up sneaking glances at each other.

422
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,432
- You exchange looks. - Yes.

423
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:10,232
When I was a young man.

424
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:12,201
When you were a young man?

425
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,272
(Laughing)

426
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,201
When the other driver looked at me,

427
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:16,371
I'd say, "Did you see that?"

428
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,772
I'd say that to my friend.

429
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:19,342
(Nostalgic)

430
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:21,212
The vibe was unique, but now...

431
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,652
- It's mild now. - "When I was a young man."

432
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,321
- Is this it? - Yes.

433
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:27,681
Where are we going?

434
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,082
Beef on Tissue.

435
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,922
Where is Beef on Tissue?

436
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:34,421
- Hold on, where is it? - Where is it?

437
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:35,562
Is this it?

438
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:38,061
Heokjung?

439
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,008
(The Sixth Sense members spot a beef restaurant.)

440
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:41,231
Wagyu.

441
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,362
Shall we go upstairs?

442
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:45,301
I've been to this area a lot,

443
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:46,302
but I've never been here.

444
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,241
I often come to this neighborhood, but I've never been here.

445
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:50,342
It's my first time here.

446
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:54,312
What's over here?

447
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:58,452
It looks like a regular restaurant.

448
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:01,851
(It obviously looks like a meat restaurant.)

449
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,522
"We hope that you'll remember it as the best meat restaurant."

450
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:08,622
(Wine bottles and glasses are lined up neatly.)

451
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:11,231
What is Beef on Tissue?

452
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,008
(What's Beef on Tissue that's hidden at this restaurant?)

453
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:14,332
By the way,

454
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:17,431
I don't know what it is, but it looks radiant.

455
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:19,542
The quality of the meat is...

456
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:20,842
It's different.

457
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,772
- Here's what's important. - It's Wagyu beef.

458
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:24,772
What is this place famous for?

459
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,311
Is tissue something edible?

460
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,682
- Something that looks like tissue? - Hello.

461
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:30,551
- Hello. - Hello.

462
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,451
(The restaurant owner who will clear things up appears.)

463
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:35,181
Sir, what is Beef on Tissue?

464
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:36,451
(He asks immediately.)

465
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:38,421
We use tissue bread.

466
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:40,322
- Do you know it? It has layers. - I know.

467
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:42,762
(Tissue bread)

468
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:45,092
(Bread with many layers)

469
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,301
(The charm lies in peeling off each layer and eating it.)

470
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,272
It's referring to tissue bread.

471
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,972
I order tissue bread at home.

472
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,501
- I really like it. - Really?

473
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:57,211
The layer is extremely thin.

474
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:58,712
It has hundreds of layers.

475
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:02,442
I eat it while watching a movie. I finish the entire bread.

476
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:03,981
You didn't eat tissue, did you?

477
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,421
(Giving a sharp look)

478
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,751
Aren't you too busy watching the movie?

479
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:09,921
You punk.

480
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,722
Why would I eat tissue?

481
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:12,792
You said that...

482
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,191
you love tissue.

483
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,992
Even if I slap him,

484
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,791
please don't tell others.

485
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,272
(Please don't tell others, Shin Hye.)

486
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:21,832
How did you come up with the tissue bread idea?

487
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:25,571
I wanted to offer a new experience to my customers.

488
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,971
We made the tissue bread in our own way.

489
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:30,911
You put meat on it...

490
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:32,742
and enjoy it like a wrap.

491
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,211
- What? - That's what we offer.

492
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,281
Isn't it similar to Beef Wellington?

493
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:40,352
- Do you wrap meat in bread? - Is that it?

494
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:43,522
It's not completely the same,

495
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:45,551
but it's similar to that.

496
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:46,692
The method is...

497
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:49,321
You can think of it as enjoying Western food...

498
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:51,792
- in a Korean way. - Like fusion food.

499
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,531
(Korean-style grilled beef is...)

500
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,671
(wrapped in bread?)

501
00:17:57,672 --> 00:18:00,841
Hello, I run a beef galbi restaurant.

502
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,542
My name is Kim Tae Hoon.

503
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:04,871
I was searching for a nice experience...

504
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:07,382
where people could enjoy food in a fun way.

505
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:10,211
At a steakhouse abroad,

506
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:13,521
meat, mashed potatoes, bread,

507
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:16,651
and accompanying sauce are usually served.

508
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:17,652
(All of them are eaten together.)

509
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:22,262
I thought about applying this to Korean beef.

510
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:25,792
With this idea, I came up with the recipe myself.

511
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:27,761
I ferment the dough and bake it...

512
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:30,632
in the oven before serving at the restaurant.

513
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:34,942
(Is Beef on Tissue a real combination that exists?)

514
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:38,541
- When did you start selling it? - It's been...

515
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,381
about six years since we opened.

516
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,341
It's been three months...

517
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,551
since this menu has been launched.

518
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:45,751
- Three months? - It hasn't been long.

519
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:46,822
Yes.

520
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:51,352
That's ideal for plotting.

521
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,091
Why is it three months?

522
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,661
- Right. - It should be at least a year.

523
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,161
When the production crew makes...

524
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:58,361
something fake for the show,

525
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,801
they run the business for 2 to 3 months beforehand.

526
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:02,801
- Right. - We can't help being suspicious.

527
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:04,131
- Please understand. - Sure.

528
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,331
I can definitely understand.

529
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:09,571
You told us something that's extremely suspicious.

530
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,292
(Launching of the new menu follows a pattern similar to a fake one.)

531
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:14,342
How much are the sales?

532
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:15,811
So far,

533
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:20,082
sales are 120,000 to 130,000 dollars a month.

534
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:21,421
Per month?

535
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:22,451
Per month.

536
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,621
Since this is a meat restaurant,

537
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,521
our overall sales are about that much.

538
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:28,821
- That's nice. - Yes.

539
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,361
- I'm very curious. - Yes.

540
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:32,531
Please let us try it.

541
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,401
- It's coming right up. - Thank you.

542
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:36,401
(When the restaurant owner leaves)

543
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:37,601
By the way,

544
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:39,802
I feel like I've seen this before on social media.

545
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,672
They might have posted it on purpose.

546
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,312
- Really? - Like it happened to me.

547
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:46,958
- "They might have posted it." - I can't remember it clearly.

548
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,712
I feel like I've seen it, but I can't remember it clearly.

549
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,381
The food is coming.

550
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:52,822
(As they discuss, the food arrives.)

551
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,152
- There's no tissue bread. - No.

552
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:59,522
(The meat they've been waiting for arrives.)

553
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,422
The portion is generous.

554
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,792
There's a lot of marbling.

555
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:07,431
(Meat with lots of marbling)

556
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,131
The meat looks good.

557
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:10,602
(Meat with lots of marbling)

558
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,772
The meat is...

559
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:15,671
- black cattle. - Black cattle?

560
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,512
We specialize in selling black beef.

561
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:21,241
(Top quality black beef)

562
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,451
We use only the highest grade purebred Wagyu...

563
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:26,052
that's between 0.1 and 0.01 percent.

564
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,551
Boneless short ribs,

565
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:31,122
it's the most expensive and the best beef cut.

566
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:34,721
Among Wagyu beef, Kobe beef's supply is...

567
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,591
so limited...

568
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,961
that we're the only restaurant in Korea selling it.

569
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,632
(Due to its extremely limited quantity, )

570
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,102
(exclusively offering the finest Kobe beef in Korea)

571
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:45,801
This is Black Angus beef.

572
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,772
It's also boneless short ribs but cut in a Korean way.

573
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:53,082
(A collaboration of ribs and Korean marinade)

574
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,582
(Spreading thoroughly for the marinade to be absorbed)

575
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,852
(Once it's rolled neatly)

576
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:02,421
It's Suwon style.

577
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:03,821
(Suwon-style marinated galbi)

578
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:06,622
We offer these three types of beef.

579
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,721
These are called Traffic Light Sauces.

580
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:10,842
They're the four signature sauces at this restaurant.

581
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,131
Red, orange, yellow, and green.

582
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:14,012
That's why they're called Traffic Light Sauces.

583
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:15,762
We have four types of sauce.

584
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:18,201
Put some on the meat however you'd like...

585
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,942
- to enjoy the food. - Okay.

586
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:22,741
Kobe beef is also very expensive in Japan.

587
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:23,742
- Kobe beef. - Right.

588
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:24,941
How much is it?

589
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:28,741
It costs over 100 dollars for 1 portion.

590
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,851
It's 300 dollars for 160g at certain places.

591
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:31,852
Right.

592
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:33,882
- It's 300 dollars for 160g? - Yes.

593
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:37,992
(Top-quality Black Angus beef is quite expensive.)

594
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,192
- Seriously. What? - What you said is right.

595
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:43,931
(Seizing their attention)

596
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:44,992
What's this?

597
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:47,732
(Appearing with an unusual presence)

598
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:50,202
(Black tissue bread)

599
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,801
The main dish, tissue bread is here.

600
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:53,842
What's this?

601
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,612
- It's very dark. - It's really dark.

602
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:58,641
Did he make it black...

603
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:00,562
- to match the black cattle? - That must be why.

604
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,951
(For beef from black cattle, )

605
00:22:03,952 --> 00:22:05,812
(the bread should be black.)

606
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:08,722
(Tissue bread)

607
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:11,151
To make it black,

608
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:14,822
we use natural squid ink.

609
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:18,632
There's natural butter in France called Echire Butter.

610
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:22,332
As the bread was made with this butter,

611
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,371
it has a great flavor.

612
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:27,572
The quality of the bread is very high.

613
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:32,612
(It is so popular on social media...)

614
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:35,712
(that Feed is turning black.)

615
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:39,211
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

616
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:41,252
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

617
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:43,152
(Carefully)

618
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,122
It's slightly smaller than the tissue bread that I eat.

619
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:49,932
Gosh, don't say that in front of the owner.

620
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:52,192
(He gets 1 more point on impoliteness.)

621
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:55,162
I'm not saying that it's bad because it's smaller.

622
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:57,662
You must have eaten bread that's bigger than this.

623
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,342
It isn't available in stores.

624
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:03,071
We make it ourselves and serve it...

625
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:04,471
- only at the restaurant. - Really?

626
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:06,641
- Even if you want it, - You can't find it anywhere?

627
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:09,211
You can't buy it anywhere else.

628
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:10,482
Do you make it here?

629
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,012
- Yes. - Is there an oven here?

630
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:14,521
We have our own factory.

631
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:16,481
When we receive the dough,

632
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,791
- we ferment it... - You just bake it?

633
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:18,951
And bake it at the restaurant.

634
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:21,021
- Do you bake it here? - Yes.

635
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:23,892
- We don't make the dough... - Shin Hye isn't ordinary either.

636
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:26,291
She's no ordinary one.

637
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:28,062
Sir, you're trying to fool the wrong person.

638
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:31,231
How do we wrap the meat with bread?

639
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:32,972
- The layer comes off like this. - Yes.

640
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:35,601
Peel off the layers 1 by 1.

641
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:37,341
- And wrap the meat with it? - Yes.

642
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:39,242
(Wrap meat with it and enjoy.)

643
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:42,282
- Does it come off thin? - It does.

644
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:45,011
- Is it warm? - Yes, it's very warm.

645
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,052
Really?

646
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,682
(The bread is freshly baked and warm.)

647
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:50,791
Look how thin it is.

648
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,352
- It smells like bread. - It's soft.

649
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,691
(It's so thin and soft that it's almost transparent.)

650
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:56,132
- It smells like bread. - It's soft.

651
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:58,892
- It smells like bread. - It's definitely bread.

652
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:02,702
(Let me try it.)

653
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,102
- It's delicious. - It's really good.

654
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:06,641
It's chewy.

655
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:08,401
It's sweet and moist.

656
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:10,018
(Made with premium butter, it's very chewy.)

657
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,211
You eat meat with this bread?

658
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,482
I wonder how they'll taste.

659
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:16,212
(How will beef and bread go together?)

660
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,511
Let's try it with some meat.

661
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:20,982
(We will grill the meat right away for the wrap.)

662
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:23,951
(Boneless short ribs with marbling)

663
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:28,262
(A fiery transformation)

664
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:32,962
(While the meat is getting cooked, )

665
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:36,532
(Shin Hye reaches for the tongs and scissors.)

666
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:39,232
(Focused on grilling)

667
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:43,842
(Effortlessly impressive hand skills)

668
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,442
(Checking if it's cooked)

669
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:49,382
(Cutting without hesitation)

670
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:51,851
(Shin Hye's hands move endlessly.)

671
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,722
- Shin Hye is grilling meat for us. - I know.

672
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,722
(It's for you.)

673
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,021
(Touched by the beef grilled with care)

674
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,262
- This is... - I knew it.

675
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:01,892
Needless to say...

676
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:04,192
It's nice to be served by a top star.

677
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:05,331
(The top star in this area who grills meat)

678
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,201
- Thank you. - Needless to say...

679
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:08,202
(The top star in this area who grills meat)

680
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:09,962
I'm a daughter of a meat restaurant.

681
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:11,732
- Right. - That's why.

682
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:14,001
(That's why.)

683
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,101
- It looks so natural. - I knew it.

684
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,711
You're good at cutting meat.

685
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:18,011
- The way... - Thank you.

686
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:19,441
- The way she grabs it... - She's good at cutting.

687
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:20,541
I know.

688
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,041
- Her hands are very quick. - Yes.

689
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,362
She's very good at grilling meat.

690
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,482
Wait, didn't he recommend this?

691
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,582
- I'll add some green onions. - Me too.

692
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:30,952
(On top of the tissue bread)

693
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,792
(Combo 1, boneless short rib and green onion sauce)

694
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:37,191
Bread with meat?

695
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:38,492
How will it taste?

696
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:41,331
Is this how you eat it? I guess it is.

697
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,902
(Seok Jin takes a big bite of the tissue.)

698
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:47,642
(Jae Seok also eats it.)

699
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:50,572
It's amazing in a wrap.

700
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:53,541
You have to eat it in a wrap.

701
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:54,622
(The taste makes you clap.)

702
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,558
It's different from wrapping meat with lettuce.

703
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:58,411
- It's different without it. - It's different.

704
00:25:58,412 --> 00:25:59,511
(The butter flavor of the bread...)

705
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:01,021
(and the beef create a fantastic combination.)

706
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:02,282
It's excellent.

707
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:04,791
First of all, it doesn't taste like Korean food.

708
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:05,792
Right? I agree.

709
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:06,921
It's similar to Western food.

710
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,162
- Right. - It tastes...

711
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,461
- like beef burger. - It tastes like...

712
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:11,991
- Right, it tastes like a burger. - It's similar to a sandwich.

713
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:13,291
- It's similar to a sandwich. - Yes, it's like a sandwich.

714
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,301
Yes.

715
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:15,561
- I'll try with the truffle sauce. - Me too.

716
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:17,562
(Kyung Pyo and Mimi try the truffle garlic sauce.)

717
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:19,672
(Make a wrap)

718
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:22,901
(Taking a big bite)

719
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:24,072
It's delicious.

720
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:27,242
It's nice to eat beef for breakfast.

721
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:32,412
(Shin Hye switches the tongs with chopsticks.)

722
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:34,921
(Eating one tissue neatly)

723
00:26:34,922 --> 00:26:37,121
- It's really good. - It's very good.

724
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:38,922
- The meat tastes great. - Yes.

725
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:40,362
It's incredible.

726
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,532
The meat is so good.

727
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:45,862
- The bread isn't necessary. - Exactly.

728
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:47,601
Is the bread necessary?

729
00:26:47,602 --> 00:26:49,832
(The meat is already delicious without the bread.)

730
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,501
(This place is fake.)

731
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:53,571
(Is the tissue bread added by the production crew?)

732
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:56,742
If I were to do some deduction,

733
00:26:57,012 --> 00:26:59,172
maybe it's not a menu from one restaurant.

734
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:02,542
He runs a meat restaurant and a bakery separately.

735
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,111
- In order to fool us, - He combined them?

736
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:07,582
Maybe he combined the two. If we had to suspect something...

737
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:11,791
It doesn't make sense to own a factory...

738
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:12,951
- just to make this bread. - Right.

739
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:15,521
- He must have his own bakery. - He runs a bakery...

740
00:27:15,522 --> 00:27:16,522
at the same time.

741
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:18,091
(Kyung Pyo's guess)

742
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:20,501
(The owner runs a bakery and a meat restaurant?)

743
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:24,731
I don't think it goes well with bread.

744
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:25,771
- But... - I don't think...

745
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:27,201
(Seok Jin doesn't seem comfortable.)

746
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,762
- By the way... - Could you grill this?

747
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:31,732
Is it okay for Shin Hye to grill by herself?

748
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,541
I feel bad.

749
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,141
- From start to finish... - I'm sorry, Shin Hye.

750
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:37,312
- I mean... - I'm sorry, Shin Hye.

751
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:38,552
I mean...

752
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,181
- You're very good at grilling. - It's because...

753
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:41,351
- Right. - Seriously.

754
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:43,521
I can't dare to interrupt.

755
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:44,951
She's close to being a master.

756
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:46,792
(The territory of the meat master)

757
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:49,161
We shouldn't burn any expensive meat.

758
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:50,392
She's very good at grilling.

759
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,331
(As soon as she finishes talking, )

760
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,502
(she concentrates on grilling meat again.)

761
00:27:56,932 --> 00:27:58,031
The meat is excellent.

762
00:27:58,032 --> 00:27:59,131
- Right. - The meat is very good.

763
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,242
It's top quality.

764
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:02,301
- The meat is very good. - It's top quality.

765
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:03,342
(Glancing)

766
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:06,241
- Can you grill the marinated meat? - Shall I?

767
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:07,541
(Can you grill the marinated meat?)

768
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,212
- Shall I? - Hey.

769
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,451
- She's our guest. - I mean...

770
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:14,081
She's not the restaurant owner.

771
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:16,281
She's our guest, but she's so good at grilling meat.

772
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:17,322
I agree with that.

773
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,291
Can you grill it as well as Shin Hye?

774
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,561
- No, I can't. - I can't either.

775
00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:23,161
- We need to change the grill. - The grill?

776
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:24,832
- Okay. - The grill?

777
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:27,101
- Sir. - Sir.

778
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:28,932
Could you please change the grill?

779
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,671
- Enjoy your food. - Okay.

780
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:33,702
Thank you.

781
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:36,801
(As soon as the marinated meat goes on the grill)

782
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,441
- Seriously... - She's adjusting the heat.

783
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:39,641
She's adjusting the heat.

784
00:28:39,642 --> 00:28:40,811
(Adjusting for the marinated meat)

785
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:42,312
- She's a master. - She's very good.

786
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:44,022
She's a master of grilling meat.

787
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:46,751
We would've grilled it over high heat to eat it fast.

788
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:47,822
Right.

789
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:50,351
(She flips it over lightly.)

790
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:51,891
- Shin Hye... - It's not burnt at all.

791
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,091
- Otherwise, the marinade... - It gets burnt.

792
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:56,062
- would get burnt. - It gets burnt easily.

793
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:59,492
(It must be flipped at the right time...)

794
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:03,102
(in order to taste marinated galbi with a nice color.)

795
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:07,401
Today, I care less about what's real or fake.

796
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:08,671
It's fascinating to watch you grill.

797
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:10,611
Yes, I totally agree.

798
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:11,642
Right.

799
00:29:11,712 --> 00:29:13,441
When we go to a meat restaurant at work,

800
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,122
the CEO of the agency sits in front of me.

801
00:29:15,742 --> 00:29:16,841
- I can understand. - I think I know why.

802
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,511
- Because you're good at grilling? - I think I know why.

803
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:20,321
From now on, I'll sit in front of Shin Hye.

804
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:21,782
Yes, it's the best spot.

805
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,652
- That's amazing. - It's impressive.

806
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:29,862
(Cutting into bite sizes)

807
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:34,202
(Stirring so that the meat is flavored by charcoal)

808
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:40,202
(When you wait a little longer)

809
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:42,902
Gosh.

810
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:44,941
- Here it is. - Here it is.

811
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:46,542
Shin Hye gave me another piece.

812
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:48,911
(Meat confirmed by Shin Hye)

813
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,242
- Shall we taste it? - Let's see.

814
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:52,952
It's almost over.

815
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:54,452
Is it good?

816
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,382
It's incredible.

817
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:58,392
You're good at grilling.

818
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:00,562
(Ecstatic)

819
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:02,721
- Is it okay? - You're good at grilling.

820
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:03,992
Is it grilled well?

821
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:05,562
It's perfect.

822
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:08,862
(It's cooked perfectly.)

823
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:12,771
(After serving everyone, Shin Hye is the last one to eat.)

824
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:14,102
It's fully marinated.

825
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,002
I should wrap it in some bread.

826
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,942
(Putting marinated meat on top of the bread)

827
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:21,511
(A lot of sauce)

828
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:22,942
The wrap looks good.

829
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:25,852
(Let's see.)

830
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:28,652
It's really good in a wrap.

831
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:29,722
It's delicious.

832
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:30,791
(Giving full credit)

833
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:31,891
It's really good.

834
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:33,821
Now I get it. You should make wraps with this.

835
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:35,161
The meat has to be marinated.

836
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:36,861
It tastes right with marinated meat.

837
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:38,791
With green onions in the wrap...

838
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:41,232
(The perfect combo of sweet marinated galbi and tissue bread)

839
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:43,162
- It's... - I'm in trouble for the next spot.

840
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:46,302
Isn't it amazing in a wrap?

841
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:48,642
- The marinated meat is the best. - Yes.

842
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,672
Instead of guessing,

843
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:53,272
are we shooting "Tasty Guys?"

844
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,642
This is our last episode.

845
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,182
- Isn't it great? - She's amazing at grilling meat.

846
00:30:57,382 --> 00:30:59,051
Shin Hye made us forget about guessing.

847
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:00,151
It's so delicious.

848
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,021
I've known Shin Hye for a long time,

849
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:03,258
I've known her for a long time,

850
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:06,051
and her strongest skill is grilling meat.

851
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:08,461
(Her strongest skill is grilling meat.)

852
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,221
I can't believe you actually said that.

853
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:11,961
- Shin Hye, this is... - She's so good at this.

854
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:12,962
Grilling meat this well isn't easy.

855
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:14,261
It's Shin Hye's signature move.

856
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:16,302
(Shin Hye's signature move)

857
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,931
Grilling meat is...

858
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:19,978
- It's her signature move. - Shin Hye's signature move.

859
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,762
I can't even begin to figure this place out.

860
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:24,372
The marinated galbi she grilled at the end...

861
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:27,082
was amazing with the bread.

862
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:28,972
- It's a perfect pairing. - Right.

863
00:31:29,912 --> 00:31:31,082
This place is real.

864
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:32,611
- I'm sure. - Are you sure?

865
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:34,151
If you ask me, absolutely.

866
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,251
(It's real here! The perfect combo of bread and meat)

867
00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:37,652
On the other hand,

868
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:41,862
the bread doesn't really go well with the other side dishes...

869
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:44,031
that were served.

870
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,931
- They don't. - Exactly.

871
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:47,561
Check out this onion salad.

872
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,131
It clashes with the bread.

873
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:50,471
Exactly. With this too.

874
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:52,131
This too. And this.

875
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:53,612
The bread feels like the odd one out.

876
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:56,441
Imagine having the meal without this.

877
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,311
- There you go. - It's perfect.

878
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:59,312
- This works. - So why was that...

879
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:00,953
- of all things added? - But the bread...

880
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:03,512
kind of ruins it as a full meal.

881
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:05,381
This dish came out three months ago,

882
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,222
and there are bakeries everywhere around here.

883
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:11,052
Maybe the production crew was trying to put the two together.

884
00:32:11,592 --> 00:32:13,491
Either way, the combination was delicious.

885
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:14,791
- Seriously. - It was really good.

886
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:15,961
The marinade was just right.

887
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:17,132
(Beef on Tissue)

888
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:18,991
Restaurants tend to promote...

889
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,802
- new side dishes. - Exactly.

890
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:22,361
It bugs me that it was never promoted.

891
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,461
(They keep talking about it as they get in the van.)

892
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:25,501
It does seem forced in a way.

893
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,101
Something feels off, right?

894
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:28,871
In some ways, it feels real,

895
00:32:28,872 --> 00:32:30,672
- but in others, it doesn't. - It seems fake.

896
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:32,811
I heard you got a lot wrong.

897
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:34,212
- I got all of them wrong. - I see.

898
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:37,252
- It's my last chance today. - He's really bad at this.

899
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:38,951
- Then... - One might think...

900
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:40,482
We made guesses as a team.

901
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:41,881
I meant myself, too.

902
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:43,042
(Aren't we on the same team?)

903
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:45,391
- Will we get it right today? - Tell me about it.

904
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,322
We should try to get it right.

905
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,522
- Hey, we're here. - Where are we going?

906
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:53,062
We're around here a lot.

907
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:54,802
(What?)

908
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:57,272
Should I open this door for you?

909
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,071
All right.

910
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:01,001
You'll grab some coffee before going to the next restaurant.

911
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:02,002
- Sounds good. - Nice!

912
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:03,542
- There we go. - I'd love to.

913
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,142
- Where... That must be the place. - Where?

914
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:07,842
Gosh, that's pretty.

915
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:10,812
(Which place blew them away?)

916
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,381
Check out the Christmas tree.

917
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:13,611
(A trendy cafe with year-end holiday vibes)

918
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:14,682
It's so pretty.

919
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:19,552
Look how pretty that is. That's definitely a photo spot.

920
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:21,092
Exactly. It's a photo spot.

921
00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:26,532
(A well-known photo spot trending on social media)

922
00:33:27,162 --> 00:33:30,162
(Even the desserts are visually satisfying.)

923
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:37,472
(Its signature desserts sell out every day.)

924
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:41,112
(A trendy spot clearly made for Gen Z and social media)

925
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,642
- They set up a tree. - That must have cost a lot.

926
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:45,081
It's huge.

927
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:47,922
Do you put up a Christmas tree at home?

928
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:49,452
Just a small one.

929
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:50,791
I put up a small one too.

930
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:53,322
- What is it? - We saw him earlier!

931
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,661
(Someone they saw earlier?)

932
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:56,662
Who?

933
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:58,761
We admired his sense of style.

934
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,762
(Hello)

935
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:02,252
- Isn't that the guy from earlier? - It is!

936
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:04,432
(The cafe where they met Shin Hye)

937
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:09,042
(The fashionably dressed owner served their order.)

938
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:12,212
- Hello. We meet again. - We met him earlier.

939
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,002
What are you doing here, too?

940
00:34:15,082 --> 00:34:16,741
Both cafes are under the same ownership.

941
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:17,882
- I see. - Really?

942
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:21,592
(Is it a coincidence they're at another place with the same owner?)

943
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:24,251
(A cafe owned by the same person we saw earlier?)

944
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:25,252
I've been here before.

945
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:28,491
I'm telling you, I just got the chills.

946
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:29,761
Why?

947
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:31,192
Check this out.

948
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:32,692
- What is it? - See this?

949
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:34,801
- See this? - See what?

950
00:34:34,802 --> 00:34:37,532
Isn't this tissue bread?

951
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:39,832
- It is. - He's right.

952
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:43,141
(On one side of the dessert display)

953
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:45,442
(One pastry really stands out.)

954
00:34:46,272 --> 00:34:50,882
(Doesn't it look like the tissue bread?)

955
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:53,951
(Grunting)

956
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:55,121
You found a connection!

957
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:56,451
There's something to this.

958
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:57,491
Are they hinting at something?

959
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:59,491
- It's the same owner. - Right.

960
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:02,521
It must be a collaboration between the local bakeries and restaurants.

961
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:03,522
(Foreshadowing planted by the production crew)

962
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:09,202
(Did the K-barbecue restaurant get its pastry from the trending cafe?)

963
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:12,101
- That's possible. - Exactly. I'm guessing that...

964
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:13,132
(I'm guessing that...)

965
00:35:13,432 --> 00:35:14,471
Let's go upstairs for now.

966
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:16,742
(Take a break from the guessing and enjoy your dessert.)

967
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:18,671
What a sweet little place.

968
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:19,748
(But there's someone who can't stop analyzing.)

969
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:21,041
I bet it gets hot in here during the summer,

970
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,411
considering there are two air conditioners...

971
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,742
in such a small space.

972
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:26,181
(The only sharp one among the dense group)

973
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,212
That was smart.

974
00:35:28,022 --> 00:35:30,182
- She saw what was up there. - What if I get it wrong?

975
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,722
It's really no big deal.

976
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:34,262
- Here we go. - These are our desserts.

977
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,252
- No way. They're adorable. - They're too cute to eat.

978
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,591
- Thank you. - Thank you.

979
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:40,792
How can we possibly eat these?

980
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:43,361
Hold on. What is this supposed to be?

981
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:44,871
These are adorable.

982
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:47,232
(Adorable winter-only desserts)

983
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,772
How could we cut into that snowman?

984
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:52,042
- These are adorable. - How could we eat this?

985
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:53,941
That's so cute.

986
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:55,242
(A snowman too adorable to eat)

987
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,482
They're too cute that I feel guilty. My gosh!

988
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:00,682
- My gosh! - Come on.

989
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,421
(Cutting the back of the head)

990
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:04,252
- You're crazy. - Are you kidding me?

991
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:05,521
- You went for the head. - You went for the head.

992
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:06,792
It's only the back of the head.

993
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,761
You're trying to keep the front intact.

994
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes, the front.

995
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:11,592
It's all cream.

996
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:13,631
Does it have strawberry in it?

997
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,178
(A snowman with wild berry puree inside)

998
00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:16,362
Gosh, the innards.

999
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:20,632
It must be made with vanilla beans.

1000
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:25,412
(As Shin Hye mentioned, black vanilla beans are visible.)

1001
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:29,012
- How is it? - I'm sorry to say this but...

1002
00:36:29,082 --> 00:36:31,112
- How is it? - It must be like a mousse cake.

1003
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:32,381
How does it taste?

1004
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:33,982
(Velvety cream fills their mouths.)

1005
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:35,651
(Grunting)

1006
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,052
- This is... - This is a bit too heavy.

1007
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:42,662
- Today... - I'm sorry to say this.

1008
00:36:43,022 --> 00:36:45,131
- It's really good, - We've had way too much bread.

1009
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:47,601
But we had bread, meat, and then bread again.

1010
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:49,462
- I'm now feeling queasy. - He's hilarious.

1011
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:52,402
- Gosh, what's this? - It's mulled wine.

1012
00:36:53,272 --> 00:36:54,272
Mutt wine?

1013
00:36:54,273 --> 00:36:55,441
- Mulled wine. - Mulled wine.

1014
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:57,302
- A mutt means dog. - Exactly.

1015
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,572
Mulled wine.

1016
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:00,112
What's a mulled wine?

1017
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:04,111
It's wine heated with orange and cinnamon.

1018
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:05,351
- What wine? - It's great when you have a cold.

1019
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:06,552
- Really? - Mulled wine.

1020
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:10,952
(Warm mulled wine that'll warm you up)

1021
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:13,652
- It's like warm grape juice. - Really?

1022
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:15,992
Really?

1023
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:19,191
(What does he think of mulled wine?)

1024
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:20,661
(Goodness)

1025
00:37:20,662 --> 00:37:21,662
(Curious)

1026
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:23,131
How is it? Can I try it?

1027
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:24,202
No.

1028
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,232
(I cover my eyes when something is funny.)

1029
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,172
- That's cold. - I know.

1030
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:30,401
Why can't I try it?

1031
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:32,141
- Go ahead. - Is it yours?

1032
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:34,711
- It's nice. - Hey, it's warm.

1033
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,951
A warm cup of mulled wine helps when you have a cold.

1034
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:39,052
- It's nice. - Right.

1035
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:40,781
Isn't it tangy?

1036
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:41,921
- It's tasty. - It's pretty good.

1037
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:43,251
- It's... - It tastes very grown-up.

1038
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:44,321
It's good.

1039
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,298
(Falling in love with sweet and tangy mulled wine)

1040
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:49,022
(Mimi tries one of the drinks.)

1041
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:52,961
- What's that? - It tastes like Babambar.

1042
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:53,992
This is marron latte.

1043
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:57,002
- Does it taste like Babambar? - Totally.

1044
00:37:57,302 --> 00:38:00,872
(A subtly sweet marron latte with glazed chestnuts)

1045
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:02,541
What does marron mean?

1046
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,601
- It means chestnuts. - This.

1047
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:04,711
- Chestnuts? - Here.

1048
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:06,012
(Marron is French for chestnut.)

1049
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:09,682
I like cream and jam made with chestnuts.

1050
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:12,711
Shin Hye's telling us a lot today.

1051
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,151
- I know. - I was surprised just now.

1052
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:16,681
- She knew mulled wine. - How did you know about it?

1053
00:38:16,682 --> 00:38:17,892
This...

1054
00:38:18,592 --> 00:38:19,951
Is it normal for people to know that?

1055
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:21,191
Doesn't that mean you're pretty knowledgeable?

1056
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:22,692
You really know a lot.

1057
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:25,962
I've only met you today, but you seem very sophisticated.

1058
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:27,832
I'm not kidding.

1059
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,661
Do you raise your voice and get angry?

1060
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:32,072
- I express my anger well. - Really? You don't seem like it.

1061
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,601
I bet nothing gets past you,

1062
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:35,641
and you're really thorough.

1063
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:36,942
I kind of am.

1064
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:39,811
Being in this industry for decades has kept me...

1065
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:41,482
from showing my anger publicly.

1066
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:44,352
(He's at it again.)

1067
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:46,851
When I get pissed off at times while driving,

1068
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:48,552
I talk to myself with the window closed.

1069
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:51,192
Seok Jin goes like this, "You idiot!"

1070
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,452
"It was your fault!"

1071
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:56,321
- We can't let it show. - I talk to myself a lot...

1072
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:57,642
- when I'm driving, too. - Right.

1073
00:38:57,862 --> 00:38:59,561
"You shouldn't have cut in like that."

1074
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:01,162
- Something like that. - I can relate.

1075
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:03,101
- That sounded sophisticated. - Unlike me,

1076
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:05,371
- you sound sophisticated. - We all do that much.

1077
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:08,201
I usually turn on my hazard lights and raise my hand...

1078
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:09,501
- politely. - This is me.

1079
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:12,571
It's very effective. If they won't let you cut in,

1080
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:15,181
lower the window and do this. Once they let you cut in,

1081
00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:17,441
take the hand that you just had up,

1082
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,151
- and do this. - Give them a thumbs up.

1083
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:21,058
- Outside the window? - So that they can see it.

1084
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:23,321
The driver behind you will be like, "What is that?"

1085
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:25,591
("What is that?")

1086
00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:26,592
(Laughing)

1087
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:28,361
I don't know about that,

1088
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:32,231
but I give them a thumbs up after they let me cut in.

1089
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:33,391
And I'm thinking,

1090
00:39:33,392 --> 00:39:35,162
"Gosh, I'm so polite."

1091
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:37,501
Baam!

1092
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:39,502
(Laughing)

1093
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:41,941
- It's more about self-satisfaction. - I've been telling people this.

1094
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:43,871
The next place is five minutes away on foot.

1095
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,972
- Sure. - Let's go.

1096
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:46,812
I can't wait for what's next.

1097
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:48,242
The lottery.

1098
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:51,851
I should buy one. I should buy a lottery ticket.

1099
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:52,852
Why?

1100
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:54,322
You never know.

1101
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:56,721
It might not sell lottery tickets.

1102
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:57,822
- Really? - He's right.

1103
00:39:58,652 --> 00:39:59,791
The keyword is "trend."

1104
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,592
("Trend" is a key word, same with "lottery.")

1105
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,591
Meanwhile, what I prefer is...

1106
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:04,832
- This... - Hey, it's me.

1107
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:06,592
- There. - Mimi!

1108
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:07,831
Mimi!

1109
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:09,031
- It's Mimi. - Hi!

1110
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,152
(Meeting Mimi on the street)

1111
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:12,402
(It's good to see you.)

1112
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:15,041
(Happy to see her)

1113
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,911
You must be cold. Cover those shoulders.

1114
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:18,942
(He feels bad for her.)

1115
00:40:19,072 --> 00:40:20,811
- Mimi, wait. - Why am I half-naked?

1116
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:21,881
You look cold.

1117
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:23,088
(Shoulders that scream capitalism)

1118
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:24,311
- You must be cold. - It's cold outside,

1119
00:40:24,312 --> 00:40:25,512
but I'm half-naked.

1120
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:26,982
It's a problem.

1121
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:29,722
This is Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

1122
00:40:30,382 --> 00:40:32,952
(From famous designer brands...)

1123
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:37,762
(to brands trending with younger people)

1124
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:40,732
(Apgujeong Rodeo Street is a trend hub.)

1125
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:43,332
That's right. People come here to shop for clothes.

1126
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:47,102
There are a lot of clothing stores near Dosan Park.

1127
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:49,141
You never know what's going to trend...

1128
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,301
- No one can tell. - these days.

1129
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:51,871
- Exactly. What? - What?

1130
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:52,872
- What's that? - What's this?

1131
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:54,742
Why is there a Lamborghini?

1132
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:58,452
(You spot it right around the corner of the main alleyway.)

1133
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:03,322
(With a ferocious bull logo)

1134
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:06,392
(A luxurious sports car)

1135
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:08,562
That car looks very expensive.

1136
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:11,542
Did he buy the car with the money he won from the lottery?

1137
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:12,762
Really?

1138
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:16,131
Lottery Winner's Fiery Trend.

1139
00:41:16,132 --> 00:41:17,162
Is this the place?

1140
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:20,001
It's a lottery,

1141
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:21,272
and what's this?

1142
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:23,471
It's a pop-up store.

1143
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:24,642
A pop-up store.

1144
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,412
(Pasted on the wall above the eye-catching car...)

1145
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:28,811
(are a pop-up store's promotional posters?)

1146
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:30,341
One-one-nine pop-up store?

1147
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:31,382
(Pop-up store)

1148
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:34,252
The building looks unique too.

1149
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,721
What's this?

1150
00:41:36,722 --> 00:41:38,792
(Flustered)

1151
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:41,892
- What's this? - Let's check it out. What is it?

1152
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:44,061
It's a pop-up store.

1153
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:45,338
(It looks like an ordinary pop-up store.)

1154
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:46,662
(Opening)

1155
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:49,062
What's this?

1156
00:41:49,762 --> 00:41:52,202
Do we need to figure out if this place is real or fake?

1157
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:54,672
(When you enter the building, )

1158
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:58,672
(you come across an ordinary clothes store?)

1159
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:02,942
(Vintage clothes...)

1160
00:42:03,212 --> 00:42:06,512
(and hats and bags in brown, which is a popular color nowadays)

1161
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:08,652
(And...)

1162
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:10,821
Hee Ryung was here.

1163
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,498
(A photo of Actress Jang Hee Ryung, a fashionista)

1164
00:42:12,522 --> 00:42:15,662
(It looks like a normal fashion brand pop-up store.)

1165
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:17,761
We're here to find out if this is real or fake, right?

1166
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:18,762
Yes.

1167
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:20,091
- What? - But...

1168
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:21,331
- it just looks real. - This...

1169
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:22,562
(It just looks real.)

1170
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:24,971
It isn't a lottery shop.

1171
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,102
(It isn't a lottery shop.)

1172
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:27,431
What's this?

1173
00:42:27,432 --> 00:42:29,501
(They look around the store.)

1174
00:42:29,502 --> 00:42:30,841
This seems to be a fashion brand.

1175
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:32,311
It's a brand. There's a hat here...

1176
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:33,642
with this face.

1177
00:42:34,142 --> 00:42:35,381
This is fascinating.

1178
00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:36,811
I have no idea what I'm supposed to look for.

1179
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:37,952
(Extremely confused)

1180
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:40,352
What's this?

1181
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:42,251
- What's this? - Why is this...

1182
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,972
(At that moment, Seok Jin spots something.)

1183
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:47,292
- It's a turnout gear. - What?

1184
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:50,391
- It's a turnout gear. - Yes, a turnout gear.

1185
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:52,232
(A turnout gear?)

1186
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:55,402
(Why are there turnout gears in a clothes pop-up store?)

1187
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:56,862
(Actually, there are...)

1188
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:02,372
(turnout gears displayed all over the place.)

1189
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:04,412
(Firefighter-shaped mural)

1190
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:07,882
(Even a booklet about turnout gear fabrics)

1191
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:10,182
(That's not all!)

1192
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:13,882
(A turnout gear displayed like artwork...)

1193
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:17,182
(and chairs made of fire hose)

1194
00:43:17,352 --> 00:43:19,322
(A kiosk for CPR)

1195
00:43:19,552 --> 00:43:22,862
(What's this place full of firefighter-related things?)

1196
00:43:23,022 --> 00:43:24,861
This must be...

1197
00:43:24,862 --> 00:43:27,391
- Is it 119 concept? - related to...

1198
00:43:27,392 --> 00:43:29,362
- firefighters. - I think so.

1199
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:31,472
Maybe they recycle the turnout gears.

1200
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:35,542
Did they make use of the fabric?

1201
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:37,501
Did they do a collaboration?

1202
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:39,171
(Is it a fashion brand which recycles turnout gears?)

1203
00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:40,742
It looks so real.

1204
00:43:40,772 --> 00:43:44,312
For promotions and various events...

1205
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:46,981
- He's here. - He's here.

1206
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:49,122
- Hello. - Hello.

1207
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:50,782
- Hello. - Hello.

1208
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:53,251
You look a lot like the character.

1209
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:55,022
(The owner looks ordinary.)

1210
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:56,791
We were told...

1211
00:43:56,792 --> 00:43:58,962
this place is called Lottery Winner's Fiery Trend.

1212
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,401
I won the first prize in the lottery,

1213
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:03,201
and with the money...

1214
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:09,602
(I won the first prize in the lottery.)

1215
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:13,571
Hello. I run an upcycling brand that uses discarded turnout gears.

1216
00:44:13,572 --> 00:44:15,242
I'm CEO Lee Seung Woo.

1217
00:44:16,242 --> 00:44:20,452
I won the lottery on August 31, 2024.

1218
00:44:20,712 --> 00:44:23,882
I tossed and turned before I fell asleep.

1219
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:26,651
A firetruck suddenly drove past.

1220
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:28,068
(A firetruck appeared in his dream.)

1221
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,861
The car plate of the firetruck...

1222
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:34,231
was 33 Ha 1321.

1223
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:37,461
And six firefighters stepped out of the firetruck.

1224
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:39,142
(6 firefighters got out of the firetruck.)

1225
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:44,072
(The owner woke up and wrote down the numbers.)

1226
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:47,742
I combined the numbers I saw plus 119...

1227
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:49,512
and formed the lottery numbers.

1228
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,581
And I won the lottery with those numbers.

1229
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:54,582
(He won 1st prize in the lottery.)

1230
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:57,421
(How much was the prize money?)

1231
00:44:57,422 --> 00:44:59,521
My prize money...

1232
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:00,951
was 2.9 million dollars.

1233
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:02,092
(2.0 million dollars)

1234
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:04,931
(The actual amount)

1235
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:06,792
(1st prize money)

1236
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:09,832
I initially majored in architectural design.

1237
00:45:10,062 --> 00:45:13,232
The business didn't do well.

1238
00:45:13,832 --> 00:45:18,412
Firstly, I paid back the loan I had from running the previous business.

1239
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:21,282
(He bought the Lamborghini with the prize money too.)

1240
00:45:21,382 --> 00:45:24,582
Because firefighters appeared in my dream,

1241
00:45:24,712 --> 00:45:28,422
I thought I could make a brand related to firefighters...

1242
00:45:28,822 --> 00:45:31,391
to share my luck...

1243
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:34,092
with others.

1244
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:38,291
So I made this brand with the prize money.

1245
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:40,132
(So he made the discarded turnout gear brand.)

1246
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:43,562
(The lottery winner's pop-up store, is it real?)

1247
00:45:43,932 --> 00:45:45,071
Really?

1248
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,172
(That's rather suspicious.)

1249
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,472
You won the first prize in the lottery?

1250
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:50,642
That's right.

1251
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:53,112
How much did you get after tax?

1252
00:45:53,172 --> 00:45:55,942
About two million dollars.

1253
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:58,852
- Lottery... - That's a lot.

1254
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:01,352
You saw those six numbers in your dream?

1255
00:46:01,582 --> 00:46:02,681
Well...

1256
00:46:02,682 --> 00:46:04,721
Since it's 119,

1257
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:06,552
I chose 1 and 19.

1258
00:46:06,752 --> 00:46:08,421
And since there were six firefighters,

1259
00:46:08,422 --> 00:46:09,521
- I chose six. - Six.

1260
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:12,761
- The car plate was 33 Ha 1321. - The car number?

1261
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:13,991
The car number.

1262
00:46:13,992 --> 00:46:17,102
- So I chose 33, 13, and 21. - So 33 and 13?

1263
00:46:17,802 --> 00:46:20,472
It's amazing that you got the order right.

1264
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:23,471
You don't need to get the order right.

1265
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:25,071
- Really? - You didn't know?

1266
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:26,241
The order doesn't matter.

1267
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,842
You've never bought a lottery, have you?

1268
00:46:27,982 --> 00:46:29,012
No.

1269
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:32,312
(Anyway, he's a very lucky man.)

1270
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:36,722
How did the brand become so popular within a short period?

1271
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:39,352
- Since I'm obsessed with luck, - Luck.

1272
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:41,921
When people come to my pop-up store,

1273
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:45,561
they can get discounts based on luck.

1274
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:48,062
(We give discounts based on your luck.)

1275
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:51,872
You could call me lucky guy.

1276
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,372
I wanted to share my luck with many people.

1277
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:58,611
So the theme of this pop-up store is "luck."

1278
00:46:58,612 --> 00:46:59,612
(Luck pop-up store)

1279
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:04,042
There are various events related to luck.

1280
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:09,152
For the first event, you need to guess 7.77 seconds.

1281
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,921
(Press the button at 7.77 seconds to get a 10 percent discount!)

1282
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:15,661
The second event is rock-paper-scissors.

1283
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:18,662
If you win, you get a discount.

1284
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,961
Lastly, if the amount you pay...

1285
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:24,101
includes the lucky number,

1286
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:27,202
you get a 10 percent discount.

1287
00:47:27,802 --> 00:47:30,871
If you're lucky enough to win all three events,

1288
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:33,842
you get up to a 30-percent discount.

1289
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:36,418
I went to a pop-up store which is obsessed with luck.

1290
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:38,562
The luckier you are, the more benefits you can enjoy.

1291
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:41,251
A lot of fashion influencers...

1292
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:43,452
like this brand.

1293
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:47,992
(It became even more popular after Jang Hee Ryung wore it.)

1294
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:49,291
The current annual revenue...

1295
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:50,522
is two million dollars.

1296
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:55,062
(This place became a hot spot with its luck concept.)

1297
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:57,901
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

1298
00:47:57,902 --> 00:48:00,032
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1299
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:03,102
If this is fake,

1300
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:04,871
- it means they designed all these. - It's easy.

1301
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:06,141
- It's doable. - It's difficult.

1302
00:48:06,142 --> 00:48:07,171
- You think it's doable? - It's doable.

1303
00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:08,312
To make all these clothes?

1304
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:13,512
(Are all these fakes created to fool the members?)

1305
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:15,821
It's not easy to do so.

1306
00:48:15,822 --> 00:48:17,551
You need the warehouse...

1307
00:48:17,552 --> 00:48:19,352
and the factory too.

1308
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,121
That's right.

1309
00:48:21,122 --> 00:48:23,692
(It's too large a scale to be fake.)

1310
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:26,632
(Is this real or fake? They're getting more confused.)

1311
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:29,601
I...

1312
00:48:29,602 --> 00:48:30,938
(It seems like Mimi remembered something.)

1313
00:48:30,962 --> 00:48:32,672
- I... - Do you know?

1314
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:34,501
- Do you know this brand? - I'm getting goosebumps.

1315
00:48:34,502 --> 00:48:35,502
- You know this brand? - Why?

1316
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:37,171
A few days ago,

1317
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:40,242
my manager wore this brand's clothes.

1318
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:42,042
I remember which one.

1319
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:43,882
This.

1320
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:45,851
My manager wore the exact same clothes.

1321
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:47,881
My manager doesn't wear clothes that stand out,

1322
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,122
but he wore this.

1323
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,882
Did the production crew send it to him?

1324
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:52,391
- They definitely did. - I think so.

1325
00:48:52,392 --> 00:48:54,122
They must've sent it to him.

1326
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:57,321
The brand is pretty popular nowadays.

1327
00:48:57,322 --> 00:48:58,392
You know it?

1328
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:01,562
- You know it? - I went trekking recently.

1329
00:49:01,932 --> 00:49:03,661
- Two of my friends wore it. - Where did you go?

1330
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:05,301
(2 of my friends wore clothes from this brand.)

1331
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:07,602
I went trekking on Mount Bukak.

1332
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:10,502
They couldn't have contacted Kyung Pyo's friends.

1333
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:12,971
- Mine was real. - They couldn't have contacted...

1334
00:49:12,972 --> 00:49:16,282
I'm sure they didn't fake it.

1335
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:17,781
Have you seen this brand, Shin Hye?

1336
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:20,552
My friend is wearing it.

1337
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,921
(A photo of Jang Hee Ryung, a friend of Shin Hye and Kyung Pyo)

1338
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:25,221
Did they ask Hee Ryung for help because she's our friend?

1339
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:26,592
They could've.

1340
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:29,122
If they go that far to fool us...

1341
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:31,422
Sixth Sense is scary.

1342
00:49:31,762 --> 00:49:33,131
Let's look around.

1343
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:34,832
Let's check out the clothes.

1344
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:36,802
The clothes are pretty.

1345
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:40,371
- People like clothes like this. - They're pretty.

1346
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:42,142
(Pretty products catch their eyes.)

1347
00:49:42,172 --> 00:49:44,101
Clothes like that are nice.

1348
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:45,771
- Right? A hoodie is nice. - Yes.

1349
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:47,541
- A hoodie is just nice. - Yes, it goes well with anything.

1350
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,712
I'll try this.

1351
00:49:49,942 --> 00:49:52,052
(He tries it on before buying it.)

1352
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:54,251
(Surprised)

1353
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,381
It's pretty.

1354
00:49:55,382 --> 00:49:56,421
It suits you well.

1355
00:49:56,422 --> 00:49:58,502
The color goes well with the hat you're wearing too.

1356
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:00,591
Today's outfit.

1357
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:01,761
(He really likes it.)

1358
00:50:01,762 --> 00:50:03,392
It's perfect.

1359
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:04,891
It looks good on you too.

1360
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:06,231
The color goes well with the sweatshirt you're wearing.

1361
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:07,692
- It's perfect. - Really?

1362
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:09,762
- You look so much younger. - It's nice.

1363
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:12,001
You look young.

1364
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,702
(I look young?)

1365
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:16,472
- Because you said he looks young... - This is perfect.

1366
00:50:16,502 --> 00:50:18,242
- It's much better, right? - Yes.

1367
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:20,171
It's better than the flower jacket.

1368
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:21,711
- The flower jacket... - The flower jacket.

1369
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:23,341
- It's nice. - It's really nice.

1370
00:50:23,342 --> 00:50:24,642
I should buy this.

1371
00:50:24,742 --> 00:50:26,751
Can I have this short-sleeved shirt, large size?

1372
00:50:26,752 --> 00:50:28,251
This print on the back is so cute.

1373
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:29,281
It's pretty.

1374
00:50:29,282 --> 00:50:30,651
Can I have small size?

1375
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,291
- It's pretty. - Mine's large size.

1376
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:33,492
Isn't this cute?

1377
00:50:33,892 --> 00:50:35,422
Can I have this color, please?

1378
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:36,721
Gray for me, please.

1379
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:38,668
(Current order list: Jae Seok, Mimi, navy hoodie jacket)

1380
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:41,732
- This bag too... - Yes.

1381
00:50:41,862 --> 00:50:43,101
You're right.

1382
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:45,432
- It uses the fabric? - Yes, the turnout gear.

1383
00:50:45,672 --> 00:50:47,231
I think they only make use of these parts.

1384
00:50:47,232 --> 00:50:49,172
- Just these parts. Not this. - Yes.

1385
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:52,711
Turnout gears are precious clothes...

1386
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:54,172
that protect firefighters' lives.

1387
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:58,751
They go to more than 300 accident sites each year...

1388
00:50:58,752 --> 00:51:01,882
and protect the firefighters. They're gears with luck.

1389
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:07,621
It has the traces of various fires.

1390
00:51:07,622 --> 00:51:10,822
(Turnout gears have the traces left from saving lives.)

1391
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:13,061
It's most important...

1392
00:51:13,062 --> 00:51:14,932
to collect the discarded turnout gears.

1393
00:51:15,862 --> 00:51:17,701
Once collected,

1394
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:19,171
they're washed thoroughly.

1395
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:20,872
(Wash the turnout gears cleanly.)

1396
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:22,671
After they're washed,

1397
00:51:22,672 --> 00:51:25,572
they're taken apart by hand.

1398
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:29,412
(A turnout gear disassembled neatly)

1399
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:31,581
The disassembled turnout gears...

1400
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:34,812
are turned into products based on the designs.

1401
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:38,721
(Turnout gears are given new lives through upcycling.)

1402
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:40,622
The products created...

1403
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:43,591
are sold in pop-up stores and online.

1404
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:45,392
(The rebirth of turnout gears)

1405
00:51:45,492 --> 00:51:47,561
- The chest part. - Parts like this.

1406
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,002
- That's right. - This, right?

1407
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:51,702
- I think this place is real. - Right?

1408
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:56,002
If this is fake, I'll have the shock of my life.

1409
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,212
Then... Hold on. To get discounts...

1410
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:02,611
- There's rock-paper-scissors. - Let's go.

1411
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:03,912
(Next is the lucky events.)

1412
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:07,052
I want to try guessing 7.77 seconds.

1413
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,851
- I'll try. - Go ahead.

1414
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:12,722
Right away.

1415
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:14,922
- One. - One, two.

1416
00:52:15,862 --> 00:52:17,992
- Four, five, six. - Four, five, six.

1417
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:20,992
(The number increases rapidly.)

1418
00:52:21,592 --> 00:52:22,602
Seven.

1419
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:26,102
(What's the result?)

1420
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:28,271
(Jae Seok's record, 7.24 seconds)

1421
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:29,342
That was close.

1422
00:52:29,642 --> 00:52:31,301
(What a pity.)

1423
00:52:31,302 --> 00:52:33,041
(Catch the Lucky 7.77 Seconds! Jae Seok, 7.24 seconds)

1424
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,912
(Unlucky)

1425
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:36,182
(Groaning)

1426
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:38,311
(Upset)

1427
00:52:38,312 --> 00:52:39,581
I'll go next.

1428
00:52:39,582 --> 00:52:41,462
- How do I do this? - The reset button is here.

1429
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:42,952
Let's go.

1430
00:52:43,322 --> 00:52:46,552
One, two, three, four...

1431
00:52:47,092 --> 00:52:49,762
(The energy of the universe, come to me.)

1432
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:52,062
(He pressed it!)

1433
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:54,732
(What's the result?)

1434
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:56,332
Seven. Stop!

1435
00:52:57,832 --> 00:52:59,072
- It's 7.70 seconds. - My gosh.

1436
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:02,072
(Seok Jin's record, 7.70 seconds, currently in 1st place)

1437
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:05,911
(That was very close.)

1438
00:53:05,912 --> 00:53:07,071
It's 7.70 seconds.

1439
00:53:07,072 --> 00:53:08,341
He's so close. Shouldn't you give him a discount?

1440
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:09,611
I'm this close.

1441
00:53:09,612 --> 00:53:11,612
- Shouldn't I get a discount? - It's 7.70 seconds.

1442
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:13,712
- You were almost there. - I was.

1443
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,781
Shin Hye, you go next.

1444
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:18,352
- You were 0.07 seconds away. - I need to be that precise?

1445
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:22,962
One, two, three, four...

1446
00:53:23,622 --> 00:53:26,062
(He's even more nervous than her.)

1447
00:53:26,392 --> 00:53:28,562
(What's the result?)

1448
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:31,771
(Shocked)

1449
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:33,872
(Let's go!)

1450
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:36,202
That's the highest score.

1451
00:53:37,102 --> 00:53:39,611
(Upset)

1452
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:41,781
- That's the highest score. - Don't look at the big seven.

1453
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:45,411
You should look at the decimals instead.

1454
00:53:45,412 --> 00:53:46,851
- The numbers on the right? - Yes.

1455
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:47,882
(It's not easy.)

1456
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:50,562
Play rock-paper-scissors with the owner three times.

1457
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:52,752
- I need to win three times, right? - Yes.

1458
00:53:53,322 --> 00:53:54,751
- What will you throw? - I can't tell you that.

1459
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:56,192
I get it.

1460
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:58,632
(Very interested)

1461
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:00,331
Rock-paper-scissors!

1462
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:02,002
(Scissors, paper)

1463
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:03,632
- You won! - You won.

1464
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:06,002
- I won once. - Yes.

1465
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,372
(The 2nd attempt)

1466
00:54:08,642 --> 00:54:09,942
Rock-paper-scissors!

1467
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:11,872
(He wins again.)

1468
00:54:12,812 --> 00:54:13,941
- Just one more. - One more.

1469
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:16,341
(Amazed)

1470
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:17,441
- I just need to win one more time. - One more time.

1471
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:18,512
You can do it.

1472
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:22,122
(Nervous)

1473
00:54:22,252 --> 00:54:23,721
Rock-paper-scissors!

1474
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:24,751
(Scissors)

1475
00:54:24,752 --> 00:54:26,122
(Rock, paper)

1476
00:54:26,452 --> 00:54:29,222
(He fails.)

1477
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,032
- I'm sorry. - Winning three times...

1478
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,991
I can't get the discount.

1479
00:54:34,992 --> 00:54:36,302
(He's very upset.)

1480
00:54:37,062 --> 00:54:38,971
- It's not easy. - It's hard to get that ten percent.

1481
00:54:38,972 --> 00:54:39,972
Exactly.

1482
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:41,608
- What's the last one? - What's the last one?

1483
00:54:41,632 --> 00:54:43,001
If the total payment amount includes today's lucky number,

1484
00:54:43,002 --> 00:54:44,402
you get a ten percent discount?

1485
00:54:45,512 --> 00:54:47,141
We have everything we want to buy here.

1486
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:48,172
Yes.

1487
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:50,582
Will you pay all at once?

1488
00:54:51,282 --> 00:54:52,282
(Glancing)

1489
00:54:54,982 --> 00:54:56,121
(He quickly checks the amount.)

1490
00:54:56,122 --> 00:54:57,422
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors?

1491
00:54:57,722 --> 00:54:59,091
- Yes. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors...

1492
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:00,451
to decide who pays.

1493
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:02,172
Play rock-paper-scissors with me, Jae Seok.

1494
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:03,821
- Shall we? - Pay for everyone.

1495
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,091
- Pay for everyone? - Pay for everyone.

1496
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,332
Then let's play that.

1497
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:10,031
(The 7.77 event which nobody succeeded)

1498
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:11,131
- That one? - Let's play that.

1499
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:12,701
- That's a good idea. - Okay.

1500
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:13,931
- Let's go. - That's nice.

1501
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:16,001
- The one closer to 7.77... - The one closer to 7.77.

1502
00:55:16,002 --> 00:55:18,172
- wins. - The two oldest's match.

1503
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:20,242
- Do I go first? - Yes.

1504
00:55:20,842 --> 00:55:24,541
This is worth 500 dollars.

1505
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:25,712
(Very nervous)

1506
00:55:27,082 --> 00:55:29,552
One, two, three...

1507
00:55:30,422 --> 00:55:32,192
The person closer to 7.77 seconds wins.

1508
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:34,792
(Nervous)

1509
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:38,362
- Five, six, seven, stop! - Seven.

1510
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:41,262
(He confidently pressed the stop button.)

1511
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,932
(How many seconds is it?)

1512
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:45,372
Seven, stop!

1513
00:55:46,102 --> 00:55:47,301
- That's not too bad. - It was close.

1514
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,372
Right?

1515
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:50,541
(A pretty stable record)

1516
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:52,011
- It's 7.65. - It's 7.65.

1517
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:53,372
I think I can win.

1518
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:55,242
Then...

1519
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:58,341
- The difference has to be 0.11. - It has to be less than 0.11.

1520
00:55:58,342 --> 00:56:00,462
(Jae Seok wins if it's between 7.66 to 7.88 seconds.)

1521
00:56:00,952 --> 00:56:01,981
Who will win?

1522
00:56:01,982 --> 00:56:03,751
(Whose side is the deity of victory on?)

1523
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:04,752
Start.

1524
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:06,222
One.

1525
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:09,792
Five, six, seven.

1526
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:12,962
(Please.)

1527
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:15,862
Five, six, seven.

1528
00:56:16,132 --> 00:56:18,902
(What's the result?)

1529
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:22,842
I won!

1530
00:56:23,372 --> 00:56:26,072
(I won!)

1531
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:27,711
(He loses to Seok Jin by 0.06 seconds.)

1532
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:29,512
(Unlucky)

1533
00:56:29,682 --> 00:56:31,381
- I won. - I was too hasty.

1534
00:56:31,382 --> 00:56:33,381
- I won. - Thanks for the clothes.

1535
00:56:33,382 --> 00:56:34,881
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1536
00:56:34,882 --> 00:56:36,282
Thanks, Jae Seok.

1537
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,982
I was hasty.

1538
00:56:38,522 --> 00:56:40,652
What's the lucky number?

1539
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:44,192
The total amount includes today's lucky number.

1540
00:56:44,462 --> 00:56:46,492
- It does? - Yes.

1541
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:49,631
The total amount is 295 dollars.

1542
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:50,632
Yes.

1543
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:51,931
- Here. - Two.

1544
00:56:51,932 --> 00:56:53,001
Two was the lucky number?

1545
00:56:53,002 --> 00:56:54,478
(The lucky number, 2, is included, so he gets a 10 percent discount.)

1546
00:56:54,502 --> 00:56:57,742
With the 10 percent discount, it's 265.5 dollars.

1547
00:56:58,772 --> 00:56:59,772
(Lucky)

1548
00:56:59,773 --> 00:57:01,772
- That's not bad. - I got a 10 percent discount.

1549
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:05,651
It isn't as expensive as I thought.

1550
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:07,652
- Yes. We bought quite a lot. - Yes.

1551
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:10,922
This is included in there too, right?

1552
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:14,091
Oh, that's not included.

1553
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:15,621
- It's not included? - It's not included?

1554
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:16,821
- Please give me a second. - Why...

1555
00:57:16,822 --> 00:57:18,461
- Hold on. - There's an unexpected variable.

1556
00:57:18,462 --> 00:57:19,891
- This... - A green hooded jacked.

1557
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:21,492
Let's not buy this, then.

1558
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:24,461
(Laughing)

1559
00:57:24,462 --> 00:57:27,002
Come on, I really like this. Why can't I buy it?

1560
00:57:28,502 --> 00:57:30,602
(This is so funny.)

1561
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:32,341
- The lucky number... - Why'd you say that?

1562
00:57:32,342 --> 00:57:33,911
Because the lucky number...

1563
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:35,111
This is so funny.

1564
00:57:35,112 --> 00:57:36,711
The lucky number will be ruined.

1565
00:57:36,712 --> 00:57:37,882
- That's true. - Yes.

1566
00:57:38,082 --> 00:57:40,111
- Still. Why didn't you add this? - Okay.

1567
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:41,811
- This is impossible. - No wonder...

1568
00:57:41,812 --> 00:57:43,252
- it was way too cheap. - I...

1569
00:57:43,952 --> 00:57:45,852
You were wearing it the whole time.

1570
00:57:46,122 --> 00:57:48,392
Did you pay for everyone except Seok Jin?

1571
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:51,522
- What? - Just those three, please.

1572
00:57:51,622 --> 00:57:53,261
- It'll ruin the lucky number. - Okay.

1573
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,762
- It'll ruin the lucky number. - Yes.

1574
00:57:55,192 --> 00:57:56,331
Come and take yours.

1575
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:57,861
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1576
00:57:57,862 --> 00:57:59,071
- Thank you. - Guys.

1577
00:57:59,072 --> 00:58:00,271
They're presents from me...

1578
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:01,502
- because I won. - Thank you.

1579
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:04,442
Thank you for the clothes.

1580
00:58:04,742 --> 00:58:06,572
Thank you for the clothes.

1581
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:09,942
You all have one each.

1582
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:11,511
(They look so close with each other.)

1583
00:58:11,512 --> 00:58:13,781
You're carrying them as if showing them off.

1584
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,911
- Really? - But...

1585
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,551
Well, it's nice to see.

1586
00:58:16,552 --> 00:58:17,852
(Envious)

1587
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:20,492
- Are you okay? - I'm okay, of course.

1588
00:58:21,192 --> 00:58:22,712
Seok Jin, you can pretend to have one.

1589
00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:24,991
- Okay. - Pretend to have one.

1590
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:26,232
We all have one now.

1591
00:58:27,062 --> 00:58:30,061
Or I can buy my own.

1592
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:32,301
(I can buy my own, can't I?)

1593
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:33,371
I'll have one.

1594
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:35,541
You can.

1595
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:37,401
(Laughing)

1596
00:58:37,402 --> 00:58:39,111
I'll have one.

1597
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:41,272
Gosh, I'm so upset. I'll get one myself.

1598
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:44,842
(This is so funny.)

1599
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:46,351
- The lucky number. - My gosh.

1600
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:49,482
Do I have the lucky number?

1601
00:58:49,882 --> 00:58:51,351
- You have. - I have it.

1602
00:58:51,352 --> 00:58:53,022
- You did it. - I have the lucky number.

1603
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:54,922
I have it.

1604
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:56,921
- We got it separately. - We both got the lucky number...

1605
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:58,261
- because we split it up. - Yes.

1606
00:58:58,262 --> 00:58:59,461
Congratulations.

1607
00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:00,631
- I'll buy this. - Rock-paper-scissors?

1608
00:59:00,632 --> 00:59:01,791
Rock-paper-scissors too.

1609
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,631
- I'll play rock-paper-scissors. - You have a chance too.

1610
00:59:03,632 --> 00:59:04,831
If I win, I get 20 percent off.

1611
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,471
- You get one more chance. - I'll throw scissors.

1612
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:08,402
Rock-paper-scissors!

1613
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:10,042
(He won!)

1614
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:11,901
- You won once. - You won once.

1615
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:13,042
Rock-paper-scissors!

1616
00:59:13,942 --> 00:59:15,071
(Dejected)

1617
00:59:15,072 --> 00:59:16,181
You lost?

1618
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:17,642
That one, 7.77 seconds.

1619
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,581
Play that one more time.

1620
00:59:19,582 --> 00:59:21,502
- I'll try 7.77 seconds. - The 7.77-second game.

1621
00:59:22,082 --> 00:59:24,052
He's busy all by himself.

1622
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:27,552
One, two, three...

1623
00:59:28,052 --> 00:59:29,062
seven.

1624
00:59:30,562 --> 00:59:32,592
- My gosh! - Did you get it?

1625
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:35,261
(What's the result?)

1626
00:59:35,262 --> 00:59:36,462
It's 7.73 seconds.

1627
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:38,202
That's 0.04 second difference.

1628
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:40,631
(He is amazing.)

1629
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:41,832
He's amazing.

1630
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:44,871
- I have the lucky number, right? - Yes, you have it.

1631
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,372
He's amazing.

1632
00:59:46,842 --> 00:59:48,071
You're very determined.

1633
00:59:48,072 --> 00:59:49,582
(A determined Korean)

1634
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:51,481
- It's done. - Okay.

1635
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:52,482
Please sign here.

1636
00:59:52,483 --> 00:59:54,711
You bought it too,

1637
00:59:54,712 --> 00:59:56,482
- so I feel better. - Now...

1638
00:59:56,622 --> 00:59:58,081
I feel like we're one team.

1639
00:59:58,082 --> 00:59:59,491
You almost missed it.

1640
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:01,292
He felt left out.

1641
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:04,192
But what would be fake about this place?

1642
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:07,461
The brand could be real, right?

1643
01:00:07,462 --> 01:00:08,492
Yes.

1644
01:00:08,762 --> 01:00:10,262
I think the clothes are real.

1645
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:12,401
But it's so strange.

1646
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:14,132
(Then what's fake?)

1647
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:15,701
(Thinking hard)

1648
01:00:15,702 --> 01:00:17,242
The lottery is fake.

1649
01:00:17,402 --> 01:00:18,671
- The lottery? - I think so too.

1650
01:00:18,672 --> 01:00:19,712
Yes.

1651
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:23,112
His dream sounded so fake.

1652
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:27,452
(The dream that taught him the lottery numbers)

1653
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:29,351
- The dream... - Yes.

1654
01:00:29,352 --> 01:00:31,682
Telling him the numbers seems so fake.

1655
01:00:32,022 --> 01:00:34,328
The story of starting the business after winning the lottery is fake.

1656
01:00:34,352 --> 01:00:36,062
The dream...

1657
01:00:36,222 --> 01:00:37,592
This is...

1658
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:39,892
Kyung Pyo.

1659
01:00:39,893 --> 01:00:42,601
Is there any chance of the staff knowing your friends?

1660
01:00:42,602 --> 01:00:43,802
Not at all.

1661
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,531
- They're your personal friends? - Totally.

1662
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,678
(Kyung Pyo's friends seem suspicious the more they think about it.)

1663
01:00:48,702 --> 01:00:54,772
(Kyung Pyo's friends wore the brand's clothes recently.)

1664
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:58,981
There's no way the staff could know about them.

1665
01:00:58,982 --> 01:01:02,082
I haven't seen one of them for a very long time.

1666
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:04,751
The staff wouldn't know him as my acquaintance.

1667
01:01:04,752 --> 01:01:06,328
(The non-celebrity friends the staff wouldn't know)

1668
01:01:06,352 --> 01:01:08,251
The staff wouldn't go that far.

1669
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:09,661
- That's right. - I know. It'd be too much.

1670
01:01:09,662 --> 01:01:10,892
It was a personal appointment.

1671
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,191
They wouldn't have known about the day we went trekking.

1672
01:01:13,192 --> 01:01:14,531
It was a personal appointment.

1673
01:01:14,532 --> 01:01:15,772
- That's right. - It'd be hard.

1674
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:18,531
I can't fall into my own trap. This makes no sense.

1675
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:19,731
(1. Upcycled turnout gear? 2. Suspicious lottery win)

1676
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:21,078
(3. A popular brand or the production crew's work?)

1677
01:01:21,102 --> 01:01:22,131
What's the last one?

1678
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:23,971
It's Space where Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears, and Hands...

1679
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,842
- are Busy - Space.

1680
01:01:26,072 --> 01:01:27,072
Let's go.

1681
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:30,842
The second one seems so fake.

1682
01:01:30,912 --> 01:01:33,881
- If it's fake, I'll get chills. - Same here.

1683
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:37,381
Our acquaintances are involved.

1684
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:38,991
Do the production crew go that far?

1685
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:40,521
- Of course. - Yes, they do.

1686
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:41,792
They could do that.

1687
01:01:41,892 --> 01:01:44,421
They could recruit Hee Ryung,

1688
01:01:44,422 --> 01:01:45,861
make her wear that clothing, and put up a photo

1689
01:01:45,862 --> 01:01:47,192
That would give me chills.

1690
01:01:48,262 --> 01:01:51,662
(She never bragged about her friendship with Hee Ryung.)

1691
01:01:52,102 --> 01:01:55,902
(Is the photo of Shin Hye's friend, Hee Ryung, real?)

1692
01:01:56,302 --> 01:01:58,342
If the second one is fake, I...

1693
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:01,541
- Will you get a mental breakdown? - Seriously. I'll lose all my hair.

1694
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:04,941
Didn't your friends say anything about their clothes?

1695
01:02:04,942 --> 01:02:08,852
I wasn't curious. But they went,

1696
01:02:08,922 --> 01:02:10,451
"You're wearing this brand too!"

1697
01:02:10,452 --> 01:02:11,681
- What? - Two male friends did that.

1698
01:02:11,682 --> 01:02:13,322
- That's suspicious. - That's suspicious.

1699
01:02:13,592 --> 01:02:15,621
But how would the production crew...

1700
01:02:15,622 --> 01:02:18,262
- get my friends involved? - That's...

1701
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:20,731
This is hard.

1702
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:22,708
- I don't have a clue today. - For goodness' sake.

1703
01:02:22,732 --> 01:02:25,462
The production crew made it very hard this time.

1704
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:27,871
Perhaps they put more effort into it since it was the last time.

1705
01:02:27,872 --> 01:02:29,201
I know. I think they did that.

1706
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:30,971
It's hard today. It's hard until the very end.

1707
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:32,811
I know. When I think that I have a hunch, I get it wrong.

1708
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:34,711
Mimi, that happens all the time.

1709
01:02:34,712 --> 01:02:36,542
I know. We never have a clue.

1710
01:02:37,112 --> 01:02:38,952
I don't have a single clue.

1711
01:02:39,282 --> 01:02:40,412
For goodness' sake.

1712
01:02:40,782 --> 01:02:41,982
"For goodness' sake."

1713
01:02:42,322 --> 01:02:44,252
- Gosh. - For goodness' sake.

1714
01:02:44,322 --> 01:02:46,551
We're heading toward Garosu-gil.

1715
01:02:46,552 --> 01:02:48,522
The colorful leaves are very pretty.

1716
01:02:48,622 --> 01:02:50,622
(The place that makes you look outside the window)

1717
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:52,092
(The place unfolds...)

1718
01:02:52,832 --> 01:02:54,091
This street is pretty.

1719
01:02:54,092 --> 01:02:55,191
(when you make a turn from Dosa-daero)

1720
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:56,431
It's Garosu-gil.

1721
01:02:56,432 --> 01:02:58,392
(The golden Garosu-gil with the colorful leaves!)

1722
01:03:01,072 --> 01:03:03,102
(All the popular brands are here.)

1723
01:03:03,672 --> 01:03:07,341
(It's full of hip tourists who are here to shop.)

1724
01:03:07,342 --> 01:03:09,442
(Cool)

1725
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:11,141
(A must-visit place in Gangnam to go shopping)

1726
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:12,142
This place...

1727
01:03:12,482 --> 01:03:14,411
- I haven't been here in a while. - I know.

1728
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:15,512
All right.

1729
01:03:15,882 --> 01:03:17,652
- Hello. - Hello.

1730
01:03:18,852 --> 01:03:20,751
From the early hours...

1731
01:03:20,752 --> 01:03:22,921
- Is it lunchtime? - Yes. Seriously.

1732
01:03:22,922 --> 01:03:25,961
- From the early hours... - I know. It looks tasty.

1733
01:03:25,962 --> 01:03:27,492
I want something like yukhoe bibimbap.

1734
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,891
(It's because you had too much bread.)

1735
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,531
- Yukhoe bibimbap. - You feel queasy from eating bread.

1736
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:31,532
- I feel queasy. - I feel queasy.

1737
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:33,271
(Queasy? I feel queasy.)

1738
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,501
(They walk as they do the Queasy Dance.)

1739
01:03:35,502 --> 01:03:36,941
- Hold on. What's this place? - Did we arrive at the place?

1740
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:39,171
- What? - Isn't this a tarot place?

1741
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:40,172
(They spot a tarot place!)

1742
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:43,081
It makes sense to get a tarot reading done on January 1.

1743
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:44,112
Okay.

1744
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:45,952
It's a real place, right?

1745
01:03:47,352 --> 01:03:48,872
Who wants to get a tarot reading done?

1746
01:03:50,922 --> 01:03:53,022
(How will be the members' fortune in 2026?)

1747
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:57,491
- Hello. - Hello.

1748
01:03:57,492 --> 01:03:59,361
I really believe things like this.

1749
01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:00,561
Thank you.

1750
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:01,632
He really believes them.

1751
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:05,672
What do you want to know the most about 2026?

1752
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:07,731
I bet you're curious about how your work will go.

1753
01:04:07,732 --> 01:04:08,972
I want to know about work...

1754
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:10,402
as well as...

1755
01:04:10,702 --> 01:04:12,572
investment.

1756
01:04:12,742 --> 01:04:14,771
- Let's start with work. - Shall we do that?

1757
01:04:14,772 --> 01:04:16,018
You should get a reading about work.

1758
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:18,141
Seok Jin brought up investment right away.

1759
01:04:18,142 --> 01:04:19,151
(Don't get too involved. Get a reading done for fun!)

1760
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:20,211
I'm not surprised.

1761
01:04:20,212 --> 01:04:22,422
(What's Seok Jin's fortune for work, not investment?)

1762
01:04:22,522 --> 01:04:24,222
- Five cards. - Five cards?

1763
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:27,268
Shall I pick them as I think about the matter?

1764
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:28,691
(Careful)

1765
01:04:28,692 --> 01:04:30,391
- One. - You can keep your eyes open.

1766
01:04:30,392 --> 01:04:32,261
- What? - You can keep your eyes open.

1767
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:34,531
- Really? - Don't get intimidated.

1768
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:36,261
- It's nerve-racking. - Gosh.

1769
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:38,108
- Do it more lightheartedly. - Why is it so nerve-racking?

1770
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:39,371
It's a tarot reading.

1771
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:41,172
I know. Here you go.

1772
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,142
I hope I picked the right cards.

1773
01:04:43,572 --> 01:04:45,071
I get nervous about things like this.

1774
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:46,772
(She opens the cards.)

1775
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:49,712
- There's a dark card. - That's...

1776
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:53,482
A man in black with his head hung.

1777
01:04:53,712 --> 01:04:55,211
Gosh, he's struggling a lot.

1778
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:56,221
(Depressed)

1779
01:04:56,222 --> 01:04:57,322
He's struggling a lot.

1780
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:00,222
Gosh, that looks bad.

1781
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,992
Why do they look like...

1782
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:05,202
- they're crumbling under pain? - Come on.

1783
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:06,292
Am I wrong?

1784
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:10,231
- Don't jump to conclusions. - Okay.

1785
01:05:10,232 --> 01:05:13,731
With positivity, these cards can mean something nice.

1786
01:05:13,732 --> 01:05:15,402
You don't need to worry in advance.

1787
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:17,071
- Pick five more cards. - Five more cards?

1788
01:05:17,072 --> 01:05:18,371
I think she wants to start over.

1789
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,071
Is he picking five more cards because those ones are terrible?

1790
01:05:20,072 --> 01:05:21,771
(Oh, no. They must be very bad.)

1791
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:24,012
Maybe the tarot reader is shocked by the terrible cards.

1792
01:05:24,142 --> 01:05:26,181
They were so bad that you asked me to pick the cards again.

1793
01:05:26,182 --> 01:05:27,851
- That's how it is. - Is it natural to pick ten cads?

1794
01:05:27,852 --> 01:05:31,451
I proceed with things as I assess the situation.

1795
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:32,821
You didn't pick the cards again...

1796
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:34,221
- since the previous ones were bad. - Of course not.

1797
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,491
Seok Jin has been around for a long time.

1798
01:05:36,492 --> 01:05:37,521
- Of course. - That's right.

1799
01:05:37,522 --> 01:05:39,391
- A very long time. - I'm mild-mannered.

1800
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:40,631
- Look. - He has the wisdom of life.

1801
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,262
What? He's getting a lot of money.

1802
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:46,772
(The cards at the bottom definitely look bright.)

1803
01:05:46,832 --> 01:05:50,141
- The hardships... Look. - Okay.

1804
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:53,371
Although you work a lot, the results are unsatisfactory and stressful.

1805
01:05:53,372 --> 01:05:56,541
- You don't get the results. - Okay.

1806
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:57,581
Nevertheless,

1807
01:05:57,582 --> 01:05:59,251
(Nevertheless?)

1808
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:01,881
you stay even, defend your place,

1809
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:03,582
and get what you want.

1810
01:06:03,722 --> 01:06:05,481
It's very positive, right?

1811
01:06:05,482 --> 01:06:06,551
(What I want?)

1812
01:06:06,552 --> 01:06:10,292
Seriously, the sun comes up and money pours down.

1813
01:06:10,522 --> 01:06:11,761
(Jealous)

1814
01:06:11,762 --> 01:06:15,801
These cards made me think, "He'll struggle a lot."

1815
01:06:15,802 --> 01:06:17,401
But if you resolve the situation well,

1816
01:06:17,402 --> 01:06:19,671
you won't fall behind.

1817
01:06:19,672 --> 01:06:21,431
You'll defend your place.

1818
01:06:21,432 --> 01:06:24,401
You'll get what you want.

1819
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:26,441
- I guess my dream will come true. - That's right.

1820
01:06:26,442 --> 01:06:27,841
- Work hard. - Thank you.

1821
01:06:27,842 --> 01:06:29,311
Thank goodness. That's a nice reading.

1822
01:06:29,312 --> 01:06:30,911
(We hope he'll make it big.)

1823
01:06:30,912 --> 01:06:32,951
- Okay. - It's nice.

1824
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:33,981
(It lacks scientific grounds, so beware of blind faith.)

1825
01:06:33,982 --> 01:06:35,251
- Shall I go next? - Go ahead.

1826
01:06:35,252 --> 01:06:36,351
Okay, I'll go next.

1827
01:06:36,352 --> 01:06:37,992
It's time to check out Jae Seok's energy.

1828
01:06:38,082 --> 01:06:40,951
Shall I get a reading done about wealth and work?

1829
01:06:40,952 --> 01:06:43,861
- That's right. - Work and wealth.

1830
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:45,562
- Pick five cards. - Five cards.

1831
01:06:45,792 --> 01:06:47,861
When it comes to you, wealth and work...

1832
01:06:47,862 --> 01:06:48,862
- That's right. - They're bound to be plentiful.

1833
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:50,531
- But I'm curious about them. - That's right.

1834
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:52,461
- It's human nature. - That's right.

1835
01:06:52,462 --> 01:06:54,401
Even when you're wealthy, you want more money.

1836
01:06:54,402 --> 01:06:55,402
(She opens the cards.)

1837
01:06:55,403 --> 01:06:57,523
- He chose them without hesitation. - Let's see them.

1838
01:06:58,702 --> 01:07:00,372
(What?)

1839
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:02,042
There are many swordsmen.

1840
01:07:03,282 --> 01:07:05,851
You put in a lot of effort to survive...

1841
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:07,911
despite competition according to this card.

1842
01:07:07,912 --> 01:07:09,011
- That's right. - He puts in a lot of effort.

1843
01:07:09,012 --> 01:07:10,121
- Look at these cards. - Okay.

1844
01:07:10,122 --> 01:07:13,621
Although people say that you're unrivaled,

1845
01:07:13,622 --> 01:07:16,261
- you struggle amidst competition... - Of course. You're right.

1846
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:18,191
And think hard about...

1847
01:07:18,192 --> 01:07:20,561
- what your work is. - You're right.

1848
01:07:20,562 --> 01:07:22,802
- Now, pick the cards again. - I'll pick five cards.

1849
01:07:23,702 --> 01:07:25,801
So he's living that kind of life.

1850
01:07:25,802 --> 01:07:27,131
We'll now see how his future will be.

1851
01:07:27,132 --> 01:07:28,372
I know since I've done it.

1852
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:31,942
(He carefully picks five cards.)

1853
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:35,442
(How will be Jae Seok's fortune regarding wealth in 2026?)

1854
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:37,042
These cards are impressive.

1855
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:39,581
(Full of positive energy)

1856
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:40,751
Look at these cards.

1857
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,052
They look amazing.

1858
01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:44,781
No matter what people say amidst competition, you go,

1859
01:07:44,782 --> 01:07:46,891
- "Bring it on. I can do it." - There are so many trees.

1860
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:49,821
You protect your place with steadiness.

1861
01:07:49,822 --> 01:07:51,591
It's fascinating. How do you overcome...

1862
01:07:51,592 --> 01:07:54,461
the hardships the cards show and fill your life...

1863
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:56,731
- with positive energy only? - That's incredible.

1864
01:07:56,732 --> 01:07:58,501
- Do the cards say that? - Look at them yourself.

1865
01:07:58,502 --> 01:08:00,401
You can tell from the shapes and forms of the cards.

1866
01:08:00,402 --> 01:08:01,971
- They're bright. - Right? They're bright.

1867
01:08:01,972 --> 01:08:03,002
You're right.

1868
01:08:04,202 --> 01:08:05,842
He defends the throne.

1869
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:08,672
(He'll be fortunate in 2026 as well.)

1870
01:08:09,012 --> 01:08:10,082
Is that the throne?

1871
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:13,751
The competition is fierce,

1872
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:18,121
but you have the mindset that you can do well.

1873
01:08:18,122 --> 01:08:20,221
You defend your place and continue to do well.

1874
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:22,698
(He'll overcome the hardships with positivity in the new year.)

1875
01:08:22,722 --> 01:08:24,491
(This girl is too absorbed.)

1876
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:25,662
That's cool.

1877
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:28,592
- Mimi, do you want to try it? - Let me try it.

1878
01:08:28,962 --> 01:08:31,401
- Mimi, what do you want to know? - I want to know about love.

1879
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:32,701
Love? Okay.

1880
01:08:32,702 --> 01:08:34,672
(The atmosphere gets heated up.)

1881
01:08:34,872 --> 01:08:36,442
Mimi, you should fall in love.

1882
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:38,672
Please do a reading on love.

1883
01:08:39,102 --> 01:08:41,012
People around me tell me...

1884
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:44,341
that I'll go into a relationship.

1885
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:45,912
Many people tell me that.

1886
01:08:46,652 --> 01:08:48,481
(Last week)

1887
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:49,921
(Mimi, you look like...)

1888
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:52,251
(you'll have a boyfriend. You have luck in finding love.)

1889
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:53,622
(Do I have luck in finding love?)

1890
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:56,561
(The fake shaman told her...)

1891
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:59,632
(that she'd have luck in finding love.)

1892
01:09:00,532 --> 01:09:03,561
(Will Mimi be able to begin a relationship?)

1893
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:04,832
(Taking out)

1894
01:09:05,032 --> 01:09:06,701
She uses different cards for love.

1895
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:09,902
The cards changed.

1896
01:09:10,302 --> 01:09:12,171
Is it okay to reveal all information?

1897
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:14,612
- Yes. - I must ask this question.

1898
01:09:14,742 --> 01:09:18,381
Is there someone who is on your mind even though you aren't dating him?

1899
01:09:18,382 --> 01:09:20,511
- No. - Is there someone you're dating?

1900
01:09:20,512 --> 01:09:23,582
- No. - You want to know if you'll meet...

1901
01:09:23,652 --> 01:09:24,982
- someone new. - That's right.

1902
01:09:25,052 --> 01:09:26,591
The cards changed.

1903
01:09:26,592 --> 01:09:29,662
Of course. Pick six cards.

1904
01:09:30,122 --> 01:09:31,791
Six cards. Two...

1905
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,461
- Pick 6 cards again. - Pick 6 cards again.

1906
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,792
- One, two, - Does she do it at once?

1907
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:37,461
- It's like that for love. - three,

1908
01:09:37,462 --> 01:09:39,301
- It's different... - four,

1909
01:09:39,302 --> 01:09:41,132
- when emotions are involved. - five,

1910
01:09:41,502 --> 01:09:42,502
six.

1911
01:09:42,632 --> 01:09:44,632
From the front, you look like a tarot card reader.

1912
01:09:45,172 --> 01:09:47,072
It's because of her hair.

1913
01:09:47,242 --> 01:09:49,111
(Approaching)

1914
01:09:49,112 --> 01:09:50,942
(Gosh, Mimi)

1915
01:09:51,512 --> 01:09:53,312
- What? - What?

1916
01:09:53,552 --> 01:09:54,612
Those cards look bad.

1917
01:09:56,382 --> 01:09:57,652
Many people are alone.

1918
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:00,622
A lovers' quarrel?

1919
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:03,422
(A spicy lovers' quarrel from the first relationship?)

1920
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:07,062
I'll explain the situation as it is.

1921
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:11,101
You have the energy to enter a new relationship.

1922
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:13,232
Something that wasn't there could begin.

1923
01:10:13,272 --> 01:10:15,101
You have the energy to enter a relationship.

1924
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:17,502
- You're very cute and pretty. - Okay.

1925
01:10:17,702 --> 01:10:18,842
However,

1926
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:21,241
you have the desire...

1927
01:10:21,242 --> 01:10:23,612
to know if the relationship will last for a long time.

1928
01:10:23,782 --> 01:10:26,251
If a man is desperate to date you,

1929
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:27,981
- you might give him a chance. - That's right.

1930
01:10:27,982 --> 01:10:30,081
But you'll see if he meets the standard.

1931
01:10:30,082 --> 01:10:31,121
That's right.

1932
01:10:31,122 --> 01:10:33,521
I don't spare a glance at a man unless he runs towards me.

1933
01:10:33,522 --> 01:10:34,721
- I see. - Yes.

1934
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:36,892
I want to date a man I can marry.

1935
01:10:37,422 --> 01:10:39,561
- Yes. You consider the future. - Seriously. I'm like that.

1936
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:41,932
I have to think about that before starting a relationship.

1937
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:44,361
(Oh, my)

1938
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:47,131
It won't be easy to enter a relationship with that thought.

1939
01:10:47,132 --> 01:10:49,701
If you think about whether or not someone is a husband material.

1940
01:10:49,702 --> 01:10:52,171
- how will you fall in love? - That's right. It'll be hard.

1941
01:10:52,172 --> 01:10:54,111
That's why I live this way.

1942
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:58,282
In the new year, you might change your mind...

1943
01:10:58,382 --> 01:11:00,411
and enter a relationship.

1944
01:11:00,412 --> 01:11:02,551
Just a relationship? Okay.

1945
01:11:02,552 --> 01:11:04,351
- Thank you. - Thank you, ma'am.

1946
01:11:04,352 --> 01:11:05,751
Thank you.

1947
01:11:05,752 --> 01:11:06,892
Okay.

1948
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:09,191
It'll be impossible for me to enter a relationship.

1949
01:11:09,192 --> 01:11:10,391
I get it now.

1950
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:12,991
- Mimi, let's work hard in 2026. - Okay.

1951
01:11:12,992 --> 01:11:14,762
- I'll work hard. - All right.

1952
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:17,031
- Mimi, you need to date someone. - I know.

1953
01:11:17,032 --> 01:11:18,961
- She won't be able to date someone. - I'm destined...

1954
01:11:18,962 --> 01:11:20,501
- to work like a racehorse. - I know.

1955
01:11:20,502 --> 01:11:22,431
Right now, Mimi is totally...

1956
01:11:22,432 --> 01:11:23,471
I guess dating isn't an option.

1957
01:11:23,472 --> 01:11:24,871
- It's a good thing. - It's a good thing.

1958
01:11:24,872 --> 01:11:26,211
- Earn money. Buy more gold. - I know.

1959
01:11:26,212 --> 01:11:27,441
I know. I'll buy more gold.

1960
01:11:27,442 --> 01:11:29,111
And Mimi, you can enter a relationship...

1961
01:11:29,112 --> 01:11:30,112
as you want.

1962
01:11:30,113 --> 01:11:31,411
But you can't work as you want.

1963
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:32,611
- You're right. - Hello.

1964
01:11:32,612 --> 01:11:34,051
Hearing that I won't be able to enter a relationship...

1965
01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:35,212
puts my mind at ease.

1966
01:11:36,152 --> 01:11:38,822
Where is the last place?

1967
01:11:39,182 --> 01:11:40,221
Seriously.

1968
01:11:40,222 --> 01:11:42,051
- Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears... - Mouth, Ears.

1969
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,092
Everything.

1970
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:47,292
I've been to this alley a few times.

1971
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:50,032
(They pass by the crowded street...)

1972
01:11:50,132 --> 01:11:51,831
(and go deep into the alley.)

1973
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:53,731
Gosh, this place is on lease too.

1974
01:11:53,732 --> 01:11:54,971
(They see empty lots everywhere.)

1975
01:11:54,972 --> 01:11:56,571
Many businesses are struggling these days.

1976
01:11:56,572 --> 01:11:58,772
(At the end of the alley)

1977
01:11:59,472 --> 01:12:00,572
The second floor?

1978
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,212
- This place? - Where?

1979
01:12:02,342 --> 01:12:04,112
- What's here? - What?

1980
01:12:04,942 --> 01:12:07,752
(It's an unassuming building.)

1981
01:12:07,852 --> 01:12:11,052
(What's Space where Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears, and Hands are Busy?)

1982
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:14,221
(Halting)

1983
01:12:14,222 --> 01:12:15,522
I smell incense.

1984
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:17,321
What's this smell?

1985
01:12:17,322 --> 01:12:18,392
Incense?

1986
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:20,561
It's an exhibition.

1987
01:12:20,562 --> 01:12:22,032
- What? - What?

1988
01:12:22,492 --> 01:12:24,861
- What's this? - It's related to the five senses.

1989
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:26,502
(It looks like a regular art exhibition.)

1990
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:30,512
(Smell of incense leads the members inside.)

1991
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:33,522
(An exhibition hall?)

1992
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,422
(It looks like a regular art exhibition.)

1993
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:39,821
Is it a restaurant or what?

1994
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,622
(Tables before artworks?)

1995
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:46,132
(When you enter through the door, )

1996
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:51,402
(stylish artworks catch the eyes.)

1997
01:12:52,072 --> 01:12:55,942
(There's a luxurious dining area.)

1998
01:12:56,202 --> 01:13:00,712
(A mysterious place of the five senses)

1999
01:13:01,182 --> 01:13:02,511
Gosh, this is...

2000
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:03,682
But this place...

2001
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:06,452
I don't have a clue.

2002
01:13:06,652 --> 01:13:08,021
Is this a popular place?

2003
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:10,151
- This place seems fake. - It seems fake, right?

2004
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,892
- Every place seems fake today. - I know.

2005
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:13,561
Sir, hello.

2006
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:14,592
(The owner appears.)

2007
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:16,122
He looks trendy.

2008
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,762
- He's smartly dressed. - Hello.

2009
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:21,731
This is the Space where Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Ears, and Hands are Busy.

2010
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:22,762
Why is that?

2011
01:13:23,272 --> 01:13:25,331
I run an immersive restaurant...

2012
01:13:25,332 --> 01:13:28,202
that stimulates the five senses.

2013
01:13:28,602 --> 01:13:29,871
(A restaurant...)

2014
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,012
(that stimulates the five senses?)

2015
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:34,841
I'm the owner of a dining gallery you remember with your five senses,

2016
01:13:34,842 --> 01:13:35,942
Kim Jae Hyung.

2017
01:13:36,582 --> 01:13:40,022
This space focuses on art exhibitions.

2018
01:13:40,822 --> 01:13:42,651
(Sight, smell, )

2019
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:45,022
(hearing, and touch)

2020
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:47,721
(Taste is the highlight.)

2021
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:51,362
I received inspiration from the Henrik Vibskov exhibition...

2022
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:53,061
that took place in 2015...

2023
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:54,902
and came this far.

2024
01:13:55,362 --> 01:13:58,231
When you listen to a certain song or smell a certain fragrance,

2025
01:13:58,232 --> 01:14:01,302
a memory comes back to you.

2026
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:05,872
I combined those experiences in one place.

2027
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:10,352
(A new type of restaurant you remember through five senses)

2028
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,752
(It became a popular place in Gangnam at once.)

2029
01:14:14,382 --> 01:14:16,222
(The reactions are explosive on social media.)

2030
01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:19,992
(Which menu will satisfy the members' 5 senses?)

2031
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,562
(Mysterious)

2032
01:14:22,622 --> 01:14:25,161
We'd like to experience it as well.

2033
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:26,331
Okay.

2034
01:14:26,332 --> 01:14:29,701
- I'll introduce the vision first. - Okay.

2035
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:31,672
The exhibition behind you...

2036
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:34,742
is a solo exhibition by Theyeolyn.

2037
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:37,871
The artworks were made with the purpose...

2038
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:41,012
of healing the psychiatric issues people experience these days.

2039
01:14:41,742 --> 01:14:45,482
(Therapeutic artworks that heal social issues through art)

2040
01:14:45,552 --> 01:14:49,051
The plaques contain information from consultations...

2041
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,692
with doctors.

2042
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:55,291
- This exhibition began in November. - Yes.

2043
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:57,661
Which artworks were exhibited three months ago?

2044
01:14:57,662 --> 01:14:59,391
Three months ago,

2045
01:14:59,392 --> 01:15:00,962
we showed chinchillas.

2046
01:15:01,232 --> 01:15:02,662
Aren't chinchillas rabbits?

2047
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,632
(A cute rodent)

2048
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:09,002
It was a series of artworks featuring chinchillas...

2049
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,012
as main characters.

2050
01:15:11,372 --> 01:15:13,512
Chinchillas as main characters?

2051
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:15,711
That sounds cute.

2052
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,112
(Suspicious)

2053
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,712
This is the touch factor.

2054
01:15:19,922 --> 01:15:22,521
Please touch it.

2055
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:23,952
(Jae Seok receives something.)

2056
01:15:24,192 --> 01:15:26,492
It's traditional Korean paper.

2057
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:27,861
(A traditional Korean paper tag...)

2058
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:29,942
(that's made with the same material as the artworks)

2059
01:15:30,032 --> 01:15:32,791
Since you can't touch the artworks,

2060
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:35,561
we prepared a sample.

2061
01:15:35,562 --> 01:15:36,732
- Like this. - Yes.

2062
01:15:36,772 --> 01:15:38,431
- Is the next sense smell? - Yes.

2063
01:15:38,432 --> 01:15:39,631
This is for the smell factor.

2064
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:41,842
(He hands over a fragrance test strip.)

2065
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,371
- I sprayed perfume on it. - It's nice.

2066
01:15:44,372 --> 01:15:45,441
- This perfume... - It smells nice.

2067
01:15:45,442 --> 01:15:46,611
It smells very nice.

2068
01:15:46,612 --> 01:15:49,342
As the artist prepared for this exhibition,

2069
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:51,812
she went to a perfume studio and made it herself.

2070
01:15:53,052 --> 01:15:55,321
When it rains in the forest,

2071
01:15:55,322 --> 01:15:57,521
- moss and grass... - That's right.

2072
01:15:57,522 --> 01:16:00,262
Seem to come alive.

2073
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:03,531
Incense gives off the warm and earthy smell.

2074
01:16:03,532 --> 01:16:04,838
(Even the incense matches the concept of the exhibition.)

2075
01:16:04,862 --> 01:16:05,862
Does it smell nice?

2076
01:16:05,863 --> 01:16:07,001
- It smells so nice. - It smells so nice. I want...

2077
01:16:07,002 --> 01:16:08,202
- to use it. - It's so nice.

2078
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:09,871
You put it there.

2079
01:16:09,872 --> 01:16:11,432
Yes, it's perfect.

2080
01:16:11,502 --> 01:16:14,171
- While we prepare food, - Okay. Thank you.

2081
01:16:14,172 --> 01:16:15,801
- you'll have a hearing experience. - Okay.

2082
01:16:15,802 --> 01:16:17,941
- Let's move to a room. - That sounds good.

2083
01:16:17,942 --> 01:16:19,111
- It smells so good. - Let's go to a room.

2084
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:20,281
It feels a bit...

2085
01:16:20,282 --> 01:16:21,511
- It feels fake. - Right?

2086
01:16:21,512 --> 01:16:23,581
- It makes no sense. - Isn't this strange?

2087
01:16:23,582 --> 01:16:24,981
And the venue...

2088
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:27,622
He gave us a fragrance test strip and told us to smell it.

2089
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:30,122
It's the room on the left.

2090
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,092
- This one? - Yes.

2091
01:16:34,762 --> 01:16:37,932
(An audiovisual room for the hearing factor)

2092
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:41,562
I'll give you a brief explanation on the room.

2093
01:16:41,932 --> 01:16:44,202
At the front is a big woofer speaker.

2094
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:48,302
There is a total of four premium audio devices.

2095
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:51,871
(You can enjoy a movie or music while dining.)

2096
01:16:51,872 --> 01:16:54,141
So it isn't an air purifier.

2097
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:55,588
(Kyung Pyo thought it was an air purifier.)

2098
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:57,551
The first song will be something that accentuates...

2099
01:16:57,552 --> 01:16:59,051
the audiovisual room.

2100
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:00,121
- Okay. - Okay.

2101
01:17:00,122 --> 01:17:01,581
Will we watch Kyung Pyo's video?

2102
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:02,621
Will we see it?

2103
01:17:02,622 --> 01:17:04,822
- "We Were in Love." - "We Were in Love." Let's see it.

2104
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:07,191
- It's nice. - Look at the number of views.

2105
01:17:07,192 --> 01:17:09,191
- It got 17 million views. - It got 17 million views.

2106
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:10,261
(He's proud of the number of views.)

2107
01:17:10,262 --> 01:17:12,491
- That song... - Please don't do that

2108
01:17:12,492 --> 01:17:13,701
(They'll hear Kyung Pyo's voice through high-end devices.)

2109
01:17:13,702 --> 01:17:14,762
How nice.

2110
01:17:15,502 --> 01:17:17,172
Let's listen to the high-end sound.

2111
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:20,071
The album he released ranked pretty high.

2112
01:17:20,072 --> 01:17:21,972
Thank you so much.

2113
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,482
Kyung Pyo is happy.

2114
01:17:32,012 --> 01:17:33,651
- He loves watching himself. - I know.

2115
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:34,981
- I know. - The number of views will go up.

2116
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:36,651
- You don't get embarrassed. - Of course not.

2117
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,722
He loves it.

2118
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:40,291
Look at my fat jawline.

2119
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:41,721
It's like a music pocket.

2120
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:43,091
It's okay. You look luxurious.

2121
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:44,932
(He sings passionately with his music pocket.)

2122
01:17:48,432 --> 01:17:53,102
(They listen to his charming voice through expensive speakers.)

2123
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:59,142
(The song reaches its climax.)

2124
01:17:59,572 --> 01:18:01,481
(He gets goosebumps.)

2125
01:18:01,482 --> 01:18:03,852
- You love it so much. - It's so nice.

2126
01:18:03,882 --> 01:18:05,411
- Watching his own video... - You know...

2127
01:18:05,412 --> 01:18:07,181
Watching his own video makes him so happy.

2128
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,152
Why are you so proud? Aren't you embarrassed?

2129
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:10,851
I'm proud.

2130
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,122
(He can't hide his pride.)

2131
01:18:12,552 --> 01:18:17,862
(The sound is more melodious thanks to the expensive speakers.)

2132
01:18:18,592 --> 01:18:21,031
(Ko Kyung Pyo is the eardrums' boyfriend.)

2133
01:18:21,032 --> 01:18:22,232
He's good.

2134
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:23,971
I see why people have a listening room.

2135
01:18:23,972 --> 01:18:25,272
It's so nice.

2136
01:18:25,602 --> 01:18:27,441
The sound is nice.

2137
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:29,541
It'll be incredible to watch a movie here.

2138
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,612
I want to do that.

2139
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,811
I wonder how many times Kyung Pyo has watched the video.

2140
01:18:32,812 --> 01:18:34,241
You watched it about 200 times, right?

2141
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,112
I think I've watched it about 10,000 times.

2142
01:18:36,952 --> 01:18:39,381
(The number of views reflects his self-love.)

2143
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:41,251
Kyung Pyo always sings...

2144
01:18:41,252 --> 01:18:43,152
on the set.

2145
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:44,621
He always does that when he's alone.

2146
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:45,792
I can't sit still.

2147
01:18:46,992 --> 01:18:48,821
Since we prepared it, you should watch Shin Hye's video.

2148
01:18:48,822 --> 01:18:50,031
- No. - Shin Hye's video.

2149
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:51,062
- Yes. - Please.

2150
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:53,662
(It got over 4.54 million views!)

2151
01:18:54,102 --> 01:18:57,972
(The legendary video was a rediscovery of Park Shin Hye.)

2152
01:18:58,172 --> 01:18:59,371
Let's watch the performance.

2153
01:18:59,372 --> 01:19:01,272
- Oh, yes. - Shin Hye is a good dancer.

2154
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:06,372
(Shin Hye shines on the stage.)

2155
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,881
Shin Hye is a good dancer.

2156
01:19:08,882 --> 01:19:10,451
- Is she a good dancer? - She's a good dancer.

2157
01:19:10,452 --> 01:19:11,681
(Embarrassed)

2158
01:19:11,682 --> 01:19:13,012
She has many talents.

2159
01:19:13,852 --> 01:19:15,251
She's really good.

2160
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:16,421
(She can act and dance.)

2161
01:19:16,422 --> 01:19:17,991
I didn't know she was such a good dancer.

2162
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:20,592
(She has unexpected charms.)

2163
01:19:21,092 --> 01:19:23,831
(With those dance skills, it's hard to believe that she's an actor.)

2164
01:19:23,832 --> 01:19:25,091
She's a professional.

2165
01:19:25,092 --> 01:19:26,332
She's a dancer.

2166
01:19:26,702 --> 01:19:28,901
(Shin Hye has gained 2 more fans.)

2167
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,132
Jennie, Jennie

2168
01:19:30,372 --> 01:19:32,932
(Even the ending pose is perfect.)

2169
01:19:33,072 --> 01:19:34,901
(She nailed the performance.)

2170
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:36,272
That was incredible.

2171
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:37,841
Shin Hye began at an agency...

2172
01:19:37,842 --> 01:19:39,971
- in the music industry. - That's right.

2173
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:42,711
- Yes. I was with DREAM FACTORY. - She was with DREAM FACTORY.

2174
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:44,211
We forgot about that.

2175
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,651
- She danced... - She's really good.

2176
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:47,282
- like a professional. - I know.

2177
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,821
- Your fans must be happy. - Shin Hye is good.

2178
01:19:49,822 --> 01:19:51,351
My fans beg me to dance...

2179
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:54,991
whenever I have a fanmeet.

2180
01:19:54,992 --> 01:19:56,321
It's understandable since she's good.

2181
01:19:56,322 --> 01:19:57,631
- That's right. - She's very good.

2182
01:19:57,632 --> 01:19:59,231
The fanmeet reminds me of something.

2183
01:19:59,232 --> 01:20:02,701
Gratefully, I go to a fanmeet through "Running Man."

2184
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:03,801
I feel embarrassed.

2185
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:05,371
- More than embarrassed. - Right.

2186
01:20:05,372 --> 01:20:06,942
(How was he during the fanmeet?)

2187
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,042
(Seok Jin)

2188
01:20:08,043 --> 01:20:12,312
(Big Nose does his best even though he's a little sloppy.)

2189
01:20:13,012 --> 01:20:15,441
I feel so embarrassed after seeing that.

2190
01:20:15,442 --> 01:20:17,242
Right. You should feel more than embarrassed.

2191
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:20,751
What's important is if this place is real or not.

2192
01:20:20,752 --> 01:20:22,052
I think it's real.

2193
01:20:22,152 --> 01:20:23,722
Can this be set up to look real?

2194
01:20:23,992 --> 01:20:25,021
- Really? - I think it's fake.

2195
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:26,302
- It's fake? - I think the same.

2196
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:29,961
- It's fake? - I think it's a private studio...

2197
01:20:29,962 --> 01:20:31,062
- Right. - of an artist.

2198
01:20:31,392 --> 01:20:34,261
This feels like a place of rest with music and movies.

2199
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,162
- It's a personal space. - Right.

2200
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,001
- Shall we head out? - Yes.

2201
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:39,772
(It's time to feel the final sense, taste!)

2202
01:20:40,272 --> 01:20:41,442
He's here.

2203
01:20:42,002 --> 01:20:44,942
(The owner brings out "taste.")

2204
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:47,241
(Startled)

2205
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,082
(Eyes opening wide)

2206
01:20:50,352 --> 01:20:51,382
Gosh, it's...

2207
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:54,052
(Sight)

2208
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:57,221
(Hearing)

2209
01:20:57,222 --> 01:20:58,821
(Smell)

2210
01:20:58,822 --> 01:21:00,861
(Touch)

2211
01:21:00,862 --> 01:21:02,622
(And taste)

2212
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:06,432
(Shrimp Toowoomba pasta)

2213
01:21:06,692 --> 01:21:08,462
There are too many kinds of Toowoomba pasta.

2214
01:21:08,862 --> 01:21:11,272
I wanted to add a unique element.

2215
01:21:12,032 --> 01:21:14,401
(To the regular Toowoomba sauce...)

2216
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,371
I mixed it up with an ingredient called beet.

2217
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,271
I developed a dish with a unique color.

2218
01:21:19,272 --> 01:21:22,712
(Hot pink beet pasta with unique visuals)

2219
01:21:23,952 --> 01:21:25,081
(It's really unique.)

2220
01:21:25,082 --> 01:21:26,282
(I love it!)

2221
01:21:26,612 --> 01:21:29,522
Sixth Sense, is this place real?

2222
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,322
- Did you just make it? - Yes.

2223
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:35,662
It's called the shrimp beet Toowoomba pasta.

2224
01:21:36,522 --> 01:21:37,762
Beet!

2225
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:40,961
I didn't professionally learn how to cook...

2226
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,901
and I didn't major in culinary arts.

2227
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:46,102
I studied a lot through YouTube and ChatGPT.

2228
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:47,642
What?

2229
01:21:48,072 --> 01:21:49,972
ChatGPT and YouTube?

2230
01:21:50,142 --> 01:21:54,082
I learn through them and develop and improve my dishes.

2231
01:21:54,642 --> 01:21:57,982
(Is the pink pasta learned from AI real?)

2232
01:21:58,482 --> 01:21:59,812
- But... - Look at the color.

2233
01:22:00,322 --> 01:22:02,081
First of all, it looks different...

2234
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:03,421
from the pasta we all know.

2235
01:22:03,422 --> 01:22:05,752
- It looks different. - It's different.

2236
01:22:05,992 --> 01:22:07,591
(As for its smell...)

2237
01:22:07,592 --> 01:22:08,721
It smells so good.

2238
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:10,292
- It smells good. - It smells good.

2239
01:22:10,832 --> 01:22:11,892
Thank you.

2240
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:14,362
Shall I try a little bit of it?

2241
01:22:15,262 --> 01:22:16,871
(Pink pasta)

2242
01:22:16,872 --> 01:22:18,101
How does it taste?

2243
01:22:18,102 --> 01:22:19,302
(Slurping)

2244
01:22:19,472 --> 01:22:21,202
How does it taste? It smells really good.

2245
01:22:22,702 --> 01:22:27,112
(How does the pink Towoomba pasta taste?)

2246
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,012
It smells really good.

2247
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:30,551
- It's good. - Gosh.

2248
01:22:30,552 --> 01:22:31,552
- I haven't tried it. - It's good.
- It's good? - Yes.

2249
01:22:32,553 --> 01:22:34,022
(I should try a bite as well.)

2250
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:36,452
- It's spicy. - It's good.

2251
01:22:36,782 --> 01:22:39,252
(As it has some peperoncino on top, )

2252
01:22:39,892 --> 01:22:43,562
(the pasta is spicy and creamy.)

2253
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:47,001
I love it.

2254
01:22:47,002 --> 01:22:48,802
(Slurping)

2255
01:22:48,902 --> 01:22:50,162
(Satisfied)

2256
01:22:50,402 --> 01:22:52,531
- It's delicious. - It's good. It's really good.

2257
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:53,602
It's really good.

2258
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,601
It's a dish that goes well with wine.

2259
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:57,722
- Right. - It's really good.

2260
01:22:58,512 --> 01:23:01,011
It's a sensuous dish.

2261
01:23:01,012 --> 01:23:02,542
There's a color added to the dish.

2262
01:23:03,082 --> 01:23:04,882
It goes well with the concept.

2263
01:23:05,812 --> 01:23:07,481
- I think the concept is fake. - Right.

2264
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,781
(Agreeing)

2265
01:23:08,782 --> 01:23:09,951
It doesn't make sense.

2266
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,151
This is what I'm curious about.

2267
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,421
If it's a chinchilla,

2268
01:23:12,422 --> 01:23:13,992
how will the five senses be satisfied?

2269
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:15,992
(That was sharp.)

2270
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:18,312
Could it be the smell of the food a chinchilla likes?

2271
01:23:18,392 --> 01:23:20,461
It possibly can't be the smell of chinchilla...

2272
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,102
- while having a meal. - Right.

2273
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:24,001
How will smell be expressed...

2274
01:23:24,002 --> 01:23:25,602
- for that theme? - Or it could be that.

2275
01:23:25,872 --> 01:23:27,141
(This place is fake!)

2276
01:23:27,142 --> 01:23:29,541
(It will be hard to find a smell for each theme!)

2277
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:31,411
- Isn't it too hard until the end? - We should get it right...

2278
01:23:31,412 --> 01:23:33,142
- before we end. - Right.

2279
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:34,212
If we get it wrong again,

2280
01:23:34,213 --> 01:23:36,381
we will have a 20-percent win rate out of 10 attempts.

2281
01:23:36,382 --> 01:23:37,511

2282
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,872
- Does this even make sense? - That would be awful from us.

2283
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:42,222
There was just one member change.

2284
01:23:42,282 --> 01:23:43,482
What does that make me?

2285
01:23:44,622 --> 01:23:46,862
It was a 50 percent win rate during the previous season.

2286
01:23:46,992 --> 01:23:49,692
- That would be a 30-percent loss. - Exactly.

Please help me.

2288
01:23:51,992 --> 01:23:54,562

We're in trouble.

This is tough.

2301
01:24:14,953 --> 01:24:17,273

2303
01:24:19,992 --> 01:24:22,098
- That didn't sound right. - That didn't convince me.

2304
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:23,591
- That doesn't make sense. - Right.

2305
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,331
It was 1 and 19 from 119.

2306
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:26,661
It was 6 because there were 6 firefighters.

2307
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:28,832
And it was something with 33.

2315
01:24:41,642 --> 01:24:43,042
- as it's so coincidental. - Right.

I think it's number three.

2327
01:25:11,412 --> 01:25:14,881
It's because I just can't understand this place.

2328
01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:16,111
A restaurant should be a restaurant.

2329
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,382
Right. I agree.

2345
01:25:43,942 --> 01:25:45,342
It could be number one.

It actually could be number one.

2347
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,812
Right. It could be number one.

2348
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:51,312
Right. We mentioned the bakery.

- Rock-paper-scissors. - I think that will be better.

2365
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:24,681
We won't be able to decide with a vote.

Number two feels like the most reasonable choice.

Choosing number two will leave us with no regrets.

2385
01:27:01,952 --> 01:27:04,792
- Right. - Number two makes no sense.

2386

01:29:23,043 --> 01:29:24,511
All of the friends were in this?

2454
01:29:24,512 --> 01:29:25,552
Jang Hee Ryung!

2455
01:29:26,752 --> 01:29:28,181
- They went that far for this? - What?

2456
01:29:28,182 --> 01:29:29,482
How did they do that?

2457
01:29:30,522 --> 01:29:33,492
(Second half of 2025)

2458
01:29:33,752 --> 01:29:36,862
(The Sixth Sense members traveled around the country...)

2459
01:29:37,862 --> 01:29:40,962
(and went through laughter and tears.)

2460
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:42,161
- That's fake? - That's fake?

2461
01:29:42,162 --> 01:29:44,701
(You were fooled...)

2462
01:29:44,702 --> 01:29:49,441
(by many different fake places...)

2463
01:29:49,442 --> 01:29:53,242
(and sincere hearts.)

2464
01:29:57,482 --> 01:30:00,381
That brand must be real with just a fake story.

2465
01:30:00,382 --> 01:30:01,821
- Right. - The story must be fake.

2466
01:30:01,822 --> 01:30:02,852
I guess so.

2467
01:30:02,952 --> 01:30:04,221
Is the lottery story fake?

2468
01:30:04,222 --> 01:30:05,391
August?

2469
01:30:05,392 --> 01:30:06,392
(A day in August)

2470
01:30:06,522 --> 01:30:08,538
(The production crew was looking for a new item to work on.)

2471
01:30:08,562 --> 01:30:11,192
(One video was found at that moment.)

2472
01:30:11,692 --> 01:30:15,461
(A photo gets taken of the bereaved family...)

2473
01:30:15,462 --> 01:30:19,232
(of the fallen firefighters.)

2474
01:30:21,502 --> 01:30:26,412
(How did you know about my husband?)

2475
01:30:26,912 --> 01:30:29,241
(A photo studio that edits in fallen family members)

2476
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:30,782
They make those photos for them.

2477
01:30:32,412 --> 01:30:33,552
Gosh.

2478
01:30:35,822 --> 01:30:37,592
No. These things make me cry.

2479
01:30:41,492 --> 01:30:42,861
(It's...)

2480
01:30:42,862 --> 01:30:45,632
(my precious son.)

2481
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:52,071
- Gosh! - Gosh.

2482
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:54,471
(Hearts of gratitude and respect flowed over the video...)

2483
01:30:54,472 --> 01:30:56,902
(with 15 million views.)

2484
01:30:57,072 --> 01:30:59,672
(That is why the production crew...)

2485
01:30:59,972 --> 01:31:04,352
(wanted to send those hearts of gratitude.)

2486
01:31:04,652 --> 01:31:07,552
(We decided to hear from an actual firefighter.)

2487
01:31:07,952 --> 01:31:09,451
Hello. My name is Do Yul.

2488
01:31:09,452 --> 01:31:11,052
I've been a firefighter for eight years.

2489
01:31:11,522 --> 01:31:14,092
(What does a firefighter need the most?)

2490
01:31:15,422 --> 01:31:19,762
After just a few months from my appointment,

2491
01:31:19,832 --> 01:31:22,032
three firefighters from a different station nearby...

2492
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:24,502
died in the line of duty.

2493
01:31:26,102 --> 01:31:29,241
(Three firefighters were lost by a car accident...)

2494
01:31:29,242 --> 01:31:32,371
(during an animal rescue.)

2495
01:31:32,372 --> 01:31:35,311
They were firefighters who haven't been appointed yet...

2496
01:31:35,312 --> 01:31:37,752
and they were going through their on-the-job training.

2497
01:31:38,212 --> 01:31:39,982
They died in the line of duty,

2498
01:31:40,152 --> 01:31:41,622
and it broke my heart.

2499
01:31:42,352 --> 01:31:43,981
It didn't feel like someone else's story.

2500
01:31:43,982 --> 01:31:45,722
It's something that can happen to me.

2501
01:31:49,762 --> 01:31:54,731
(Firefighters face danger for the safety of the citizens.)

2502
01:31:54,732 --> 01:31:58,132
I believe luck is most needed for firefighters.

2503
01:31:58,672 --> 01:32:01,371
I believe luck must follow to be able to save the citizens...

2504
01:32:01,372 --> 01:32:04,272
and keep them safe from danger.

2505
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:06,271
I wish for all firefighters to be full of luck.

2506
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,958
(I wish for all firefighters to be full of luck.)

2507
01:32:07,982 --> 01:32:11,812
(That was why we wanted to give the firefighters good luck.)

2508
01:32:12,182 --> 01:32:14,752
(That was how the first important mission began.)

2509
01:32:15,422 --> 01:32:17,121
(Missions of this season!)

2510
01:32:17,122 --> 01:32:18,922
(The good luck project for the firefighters!)

2511
01:32:19,152 --> 01:32:22,191
We prepared a donation project for the firefighters.

2512
01:32:22,192 --> 01:32:23,561
That's great.

2513
01:32:23,562 --> 01:32:24,562
(The money will be donated to a firefighter funding group!)

2514
01:32:24,563 --> 01:32:27,003
What a heartwarming sight right at the start of the new year!

2515
01:32:27,232 --> 01:32:30,032
(D-121 before the shoot of Episode 10)

2516
01:32:30,132 --> 01:32:33,402
What can we do provide the firefighters with luck?

2517
01:32:34,072 --> 01:32:35,872
Do you know the brand of this bag?

2518
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:42,382
(A brand that makes fashion items out of used fire coats)

2519
01:32:42,412 --> 01:32:44,511
How does making a fake fashion brand...

2520
01:32:44,512 --> 01:32:46,681
that upcycles used fire coats sound?

2521
01:32:46,682 --> 01:32:47,721
(A fake fashion brand?)

2522
01:32:47,722 --> 01:32:49,052
They came up with that?

2523
01:32:49,582 --> 01:32:51,551
- They made a brand? - They made a brand?

2524
01:32:51,552 --> 01:32:52,691
A brand?

2525
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,592
- Gosh, that's crazy. - They made that?

2526
01:32:55,992 --> 01:32:57,561
Hold on. I'm feeling hot.

2527
01:32:57,562 --> 01:32:59,032
(This is making me feel hot.)

2528
01:32:59,092 --> 01:33:01,201
Did we buy things from the brand made by the production crew?

2529
01:33:01,202 --> 01:33:02,401
(How were these clothes made?)

2530
01:33:02,402 --> 01:33:04,131
(That was how...)

2531
01:33:04,132 --> 01:33:05,701
(the longest project ever began!)

2532
01:33:05,702 --> 01:33:06,732
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2533
01:33:07,602 --> 01:33:09,542
No way. A brand was made?

2534
01:33:10,072 --> 01:33:11,072
(The first meeting with the fire coat upcycling brand)

2535
01:33:11,073 --> 01:33:12,542
- Hello. - Hello.

2536
01:33:13,112 --> 01:33:14,281
(But...)

2537
01:33:14,282 --> 01:33:16,712
This guy. Wasn't he the CEO we met earlier?

2538
01:33:17,182 --> 01:33:18,411
He was the CEO we met.

2539
01:33:18,412 --> 01:33:19,781
(The true identity of the lottery winner CEO)

2540
01:33:19,782 --> 01:33:22,681
Hello. I'm currently running a brand that upcycles used fire coats.

2541
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:25,022
- He actually runs a brand. - My name is Lee Seung Woo.

2542
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:27,091
A total of 50 percent of our profit...

2543
01:33:27,092 --> 01:33:31,532
is donated to firefighters who suffer from cancer or PTSD.

2544
01:33:32,262 --> 01:33:33,761
I see.

2545
01:33:33,762 --> 01:33:34,831
(He joins the fake brand launch with a light heart.)

2546
01:33:34,832 --> 01:33:36,462
He's working for a great cause.

2547
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:39,202
(However...)

2548
01:33:39,372 --> 01:33:43,001
We make things like bags and wallets.

2549
01:33:43,002 --> 01:33:44,002
(The main products are things like bags and keyrings.)

2550
01:33:44,003 --> 01:33:45,471
I've seen them before.

2551
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:47,472
Other than things like keyrings,

2552
01:33:47,882 --> 01:33:50,482
is it possible to make apparel?

2553
01:33:51,012 --> 01:33:53,252
It's hard for us to produce apparel.

2554
01:33:54,152 --> 01:33:56,321
- The apparel was made for this? - It's a difficult process.

2555
01:33:56,322 --> 01:33:58,091
(They don't have the experience for producing apparel.)

2556
01:33:58,092 --> 01:34:00,772
- Apparel is a different field. - It isn't easy to produce apparel.

2557
01:34:01,292 --> 01:34:03,261
(He has come!)

2558
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:04,362
Someone must have come.

2559
01:34:06,192 --> 01:34:08,661
Hello. I'm Ko Tae Yong, a fashion designer.

2560
01:34:08,662 --> 01:34:11,031
- It's Ko Tae Yong. - It's Ko Tae Yong.

2561
01:34:11,032 --> 01:34:12,352
I'm currently running that brand.

2562
01:34:12,732 --> 01:34:14,771
No wonder the characters were used so well.

2563
01:34:14,772 --> 01:34:15,918
(It became a great hit with the signature dog logo.)

2564
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:19,311
Lee Jong Suk, Byeon Woo Seok, Jang Ki Yong,

2565
01:34:19,312 --> 01:34:21,981
and Nam Joo Hyuk, There's Woo Jae as well.

2566
01:34:21,982 --> 01:34:24,011
- They have nice clothes here. - Right.

2567
01:34:24,012 --> 01:34:25,282
They look nice.

2568
01:34:25,512 --> 01:34:26,581
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2 and Designer Ko Tae Yong)

2569
01:34:26,582 --> 01:34:28,322
Ko Tae Yong has come to help.

2570
01:34:29,252 --> 01:34:32,552
When I was first given the offer, I loved the intention of it.

2571
01:34:33,052 --> 01:34:35,991
I wanted to do anything to help out.

2572
01:34:35,992 --> 01:34:37,021
I see.

2573
01:34:37,022 --> 01:34:39,632
(D-92 before the shoot of Episode 10)

2574
01:34:40,262 --> 01:34:43,101
- Do these keep getting provided? - Yes.

2575
01:34:43,102 --> 01:34:44,671
So all of these are torn up?

2576
01:34:44,672 --> 01:34:47,031
Yes. They are torn up first.

2577
01:34:47,032 --> 01:34:50,171
- The patterns are like this. - Right. They're all like this.

2578
01:34:50,172 --> 01:34:52,041
- I'll take this with me. - Sure.

2579
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:54,012
- I want to ask the factory. - Right.

2580
01:34:54,112 --> 01:34:56,181
- We'll give it a try. - Right.

2581
01:34:56,182 --> 01:34:58,358
If it doesn't work out, we should be quick to switch off.

2582
01:34:58,382 --> 01:35:00,181
(The atmosphere brightens up with a reliable supporter.)

2583
01:35:00,182 --> 01:35:01,222
He isn't hesitant at all.

2584
01:35:01,382 --> 01:35:04,591
The most important thing when making a brand is the logo.

2585
01:35:04,592 --> 01:35:06,392
- That was so cute. - Gosh.

2586
01:35:07,152 --> 01:35:09,672
(Designer Ko Tae Yong meticulously checks the color and patch.)

2587
01:35:10,092 --> 01:35:13,332
(The designing process is over.)

2588
01:35:14,132 --> 01:35:16,032
The clothes were put into production?

2589
01:35:17,262 --> 01:35:18,771
(Used fire coats)

2590
01:35:18,772 --> 01:35:20,631
- Are you serious? - Awesome!

2591
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:21,872
A total of 360 used fire coats!

2592
01:35:22,172 --> 01:35:23,941
(Total number of production)

2593
01:35:23,942 --> 01:35:25,341
- Gosh, there are over 1,000. - Gosh!

2594
01:35:25,342 --> 01:35:26,972
A total of 1,300 of them were made?

2595
01:35:27,782 --> 01:35:28,841
(Upcycling used fire coats?)

2596
01:35:28,842 --> 01:35:30,111
(Start by producing the material!)

2597
01:35:30,112 --> 01:35:31,112
(The used fire coats...)

2598
01:35:31,113 --> 01:35:32,851
(are washed, dried...)

2599
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,922
- They're put out to dry. - That's amazing.

2600
01:35:34,952 --> 01:35:36,881
(torn up, )

2601
01:35:36,882 --> 01:35:37,891
(and ironed.)

2602
01:35:37,892 --> 01:35:39,222
That's a great amount of work.

2603
01:35:39,592 --> 01:35:42,562
(The material production from used fire coats is done.)

2604
01:35:43,662 --> 01:35:44,761
The logo was added to that.

2605
01:35:44,762 --> 01:35:47,092
- The patches. - The logo was made as well.

2606
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:50,201
(When added nicely to the material prepared...)

2607
01:35:50,202 --> 01:35:51,572
That's amazing.

2608
01:35:51,902 --> 01:35:54,102
- That's the hoodie we bought. - Right!

2609
01:35:54,272 --> 01:35:55,471
That was the one you bought.

2610
01:35:55,472 --> 01:35:56,672
- Right. - Right.

2611
01:35:56,902 --> 01:35:59,871
Who else would make a brand for a show?

2612
01:35:59,872 --> 01:36:00,941
- Exactly. - Exactly.

2613
01:36:00,942 --> 01:36:03,182
(How do all of these clothes get sold?)

2614
01:36:03,782 --> 01:36:04,951
(If our target...)

2615
01:36:04,952 --> 01:36:06,182
(is Gen MZers...)

2616
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:07,682
Popup!

2617
01:36:11,022 --> 01:36:12,951
(The center of fashion popup stores)

2618
01:36:12,952 --> 01:36:15,362
(Gangnam's Dosan Park)

2619
01:36:15,462 --> 01:36:17,762
(They went through Dosan Park in the scorching heat.)

2620
01:36:18,262 --> 01:36:19,431
A place was rented?

2621
01:36:19,432 --> 01:36:20,752
(A long search for a popup store)

2622
01:36:20,932 --> 01:36:22,161
(They found a decent place!)

2623
01:36:22,162 --> 01:36:23,332
It was an empty place?

2624
01:36:23,732 --> 01:36:27,032
(They decide to rent the place for 3 months!)

2625
01:36:28,102 --> 01:36:29,641
They rented the place for three months.

2626
01:36:29,642 --> 01:36:30,748
(The construction for the popup store begins!)

2627
01:36:30,772 --> 01:36:32,671
- That's amazing. - But it seemed like...

2628
01:36:32,672 --> 01:36:34,481
it was used for a while.

2629
01:36:34,482 --> 01:36:36,111
It was because they actually ran the place for three months.

2630
01:36:36,112 --> 01:36:37,212
(The empty place...)

2631
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,811
- My gosh. - They went this far for this?

2632
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:41,612
(was worked on starting with even the walls.)

2633
01:36:41,982 --> 01:36:43,951
How are we supposed to get it right after all of that?

2634
01:36:43,952 --> 01:36:44,952
(Gaming devices and experience devices were placed.)

2635
01:36:44,953 --> 01:36:46,522
That's amazing.

2636
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:48,421
(A car makes a grand appearance.)

2637
01:36:48,422 --> 01:36:49,662
Right.

2638
01:36:50,762 --> 01:36:52,191
- Hello! - Hello!

2639
01:36:52,192 --> 01:36:53,362
- Hold on. - Hold on.

2640
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:57,331
Hello. I'm the owner of Secret Garden in Episode Seven.

2641
01:36:57,332 --> 01:36:59,932
- No wonder! - No wonder!

2642
01:37:00,202 --> 01:37:02,541
- They even did that? - They even did that?

2643
01:37:02,542 --> 01:37:03,702
They're so meticulous.

2644
01:37:04,002 --> 01:37:05,011
I thought it was an existing store.

2645
01:37:05,012 --> 01:37:06,041
Same here.

2646
01:37:06,042 --> 01:37:07,781
I didn't imagine this place would've been built.

2647
01:37:07,782 --> 01:37:08,782
(The construction went on until the opening.)

2648
01:37:08,783 --> 01:37:10,012
That's amazing.

2649
01:37:11,282 --> 01:37:13,011
- The four-leaf clover. - I thought the clothes were real.

2650
01:37:13,012 --> 01:37:15,058
(Good luck is filled with the clover to finish things off.)

2651
01:37:15,082 --> 01:37:17,251
(The place is filled...)

2652
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:18,922
(with clothes and goods.)

2653
01:37:19,052 --> 01:37:21,021
(There's even a photowall that gives off popup store vibes.)

2654
01:37:21,022 --> 01:37:22,261
- Like a real popup store. - Awesome.

2655
01:37:22,262 --> 01:37:23,521
I got cold during the hike,

2656
01:37:23,522 --> 01:37:25,238
so I even got that from my friend and wore it.

2657
01:37:25,262 --> 01:37:26,331
- Really? - Yes.

2658
01:37:26,332 --> 01:37:27,361
From your friend?

2659
01:37:27,362 --> 01:37:28,431
(Hold on, Sixth Sense members.)

2660
01:37:28,432 --> 01:37:30,062
"Hold on, Sixth Sense members." Yes?

2661
01:37:31,572 --> 01:37:33,532
No way!

2662
01:37:34,572 --> 01:37:37,602
- What have you done this time? - Hold on!

2663
01:37:38,342 --> 01:37:40,742
(Who are these people who have gathered together?)

2664
01:37:41,072 --> 01:37:42,741
Our managers are there!

2665
01:37:42,742 --> 01:37:43,981
Where?

2666
01:37:43,982 --> 01:37:45,012
(Our managers are there?)

2667
01:37:45,552 --> 01:37:46,811
- Gosh! - That's your manager!

2668
01:37:46,812 --> 01:37:48,482
That's my manager.

2669
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:50,721
Hello. I'm Ko Kyung Pyo's manager.

2670
01:37:50,722 --> 01:37:52,962
- I'm Yoo Ji Woong. - How did they know about our plans?

2671
01:37:53,552 --> 01:37:54,991
- Hello. - That's my manager!

2672
01:37:54,992 --> 01:37:56,221
- That's Seok Sam's manager! - I'm Ji Seok Jin's manager,

2673
01:37:56,222 --> 01:37:57,422
Lee Mi Jung.

2674
01:37:57,962 --> 01:38:00,061
- Hello. I'm Jae Seok's stylist, - Lee Ju Eun?

2675
01:38:00,062 --> 01:38:01,762
- Lee Ju Eun. - Ju Eun was there too?

2676
01:38:02,402 --> 01:38:04,201
Why is Ju Eun there?

2677
01:38:04,202 --> 01:38:05,401
(All managers were summoned for the first time.)

2678
01:38:05,402 --> 01:38:08,841
This is our request when the apparel gets launched.

2679
01:38:08,842 --> 01:38:11,272
Hold on. I think Ju Eun wore that!

2680
01:38:11,612 --> 01:38:14,782
- Right. He wore that. - I didn't notice at all.

2681
01:38:15,682 --> 01:38:17,441
Really? They were wearing that?

2682
01:38:17,442 --> 01:38:19,112
So... Right!

2683
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:20,652
That's my manager.

2684
01:38:20,712 --> 01:38:21,722
Really?

2685
01:38:22,282 --> 01:38:23,851
(The shoot for Episode 8 in Gangneung)

2686
01:38:23,852 --> 01:38:25,021
My gosh.

2687
01:38:25,022 --> 01:38:27,352
I remember seeing that!

2688
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:30,761
Right. Just like that!

2689
01:38:30,762 --> 01:38:33,362
- There it is! - I saw that!

2690
01:38:34,192 --> 01:38:36,631
- Right! I saw that! - It was even in your car.

2691
01:38:36,632 --> 01:38:38,201
- I saw that! - You did?

2692
01:38:38,202 --> 01:38:40,032
(And just for Kyung Pyo...)

2693
01:38:40,372 --> 01:38:43,541
- Kyung Pyo's friends. - Right.

2694
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:45,641
There are 3 to 4 of them...

2695
01:38:45,642 --> 01:38:47,362
- That's great. - and they meet very often.

2696
01:38:47,412 --> 01:38:50,511
- They can wear it together. - I thought it was a popular brand!

2697
01:38:50,512 --> 01:38:51,958
(Kyung Pyo's friends will be in this as well!)

2698
01:38:51,982 --> 01:38:53,011
(Kyung Pyo's friends)

2699
01:38:53,012 --> 01:38:55,351
- Here. - Right. It's this brand!

2700
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:57,321
(It's O.O.N!)

2701
01:38:57,322 --> 01:38:58,451
Right!

2702
01:38:58,452 --> 01:38:59,752
(Kyung Pyo really wore it.)

2703
01:38:59,952 --> 01:39:00,992
Hey!

2704
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:03,521
(Was this filmed?)

2705
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:05,032
This is incredible.

2706
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:07,361
- You wore it. - I know.

2707
01:39:07,362 --> 01:39:08,631
- When did you wear it? - Unbelievable.

2708
01:39:08,632 --> 01:39:10,301
What were they doing?

2709
01:39:10,302 --> 01:39:11,432
Those crazy punks.

2710
01:39:12,472 --> 01:39:14,572
(They're real friends.)

2711
01:39:14,742 --> 01:39:16,942
(He can't get over it.)

2712
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,171
- What? - What is it?

2713
01:39:19,172 --> 01:39:21,811
(What are Jang Hee Ryung's photos doing here?)

2714
01:39:21,812 --> 01:39:23,012
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

2715
01:39:23,212 --> 01:39:24,981
- Even she's involved? - Hello,

2716
01:39:24,982 --> 01:39:26,452
I'm Actress Jang Hee Ryung.

2717
01:39:27,152 --> 01:39:28,251
(A fashionista among the celebrities)

2718
01:39:28,252 --> 01:39:29,881
She dresses well.

2719
01:39:29,882 --> 01:39:32,392
(Actress Jang Hee Ryung)

2720
01:39:32,492 --> 01:39:34,022
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

2721
01:39:34,152 --> 01:39:35,262
You...

2722
01:39:35,462 --> 01:39:38,032
- She and I ate together yesterday. - You did?

2723
01:39:38,132 --> 01:39:40,492
- This is unbelievable. - It's incredible.

2724
01:39:40,632 --> 01:39:43,331
It sounds like a good deed,

2725
01:39:43,332 --> 01:39:45,602
so I'd like to participate.

2726
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,972
On social media... My goodness.

2727
01:39:49,702 --> 01:39:51,972
- Hee Ryung... - On social media...

2728
01:39:52,242 --> 01:39:54,311
Kyung Pyo, surprise!

2729
01:39:54,312 --> 01:39:55,442
(Surprise!)

2730
01:39:55,482 --> 01:39:56,811
I can't believe it.

2731
01:39:56,812 --> 01:39:58,512
I'm very surprised, you punk.

2732
01:39:59,182 --> 01:40:00,951
I'm a fashion content creator.

2733
01:40:00,952 --> 01:40:02,281
- I'm Kkang Stylist. - I know him.

2734
01:40:02,282 --> 01:40:04,552
I'm a content creator named Dindi.

2735
01:40:04,922 --> 01:40:05,991
Exactly.

2736
01:40:05,992 --> 01:40:07,021
Seriously.

2737
01:40:07,022 --> 01:40:08,122
This is really...

2738
01:40:08,892 --> 01:40:11,292
They were very determined this time.

2739
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:14,831
I bet they sold all 1,000 of them.

2740
01:40:14,832 --> 01:40:15,961
(That's how O.O.N's pop-up store started.)

2741
01:40:15,962 --> 01:40:17,032
It's unbelievable.

2742
01:40:17,972 --> 01:40:19,002
But this...

2743
01:40:19,502 --> 01:40:20,631
- It's really incredible. - Without the lottery,

2744
01:40:20,632 --> 01:40:22,842
- we would've been totally fooled. - Right.

2745
01:40:23,402 --> 01:40:24,441
This is impossible to guess.

2746
01:40:24,442 --> 01:40:26,571
This is as good as real.

2747
01:40:26,572 --> 01:40:27,612
Exactly.

2748
01:40:28,442 --> 01:40:30,912
I don't usually buy lottery tickets.

2749
01:40:31,352 --> 01:40:34,111
I felt very happy during the shoot...

2750
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:36,222
as if I had won the lottery.

2751
01:40:36,452 --> 01:40:39,391
I hope this will bring luck to the firefighters...

2752
01:40:39,392 --> 01:40:41,921
- and the viewers. - The owner did...

2753
01:40:41,922 --> 01:40:43,621
- such a great deed. - Yes.

2754
01:40:43,622 --> 01:40:45,192
Thank you, firefighters.

2755
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:47,062
Thank you, firefighters.

2756
01:40:48,602 --> 01:40:50,762
- Thank you, firefighters. - Thank you, firefighters.

2757
01:40:50,862 --> 01:40:51,971
Keep up the good work.

2758
01:40:51,972 --> 01:40:53,132
(Thank you, firefighters.)

2759
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:56,771
- Firefighters, thank you so much. - Thank you.

2760
01:40:56,772 --> 01:40:58,688
(Wishing a lucky and safe year for the firefighters)

2761
01:40:58,712 --> 01:41:02,341
(We also wish our viewers a lucky year.)

2762
01:41:02,342 --> 01:41:05,051
The firefighters who protect our lives...

2763
01:41:05,052 --> 01:41:08,181
- and keep us safe. - It was a meaningful deed.

2764
01:41:08,182 --> 01:41:10,321
We'd like to thank the firefighters again.

2765
01:41:10,322 --> 01:41:11,491
Thank you.

2766
01:41:11,492 --> 01:41:12,622
(Thank you, firefighters.)

2767
01:41:12,652 --> 01:41:14,151
- Our guess was correct. - It was.

2768
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:15,761
It's a relief.

2769
01:41:15,762 --> 01:41:17,391
(Their correct answer is a good way to end the season.)

2770
01:41:17,392 --> 01:41:18,862
All right, for the coffee truck,

2771
01:41:19,092 --> 01:41:20,261
go ahead and pick, Seok Sam.

2772
01:41:20,262 --> 01:41:21,331
Okay.

2773
01:41:21,332 --> 01:41:22,801
Even if I pick my name, I'll give it to Shin Hye.

2774
01:41:22,802 --> 01:41:24,362
- Right. - Yes.

2775
01:41:24,772 --> 01:41:26,771
- I'll send it to you. - We should send it to Shin Hye.

2776
01:41:26,772 --> 01:41:28,102
Kyung Pyo and Shin Hye.

2777
01:41:28,642 --> 01:41:30,041
(Who is the lucky winner?)

2778
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:31,301
I picked my name.

2779
01:41:31,302 --> 01:41:33,212
(He's the lucky winner.)

2780
01:41:33,742 --> 01:41:34,881
- As I promised... - Just a moment ago...

2781
01:41:34,882 --> 01:41:36,181
- Okay. - All right.

2782
01:41:36,182 --> 01:41:37,941
I will send it to the drama set.

2783
01:41:37,942 --> 01:41:39,351
Thank you.

2784
01:41:39,352 --> 01:41:40,481
- Thank you. - Nice.

2785
01:41:40,482 --> 01:41:42,458
(Please show a lot of interest in "Undercover Miss Hong.")

2786
01:41:42,482 --> 01:41:47,052
(The coffee truck was delivered successfully.)

2787
01:41:47,462 --> 01:41:49,731
- Sixth Sense: City Tour 2 ended... - Yes.

2788
01:41:49,732 --> 01:41:51,131
With ten episodes.

2789
01:41:51,132 --> 01:41:53,071
From this year's summer to winter,

2790
01:41:53,072 --> 01:41:55,112
I enjoyed my time with Sixth Sense members.

2791
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:57,241
It was an honor to join Season Two.

2792
01:41:57,242 --> 01:41:58,412
Thank you.

2793
01:41:58,982 --> 01:42:01,882
We'll be back with Sixth Sense, City Tour Season Three.

2794
01:42:02,352 --> 01:42:03,952
- I can't talk. - Season Two Three?

2795
01:42:04,152 --> 01:42:05,751
See you again.

2796
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:08,791
We'd like to thank the viewers for joining us today.

2797
01:42:08,792 --> 01:42:12,062
We'd also like to thank everyone who participated on the show.

2798
01:42:12,822 --> 01:42:14,862
(Those who walked with Sixth Sense members)

2799
01:42:16,462 --> 01:42:18,831
(We'd like to thank all the owners.)

2800
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:20,731
