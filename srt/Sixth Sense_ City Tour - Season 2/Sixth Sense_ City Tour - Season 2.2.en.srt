1
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,100
(Where is this place that's fiery with the eagle spirit?)

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,399
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Hello, Mimi.

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,770
- Hello, Mimi. - Hello.

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,009
I haven't been to Daejeon in a long time.

5
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,110
- Me neither. - Gosh.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,179
This city used to not be fun. Did you know that?

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,349
- What did you say? - This city wasn't fun.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,756
- Be careful with what you say. - I'm talking about a long time ago.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,949
- A long time ago? - Be careful with what you say.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,350
- It's what people in Daejeon say. - It's not anymore.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,590
But now, it's very popular.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,959
(Today's destination is a very popular city.)

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
(Daejeon)

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,359
Daejeon is very vibrant.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,959
(Located in the heart of South Korea, )

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,529
(it's a city that's easily accessible from anywhere.)

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,530
(Things to eat)
(Things to see)

18
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:57,700
(Things to enjoy)

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,199
(As a 3-in-1 tourist route)

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,739
(No fun)

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,410
(Fun is on, the title has been flipped.)

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,079
(Now it's bustling with Generation MZ.)

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,410
(It's a city of endless fun.)

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,580
(Among the fun places, there's a fake.)

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,719
(An unbelievable fake?)

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,820
(Or real?)

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
(Their opinions continue to sway today.)

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,560
(Will you be able to figure out which one is fake?)

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,929
- Now, it's known for its bread, - Right.

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,560
But most important, the Hanwha Eagles...

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,529
The Hanwha Eagles.

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,176
(The Hanwha Eagles have been a huge success all season.)

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,669
I looked up their ranking...

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,340
as of today.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,070
They rank second.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
Throughout the season, they've been playing very well.

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,540
(With the eagle squad's strong performance this season)

38
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,179
("After 33 Years, They Reached 80 wins...")

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,309
("And Secured a Spot in the Playoff")

40
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,580
(The tickets were sold out every day at the stadium.)

41
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,120
Hyun Jin.

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,589
It's been eight years since I talked to him.

43
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,190
Then don't drop the honorifics with him.

44
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,489
- Hey. - Don't drop the honorifics.

45
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,129
Just because I wasn't in contact with him for eight years...

46
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,159
Exactly.

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,189
(Welcome, Seok Jin.)

48
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,959
Hello.

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,059
Today's City Tour will be in Daejeon.

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,629
Since it's raining, we'll invite the guests right away.

51
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,030
- Let's do that. - Okay.

52
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,739
- Someone is coming. - They're coming.

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,840
There are two of them.

54
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,209
(Who are today's guests arriving like the anticipated rain?)

55
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,940
He's wearing a passionate color.

56
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,450
It's Ji Hoon.

57
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,909
- It's Seo Ji Hye. - Hello.

58
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,480
- Hello. - Hello.

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,520
(From a career woman of cool beauty...)

60
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,120
(to a North Korean elite of cool beauty)

61
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,429
(The epitome of sophistication)

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,330
(Actress Seo Ji Hye)

63
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,800
(Not only in acting...)

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,770
(but also dominating in variety shows)

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,510
(A versatile actor, Kim Ji Hoon)

66
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,570
- It's been such a long time. - Yes.

67
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,410
- Come this way. - It's good to see you.

68
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,080
- Ji Hoon. - Yes.

69
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,250
I thought it'd be sunny today.

70
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,570
I haven't seen you two in a long time.

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,019
- It's been a long time. - Kyung Pyo.

72
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,649
- Long time, no see. - Have you been well?

73
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,049
Of course.

74
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,589
- Hello. - Hello, nice to meet you.

75
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,690
- So that's why. - Long time, no see.

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,259
(Tensing up his biceps with a handshake)

77
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,629
- You're buff now. - Ji Hoon,

78
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,270
your shoulders weren't so wide last time.

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,700
It's nice to meet you.

80
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,830
(Moving to the center at this time?)

81
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,869
- We haven't met, have we? - Yes, we have.

82
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,570
- "Running Man." - We met on "Running Man."

83
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,969
That was in the past.

84
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,970
(Laughing shyly)

85
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,780
He's such a nuisance.

86
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,609
"We haven't met, have we?"

87
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,919
(Embarrassed)

88
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
- He got surprised. - Did you see him back away...

89
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,521
- because he got flustered? - It's okay.

90
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,919
(He backed away by moonwalking out of embarrassment.)

91
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,889
I found out that...

92
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,259
you were in a drama...

93
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,859
- Right. - with my friend, Lee Jung Jae.

94
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,159
Yes.

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,900
It's a drama called "Nice to Not Meet You."

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
- It must be a romantic drama. - Yes.

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,839
(Lee Jung Jae and Lim Ji Yeon's comic acting is...)

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,809
(making waves.)

99
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,279
(A comedy drama about a relationship...)

100
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,850
(between a veteran journalist and a national star)

101
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,719
It's a cheerful, innocuous, and fun drama.

102
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,349
(Please show a lot of love for "Nice to Not Meet You.")

103
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,820
Is there some romance between you two?

104
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,759
- Maybe... - I can't say.

105
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,889
Is that a mystery?

106
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,990
It's a mystery. We don't know yet.

107
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,399
Ji Hoon, you used to be very cute and pretty,

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
but now...

109
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,669
You're a teto-boy.

110
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,299
I'm too old to be cute and pretty.

111
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Really?

112
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,039
I'm in my mid-40s now.

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
Are you in your mid-40s?

114
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,440
He looks so young for his age.

115
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,009
You still look cute to me.

116
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,449
- Yes. - Right.

117
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,349
That's because Seok Jin is in his 60s.

118
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,350
What?

119
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,120
I keep telling you that I'm not in my 60s yet.

120
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,720
- He's frustrating me. - I mean...

121
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,719
- It's been three years... - Mimi, could you say something?

122
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,466
He's been saying that he's in his 50s for 3 years.

123
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,689
Is it true that you're in your 60s?

124
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,359
- I said no. - No?

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
No.

126
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,459
- I can't say anything. - Stop laughing.

127
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,469
All his peers are over 60.

128
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,530
Really?

129
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,040
All his peers admit that they're over 60.

130
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,109
- Only he is in denial. - It's not true.

131
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,539
- Is it not true? - Then...

132
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,040
how did you become four years older than me?

133
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,209
- How old are you? - Your age remains the same,

134
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,750
and I keep aging.

135
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,720
In a few years, your titles will change.

136
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,719
I bet in three years,

137
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,190
- we'll be the same age. - Okay.

138
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,990
That's fine with me.

139
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,460
If he doesn't say his age,

140
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,930
who would think that he's in his 60s?

141
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,499
You look so young.

142
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,760
- I'm not in my 60s. - You look so young.

143
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,129
(Delighted)

144
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,600
It's not true.

145
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,570
Ji Hye, where are you going?

146
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,170
- Ji Hye. - Where are you going?

147
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,709
Your outfit is so white.

148
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,369
With the umbrella and your back turned, you look like a ghost.

149
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,379
(You look like a ghost.)

150
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,780
(Flopping down)

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,180
Why are you so rude today?

152
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,580
How could you call our guest a ghost?

153
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,820
- I'll give you the map first. - Okay.

154
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,750
What is it today?

155
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,420
"City Bursting with Bread, Daejeon."

156
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,530
It's bread when it comes to Daejeon.

157
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,190
The first one is Owner with Puffy Cheeks.

158
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,859
- "Puffy Cheeks?" - The second is...

159
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,299
Owner with Explosive Cannons.

160
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,659
- Are these all bakeries? - Everything is related to bread.

161
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,430
- All of them are related to bread. - Yes.

162
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
(Is today's theme related to bread?)

163
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,270
Owner with Puffy Cheeks.

164
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,969
Owner with Explosive Cannons.

165
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,610
Owner Full of Intelligence.

166
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,279
(Because of his puffy cheeks, )

167
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
(is it someone who looks cute?)

168
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,510
(Or a baby boss?)

169
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,550
(Owner with Puffy Cheeks)

170
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,590
(Echoing through the heart of the city)

171
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,020
(A massive cannon sound?)

172
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,020
(What is the owner's secret weapon?)

173
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,230
(Owner with Explosive Cannons)

174
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,029
(Someone who knows it all)

175
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,030
(An elite intellectual?)

176
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,200
(Owner Full of Intelligence)

177
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,570
(Three places in Daejeon that unleashed their potential charm)

178
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,010
(Which one of them is fake?)

179
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,110
We'll be eating only bread, won't we?

180
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,679
I'm excited.

181
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,349
What could explosive cannons be?

182
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,879
- What? - Explosive cannons.

183
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,250
Bread shaped like cannons.

184
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,719
It sounds like shooting cannons.

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,119
- "Pop." - What?

186
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,589
"It's popping. Pop."

187
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,120
(You know that phrase, right?)

188
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,530
Someone who lies?

189
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,310
- Is that what you mean? - I mean rice popcorn.

190
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,999
- Rice popcorn? - It looks like a cannon.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right.

192
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,499
Let's go and get some bread.

193
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,099
- Okay. - Let's get bread.

194
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,469
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

195
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,470
Let's go.

196
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,540
(Tapping)

197
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,280
Your forearm muscles.

198
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,850
Look at his forearm muscles.

199
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,449
- Ji Hoon does pull-ups. - Yes.

200
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,820
Can you still do the muscle-up?

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,350
Yes, I can.

202
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,859
(This is the muscle-up.)

203
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,990
(An exercise that Ji Hoon usually does)

204
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,130
(Pull-ups are about your weight.)

205
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,630
(And core exercises that defy gravity)

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,740
(It's no wonder that he has a nice body.)

207
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,309
- Both of them have... - Seriously.

208
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,810
- small faces. - Don't they?

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,480
- Everyone here has a small face. - The face size...

210
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,880
Is there anyone among us with a big face?

211
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,149
Why are you looking at Kyung Pyo?

212
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,749
- You're staring at me so hard. - You're staring at Kyung Pyo.

213
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,219
Kyung Pyo's face has gotten smaller.

214
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,759
- It's gotten much smaller. - I agree.

215
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,889
He lost a lot of weight.

216
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,759
Right? I lost a lot of weight.

217
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,089
You gained a lot of weight since we've known each other.

218
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,999
Ji Hoon, that was ten years ago.

219
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,099
My weight was in the 70s back then.

220
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,970
We were in a drama called "Flower Boys Next Door."

221
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,369
He was the pretty boy next door.

222
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,940
- He played the pretty boy? - Yes.

223
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,209
Ji Hye and Kyung Pyo, have you been in a drama before?

224
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,509
- "Don't Dare to Dream." - "Don't Dare to Dream."

225
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,680
- "Don't Dare to Dream." - I know that one.

226
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,779
- That's right. - "Don't Dare to Dream?"

227
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,349
(A masterpiece that captured both viewership and widespread buzz)

228
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,126
(Female supporting actress, male supporting actor)

229
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,549
Back then, you were slim and handsome.

230
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,689
Ji Hye, back then...

231
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,690
- Only back then? - Back then?

232
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,559
That was when I weighed the least.

233
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
- Right. - Yes.

234
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,589
- Back then? - You had lost the most weight.

235
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,729
- Exactly. - He bragged a lot about...

236
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,210
- having lost a lot of weight. - About losing a lot of weight?

237
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,970
(He played the role of a 3rd-generation chaebol heir.)

238
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,240
(Blunt Kyung Pyo's past when he was slender)

239
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,570
I'd say that I was in my prime back then.

240
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,809
- We're here. - We arrived...

241
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,050
- after chatting. - We're here.

242
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,510
Open up your umbrellas.

243
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,549
- Okay. - Get your umbrella ready.

244
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,620
- I'll get out first. - Hurry up and get out.

245
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,549
You have to get out so we can too.

246
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,896
(There are people in the back seat.)

247
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,660
All right. Welcome.

248
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,959
- Mimi, please get out. - Okay.

249
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,229
I'm getting out, Jae Seok.

250
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,460
(The original voice)

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,830
Goodness.

252
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,430
- Ji Hoon. - That's nice.

253
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,769
- He's so manly. - With his forearm muscles...

254
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,240
Did you see his forearm muscles popping out?

255
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,909
Are we going to the first location right away?

256
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,379
No, before you figure out which is real or fake,

257
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,839
we'll stop by a popular bakery.

258
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,949
- Okay. - Yes.

259
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,849
Where we're going now is another popular place.

260
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,950
- The next place? - Yes.

261
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,219
- Especially on weekends, - Right.

262
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,089
A lot of people come here from outside the city...

263
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,589
for the bread tour.

264
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,660
That's right.

265
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,190
(The city of bread, Daejeon)

266
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,830
(Bread here...)

267
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,530
(and there)

268
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,170
(People from everywhere come for the bakery tour.)

269
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,770
(Wherever you go, great taste is guaranteed.)

270
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,239
(Dozens of recommended bakeries on social media)

271
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Do you know good bread is in Daejeon?

272
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,080
(There's even a bread tour bus.)

273
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,580
(The bakery tour in Daejeon became the hottest trend.)

274
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,279
(Jung-gu, Daejeon)

275
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,690
(Shall we go on the bakery tour?)

276
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,060
How about some bread early in the morning...

277
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,759
- Coffee. - with a hot cup of coffee?

278
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,959
- That sounds wonderful. - That's the best.

279
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,129
I want some sponge cake.

280
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,699
- We're already here. - From the window...

281
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,800
- This is it. - Here it is.

282
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,300
This place is very famous.

283
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,000
I can already smell...

284
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,640
- the bread. - Yes.

285
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,669
The smell of the bread...

286
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,739
(There's a mild smell of bread outside the bakery.)

287
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,509
I know that it's too early to say this,

288
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,610
but it looks so new.

289
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,110
What do you mean?

290
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
The signboard looks very new.

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
We're not here to see if it's real or not.

292
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,589
It's real.

293
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,689
It's a popular place, so we're here to introduce it.

294
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,789
- This is... - You should've told me.

295
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,490
We're not here to see if it's real or not.

296
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,329
- Feel free to eat here. - It's a place to eat.

297
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,560
(We stopped by here because it's a popular spot.)

298
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,529
- Hello. - Welcome to our bakery.

299
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,976
(Giving off positive energy in their greetings)

300
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,099
Gosh.

301
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,699
- Is this the bakery... - Welcome.

302
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,970
- that's popular right now? - Yes, that's right.

303
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,609
(In a cozy space, bread is neatly stacked.)

304
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,280
The bread looks so delicious.

305
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,249
The smell of the bread is amazing.

306
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
(It's waiting for customers with its sweet smell.)

307
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,760
(Long waits are a given.)

308
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,790
(It's a bakery that you must visit during the bakery tour.)

309
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,230
(The hottest bakery in Daejeon, the city of bread)

310
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,939
They're most famous for their milky madeleine.

311
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,839
- Which one? - This is the most famous.

312
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,170
- This one? - They won in a bread contest.

313
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,740
(A taste that even got an award?)

314
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,450
(Covered with condensed milk and vanilla beans)

315
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,550
(Looking plump and delicious)

316
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,620
(Milky madeleine)

317
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,190
Why is it so fat?

318
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,630
I bet there's an egg inside.

319
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,959
Seok Jin, this isn't egg bread.

320
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,929
- It looks exactly like egg bread. - It's called madeleine.

321
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,000
It looks like egg bread.

322
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,770
Seok Jin, why don't you put it inside your ear?

323
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,910
(When Ji Hye finds something funny, she turns around.)

324
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,379
Ji Hye is very responsive.

325
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,650
Look at Ji Hye.

326
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,620
It's so good.

327
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,380
It's chewy.

328
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,589
It has a lot of vanilla beans and condensed milk.

329
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,660
That's why it's so savory and fragrant.

330
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,759
It's very soft.

331
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,966
("It's very soft" by Professor Foodie Kyung Pyo)

332
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,400
(Eating)

333
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,169
And their poolish baguette is very famous too.

334
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,170
Which baguette?

335
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,939
(Poolish baguette)

336
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,400
(Double chocolate baguette)

337
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,939
I've been wanting to try this.

338
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,070
Double chocolate baguette.

339
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,880
(They take a bite.)

340
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,180
This baguette is excellent.

341
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,480
(Humming)

342
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,356
The chocolate baguette is really good.

343
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,689
They're generous with the ingredients.

344
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,550
You can taste every ingredient in it.

345
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,260
This would be perfect with rice.

346
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
- Hey. - It's so good.

347
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,960
It wouldn't match well with rice.

348
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,399
Ji Hoon, you can't say that it'd be perfect with rice.

349
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,329
It usually refers to a side dish.

350
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,229
You can't say that it'd be perfect with rice.

351
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,499
- You understand what I mean, right? - Of course, but...

352
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,699
(I'm just saying that it's that good.)

353
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,010
- I should bring some back to Seoul. - Yes.

354
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,180
- Can we get some bread to go? - Sure.

355
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,450
We have to take some home. It's so good.

356
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,680
- Are you paying for it? - Of course.

357
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,419
Wouldn't it make your wife happy?

358
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,890
- She'd love it. - Exactly.

359
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,030
It's great to have a successful younger friend.

360
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,460
He pays for a lot of things.

361
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,860
Why is the total so small?

362
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,260
- This is on us. - No, I'll pay the full price.

363
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,699
- Please rip him off. - Please give me the full price.

364
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,369
That's amazing. I want to become successful enough...

365
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,699
to ask someone to rip me off.

366
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,180
- I should certainly pay. - I'll pack you a lot of good bread.

367
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,539
It's done.

368
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,270
Thank you for the bread, Jae Seok.

369
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,079
Your bread was amazing.

370
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,540
- Have a good day. - Bye.

371
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,879
- The bread was really good. - I agree.

372
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,980
It was very good.

373
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,920
It's a popular place for pudding.

374
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,789
Is it popular for their pudding?

375
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,966
(Is this another popular place?)

376
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,289
(The bakery where they just went)

377
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,290
It's right next door.

378
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,559
- Hamster... - Gosh, it must be a hamster cafe.

379
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,600
(A hamster cafe?)

380
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,330
This is what it used to look like.

381
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,290
This is what it used to look like.

382
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,739
- You mean this building? - Yes.

383
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,369
It says that it's still open.

384
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,770
(There's even a suspicious poster.)

385
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,369
What is it?

386
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,556
(The shop is confusing from the entrance.)

387
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,639
What could it mean?

388
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,810
(It's a popular pudding shop, right?)

389
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,220
- Hello. - Welcome.

390
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,849
Is this a pudding place?

391
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,050
- I've never been to a pudding shop. - Me neither.

392
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,849
I've never seen a shop specializing in pudding.

393
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,960
It's also my first time.

394
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,260
(From afar, it looks ordinary.)

395
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,260
- Here's some pudding. - Is there pudding?

396
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,129
(Colorful)

397
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,570

402
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,440
(It suddenly rose to a hot dessert spot in Daejeon.)

403
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,079
(The second popular spot)

404
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,050
(A cafe specializing in pudding)

405
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,979
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

406
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,549
- Hello. - Ma'am.

407
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,019
We've never had pudding before.

408
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,219
We don't know which one to get.

409
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,659
- Do you have any signature dish? - At our cafe,

410
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,690
- most people order jelly soda. - Jelly soda sounds good.

411
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,830
- Shine Muscat jelly, - That sounds good.

412
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,999
Pancakes...

413
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,329
(Various desserts like pancakes and huge pudding)

414
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,359
And huge pudding.

(Various desserts like pancakes and huge pudding)

416
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,746
- Huge pudding for Big Nose, please. - Huge pudding.

417
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,770
(Huge pudding for Big Nose, please.)
Please serve it in front of me.

418

(Huge pudding is for Big Nose.)

419
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:28,109
We'll take those.

420
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,740
- I'll bring them soon. - Okay.

421
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,009
You know what?

422
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,739
I bet many MZers come...

423
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,249
to Daejeon these days.

424
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I know.

425
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,219
- It's so much fun. - I agree.

426
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,449
You can have bread.

427
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,219
- There's a pudding place next door. - Exactly.

428
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,989
Right. If you're an MZer, you must come to Daejeon.

429
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,020
You're right.

430
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,790
Here it is.

431
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,989
- It's so pretty. - It's beautiful.

432
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,089
It's really pretty.

433
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,129
- It must be jelly. - Oh, my.

434
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,630
- Is this jelly? - It's pudding.

435
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,069
- It's pudding. - Goodness.

436
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,740
Look at it shaking.

437
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,869
- Thank you. - Thank you, ma'am.

438
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,370
(Bouncy)

439
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,910
I should take a photo of this.

440
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,879

441
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,210

- Is this the huge pudding? - Look at it shake.

451
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,100
It's shaking like my nose.

452
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,900
It looks soft.

453
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,139
Let's try it.

454
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,839
Is this Big Nose... I mean, is this the huge pudding?

455
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,709
- Big Nose. - Aren't you Big Nose?

456
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,710
(Aren't you Big Nose?)

457
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,580
I don't want to eat it now.

458
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,210
It's because we came here early.

459
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,250
(It's 10am when his tongue isn't warmed up yet.)

460

461
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,020

- I don't particularly like it. - Right.

470

- I've never had a lot of pudding. - Right.

471

You're not familiar with it.

472
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,309
- You're not familiar with it. - Exactly.

473
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,809
- That's a great expression. - You're not familiar with it.

474
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,140
Right. Let's see.

475
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,909
Shall I try this first? Let's try Big Nose.

It's not too sweet. It's perfect.

482
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,729
- You're right. - It's not sweet.

483
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,499
- It's not very sweet... - It's perfect as a dessert.

484

Green grape candy.

501
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,670
Did her comment deserve that much reaction?

502
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,569
I thought you won the Grand Award at the Math Olympiad.

503

505
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,130
Yes, it tastes like green grape candy.

507
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,050
- It looks like honey hotteok. - This is...

508
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,449
- Pancake? - Pancake.

509
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,589

513
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,490
Really?

514
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,229
- It's freshly made. - It's warm.

515
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,289
Have some now.

516
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,829

(Grabbing and eating immediately)

520
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,030
I like its texture because it's thick.

521
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,840
It's very chewy.

522
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,839
The inside is different from the pancakes we know.

523
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,009
- No. - It's not the same.

524
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,569
- It's different. - The inside is soft.

525
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,640
- Yes. - Gosh.

526
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,709
This is good.

527
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,040
- This is it. - Yes.

534
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,819
(Seok Jin, have a bite.)

535
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,859
What's wrong with you?

536
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,989
(Pushing forward)

537
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,990
(Smiling)

538
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,359
(Pushing right in)

539
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,860
(A hit-and-run with bread)

540
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,800
What's the matter with you?

541
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,699
(He got caught off guard and got humiliated.)

542
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,499
- I mean... - Why did you do that...

543
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,600
- all of a sudden? - Here's why I did it.

544
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,309
Seok Jin was eating little by little.

545
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,369
Right.

546
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,439
He was taking small bites.

547
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,570
(It was irresistible.)

548
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,010
He was being considerate of his health.

549
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
No, I wasn't.

550
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,650
We have to eat all day long.

551
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,579
We have to eat all day long, so I was pacing myself.

552
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,619
(Extremely furious)

553
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,719
It's so delicious that I can't help eating it.

554
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,819
I was just being affectionate.

555
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,949
I was so startled.

556
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,720
I was expressing my love for you.

557
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,429
- Let's go. - Let's go.

558
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,690
Let's go.

559
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,100
- Is City Tour starting now? - Yes.

560
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,130
We have to stay alert.

561
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,660
We have to be sharp from now on.

562
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Exactly. Gosh.

563
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,270
- Hello. - Are you going on a bread tour?

564
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,239
- Gosh. - It's that bakery.

565
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,910
You bought some bread.

566
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,569
(Even the pouring rain can't stop...)

567
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,880
(the scene of the bakery tour.)

568
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,109
Daejeon is very hot right now.

569
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,249
- It's very hot. - Yes.

570
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,850
- The MZers are... - Are they here for the bread tour?

571
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,049
It's not just Generation MZ.

572
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,389
Generation X like me...

573
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,589
- Are you Generation X? - Yes.

574
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,989
- Aren't I part of Gen X too? - No.

575
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,289
- Which generation do I belong to? - You belong to...

576
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,360
the Korean War generation.

577
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,930
No way. Goodness.

578
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,359
(Laughing)

579
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,630
The Korean War?

580
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,530
I learned about the Korean War in books.

581
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,000
Hey, I'm still young enough to be healthy.

582
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,240
I mean...

583
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,239
What was the name of the first place?

584
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,540
- Puffy Cheeks. - Puffy Cheeks.

585
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,080
- Puffy Cheeks? - Puffy Cheeks.

586
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,880
Puffy Cheeks.

587
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,180
If it's called Puffy Cheeks,

588
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,650
could it be a bossam restaurant?

589
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,350
When you put a wrap in your mouth,

590
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:42,690
your cheeks become puffy.

591
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,549
- Some might not be a bakery. - I don't think that it's bread.

592
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,819
- Me neither. - Puffy Cheek.

593
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,220
- It can't be bread. - Puffy Cheek.

594
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,559
Here we are.

595
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
- What? - This must be it.

596
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:51,259
- It's written in Japanese. - Right.

597
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,230
It looks like a bakery.

598
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,969
- What? - Beer...

599
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,029
Is this it?

600
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,276
(The first shop makes everyone flustered.)

601
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,869
I didn't expect this at all.

602
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,299
Isn't it a Japanese-style...

603
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,310
bar? It's an izakaya.

604
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,469
(Located at the end of the alley)

605
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,650
(An ordinary-looking izakaya)

606
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,109
- What? - Beer...

607
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,979
- Is this it? - Are we drinking during the day?

608
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,126
(Is this really a happening place in Daejeon?)

609
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,120
- There are baseballs. - What?

610
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,490
(Baseballs at an izakaya? That's random.)

611
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,059
- Is it run by a baseball player? - Is it real or fake?

612
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,090
- Right? - Yes.

613
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,660
Hanwha...

614
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,230
Is this run by a baseball player?

615
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,730
It must be the Hanwha Eagles.

616
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,669
- Let's go. - Please come in.

617
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,539
Let's go in. Hello, sir.

618
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,770
(They enter while being suspicious.)

619
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,310
(Looking around)

620
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,309
Baseball?

621
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,510
(Baseball?)

622
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,750
(What you see as soon as you go through the door)

623
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,450
(A huge amount of Hanwha Eagles merchandise)

624
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,190
(Hanwha Eagles jersey and commemorative ball)

625
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,420
(Baseball cards of various players)

626
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,260
(Baseballs with each player's photo and signature)

627
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,830
(Filled with Hanwha Eagles merchandise)

628
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,729
(Past the display case is...)

629
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,299
(the jersey zone.)

630
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,869
(Chang Jong Hoon, Song Jin Woo, Jung Min Cheul, Kim Tae Kyun)

631
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,970
(Eagles legends are in one place.)

632
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,280
(The interior is in orange which symbolize the Hanwha Eagles.)

633
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,680
(Covered with eagles everywhere)

634
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,150
(How did it become a popular place?)

635
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,749
Based on its appearance,

636
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,219
it looks like it's actually running.

637
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
(It looks like it's actually running.)

638
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,060
Is it an izakaya with the baseball theme?

639
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,689
There are also autographs.

640
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,200
- What? - Autographs.

641
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,440
- Autographs. - There are autographs.

642
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,370
(Autographs are on the wall by the entrance.)

643
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,440
(From cheerleaders of the Hanwha Eagles)

644
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,010
Comedians visited here.

645
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,939
They're comedians.

646
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,109
(Couple Kang Jae Jun and Lee Eun Hyeong also visited.)

647
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,310
Is this run by a baseball player?

648
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,849
Could it be someone...

649
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,990
from the Hanwha Eagles team?

650
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,919
(A restaurant run by a player from the Hanwha Eagles?)

651
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,420
(Mimi is looking at the table.)

652
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,390
- The players... - What is it?

653
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,789
(What did she find?)

654
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,300
- What is it? - What is it?

655
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,729
It says that at this restaurant,

656
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,730
rice balls may fly over your head.

657
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,229
(They may fly over your head.)

658
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,470
What?

659
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,970
(Mimi found a warning on the table.)

660
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,780
Isn't there a baseball glove next to you?

661
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,410
- Yes, there's a glove. - Yes.

662
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,949
This isn't the only place.

663
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,449
There are baseball gloves everywhere.

664
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,120
(There's a baseball glove at each table.)

665
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,419
Maybe we have to catch...

666
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,850
all the food with the glove.

667
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,649
Maybe the cheeks meant balls.

668
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,219
Maybe we catch food with that.

669
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,689
- Catch like this? - Yes, with the glove.

670
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,659
- No way. - Come on.

671
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,529
This is ridiculous.

672
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,400
The idea is excessive.

673
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,300
- It has to be fake. - This is ridiculous.

674
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,740
Who would throw food?

675
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,640
(Coming up soon)

676
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,169
It's really a baseball glove.

677
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,380
(Surprised)

678
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,610
So this is how it works.

679
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,480
This place seems real.

680
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,019
(To instantly put...)

681
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,750
(all doubts to rest)

682
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,089
That's amazing.

683
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,690
(Here comes the rice ball.)

684
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,890
The restaurant owner is coming.

685
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,589
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

686
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,629
(Will it be someone who used to be a baseball player?)

687
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,729
(Surprised)

688
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,000
(Thinking)

689
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,100
He looks very young.

690
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,899
(To be a former baseball player)

691
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,139
Excuse me.

692
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,540
(He looks way too young.)

693
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,870
- I don't think he's the owner. - Your ear...

694
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,839
Were you one of the Hanwha Eagles?

695
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,349
- I don't think... - No, I wasn't.

696
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,080
- You weren't? - No.

697
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,919
I'm a fan.

698
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,050
Also, the Hanwha Eagles are known in Daejeon.

699
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,790
- You're right. - I agree.

700
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,060
(The Eagles baseball team founded in Daejeon as its home base)

701
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,800
(Starting with their victory in the Korean Series in 1999)

702
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,400
(Giving us countless moments of joy and emotion)

703
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,870
I'm from Daejeon.

704
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,540
It's impossible not to be their fan.

705
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,380
The Eagles' home stadium is near Daeheung-dong.

706
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,130
(The restaurant is located a 10-minute drive from the stadium.)

707
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,279
Some people come here after watching a baseball game.

708
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,220
Many of the fans also visit here.

709
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,190
I renovated the place with the Eagles theme.

710
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,719
After the renovation,

711
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,929
I believe that it became a must-visit place for the fans.

712
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,830
(Now, it became a place that the Eagles fans must visit.)

713
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,299
- So you changed the theme? - That's why.

714
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,729
I got it renovated...

715
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,300
with the baseball theme.

716
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,699
May I ask how this place became popular?

717
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,899
We have what's called...

718
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,739
baseball glove pork cutlet.

719
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,540
By pounding the sirloin,

720
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,670
- we shape it into a baseball glove. - Seriously?

721
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,580
In this shape?

722
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,079
- Is it shaped like this? - It's shaped like the glove.

723
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,379
That's fascinating.

724
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,379
Baseball glove pork cutlet is accompanied...

725
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,589
by a rice ball.

726
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,259
We serve the rice balls by throwing them.

727
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,389
(By throwing)

728
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,960
(By throwing?)

729
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,260
(The real reason why this place became hot)

730
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,599
We serve the rice balls by throwing them.

731
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,770
That's how we run the restaurant.

732
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,369
I happened to watch a video of a shop abroad...

733
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,140
where bread was served by throwing it.

734
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,639
(One day, a video came up...)

735
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,839
(Throwing)

736
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,279
(based on the boss's algorithm.)

737
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,610
It was fun.

738
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,420
I was inspired by the idea.

739
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,850
Many customers find it fun.

740
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,120
Thanks to the rice balls, the sales increased a lot.

741
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,290
Average monthly sales are about 70,000 dollars.

742
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,360
(A restaurant where rice balls are thrown. Could it be real?)

743
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,270
(This is suspicious.)

744
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,769
- Other than this, - Yes?

745
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,200
What are some other dishes related to baseball?

746
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,669
It's a dish called Eagle Platter.

747
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,639
It's shaped like a baseball stadium.

748
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,610
It's a platter with five different types of food.

749
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,309
It sounds real.

750
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,579
- Could we taste those dishes? - Okay.

751
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,049
- Thank you. - They're coming right up.

752
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,650
How did he injure his ear?

753
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,590
(By the way, how did he injure his ear?)

754
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,859
(Since a moment ago)

755
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,889
Your ear...

756
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,290
(Since a moment ago)

757
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,429
- Your ear... - He hurt his ear.

758
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,730
(The owner's ear got caught on Mimi's radar.)

759
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,906
I got an ear infection during my summer vacation.

760
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,400
I see.

761
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm struggling with it.

762
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,569
I thought that you were getting orders.

763
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,146
(I thought that you were getting orders.)

764
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,246
He has an ear infection, but you thought he was getting orders?

765
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,369
I thought that...

766
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,679
he was secretly getting orders.

767
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,279
She was busy being suspicious.

768
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,449
(Talk about the pork cutlet. Smile.)

769
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,780
(Like this?)

770
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,580
I apologize, sir.

771
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,649
She was busy being suspicious.

772
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,290
She's not a bad person.

773
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,620
(Laughing)

774
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,559
- I thought that he was... - We have to suspect.

775
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,030
Right, we have to suspect.

776
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,500
(While the restaurant owner goes to prepare the food)

777
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,899
Doesn't it seem real here?

778
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
I think so.

779
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,830
Including the details...

780
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,570
I think that it's fake.

781
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,969
Why?

782
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,170
I think the restaurant exists in real life,

783
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,809
- but the idea seems fake. - Right.

784
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,910
- The idea seems fake. - That could be fake.

785
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,080
It's strange that he changed...

786
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,979
- the theme all of a sudden. - He changed it.

787
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,720
- I agree. - That's what's suspicious.

788
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,279
This is what I should've asked.

789
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,919
When did he renovate this place?

790
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,989
Ask him now.

791
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,889
- Sir. - Yes?

792
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,860
How long has it been since the renovation?

793
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,859
I changed it to the baseball theme two years ago.

794
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,800
- It's been a long time. - Yes.

795
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,459
Has it really been two years?

796
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,799
Don't these look...

797
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,929
too clean?

798
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,100
(The props look too clean for 2 years.)

799
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,570
You see that baseball jersey?

800
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,039
- Yes. - It can't belong to Kim Tae Kyun.

801
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,409
- The size is... - It's too small.

802
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,940
Do they sell uniforms just as souvenirs?

803
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,210
Isn't it merchandise?

804
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,250
"Isn't it merchandise?"

805
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,380
(Logged in as Mimi)

806
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,589
Do you mean, Lee Gook Ju?

807
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,390
(Me?)

808
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,589
(What a headache)

809
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,930
Is it Gook Ju?

810
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,660
Is it merchandise?

811
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,259
"Gosh, I feel stressed."

812
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,229
(He's the most excited when teasing Mimi.)

813
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,470
"I feel stressed."

814
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,969
All these uniforms belong to the legends of the Hanwha Eagles.

815
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,409
(Jerseys of legendary players who retired their numbers)

816
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,909
(The Eagles' king of home run, Chang Jong Hoon)

817
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,409
(The all-time winningest pitcher, Song Jin Woo)

818
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,839
(The hero of the 1999 championship, Jung Min Cheul)

819
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,486
(The eternal cleanup hitter, Kim Tae Kyun)

820
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,710
(And at the very end is...)

821
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,580
(Player Moon Dong Ju)

822
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,880
(Speaking of Moon Dong Ju)

823
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,259
(The Eagles' starting pitcher with the highest...)

824
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,820
(pitching velocity in the country)

825
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,560
(The hottest rookie sensation at the moment)

826
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,629
There's only Moon Dong Ju's autograph.

827
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,660
You're right.

828
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,899
(Speaking of which)

829
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,399
(Moon Dong Ju)

830
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,839
(There's autograph only on Moon Dong Ju's jersey.)

831
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,610
Except for Moon Dong Ju, everyone else has already retired.

832
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,639
- Right. - That's why there's no autograph.

833
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,880
A detail like this is convincing.

834
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,149
If it were fake,

835
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,749
- all autographs would be there. - It looks natural.

836
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,150
- It looks natural. - You're right.

837
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,249
If it were fake, they could also show fake autographs.

838
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,650
- It's not hard. - You're right.

839
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,590
- I need to try the food first. - Could it be real?

840
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,019
- Right. - So this is it.

841
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,089
(Their reasoning continues.)

842
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,230
The food is here.

843
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,089
- It's Eagle Platter. - It's quite heavy.

844
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,160
It's heavy.

845
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,259
This looks amazing.

846
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,399
(Eagle Platter)

847
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,699
- It's a baseball stadium. - There's salmon.

848
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
(Fascinated)

849
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:53,900
Eagle Platter?

850
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,539
(The first dish to mislead the Sixth Sense members)

851
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,009
(Copying and pasting a baseball stadium)

852
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,810
(Amazing-looking Eagle Platter)

853
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,650
(Let me introduce you 5 different dishes.)

854
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,350
The main dish is called chirashi sushi.

855
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,649
"Chirashi" means scattered in Japanese.

856
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,820
(Sushi with various seafood, eggs, and vegetables)

857
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,689
(Inspired by chirashi sushi, )

858
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,366
(it's sushi that's shaped like a baseball stadium.)

859
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,429
Julienned arugula, onions,

860
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,860
and cabbages are served.

861
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,770
(Raw salmon)

862
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,169
I prep the salmon, which is the main ingredient.

863
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,340
(Once fresh salmon is cut and served)

864
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,809
(The outfield)

865
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,810
(The infield)

866
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,650
(The baseball field is complete.)

867
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,050
I top it with avocado.

868
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,490
I plate it like a baseball stadium.

869
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,090
(It looks exactly like a baseball stadium.)

870
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,890
(Increasing the savory flavor by adding salty soy sauce)

871
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,330
(Savory chirashi sushi is ready.)

872
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,730
(This isn't all.)

873
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,470
Japanese fried chicken,

874
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,970
fried enoki mushrooms,

875
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,370
rolled omelet.

876
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,540
I also serve potato salad.

877
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,840
(A combination so perfect that it's impossible not to be delicious)

878
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,879
(The restaurant's signature dish filled with victorious energy)

879
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,979
It's shaped like a baseball stadium.

880
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,749
This is our restaurant's signature dish.

881
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,350
(The game of 5 flavors starts.)

882
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,520
- What's this? - This is...

883
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,019
It's the ball ground.

884
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,989
- First, second, and third base. - Right.

885
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,090
So that's what they are.

886
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,059
He even showed the audience.

887
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,160
There it is.

888
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,860
(Including a detail of the audience)

889
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,959
- How much is it? - It's 29.9 dollars.

890
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,100
It's 29.9 dollars?

891
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,129
The price is good.

892
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,270
It's not bad.

893
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,840
Please mix the ingredients before eating.

894
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,239
It'd be a waste to mix them.

895
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,769
Right, it looks pretty.

896
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,709
Salmon... And vegetables.

897
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,180
- It's like salmon over rice. - Exactly.

898
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,410
There are more vegetables than salmon.

899
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,679
Gosh, this is...

900
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,880
(Bursting out laughing)

901
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,250
Ji Hye, you're laughing...

902
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,620
a lot today. She was laughing while looking out the window.

903
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,229
(Ji Hye has been laughing in silence.)

904
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,530
(This is a fun place.)

905
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,629
It's been a while since Ji Hye has been on a variety show.

906
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,469
She's seeing so many unusual characters now.

907
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,869
(Laughing)

908
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,099
- It's hard to find people like us. - Exactly.

909
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,709
- It's impossible to find. - Right.

910
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,969
All the famous people...

911
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,980
in each neighborhood are right here.

912
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,309
From each neighborhood...

913
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,080
- None of us are normal. - No.

914
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,610
All the neighborhood representatives are here.

915
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,319
Right, I represent Bangbae-dong.

916
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,479
Bangbae-dong?

917
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,619
Are you from Bangbae-dong?

918
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,450
You're from a high class neighborhood.

919
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,019
- Are you from Bangbae-dong? - Yes.

920
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,719
- What's the matter? - Is that your hometown?

921
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,129
No, it's where I live now.

922
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,190
(I see.)

923
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,459
- We're talking about our hometown. - Where do you live now?

924
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,129
No, we're talking about our hometown.

925
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,899
- It should be your hometown. - Really?

926
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,240
I also live in Seocho.

927
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,539
- I live in the neighborhood. - I also live in Nonhyeon.

928
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,440
Of course. All of us live in the same area.

929
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,479
You don't know many people like us, do you?

930
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,410
- They must be much quieter. - I want a lot of salmon.

931
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,279
Please eat, Seok Jin.

932
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,079
- Thank you. - It's for you.

933
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,150
Okay.

934
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,090
(Seok Jin takes the first bite.)

935
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,760
- Is it good? - It's really good.

936
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,389
(Mimi also takes a big bite.)

937
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,030
(Humming)

938
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,499
(A gesture of truth)

939
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
(Everyone is exclaiming.)

940
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:08,600
It's delicious.

941
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,629
- It's really delicious. - It is.

942
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,670
(Two bites)

943
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,300
- It's good. - It's good.

944
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,270
Gosh, it's delicious.

945
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,409
- Japanese fried chicken... - Dip it in this sauce.

946
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,579
What's this?

947
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,040
(At that time, Seok Jin finds something.)

948
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,750
- It looks like fried mushroom. - Mushroom?

949
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,919
(Crunchy on the outside and chewy inside)

950
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,750
(Fried enoki mushrooms with the best texture)

951
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,660
(Staring)

952
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,420
It must be pine mushroom.

953
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,289
- Enoki mushroom. - Enoki.

954
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,529
- Enoki mushroom. - It has to be enoki mushroom.

955
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,759
- It can't be pine mushroom. - It looks like...

956
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,769
- We're a group of unusual people. - He's the same as us.

957
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,070
(What's wrong with him now?)

958
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,139
He's the same as us.

959
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,470
(Blunt)

960
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,740
(Laughing)

961
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,740
Where are you from? Where's your hometown?

962
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,409
I'm from Junggok-dong.

963
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,139
- You're from Junggok-dong? - Are you from Seoul?

964
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,979
I grew up in Junggok-dong.

965
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,079
- Really? - Yes.

966
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,320
Which number in Junggok-dong?

967
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,279
What?

968
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,990
(He's very tiring.)

969
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,149
(He's definitely one of us.)

970
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,089
Junggok-dong is divided into four parts.

971
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,359
Do we have to be...

972
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,790
from the exact same place?

973
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,459
We only have unusual people with us.

974
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,859
He's also unusual in his neighborhood.

975
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,730
We represent each of our neighborhood.

976
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,030
This is delicious.

977
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,440
People can come here when there's a baseball game.

978
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,569
I could see myself drinking beer while watching baseball.

979
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,870
Or after a baseball game.

980
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,340
I'm curious about Baseball Glove Pork Cutlet. Is it really shaped...

981
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,510
I'm curious about the shape.

982
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,820
- Actually, this is enough... - It's good.

983
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,349
Pork cutlet.

984
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,190
(Where?)

985
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,690
It's really shaped like a glove.

986
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,919
(To shake up the world of pork cutlet)

987
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,020
(The rise of a new sensation)

988
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,500
(With the deep contour of the baseball glove...)

989
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,370
(and detailed finger shapes)

990
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,700
(Is this a baseball glove or pork cutlet?)

991
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,340
(The appearance can be very misleading.)

992
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,670
(This can't be excluded when it comes to baseball gloves.)

993
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,980
(Rice baseball)

994
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,779
(There are even stitches.)

995
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,210
(A meeting of baseball glove and baseball)

996
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,579
(A meal with the baseball vibe is ready.)

997
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,690
(And)

998
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,259
(Hidden in this dish)

999
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,690
(A special secret)

1000
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,889
The rice baseball is...

1001
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,900
served by throwing it.

1002
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,330
(The first ever in Korea)

1003
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,870
(Rice balls that are thrown)

1004
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,209
(Throwing rice balls takes place from Monday to Thursday.)

1005
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,039
Table Eight, here comes your rice ball.

1006
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,780
One, two, three.

1007
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,019
The customers receive...

1008
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,849
the rice balls and root for us.

1009
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,789
I think that's what makes it fun.

1010
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,089
(I think that's what makes it fun.)

1011
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,059
Rice Baseball Reels have been popular...

1012
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,829
on social media.

1013
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,599
I looked it up on social media.

1014
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,300
It came up on social media.

1015
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,640
(The hottest place that's dominating the social media)

1016
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,239
On successful days, I've sold over 100 dishes.

1017
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,350
(A popular dish that turned it into a trendy spot)

1018
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,949
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

1019
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,549
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1020
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,889
As I told you before, the rice ball is...

1021
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,889
- served by throwing. - I'll catch it.

1022
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,519
Please put on the glove.

1023
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,589
- I used to be an outfielder. - You should catch it.

1024
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,299
- He played baseball. - I played baseball.

1025
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,360
Catch it.

1026
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,100
Table Eight, here's your rice ball.

1027
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,470
(Nervous)

1028
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,739
One, two, three.

1029
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,840
(It's thrown.)

1030
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,640
(The ball is a little low.)

1031
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,079
(Will...)

1032
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,280
(Jae Seok be able to catch it?)

1033
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,950
(He caught it.)

1034
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,689
(A perfect catch)

1035
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,260
(Feeling triumphant)

1036
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,560
So this is how it works.

1037
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,030
People catch it like this.

1038
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,400
This place seems real.

1039
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,429
If this is fake,

1040
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,230
someone should make use...

1041
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,800
of this idea fast.

1042
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,099
This place seems real.

1043
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,640
- It seems real. - I agree.

1044
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,509
Shaping pork cutlet like this...

1045
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,186
- Right. It looks realistic. - It's not easy.

1046
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,450
He deep-fries it by sticking the meat to the glove.

1047
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,550
Hey, you.

1048
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,319
Goodness.

1049
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,419
(What's wrong with him?)

1050
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,049
How would they stick it to the glove?

1051
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,319
- My junior from Junggok-dong. - Goodness.

1052
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,736
(The Junggok-dong rep doesn't disappoint.)

1053
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,330
- How did he fry it like this? - I wonder how.

1054
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,420
(Would you like to know how to make Baseball Glove Pork Cutlet?)

1055
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,299
Baseball Glove Pork Cutlet is...

1056
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,929
made with Korean pork sirloin.

1057
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,530
(Fresh Korean pork sirloin is prepared.)

1058
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,440
It's seasoned with salt and black pepper.

1059
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,280
(A mallet appears.)

1060
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,379
I pound the pork sirloin over 100 times.

1061
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,420
(Once it's pounded over 100 times and becomes thin)

1062
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,390
Spread it out thin and make it bigger than a person's face.

1063
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,349
To shape it like a baseball glove,

1064
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,289
I make knife cuts for the fingers.

1065
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,770
(Make knife cuts shaped like fingers)

1066
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,060
(It's shaped like a glove.)

1067
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,360
(Next, it's time to shape the contour of the glove.)

1068
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,500
(This time, it's a ladle.)

1069
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,909
Use a ladle and chopsticks for frying...

1070
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,540
to shape it like a glove.

1071
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,040
(When it's deep-fried for 5 more minutes)

1072
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,280
(Baseball Glove Pork Cutlet is made.)

1073
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,540
(Accompany it with curry sauce made from scratch)

1074
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,350
(Baseball Glove Pork Cutlet is ready.)

1075
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,320
- How do we cut it? - Shall we cut it?

1076
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,760
- Here are some scissors. - We're supposed to use scissors.

1077
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,799
(Tongs and scissors are provided to make cutting easier.)

1078
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,759
- Here are some scissors. - We're supposed to use scissors.

1079
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,776
(Naturally handing over the scissors)

1080
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,099
- Here are some scissors. - We're supposed to use scissors.

1081
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,629
- Then... - Since it'll be messy.

1082
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,470
You, with the forearm muscles, cut it for us.

1083
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
(Busted...)

1084
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:52,421
- You, with the forearm muscles. - How can you toss them to Ji Hye?

1085
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,079
- Was he giving them to me? - Yes!

1086
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,780
- The plate's closer to her. - He wasn't going to budge.

1087
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,749
What's the point of working out?

1088
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,279
I can't believe Mr. Forearm Muscles.

1089
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,619
Forearm Muscles, come on.

1090
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,049
- How should I cut this? - Why bother to work out?

1091
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,719
- I can't believe him. - This is all great.

1092
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,090
Should I cut two pieces at once?

1093
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,029
- Go, Forearm Muscles. - Look at him go.

1094
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,260
Look at his muscles at work.

1095
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,300
- Check out his forearm muscles. - Nice.

1096
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,906
- Look at his muscles at work. - Do you see his forearm muscles?

1097
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,570
The veins in his arms are popping out.

1098
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,700
(No way!)

1099
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,940
(Look at that.)

1100
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,979
- Nice! - Go, Forearm Muscles.

1101
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,409
(Grinning wide, showing his gums)

1102
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,730
How many years did you work out just to cut a pork cutlet?

1103
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
- No way. - All those pull-ups...

1104
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,950
- Here you are cutting this. - I love it.

1105
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,090
Ji Hye, you got lucky today.

1106
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,389
Isn't it a treat to see representatives...

1107
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,519
from all these different neighborhoods?

1108
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,730
- Aren't we a bunch of weirdos? - He's from Junggok-dong.

1109
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,400
Good. Please try some.

1110
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,569
- Please enjoy. - Nice.

1111
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,700
I love it.

1112
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,999
- Let's try this. - This is curry sauce.

1113
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Let's have it with curry.

1114
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,910
(The pork cutlet's best friend: thick, spicy curry sauce)

1115
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,009
This is the pork cutlet sauce.

1116
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,239
(How does it taste?)

1117
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,080
(Delicious)

1118
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,380
(My gosh)

1119
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,880
- I... - That's super crispy.

1120
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
(A bite)

1121
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,380
It's really crispy.

1122
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,649
(Yummy)

1123
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,720
I like how it's crispy.

1124
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,389
The sauce goes perfectly with it.

1125
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,920
(Flavors that bring joy)

1126
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,060
- This is really good. - Tell me about it.

1127
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,989
I wouldn't expect this...

1128
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,430
- from a fake restaurant. - Exactly.

1129
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
It seems like they worked hard to achieve this.

1130
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,999
- The pork cutlet is incredible. - I know.

1131
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,146
(It's real here! Pork cutlet from a master of the craft)

1132
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,699
I had forgotten about the rice ball.

1133
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,669
(They like the pork cutlet, so what about the rice ball?)

1134
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,700
It's warm.

1135
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,469
- It's warm. - It's steamed rice, isn't it?

1136
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,430
- It was warm when I caught it. - But it's sweet.

1137
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,549
(The stitch pattern on the baseball rice ball)

1138
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,349
(Sakura denbu: Japanese condiment made with white fish like pollack)

1139
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,620
(Sugar is added.)

1140
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,890
It's not his kind of flavor.

1141
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,719
(Smiling)

1142
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,159
Grandpa!

1143
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,130
- Grandpa. - He's not saying anything else.

1144
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,159
He stops talking if he's not that into it.

1145
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,830
(This isn't that nice.)

1146
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,429
I'm sorry, but this is who I am.

1147
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,039
Even though I shouldn't think out loud,

1148
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
I can't help myself.

1149
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,510
- That's who I am. - "This is who I am."

1150
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,739
Why the sudden self-reflection?

1151
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,610
(Sudden self-reflection during the meal)

1152
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,039
"This is who I am."

1153
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,450
That's my superpower.

1154
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,310
- Superpower? - Yes, superpower.

1155
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,920
I should've stopped myself, but I couldn't.

1156
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,919
I wouldn't mind for some Cheongyang chili.

1157
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,959
(Yet again, no lessons learned from self-reflection.)

1158
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,619
Anyway, this place...

1159
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,389
serves dishes themed around baseball,

1160
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,899
and we have to decide whether it really exists.

1161
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,030
This seems real to me.

1162
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,430
It seems real.

1163
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
This place has to be real.

1164
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:32,476
(Jae Seok and Mimi are certain the place exists.)

1165
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,099
This seems fake to me.

1166
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
(An opposite opinion)

1167
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,139
He said they had been open for two years.

1168
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,739
But the banners and signs don't seem like...

1169
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,150
they've been up for two years.

1170
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,050
I want to comment on this glove.

1171
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,779
It's way too new...

1172
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,526
- This looks too new. - for a two-year-old glove.

1173
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,149
It looks like they purposely...

1174
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,160
- scratched the glove. - The rice ball...

1175
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,959
Don't these scratches...

1176
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,389
- seem intentional? - Maybe it's just for practice.

1177
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,860
The scratches here look authentic.

1178
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,229
- You're not wrong. - You have a point.

1179
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,230
(Aren't I right?)

1180
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:04,130
- You have a point. - That's for your left hand.

1181
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,300
Oh, right.

1182
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,639
No wonder something seemed off.

1183
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,769
(Embarrassed)

1184
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,609
I bet you couldn't fit your hand in it.

1185
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,469
I'm sure you thought it was odd.

1186
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,040
How did you force your hand into this?

1187
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,279
(Scrunched)

1188
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,510
How did you even put it on?

1189
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,009
It took a weird shape just now.

1190
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,010
(She's quite the oddball as well.)

1191
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:20,449
- I bet that startled you. - I wasn't aware of that.

1192
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,096
- You haven't worn one before. - I haven't.

1193
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,019
Is this place real or not?

1194
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,319
(Owner with Puffy Cheeks: 1. A fitting baseball theme, )

1195
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,759
(2. Good quality of food, 3. Seems newly renovated)

1196
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,659
This must be downtown Daejeon.

1197
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,129
The streets are lively at night.

1198
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,130
(Heading off to meet the Owner with Explosive Cannons!)

1199
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,730
Is Sungsimdang near here?

1200
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,229
Sungsimdang? Hey, it's over there!

1201
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,670
Sungsangdong Boutique.

1202
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,569
- There's Sungsimdang. - There it is.

1203
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,300
The cake boutique.

1204
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,130
Aren't there a lot of people?

1205
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,180
- This is the place. - Their baked goods are tasty.

1206
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,849
(Those who bought baked goods...)

1207
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,179
They come to Daejeon...

1208
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,650
and line up outside this place to get their baked goods.

1209
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,920
(Sungsimdang Street)

1210
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Wait, what's this place?

1211
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:02,319
- This is also Sungsimdang. - They're all part of the franchise.

1212
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,659
Exactly. This is one of their bakeries.

1213
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
They own both bakeries on the left and right.

1214
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,600
(Starting with the cake boutique at the start of the street)

1215
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,170
(Sungsimdang Pizza)

1216
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,839
(Various Sungsimdang franchise shops line the street.)

1217
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,769
(Sandwiches, Italian, Western, )

1218
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,640
(Traditional tea, Multi-culture space)

1219
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,239
Did you know Sungsimdang...

1220
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,949
makes more profit than all the franchise bakeries...

1221
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,209
- in Korea? - That's true.

1222
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,379
They make more...

1223
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,549
than the entire P bakery franchise nationwide.

1224
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,819
(Hugely popular, the bakery is breaking sales records.)

1225
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,850
It's true.

1226
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,889
The line is usually long, but because it's raining today...

1227
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,159
- I see. - Really?

1228
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,589
Isn't this the original Sungsimdang bakery?

1229
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,159
- Is this it? - The original Sungsimdang bakery.

1230
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,689
(At the center of the street...)

1231
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,060
So this is Sungsimdang.

1232
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,200
(The original Sungsimdang)

1233
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,629
Look at all those people.

1234
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,500
(Even on a rainy morning, there's always a line.)

1235
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,439
(From the tiered siru cake covered in seasonal fruit...)

1236
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,570
(that's been blowing up on social media, )

1237
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:56,650
(to its signature baked goods that people buy in bulk)

1238
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,780
(The hottest spot, always filled with customers)

1239
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,620
(Reviews pour in on social media, with tips and receipts.)

1240
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,319
- This is the bakery capital. - Bakery capital.

1241
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,889
(The absolute must-do when you're in Daejeon)

1242
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,059
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1243
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,830
Sungsimdang opened in 1956.

1244
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,059
Who's older? You or the bakery?

1245
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,500
Think of us as peers.

1246
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,299
Really?

1247
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,070
Of course, the bakery's older.

1248
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,870
It's way older!

1249
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,169
It's been so long since I walked...

1250
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,269
around Eunhaeng-dong.

1251
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,179
- It's been about ten years for me. - Nice to meet you!

1252
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,479
- Hello. - Hi!

1253
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,910
- Hello. - Hello.

1254
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,210
- Hi. - Hello.

1255
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,919
This downtown area has a certain energy to it.

1256
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,049
- Tell me about it. - It's really lively here.

1257
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,720
- Lively. - It's lively, and I love it.

1258
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,990
Wait, there's a storage locker for baked goods!

1259
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,260
- Where? - The bread locker.

1260
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,859
It keeps them frozen.

1261
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,930
Does that really exist?

1262
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,160
- No way. - Who knew?

1263
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,159
This is the bakery capital for sure.

1264
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,330
- There's a bread locker. - How is this real?

1265
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,769
"Store baked goods. A dollar for three hours."

1266
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,000
How trendy is that?

1267
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,909
- How does this even work? - Let's go.

1268
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:58,910
(Let's check it out!)

1269
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:00,479
You can't carry buns around all day,

1270
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,740
and cakes melt easily.

1271
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,310
- Why is it so dark up here? - You can't carry buns around.

1272
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,620
It's downstairs.

1273
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,589
(Why is it so dark up here?)

1274
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,819
(It's downstairs!)

1275
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,089
Isn't this the place?

1276
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,359
No wonder it was so dark.

1277
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,120
How come none of you know what you're doing?

1278
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,206
Why did you lead the way without knowing where it was?

1279
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,460
I'm sorry, Mimi.

1280
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,329
No wonder it was so dark.

1281
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,100
Exactly. There's nothing up there.

1282
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,029
No wonder. That was hilarious.

1283
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,099
(They head downstairs to where the lockers actually are.)

1284
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,540
It was pitch black up there.

1285
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,170
I can already feel the cold air.

1286
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,940
It's cold down here.

1287
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,409
(Wow!)

1288
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,410
It's cool down here.

1289
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,109
- Are these all bread lockers? - Was it this huge?

1290
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:35,989
(The bread lockers they come across in the cool air)

1291
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,380
I can already feel the cold air.

1292
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,010
It's cold down here.

1293
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,449
(Exclaiming)

1294
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,480
It's cool down here.

1295
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,320
- Are these all bread lockers? - Was it this huge?

1296
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,619
No way.

1297
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,749
(A surprisingly large space just for bread lockers)

1298
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,890
It's huge.

1299
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,490
How is it this huge?

1300
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,889
It's cool down here.

1301
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:52,890
(A spacious area in the back too!)

1302
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:56,059
Did they set up a designated space for lockers to store bread and buns?

1303
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,159
Tell me about it.

1304
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,299
Some are refrigerated and some aren't.

1305
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,570
- How can this be? - It's like a giant fridge.

1306
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,039
This place is huge.

1307
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,269
It's really cold down here.

1308
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:07,069
It'd be the best place to be on a hot day.

1309
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,169
Yes, in the summer.

1310
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,580
- But it's cold today. - I know.

1311
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,879
We stored what we bought at Sungsimdang...

1312
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
- in lockers 136 and 140. - I see.

1313
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,449
The lock combination is Jae Seok's birthday.

1314
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,679
(Lock combination: 0814)

1315
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,720
- Only Seok Jin knows. - That's right.

1316
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,689
After today, I'll keep 0814 in mind.

1317
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,889
- Hold on. Where's number 136? - Number 136.

1318
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,890
- Right here. - Here it is.

1319
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:27,159
- Retrieve. - Go ahead.

1320
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,960
- Shouldn't we press "retrieve?" - Yes, that.

1321
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,630
Number 136.

1322
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,499
It's 0814.

1323
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,906
(Pressing the lock combination which is Jae Seok's birthday?)

1324
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,299
(The door opens!)

1325
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,740
Did it open? It did!

1326
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,909
(Bun-dora's Box...)

1327
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,810
(opens.)

1328
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,349
- It's siru cake. - It's like receiving presents.

1329
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,580
(Filled with fresh baked goods that were hidden!)

1330
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,949
These popular baked goods from Daejeon...

1331
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,266
(With the baked goods bought at Sungsimdang, )

1332
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,450
(walk for about a minute to a place just steps away.)

1333
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
After storing them here,

1334
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:59,036
- You can get out there again. - see the city some more.

1335
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,089
You can take them out...

1336
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,730
- right before you leave. - What an idea.

1337
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,330
It's hard to walk around with heavy bags.

1338
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,900
You can't carry them around...

1339
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,069
and also see the city.

1340
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,110
(A popular spot known to people on the bakery tour)

1341
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,939
There are a whole lot of things in there.

1342
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,940
(Getting the baked goods out of the locker)

1343
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:14,370
It's cool inside the locker too.

1344
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,839
Is it refrigerated?

1345
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,600
(Thanks to the lockers being refrigerated, )

1346
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,279
(the buns and cakes stay fresh.)

1347
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,610
- This is beautiful. - It's stunning!

1348
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,250
Check out the mandarins.

1349
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,950
This is fascinating.

1350
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,219
How could they have come up with this?

1351
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,249
(Now that we've been amazed, let's get back to the guessing!)

1352
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,419
I must say...

1353
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,129
- we're having a blast in Daejeon. - I know.

1354
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,529
But we need to guess which one isn't real.

1355
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,459
- We can't get it wrong today. - We can't get it wrong today.

1356
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,730
- This is... - I already did the penalty once.

1357
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,129
The first one is confusing.

1358
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,669
I think the first one is real.

1359
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,199
It seems real, right? I think so too.

1360
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,139
I had a few words with the owner...

1361
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,500
after the shooting was over and we were signing autographs.

1362
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
- Sir. - Yes?

1363
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:51,079
What's the trash bin for?

1364
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,039
When the empty bottles are left on the table,

1365
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,949
they sometimes fall and break.

1366
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,879
- So they put it in the bin. - Yes.

1367
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,280
- I see. - And they can drink more.

1368
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,089
- Because they break? - Yes, this is how we do it.

1369
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,249
(Is it real? A calm explanation as if he really runs the restaurant)

1370
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,419
Thank you.

1371
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,090
(Is the first place real?)

1372
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,719
Next is...

1373
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,889
- Explosive cannons. - Explosive cannons.

1374
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,460
I wonder what explosive cannons are.

1375
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,229
It's raining the whole day.

1376
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,259
It's really raining the whole day.

1377
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,370
Raining provides a nice atmosphere, though.

1378
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,169
- There are so many bars. - It's just a neighbor here.

1379
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,640
An apartment complex.

1380
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,169
Is there anything you can associate with cannons here?

1381
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,270
There's nothing much here.

1382
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,579
What is this?

1383
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,140
(Confused)

1384
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,679
I think we're here.

1385
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,040
- This is the place? - It must be.

1386
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,550
Let's go.

1387
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,020
Thank you.

1388
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,789
(They arrive at the second hip place.)

1389
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,850
Wait, this place...

1390
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,359
(Staring intently)

1391
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,759
It's just a residential area.

1392
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,120
- A residential area. - Come here.

1393
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,089
It really is just a residential area.

1394
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,159
For a popular place to be here, it's a residential area.

1395
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,830
(The second restaurant is located her?)

1396
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,399
Which direction do we go to?

1397
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,469
I think it's right here.

1398
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,670
It is here.

1399
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,010
It's here. It's an army stew shop.

1400
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,710
(An army stew restaurant located in a residential area)

1401
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,549
Is that why it's "cannon?"

1402
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,609
- Gold medal. - "Army?"

1403
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,620
"Army?"

1404
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,419
Military and army,

1405
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,750
- so it's cannon? - Army stew?

1406
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,489
That's why it's "explosive cannons?"

1407
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,536
(Is it "explosive cannons" because it reminds you of an army?)

1408
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,430
Sixth Sense likes dad jokes.

1409
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,089
(An MZ's cold remark)

1410
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,830
- It's... - "Sixth Sense likes dad jokes."

1411
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,900
(They enter the army stew restaurant.)

1412
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,270
This is...

1413
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,870
What's special about this place?

1414
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,199
Why is it...

1415
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,810
(Why is it called "explosive cannons?")

1416
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,010
(The interior looks ordinary.)

1417
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,180
What is it?

1418
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,379
I find stuff like this suspicious.

1419
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,380
- Me too. This is fake. - They look so fake.

1420
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,550
(What are "explosive cannons" supposed to be?)

1421
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,820
Look at this painting.

1422
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,260
- They make their own sausages. - I see.

1423
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,329
They're making sausages.

1424
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,560
You're right.

1425
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,399
It's an army stew restaurant,

1426
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,870
but not just an ordinary one.

1427
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:58,370
(Is it an army stew restaurant where they make their own sausages?)

1428
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,210
It looks a bit like Jae Seok.

1429
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,439
It looks a bit like Jae Seok.

1430
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,610
Seok Sam.

1431
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,320
Mr. Forearm Muscles today.

1432
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,449
Today...

1433
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,159
- They're so big. - I know, right?

1434
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,696
- It's like chicken drumstick. - Mr. Forearm Muscles.

1435
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,959
Mr. Forearm Muscles.

1436
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,559
I strongly recommend pull-up bars.

1437
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,899
It's very effective. It's great for your health too.

1438
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,229
I can't pull myself up.

1439
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,990
I can only try if I manage to get myself up.

1440
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,799
You can if you keep trying.

1441
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
(Laughing)

1442
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,816
- Yes, if you keep trying. - I don't want to keep trying.

1443
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,269
- You can if you keep trying. - I don't want to.

1444
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,070
Why are you guys so sassy?

1445
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,180
Have you tried something like this?

1446
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,580
Do this.

1447
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,909
- What's this? - You push.

1448
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,149
- You push. - What's this?

1449
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,250
You push like this.

1450
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,850
(Pressing)

1451
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,419
It hurts so much.

1452
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,940
That's exactly why you do it. Darn it.

1453
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,889
Why do you do this for?

1454
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,136
(Why do you do it when it hurts?)

1455
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,459
- I think it's an acupoint. - I thought it wouldn't hurt.

1456
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,789
Why do you do it when it hurts both of you?

1457
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,930
You lose when you pull away.

1458
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,530
Try it, Seok Jin.

1459
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,829
- It's very painful. - It's so sharp.

1460
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,269
Since I did this side...

1461
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,840
It's so sharp.

1462
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,540
(Slapping)

1463
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,739
(Pained moan)

1464
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,340
(Slapping)

1465
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,839
(Pot calling the kettle black)

1466
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
What?

1467
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,010
It hurts!

1468
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,080
That's how you play.

1469
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,410
Why would you rub it?

1470
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,549
- You should just push gently. - This is how you play.

1471
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,019
- Don't do this. - He's so mischievous.

1472
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,250
This is so funny.

1473
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,790
(Anyway...)

1474
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,889
- I think it's real here. - Here...

1475
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,820
But the interior design is a bit...

1476
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,030
- like a pub. - I mean...

1477
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,329
The only thing that gets on my nerves is...

1478
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,200
that the interior design is too artificial.

1479
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,699
(Speaking of which, something feels off.)

1480
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,829
That picture.

1481
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,239
Did they paint on the wall or...

1482
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,499
- They painted it. - It's painted.

1483
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,916
(A random Western-style mural that doesn't suit an army stew shop)

1484
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:44,340
(Somewhat unnatural-looking props)

1485
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,809
(A picture and gold medals...)

1486
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,049
(displayed as if to show off)

1487
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,619
I think it used to be a pub,

1488
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,950
and the staff changed it into this.

1489
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:58,090
(Seok Jin's observation: The interior looks like a pub.)

1490
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,059
Could the staff have drawn the mural for the show?

1491
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,689
- Yes, they could have. - Really?

1492
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,429
- But for that to be the case, - The bottom...

1493
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,299
- Hello. - it's very...

1494
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,930
- Gosh, hello. - Hello, sir.

1495
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,599
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1496
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,700
Hello.

1497
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:13,509
He is the same owner as the one in the picture.

1498
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,810
He is.

1499
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,409
(When compared to the picture, it is the owner himself.)

1500
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,049
Did you win an award in Germany?

1501
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,209
Yes, I did.

1502
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:25,680
I won gold medal in Germany's Global Meat Product Awards.

1503
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,619
(IFFA Meat Processing Exhibition: A global exhibition...)

1504
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,920
(held once every 3 years in Frankfurt, Germany)

1505
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,730
(He won the award in a competition held in Germany?)

1506
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,929
(Is he an award-winning sausage expert?)

1507
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,029
Sir, we were told that your restaurant...

1508
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,629
was "explosive cannons."

1509
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,070
Why is it called that?

1510
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,370
Will you look at the painting and imagine?

1511
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,869
I'll show you something amazing soon.

1512
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,280
I'll show you.

1513
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,080
(What?)

1514
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,150
I'll show you.

1515
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,180
I think he's fake. He's too...

1516
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,280
(Leaving quickly)

1517
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,449
The owner seems a bit strange.

1518
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,920
I think he practiced for this.

1519
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,960
- He's so.. - He seems awkward.

1520
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,090
What if he serves awkwardly too?

1521
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,660
He left very quickly.

1522
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,706
- He left as if he was running away. - It's a bit...

1523
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,900
The picture stuck here...

1524
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,230
looks fake too.

1525
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,140
(Thinking)

1526
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,870
- Here's the basic setting. - Okay.

1527
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,539
Do you always speak brightly?

1528
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,780
Yes.

1529
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,379
- Special guests came today. - Thank you.

1530
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,910
So more than usual,

1531
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,510
I'm excited.

1532
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,180
Thank you.

1533
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,279
I understand.

1534
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,049
- I see. - I understand.

1535
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,520
The owner seems weird.

1536
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,159
(Laughing)

1537
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,690
- He's acting so unnatural. - It's so unnatural.

1538
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,590
He's so unnatural.

1539
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,230
- Here's the army stew. - Army stew...

1540
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,899
Are these sausages the ones you made here yourself?

1541
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,600
Of course. I made them myself.

1542
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,439
(Germany)

1543
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,010
Germany has the best sausages.

1544
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,069
So I underwent training in Germany.

1545
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,856
(The owner trained in Germany, the home of ham sausages)

1546
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,410
(German-style handmade sausages landed in Korea!)

1547
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:05,349
I add handmade German sausages in army stew.

1548
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:09,150
You can have fresh ham sausage in my army stew restaurant.

1549
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,530
(Grinding and mincing raw meat)

1550
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:19,760
(He even makes his own special sauce.)

1551
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,169
The army stew has...

1552
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,070
five different hams.

1553
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,009
Thüringer Wurst from Thuringia.

1554
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,140
Bockwurst from Berlin.

1555
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,180
Nuremberg sausage.

1556
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,679
I only selected the sausages that Koreans like.

1557
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,280
(Special army stew with German sausages)

1558
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,190
(You can taste Germany as you eat army stew!)

1559
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,929
The sausages sure are different from the typical army stew ones.

1560
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,459
- They're different. - They are different indeed.

1561
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,830
(New type of army stew)

1562
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,599
By "explosive cannons,"

1563
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,259
maybe they meant that. "Vulcan Cannon Set for Two."

1564
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,600
You're right.

1565
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,370
(Vulcan Cannon Set for 2, Vulcan Cannon Set for 3)
(Vulcan Cannon Set for 4)

1566
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,340
(Army stew with a suspicious name?)

1567
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,909
- There must be a performance. - There must be something.

1568
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,310
Calling it "Vulcan cannon..."

1569
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,209
They're all handmade? How much is it?

1570
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,079
- I think we got 2 sets for 2. - It's expensive.

1571
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,950
Sir, is this a set for two?

1572
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,090
Squad, attention!

1573
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,250
Squad, attention!

1574
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,959
(What?)

1575
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,460
(Surprised)

1576
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,630
Attention!

1577
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,930
(Following the order)

1578
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,130
"Squad, attention?"

1579
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,729
It's a cannon.

1580
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,869
Vulcan cannon?

1581
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,900
(Vulcan cannon?)

1582
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,339
(The identity of Owner with Explosive Cannons...)

1583
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,100
(which was hidden until now)

1584
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,140
(Vulcan cannon raw ham)

1585
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,050
(Owner with Explosive Cannons, Vulcan cannon)

1586
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,620
It's a cannon. Vulcan cannon.

1587
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,719
This must be their selling point.

1588
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,789
It looks fake.

1589
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,520
Present arms.

1590
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,189
(I'm flustered.)

1591
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,390
I will now fire...

1592
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,590
the Vulcan cannon.

1593
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,300
(Eyes opened wide)

1594
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,029
Vulcan cannon.

1595
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,330
Fire.

1596
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,130
(A cute sound effect that doesn't suit the Vulcan cannon)

1597
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,440
I make fresh raw German sausage every day.

1598
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,709
I squeeze it into army stew directly.

1599
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,179
And it is cooked on the spot.

1600
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,850
This is my restaurant's signature menu.

1601
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,190
(Vulcan cannon raw ham)

1602
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,190
We put handmade raw ham into the Vulcan cannon...

1603
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,059
and squeeze it directly into army stew.

1604
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,990
We're a very special army stew restaurant.

1605
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,669
I got the inspiration from painting in Germany...

1606
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,629
which depicted people making sausages.

1607
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,840
That's how I came up with Vulcan cannon army stew.

1608
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:44,340
(He developed his own Vulcan cannon for raw ham.)

1609
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,149
Monthly sales is over 35,000 dollars.

1610
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,249
(Monthly sales is over 35,000 dollars!)

1611
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,619
If you don't know this place, you're missing out.

1612
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,949
Not many in Daejeon know this place either.

1613
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,550
(The unique way of squeezing the ham out of the Vulcan cannon...)

1614
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,789
(made the restaurant go viral on social media.)

1615
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,889
(Vulcan cannon raw ham)

1616
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,830
(Vulcan cannon army stew)

1617
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,489
Sixth Sense members,

1618
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,160
is this place real?

1619
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,230
Since we have special guests today,

1620
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,700
I'll give you the chance to squeeze it out yourselves.

1621
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,339
We have Mr. Forearm Muscles here.

1622
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,470
He has strong forearms.

1623
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,409
Fire!

1624
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,509
You came on the right day.

1625
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,550
- Show us. - Mr. Forearm Muscles...

1626
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,709
You came on the right day.

1627
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,579
I'll let you eat as much as...

1628
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,620
you squeeze out.

1629
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,949
Here's the handle.

1630
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,289
Did you make the ham in the morning?

1631
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,849
Yes, I make it fresh every day.

1632
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,720
Present arms.

1633
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,690
Salute.

1634
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,390
Salute.

1635
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,799
- Shoot to the middle. - Mr. Forearm Muscles.

1636
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,259
- He... - Vulcan cannon raw ham,

1637
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,329
- locked and loaded. - Fire.

1638
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,499
Fire forward.

1639
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,070
(Firing)

1640
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,570
It's coming out smoothly.

1641
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,370
It's my first time trying raw ham.

1642
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,340
It's raw ham.

1643
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,639
Mr. Forearm Muscles.

1644
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,879
(His forearm muscles are at work.)

1645
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,510
- Mr. Forearm Muscles. - Muscles.

1646
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,279
- You're squeezing out a lot. - That's enough, Forearm Muscles.

1647
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,390
- There'll be nothing left. - That's enough.

1648
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,489
You worked out for years to do this.

1649
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,190
Okay.

1650
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,720
(His forearm muscles show ends neatly.)

1651
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,190
Sir, did you make the machine yourself?

1652
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,959
To make this,

1653
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,160
I went around Hwanghak-dong Flea Market...

1654
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,269
- for many days. - You made it yourself?

1655
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,330
Yes, I made it myself.

1656
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,139
I made it all myself...

1657
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,000
to its optimum state.

1658
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,269
It already smells good.

1659
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,739
It smells so good.

1660
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,439
It's going to be so delicious.

1661
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,916
(They can already tell it'll be delicious.)

1662
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,680
(It looks great too.)

1663
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,279
This...

1664
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,580
Strangely, everything feels real today.

1665
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,150
Right?

1666
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,390
It inflated.

1667
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,090
You're right. As it gets cooked...

1668
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,189
(Opening Vulcan cannon army stew)

1669
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,489
Isn't this beef tripe jeongol?

1670
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,699
- It looks so delicious. - It does look like it.

1671
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,829
It looks so tasty.

1672
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,830
(Beef tripe jeongol?)

1673
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,100
(The raw ham fired by the Vulcan cannon inflated...)

1674
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,570
(to become as thick as beef tripe.)

1675
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,419
- It's fascinating. - It's fascinating.

1676
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,789
- It's raw ham. - It inflates.

1677
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,349
It inflates. My gosh.

1678
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:11,459
- It really looks like beef tripe. - It looks real.

1679
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,889
- Let's eat. - Look at that.

1680
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,030
- It's amazing. - Looks like it's about to explode.

1681
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,500
It's my first time trying this.

1682
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,929
- I wonder how it tastes. - Let's try it.

1683
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,229
(Taking a bite straight away)

1684
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,069
- I wonder how it tastes. - Let's try it.

1685
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,470
(Impressed)

1686
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,140
- Is it good? - It's so tasty.

1687
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,440
(Agreeing wholeheartedly)

1688
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,650
It's so good. Right?

1689
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,420
(Taking a bite)

1690
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,950
Since it's raw ham,

1691
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,659
there's nothing wrapped around it.

1692
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,060
- It's soft. - It's soft.

1693
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,629
It's so much softer than the ham we know,

1694
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,060
and it's less salty, so it's good.

1695
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,699
(The ham is much softer and light.)

1696
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,769
- Isn't it delicious? - Yes.

1697
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,339
- It's like silken tofu. - It's so good.

1698
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,099
It's so savory and nice.

1699
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,820
- It's so good. - It has a great fragrance.

1700
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,879
The taste at the end is amazing.

1701
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,110
Would you like some soup?

1702
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,780
Come here.

1703
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,280
Seok Jin.

1704
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,549
(Moving forward and back)

1705
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,779
(U-turn)

1706
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,789
(Laughing)

1707
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,390
- Soup... - You have it in front of you.

1708
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,759
The soup...

1709
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,020
(Adhering to traffic laws)

1710
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,600
(She can't stop laughing.)

1711
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,229
It's very healthy ham.

1712
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,430
- Right? - Yes.

1713
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,859
The ham isn't processed much.

1714
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,099
Raw ham...

1715
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,270
has its charms.

1716
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:28,830
This is amazing.

1717
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,069
For those who had a drink yesterday,

1718
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,440
this is perfect for hangover.

1719
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,409
It's delicious.

1720
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,109
- It's so delicious. - It's very delicious.

1721
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,239
It's so good.

1722
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,480
- This place must be real. - Is the business doing well?

1723
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,779
Shall I add ramyeon noodles?

1724
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,380
Gosh, add... Add it in.

1725
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,989
- He's been waiting for this. - Yes.

1726
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,449
If there's no ramyeon in army stew...

1727
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,520
He won't even eat it.

1728
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,119
It's perfect now.

1729
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,730
(Ramyeon noodles in army stew is all about timing.)

1730
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,160
(Right now)

1731
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,500
- I don't think that's the case. - Right.

1732
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,970
If you get the set for 4, it's 11 dollars more expensive.

1733
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,280
It's delicious.

1734
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,810
It's so good.

1735
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,510
(Glancing)

1736
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:17,619
Jae Seok.

1737
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,979
You eat so well.

1738
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,890
It's a grasshopper eating show.

1739
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,650
(Frustrated)

1740
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,189
- This... - What?

1741
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,260
It's a necklace.

1742
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,400
(Laughing)

1743
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,760
- Why don't you trade with this? - With this?

1744
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,030
(Raw ham over pearls)

1745
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,799
Raw ham is so delicious.

1746
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,309
The soup. I think the owner has his own know-hows.

1747
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,770
- Right? - Right?

1748
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,750
I don't think even top tier chefs can make it taste this good.

1749
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,550
This place is real.

1750
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,610
It has to be real.

1751
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,049
MZers would like it too, right?

1752
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,949
- Definitely. - MZers would love it.

1753
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,350
- They would like it, right? - Yes.

1754
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,420
Why do you always seek MZer's approval?

1755
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,460
- I... - Why?

1756
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:04,360
I try to be like them.

1757
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,660
- Mr. 486. Why do you... - Don't you know?

1758
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,429
- Mr. 486. - Don't you know my character?

1759
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,770
- I try to be like them. - You're trying way too hard.

1760
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,199
It's super delicious.

1761
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,039
This is the best army stew I've had recently.

1762
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,340
Me too. This is the best I've had this year.

1763
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,140
- It's really delicious. - Yes.

1764
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,509
It's so delicious.

1765
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,430
- It's so good. - The army stew here is amazing.

1766
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,149
Normally, only those who process sausages...

1767
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,620
get the chance to eat raw ham.

1768
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,989
- Really? - It's a very precious experience.

1769
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,990
(Glaring)

1770
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,090
You're saying this at a strange timing.

1771
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,530
- We... - I feel...

1772
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,659
Since we're getting fooled...

1773
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,499
Are they trying to trick us?

1774
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,660
- Did they throw the final punch? - They seem a bit...

1775
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,129
- It's like, "You took the bait." - It's a bit...

1776
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,270
- Right? - Yes.

1777
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,380
- "You took the bait." - The timing was...

1778
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,569
Sir, let's talk.

1779
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,570
(He's not angry.)

1780
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,340
Sir.

1781
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,350
(Smiling)

1782
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,250
Sir, is this handmade sausage?

1783
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,550
Yes, it is.

1784
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,879
- Did you make it yourself? - Yes, I did.

1785
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,849
The taste and the filling inside...

1786
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:02,889
(They definitely are handmade sausages.)

1787
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,759
- Something feels suspicious, right? - Eating this with suspicions...

1788
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,230
makes this ham feel like it's not handmade.

1789
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,359
Just the beef tripe-looking ham is handmade.

1790
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,659
These might be factory-made.

1791
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,330
Can you say this after the owner leaves?

1792
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,569
(Speaking through his clenched teeth)

1793
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,999
(On pins and needles)

1794
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,040
I'm sorry.

1795
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,069
- Hey. - He went back.

1796
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,610
The owner was right there.

1797
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,179
- Sir. - I concluded that it was fake.

1798
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,209
Before, he went in with light footsteps.

1799
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,479
Now, he went in with heavy footsteps.

1800
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,550
- Ji Hoon. - I'm sorry.

1801
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,779
- I was so sure. - You're so...

1802
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,020
- Right in front of him. - If the owner is real...

1803
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,519
I made the same mistake last time,

1804
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,319
but I whispered at least.

1805
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,660
You were so loud.

1806
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,059
He has great vocalization.

1807
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,100
- This is so hard. - It's hard.

1808
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,130
- This is hard. - This is a bit...

1809
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,770
For the first episode,

1810
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,299
- everything seemed fake. - They all seemed fake.

1811
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,840
- But today, everything seems real. - Today, it all feels real.

1812
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,579
We can only decide...

1813
01:03:58,580 --> 01:03:59,909
after the last place.

1814
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:00,979
Let's go.

1815
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,210
(Owner with Explosive Cannons)

1816
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,350
- We're going to the last place. - Yes.

1817
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,950
Owner Full of Intelligence.

1818
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,066
What do you think of the last place? Real or fake?

1819
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,366
- Everything until now seems real. - Right? They all seem real.

1820
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:13,319
The first episode was hard because everything looked fake.

1821
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,429
- Exactly. This week... - They all look real.

1822
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,160
(This week's places all look real.)

1823
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:24,140
(Suddenly showing off his biceps)

1824
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,799
- You must work out a lot. - Of course I do.

1825
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,910
- Did Seok Jin show off his arm? - Yes.

1826
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,509
(Jae Seok can predict Seok Jin's every action.)

1827
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,040
- He did this. - How did you know?

1828
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,979
I can't do pull-up bars. Not once.

1829
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,249
Because you don't have strong back muscles.

1830
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,279
Is that so?

1831
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,719
Pushing uses your chest muscles.

1832
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,149
Pulling uses your back muscles.

1833
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,150
I see. That's why I can't do it.

1834
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:43,689
Now you know.

1835
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,660
(Teasing him)

1836
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,990
When you want to gently touch an annoying junior,

1837
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,099
- if you have strong back muscles... - When you hit someone,

1838
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,820
- you use your back muscles a lot. - Right?

1839
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,430
I must do a lot of pull-up bar.

1840
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:57,539
- Mr. Forearm Muscles. - When you want to...

1841
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,069
- When you hit someone. - When you scold him.

1842
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,269
Darn you, Forearm Muscles.

1843
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,409
(Traveling happily with Mr. Forearm Muscles)

1844
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:04,440
Ji Hye and Ji Hoon.

1845
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,379
People like them are born with the faces to become celebrities.

1846
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,509
- Yes. - They were born to be one.

1847
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,579
I've been acting for more than 20 years now.

1848
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,550
Your face isn't important.

1849
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,850
What do you mean?

1850
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,660
Do you know why you have that thought?

1851
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,589
Because you've lived with that face your entire life.

1852
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:20,590
- Exactly. - Exactly.

1853
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:22,529
Because you've lived with your face for 20 years.

1854
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,460
You're handsome too, Kyung Pyo.

1855
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,259
I'm so jealous. "You're handsome too."

1856
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,670
Why won't you say that to us?

1857
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,139
(You're handsome too)

1858
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,970
(I'm a mess)

1859
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:35,569
My goodness.

1860
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,739
(They're laughing too hard.)

1861
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,840
Goodness.

1862
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,150
- Ji Hye, how did you debut? - Me?

1863
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,379
I was scouted on the street.

1864
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,780
- See that? - Scouted on the street.

1865
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,149
- They shine. - Exactly.

1866
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,420
They don't need to go to the agencies themselves.

1867
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,019
Some people are meant to be.

1868
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,419
Ji Hye, where were you scouted?

1869
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,860
- In Dongdaemun. - In Dongdaemun?

1870
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,629
In the midst of that busy crowd,

1871
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,260
- you stood out. - Gosh, no.

1872
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,799
I got lucky on the way.

1873
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,069
If it was luck,

1874
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:04,069
- Seok Jin or I should've gotten it. - Of course.

1875
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,269
But not once.

1876
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,169
- We went to Dongdaemun so often. - We went there so often.

1877
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:08,769
(They frequented Dongdaemun so many times.)

1878
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,769
Frequency-wise, you went there once in a while.

1879
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,679
Yes. When someone hands us something,

1880
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,550
it's a flyer promoting a new beer pub.

1881
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:16,609
- We got a lot of those. - Tissue paper.

1882
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,950
Either that, or I'm being mugged.

1883
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,549
(Handing over money instead of getting scouted)

1884
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,319
- Mugged? - Have you been mugged before?

1885
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,419
I have.

1886
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,390
It was pretty bad back in the days.

1887
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,529
- Didn't you have that in your time? - I did.

1888
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,029
- Have you been mugged? - If you go to...

1889
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,389
Cheongpyeonghwa Market in Dongdaemun...

1890
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,399
- You definitely get ripped off. - Really?

1891
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,599
- They will force you to buy stuff. - Yes. They ripped you off so badly.

1892
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,399
You bring money to buy clothes.

1893
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,669
- They force you to buy stuff. - A scary looking man calls you.

1894
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,950
"Walking around will only tire your legs out. Come here."

1895
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,739
- Yes. - That's incredible.

1896
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,210
"You look good in it. Buy this."

1897
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,240
You have to buy it.

1898
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,649
You get clothes for that at least.

1899
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,850
I sometimes just gave them money for nothing in return.

1900
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,180
Without even getting clothes.

1901
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,820
"Your shoes look nice."

1902
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,149
"Yes, my mom bought it for me."

1903
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,889
He already sounds weak. "My mom bought it."

1904
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,319
(What he says already shows how weak he is.)

1905
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,219
- "Take it off." - They'll take it from you? My gosh.

1906
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,159
- He'll trade it with his shoes. - Oh, dear.

1907
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,229
It was quite romantic compared to now.

1908
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,700
He gave you his pair of shoes.

1909
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,760
(Snorting)

1910
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,899
- He is concerned about his way... - Yes.

1911
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,069
Back home. He gave us a ticket.

1912
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,590
- So you could take a bus home. - So you could take a bus home.

1913
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,769
Did you have this when you were a student?

1914
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,679
I watched the movie "Wish."

1915
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,210
The guys from different schools fought each other.

1916
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,649
- Did you have that? The top dogs? - Even if they did have it,

1917
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,419
we wouldn't be in the group.

1918
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,979
We weren't involved. It's a completely different world.

1919
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,689
We hear from others that things like that happened.

1920
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,820
- Like a folklore. - That's it.

1921
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,060
Had they taken us, the team would've looked weak.

1922
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:35,989
Had we stood there...

1923
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,990
(The weak duo)

1924
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:39,031
the team would've looked weak despite more members.

1925
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,300
(Where could be Owner Full of Intelligence?)

1926
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,769
This is the city of science.

1927
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:45,076
- KAIST is here, right? - It's here.

1928
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,369
KAIST is very close.

1929
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,570
- From here? - We came all the way to KAIST.

1930
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:49,909
KAIST.

1931
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:51,239
(The best science university in Korea, KAIST...)

1932
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,839
Daedeok Research and Development Complex is to our right.

1933
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,986
(and the center of science industry, Daedeok Innopolis are nearby.)

1934
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,680
Owner Full of Intelligence is...

1935
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,190
Owner Full of Intelligence?

1936
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,696
Will we get food only if we answer a question?

1937
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,090
I don't know what it is.

1938
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,949
- Do we go that way? - Wait. Isn't it to our left?

1939
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,189
- This is the place. - No way.

1940
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,729
What? There's a poster of Orbit.

1941
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:08,890
- Orbit. - Orbit?

1942
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,500
- The science YouTuber. - I know who he is.

1943
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,799
That's Jeon In Kwon.

1944
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,776
(Are the posters of Orbit and Jeon In Kwon on the wall?)

1945
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,200
- That isn't Jeon In Kwon. - That's Jeon In Kwon.

1946
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,240
He's a different person.

1947
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,539
"Science is sexy?"

1948
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,569
(Yi Jeong Mo, Science YouTuber and director of a science museum)

1949
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:23,769
What's this place? A cafe?

1950
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,880
(Is this place a cafe?)

1951
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,179
It's a cafe.

1952
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,210
(They go inside.)

1953
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,780
(My goodness)

1954
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,809
It's so funny today.

1955
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,879
- Every place looks real. - Every place looks real.

1956
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,979
This place is real.

1957
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,090
(What does it look like?)

1958
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,060
(You pass by the suspicious wall...)

1959
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,430
(and enter the cafe.)

1960
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,999
(There are mysterious items on display...)

1961
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,399
(as well as a robot, )

1962
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,569
(a dinosaur, )

1963
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:50,700
(and a rocket.)

1964
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,840
(There are numerous fascinating items...)

1965
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,380
(and mysterious menu items that'll be revealed soon.)

1966
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:02,450
(Is this place real?)

1967
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,150
You can't make up a place like this.

1968
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,779
- This place is real. - I think this place is real.

1969
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,780
This place is real.

1970
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:08,249
How will you display an item like this...

1971
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,589
for a fake place?

1972
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,726
You can't get an item like this.

1973
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,259
It's an old diving equipment.

1974
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,430
(A helmet divers used in the past)

1975
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,160
This place is so fascinating.

1976
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,930
It's a model of KF-21.

1977
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,269
(KF-21 is the 5th generation fighter aircraft...)

1978
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,946
(that has been made with Korean technology.)

1979
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,840
- No way. It's sudoku. - Sudoku.

1980
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,809
- The toilet paper has sudoku. - The toilet paper has sudoku.

1981
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,309
- This is incredible. - It's a good idea.

1982
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,870
This place is incredible. It's fun.

1983
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,680
They also have this item.

1984
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,879
- What is it? - A metal ball rolls...

1985
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,719
and draws a design on the sand.

1986
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,979
(It's a kinetic sand where a metal ball draws on the sand.)

1987
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,979
If you set a design,

1988
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,619
- the metal ball rolls slowly... - It draws the design.

1989
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,620
And draws the design.

1990
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,960
(Albert Einstein)

1991
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,630
There are so many nice places in Daejeon.

1992
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,860
If this place isn't a cafe, it's fake.

1993
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,269
(They look for evidence of the place being fake.)

1994
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,300
This is...

1995
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,670
Guess how much this artwork is.

1996
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,369
- How much is it? - It's 2,200 dollars.

1997
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,639
(They find an artwork on sale.)

1998
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,879
That's the world of art.

1999
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,050
(Why are they selling an artwork at a cafe?)

2000
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,049
Maybe this is a place that sells artworks, not a cafe.

2001
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,449
A gallery.

2002
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,696
(Is it a fake cafe that's originally a gallery?)

2003
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,989
- It isn't a cafe. - Seriously.

2004
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,990
Right?

2005
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,189
- Let's sit here. - Okay.

2006
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,220
(Is this place real?)

2007
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,630
- But this place is real. - This place is real.

2008
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,460
It can't be fake.

2009
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,329
- What? - Hello.

2010
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:28,099
- Hello. - Hello.

2011
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,199
(Owner Full of Intelligence appears.)

2012
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,669
- Hello. - He has the air of science.

2013
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,140
(He has the air of science.)

2014
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,769
Sir, what is this place?

2015
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:39,680
This place is a science cafe.

2016
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,610
A science cafe?

2017
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,979
This is a science cafe...

2018
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:48,250
where you can feel science with your five senses.

2019
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:52,520
Anyone can feel science with a single cup of coffee...

2020
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:57,060
and check how tasty science is in this spacetime.

2021
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:59,560
There are various items on display.

2022
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,970
And you can read books in a relaxed manner.

2023
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,170
You can enjoy the science culture in this spacetime.

2024
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:10,269
The concept of a science cafe is widespread...

2025
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,840
in foreign countries.

2026
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,479
I checked how things were in Korea...

2027
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,186
and saw that there weren't any science cafes.

2028
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:19,419
That was how I made one.

2029
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,396
(The frustrated science enthusiast built a science cafe.)

2030
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,689
In a single day, we get...

2031
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,259
about 300 to 400 visitors...

2032
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,959
and make a profit of a four-digit number.

2033
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,320
(The reviews recommend the place.)

2034
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:31,759
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

2035
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,840
(Is Owner Full of Intelligence's science cafe real?)

2036
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,030
For how long have you run this cafe?

2037
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,540
I've run it for about three years.

2038
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,869
Did you attend KAIST?

2039
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,809
At times, I give...

2040
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,780
a special lecture at KAIST.

2041
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,710
Do you give a special lecture?

2042
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,160
Does that mean he's a professor?

2043
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,320
What did you major in?

2044
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,450
I majored in mechanical engineering.

2045
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:56,219
Mechanical engineering.

2046
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,060
(It's an unusual background for a cafe owner.)

2047
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,889
Are all the items on display yours?

2048
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,559
There are items I've collected over the course of 20 years.

2049
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,059
(Science items he has collected in the past 20 years)

2050
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,399
We also hold exhibitions.

2051
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,199
When that happens, artists lend...

2052
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,740
- their works. - You hold exhibitions.

2053
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,700
What are some rare items?

2054
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,469
There was the first man to travel into space,

2055
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,710
- Yuri Gagarin. - Yes.

2056
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,279
There's an autographed copy of his autobiography.

2057
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,350
(His autograph is here.)

2058
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:26,380
(The first man to travel into space)

2059
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,019
He was a Soviet cosmonaut.

2060
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,720
(The first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin)

2061
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:30,949
- That's... - How fascinating.

2062
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:31,990
Is it his own handwriting?

2063
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,830
It's an autograph in his own handwriting.

2064
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:40,030
(An autograph that contains the breath of a cosmonaut)

2065
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,799
It's in Russian.

2066
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,670
- It's a book. - It's an autobiography.

2067
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,939
"I worked this hard and traveled into space."

2068
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,540
That's what the book is about.

2069
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:50,239
It sounds like you haven't read it yet.

2070
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,909
You're right. It's in Russian.

2071
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,080
(I can't believe him.)

2072
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,850
It's in Russian.

2073
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,510
He's sharp.

2074
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:57,710
For goodness' sake.

2075
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,920
That's for safekeeping.

2076
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,819
We haven't seen Yuri Gagarin's autograph...

2077
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,159
to know whether or not it's authentic.

2078
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,160
But this is...

2079
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,589
It's Yuri Gagarin. This man is Yuri Gagarin.

2080
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,876
- That's right. - He was so young.

2081
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,300
(Yuri Gagarin in his boyhood)

2082
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,930
(Staring)

2083
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,130
He was too young.

2084
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,069
- He was so young. - He was too young.

2085
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:23,470
- That's from his childhood. - It's his autobiography.

2086
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,856
He didn't travel into space at that age.

2087
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,210
Mimi, we had the same thought just now.

2088
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,349
- Right? - Seriously.

2089
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,880
- I was so startled. - Same here.

2090
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,989
I'm sure it's the only one in Korea.

2091
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,260
- I bet. - Yes.

2092
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,360
How did you get it?

2093
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,300
I bought it in Russia through an auction.

2094
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,799
- How much was it? - How much was it?

2095
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,800
If we may ask...
(Hesitant)

2096
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:47,881
It was a five-digit number.

2097
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,130
One, ten, hundred, thousand... Tens of thousands of dollars.

2098
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,469
- Yes. It was around that number. - It was around that number.

2099
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:55,640
(It was around that number.)

2100
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:57,170
Where was the auction house?

2101
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:01,679
I don't remember the location of the auction house.

2102
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,760
- You don't remember. - No.

2103
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,820
(Don't you remember?)

2104
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,720
(He participated in an auction, but he doesn't remember.)

2105
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,360
(Is his story real?)

2106
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:15,529
There are unique menu items that made this cafe popular.

2107
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:16,730
- Really? - Yes.

2108
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,660
They give you a scientific culinary experience.

2109
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,870
- A scientific culinary experience? - Yes.

2110
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,200
I guess we get something like the laboratory equipment.

2111
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,999
(A cup of coffee...)

2112
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,910
(with a spoonful of science)

2113
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:32,640
(A fun science lesson you learn as you drink)

2114
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,350
(A dessert that pays homage to nature)

2115
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,549
(The special menu items of the science cafe...)

2116
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:39,750
(are coming soon.)

2117
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,389
This place can't be fake.

2118
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,419
It's impossible.

2119
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,519
- These decorations can't be fake. - Seok Jin,

2120
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,220
did you get chased by a group of zombies?

2121
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,830
(Zombies?)

2122
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,800
It's fashion.

2123
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,170
(Jae Seok found another thing to tease him about.)

2124
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:58,269
- You don't know, do you? - The gap will widen with time.

2125
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,570
It's fashion.

2126
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,439
- It's cool. - You don't wear such a T-shirt.

2127
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,639
- No, I don't. - I...

2128
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,209
Are you not wearing anything underneath?

2129
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,210
No.

2130
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,110
- May I stick in my finger once? - No.

2131
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,109
- It's my bare skin. - How secretive.

2132
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,309
It really is your bare skin.

2133
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,550
The hole barely avoids showing your nipple.

2134
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:15,450
That's design.

2135
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,219
- Is that design? - That's the power of design.

2136
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,589
- It wasn't made haphazardly. - Okay.

2137
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,589
- The designer thought about it. - It reflects the designer's idea.

2138
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,690
Of course.

2139
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,359
Do you ask your stylist to get you clothes of certain vibes?

2140
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,400
No, I don't.

2141
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,830
- I ask her to make me look young. - You want to look young.

2142
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,269
(He's obsessed with looking young.)

2143
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:33,369
You want to be like a Gen Zer.

2144
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:36,139
- I want to be like a Gen Zer. - That's a difficult request.

2145
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,469
That's the secret behind not reaching the 60s.

2146
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,440
Of course. I'll never reach the 60s.

2147
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,080
If you want to look really young, wear a diaper only.

2148
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:46,620
(Drastic)

2149
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:51,990
(A fashion that suits his aesthetics)

2150
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:53,260
Wear a diaper only.

2151
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,460
A stroller.

2152
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,360
(Chasing after youth makes him run out of breath.)

2153
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,630
Ride a stroller instead of a Carnival.

2154
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,430
(Laughing)

2155
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,410
"Instead of a Carnival."

2156
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,510
Use a pacifier as well.

2157
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,639
Use a pacifier and make your manager push...

2158
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,850
(A stroller and a pacifier)

2159
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:19,320
(Seok Jin's work fashion)

2160
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,220
- You're too much. - How am I too much?

2161
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,130
- You'll look very young. - Yes, you'll look very young.

2162
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,520
Seriously.

2163
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,430
You'll look very young.

2164
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,990
Ride a stroller.

2165
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:33,460
You're laughing in an elegant way.

2166
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,569
She's doubling over, but you don't hear a sound.

2167
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,429
- Ji Hye... - She's doubling over,

2168
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:38,769
- Ji Hye is noble. - but you don't...

2169
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,799
- You don't hear a sound. - No.

2170
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,770
You don't hear a sound of her laughter.

2171
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,339
(Jae Seok notices a plushie.)

2172
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,940
It looks like Seok Jin.

2173
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,679
(The teasing begins once more.)

2174
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,710
It has a long nose.

2175
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,949
(They look strangely similar.)

2176
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,880
Hey, that's an alien.

2177
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,720
Hey, that's a mouth.

2178
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,390
That isn't a nose.

2179
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,189
That's a mouth.

2180
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,259
(Ji Hye runs away.)

2181
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,959
- It's an alien plushie. - I know. It's fascinating.

2182
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,999
- Here. - Something like that...

2183
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,830
It must be a deep-sea creature.

2184
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,869
- This is its mouth. - It looks like...

2185
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,030
Jae Seok.

2186
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,270
Ji Hye, how could you say that after approaching silently?

2187
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,980
Ji Hye, that's good. I see that we've gotten close.

2188
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,886
- Ji Hye, we've gotten close. - What are you saying?

2189
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,080
We've gotten close.

2190
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,209
This is it.

2191
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,210
(They get drinks amidst the ruckus.)

2192
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:25,280
What's this?

2193
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,990
(Stirling engine Americano)

2194
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,960
(The thermal energy of coffee...)

2195
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:39,259
(gets transformed into kinetic energy...)

2196
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:42,300
(and moves the engine.)

2197
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,940
(It's a cup of coffee with physics.)

2198
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:52,610
(Stirling engine Americano)

2199
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,979
This is a Stirling engine.

2200
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,249
- An engine? - This is a Stirling engine.

2201
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,949
It's an external combustion engine that was invented...

2202
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,190
by Professor Robert Stirling.

2203
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,649
Where does the power come from?

2204
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,119
The power comes from the heat of the coffee.

2205
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,489
- The thermal energy... - Really?

2206
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:11,529
- heats up the bottom plate. - Really?

2207
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,930
It expands the gas inside.

2208
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,700
(The heat of the coffee that's the power source...)

2209
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,830
(and the engine are separated, so it's an external combustion engine.)

2210
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,109
That's why it's an external combustion engine.

2211
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:23,139
That's right.

2212
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,839
- An internal combustion engine... - You're smart.

2213
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,910
Yes.

2214
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,509
Then a car engine...

2215
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,009
A car uses an internal combustion engine.

2216
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,110
I see.

2217
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,450
This is an external combustion engine.

2218
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,450
(He fails to hold in his laughter.)

2219
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,119
External?

2220
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,789
(He acts like he has misheard.)

2221
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:40,820
(Laughing)

2222
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,460
(Chuckling)

2223
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,899
The heat...

2224
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,660
makes the plate move up.

2225
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,029
- "It's hot!" - Yes.

2226
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:50,746
- "It's hot!" - It makes the plate move up.

2227
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,139
It's fascinating.

2228
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,339
How does it work?

2229
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,940
How do we drink it?

2230
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,240
(Starpresso)

2231
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,779
You apply pressure...

2232
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,979
and extract coffee.

2233
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,750
You apply about 10psi.

2234
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,990
When the coffee gets extracted,

2235
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,750
its aroma spreads.

2236
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,220
(In the starpresso machine, )

2237
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:17,260
(ground coffee beans go in.)

2238
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,800
(It goes in the bottom.)

2239
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,770
(Hot water goes into the main compartment.)

2240
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,440
(Then it gets sealed.)

2241
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:31,240
(Starpresso is ready to go.)

2242
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,709
- This is... - Mr. Forearm Muscles will do it.

2243
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,379
The one with the forearm muscles.

2244
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,480
What should I do?

2245
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:38,049
- Press it. - Repeatedly.

2246
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:39,119
- Do it continuously. - Press it.

2247
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,049
(Mr. Forearm Muscles' first task)

2248
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:42,990
(Cutting two pork cutlets at once)

2249
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,190
(Impressed)

2250
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,160
He's strong.

2251
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,560
(Mr. Forearm Muscles' second task)

2252
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:53,460
(He fired the fresh ham cannon as he showed off his forearms.)

2253
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,629
(This is his third task.)

2254
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:00,140
(His muscles shine.)

2255
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,339
Look at his forearm muscles.

2256
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,539
His forearm muscles are no joke.

2257
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,740
(Compliments give a boost to his forearm muscles.)

2258
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,840
(My goodness)

2259
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:09,250
(He uses his muscles to the max.)

2260
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,650
I feel like I'm drilling for oil.

2261
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,050
- It's coming out. - It's coming out.

2262
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:17,819
This is incredible.

2263
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,419
(Let me try it.)

2264
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,490
Ji Hye too.

2265
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,430
(She's good.)

2266
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,130
You don't need much strength for this.

2267
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,470
You don't need much strength for this.

2268
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,600
Act like it's exhausting.

2269
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,340
"Act like it's exhausting."

2270
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,486
It looked like he was using a lot of strength.

2271
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,939
This is fun.

2272
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,139
- How fascinating. - Couples can come and do this.

2273
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,609
- If you drink it as it is... - It's espresso.

2274
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,849
If you add it to water, it's Americano.

2275
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:43,950
Iced Americano.

2276
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:46,949
- Try the espresso. - Try it.

2277
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,566
- Teto-boy drinks espresso. - That's right.

2278
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:50,649
I asked my stylist to turn me into...

2279
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:51,959
an Italian teto-boy.

2280
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,289
You look great.

2281
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:55,019
You look like an Italian today.

2282
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,230
It's the perfect outfit.

2283
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,966
- Teto-boy drinks espresso. - That's right.

2284
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,560
Italians drink espresso.

2285
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,169
(He drinks coffee in a cool way.)

2286
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,230
How is it?

2287
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,170
(Humming in approval)

2288
01:21:06,171 --> 01:21:07,699
Italians communicate with hand gestures.

2289
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,460
(They suddenly get the atmosphere of Italy.)

2290
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,009
(He takes another sip.)

2291
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,110
How is it?

2292
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,039
(Acting cute)

2293
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,109
- How is it? - It's good.

2294
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:16,749
- Is it good? - It's good. It's rich.

2295
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,450
(The Italian teto-boy is satisfied.)

2296
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,919
Try it with water.

2297
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,589
(This time, they make Americano.)

2298
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,019
- You want it, right? - No.

2299
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,259
- I'll make it weak. - No.

2300
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,100
- Leave some for me. - Here. It's weak coffee.

2301
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,759
(A tiny bit)

2302
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,900
It's weak coffee.

2303
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,760
(Flustered)

2304
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,299
Isn't it plum syrup?

2305
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,429
This is...

2306
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:37,529
(Bland)

2307
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:39,169
Barley tea would be stronger than this.

2308
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:40,940
- I made you weak coffee. - I'll try it.

2309
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,110
The aroma could be strong.

2310
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,680
Is it good?

2311
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:47,710
- The aroma is nice. - It's nice.

2312
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,250
It's really nice.

2313
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,919
The next menu items are here.

2314
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,719
- It's an aurora. - It's Definitely Space.

2315
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,749
- That's right? - Definitely Space?

2316
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,820
Definitely Space.

2317
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,559
(Even a glass of ade...)

2318
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,830
(contains the space.)

2319
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,859
(A drink that resembles the galaxy, )

2320
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,200
(Definitely Space)

2321
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,429
(A drink that contains a pink aurora, )

2322
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,700
(Aurora Ade.)

2323
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,469
- Aurora. - Aurora Ade.

2324
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,799
For these drinks, there's blue syrup in the beakers.

2325
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,720
- Shall we pour it in? - Yes, please pour it in.

2326
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,309
- The syrup in the beaker. - Let's pour it in.

2327
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,740
(He pours it in as instructed.)

2328
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,209
It looks like the galaxy.

2329
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,049
It's pretty. It's going in.

2330
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:27,780
(The drink reacts.)

2331
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,519
There are anthocyanins inside the syrup.

2332
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,836
(The syrup contains anthocyanins.)

2333
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:35,190
(The base of the drink is the acidic lemon.)

2334
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,459
When it meets acid,

2335
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,360
it shows acid-base reactions.

2336
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:41,199
The color is changing.

2337
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,529
(The color changes due to a chemical reaction.)

2338
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,999
- The color is changing. - You're right.

2339
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,840
- It's pretty. - It's science.

2340
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,539
What am I supposed to doubt?

2341
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:52,040
There's nothing to doubt.

2342
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,739
- If I were to fool someone, - Okay.

2343
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,149
- this would be a good place. - Do you think this place is fake?

2344
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,796
- Really? - If I were in the production crew,

2345
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,279
I'd set up these items.

2346
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,189
Maybe this is a book cafe...

2347
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,649
or a bookstore...

2348
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,919
and they just hung up science posters.

2349
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,919
- It became a science cafe. - It became a science cafe.

2350
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,659
Maybe he isn't the owner,

2351
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,190
(Owner Full of Intelligence)

2352
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:12,129
- but a guest. - A guest.

2353
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,930
- A professor or... - Yes.

2354
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,629
Daejeon is...

2355
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,099
the city of science.

2356
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,269
So, setting up a fake place like this is plausible.

2357
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:22,669
But the menu items...

2358
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,839
show a high level of creativity.

2359
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,279
- It's hard to make them. - It's hard.

2360
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,639
- It isn't easy. - You have to be serious...

2361
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,979
about science.

2362
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,409
- The production crew can't do that. - That's right.

2363
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,619
The equipment...

2364
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,179
- What is it? - What's wrong?

2365
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,490
I have a headache.

2366
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,449
- It's too... - The drink is too cold.

2367
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,810
- It's too cold. - Is it too cold?

2368
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:42,830
(While they were having heated deductions, )

2369
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,830
(she tried the ade by herself.)

2370
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,300
It's tasty.

2371
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,040
(Since it was tasty, she had another sip.)

2372
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:59,380
(The drink filled her mouth.)

2373
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,610
(The aftereffect hit her.)

2374
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,909
- Is it too cold? - Is it that cold?

2375
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,049
- Just once... - You're lying.

2376
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,119
Is that why you're doing this?

2377
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,520
I had a bad headache.

2378
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:08,989
(Seok Jin takes a sip as well.)

2379
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:10,150
It's long-lasting.

2380
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,990
(Drinking)

2381
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:14,190
How is it?

2382
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:18,960
(He can't help but put his hand on his head.)

2383
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Galaxy.

2384
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:22,270
It's really tasty.

2385
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,770
How should I describe it...

2386
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:26,500
- It's like cold ice cream. - The taste of the galaxy.

2387
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,169
- The taste of the galaxy. - It's...

2388
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,686
- It's cold, right? - It gives you a headache, right?

2389
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,310
- It's sour. - Seriously.

2390
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:32,879
- It's like... - It's...

2391
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,610
- lemon-based. - Lemon.

2392
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,950
It hits you.

2393
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,579
- These are the next menu items. - What are these?

2394
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,949
- These are... - I recognize them.

2395
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,119
Dessert items.

2396
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,290
Saltsalt.

2397
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,190
Saltsalt.

2398
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,489
(Which one is a cookie...)

2399
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:48,930
(and which one is a rock?)

2400
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,129
(It's...)

2401
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,260
(me!)

2402
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,030
(Chocolate that resembles basalt, Saltsalt)

2403
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:59,240
(White chocolate gets added to crushed cookies.)

2404
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:03,110
(Then they get mixed well.)

2405
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:07,680
(Food dye gets added as well.)

2406
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,950
(The dark color of basalt)

2407
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:15,150
(Then it's put into a mold and hardened.)

2408
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,420
(Saltsalt looks like basalt by 100 percent.)

2409
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,260
(Cookie dough with a lot of nuts)

2410
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,460
(It gets shaped like conglomerate.)

2411
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,100
(Then it's baked in the oven.)

2412
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:31,100
(There are sedimentary nuts inside the cookie.)

2413
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:35,000
(Sedimentary rock in a cookie form, Conglomerate Cookie)

2414
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:38,240
(A columnar joint turns into jelly.)

2415
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:41,310
(Columnar Jelly)

2416
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,310
This is Saltsalt.

2417
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:45,919
And this is Conglomerate Cookie.

2418
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,920
What kind of cookie is it?

2419
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:48,920
- Conglomerate. - Conglomerate?

2420
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:52,320
It's one of the representative sedimentary rocks.

2421
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,760
You did a great job of making it look like a rock.

2422
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,289
I'm curious.

2423
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,159
They look like real rocks.

2424
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,299
I want the jelly.

2425
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,859
- Let's try the cookie. - Let's try the cookie.

2426
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,330
Cut up the cookie.

2427
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:04,970
It looks like a cookie we usually eat.

2428
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,339
(He tries a bite.)

2429
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,500
It's an actual cookie.

2430
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,539
Of course.

2431
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,669
(The dessert expert, Mimi)

2432
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,039
This cookie is tasty.

2433
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,639
- This cafe has good cookies. - It's really tasty.

2434
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,780
Yes.

2435
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:17,810
When you eat Saltsalt,

2436
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:21,120
hold the fork vertically to break it.

2437
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,649
- It's hard since it's a rock. - It's hard.

2438
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:24,720
(Ji Hye steps in.)

2439
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,959
It's hard.

2440
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:28,159
(One shot, one kill)

2441
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,230
She's strong.

2442
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:31,230
Do you do bar exercises?

2443
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,530
This cookie is so tasty.

2444
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:35,429
(She picks up a piece...)

2445
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:38,430
(and tries it.)

2446
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:40,600
How does it taste? How is it?

2447
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:41,999
It's sweet.

2448
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,469
(It's sweet.)

2449
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:45,639
But cookie particles inside...

2450
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,740
- They provide texture. - They provide texture.

2451
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,679
- This cookie and Saltsalt. - It's so tasty.

2452
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,780
- This one is tasty too. - This one is tasty too.

2453
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,549
- We need to get it right today. - We need to get it right.

2454
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:55,890
I really don't know.

2455
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,519
I think this place is fake.

2456
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,020
Do you think this place is fake? Why?

2457
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,659
I don't think it's a cafe.

2458
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,160
- You don't think it's a cafe. - No.

2459
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:04,859
Look over there.

2460
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,399
You see the coffee machine, right?

2461
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,829
- The huge stainless machine. - Yes.

2462
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,300
(What about the coffee machine?)

2463
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:10,899
- The huge stainless machine. - Yes.

2464
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,400
It's very expensive.

2465
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,110
Seok Jin, we know that much.

2466
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,640
- It's... - Stainless...

2467
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,839
It's very expensive.

2468
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,509
One time, we saw a cup noodle sealing machine...

2469
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:22,179
- at a fake place. - That's right.

2470
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,349
- That's right. - At a fake place?

2471
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:25,819
(In the last season, they borrowed a cup noodle sealing machine...)

2472
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,679
(that was worth 80,000 dollars from a ramyeon brand.)

2473
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,090
- Yes. At a fake place. - That's worth 10,000 dollars.

2474
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,760
- The machine we saw? - It's worth a lot more.

2475
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,960
- It's over 100 million. - Right.

2476
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:38,159
- A cup ramyeon machine? - Yes.

2477
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,760
You can buy that for around 300 dollars.

2478
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,429
It's not the regular ones we see.

2479
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:42,569
It's not the ones that make the Han River ramyeon?

2480
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,669
- No. - No.

2481
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,740
- It actually makes the packaging. - Really?

2482
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,200
This is what I feel.

2483
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,769
I think it's possible to fill the place with items,

2484
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,209
but there are many creative ideas here.

2485
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,409
I think these things are hard to replicate.

2486
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:58,849
That is why this place feels real to me.

2487
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,519
Let's get going for now. We have to decide.

2488
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,520
We have to get the answer for our second attempt.

2489
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,349
(The Owner Full of Intelligence's Science Cafe)

2490
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:05,389
(A cafe with a fake science theme)

2491
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,419
(The suspicious owner is a professor?)

2492
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,589
(The creative menu items sound real!)

2493
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:09,089
It's hard once again today.

2494
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,930
I think it's harder than Season One.

2495
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,430
Who is the fake one?

2496
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,459
- Gosh. - What do we do?

2497
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,100
I don't think I can get the right answer.

2498
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,969
- This is really hard. - I'm not sure.

2499
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,239
It's either number 1 or number 2, right?

2500
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,240
- Right. - I think it's number one.

2501
01:28:21,241 --> 01:28:23,139
- It's not number 3, right? - It's not number 3.

2502
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:25,009
I think it's number three.

2503
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:27,139
- I sense it's number three. - All of a sudden?

2504
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,410
From the eyes of a producer,

2505
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,380
that place was the easiest to set up.

2506
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,320
(Number 3, Science Cafe Full of Intelligence)

2507
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,749
It's a book cafe, but they put science posters instead.

2508
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,919
(A book cafe turned into a science cafe?)

2509
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,889
He's someone invited instead of the owner.

2510
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:40,919
He's someone like a professor invited?

2511
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,959
Right.

2512
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,529
(A professor invited by the production crew?)

2513
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:44,889
Wasn't that strange toward the end?

2514
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,959
I asked where he got the item auctioned,

2515
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,630
but he said he couldn't remember.

2516
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,029
(Which auction house did you get it from?)

2517
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,499
(I don't remember...)

2518
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,540
(which auction house it was.)

2519
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:57,300
- I don't think that's too strange. - Is that so?

2520
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:59,780
(Smiling)

2521
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,380
Give it some thought.

2522
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,649
- It's not that strange. - Really?

2523
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:05,280
- He can not remember it? - Sure.

2524
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,750
I have no idea.

2525
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,850
- What about you, Mimi? - I think...

2526
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,419
- it's number 2. - Number 2?

2527
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,560
- Number two is real. - Because it was too good.

2528
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:19,900
(Number 2, Army Stew Restaurant with Explosive Cannons)

2529
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,130
(Amazed)

2530
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:23,999
(Eyes opening wide)

2531
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,369
It's good. It's good, isn't it?

2532
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:27,270
(Full of taste)

2533
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:30,110
There was a reason behind a place with great food.

2534
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,479
- The chef went like this... - It was by a professional?

2535
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,986
And he must be a professional chef that works with German cuisine.

2536
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:38,310
(He's actually a professional chef that works with German cuisine?)

2537
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:39,619
I choose number two as well.

2538
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:42,619
With what I felt,

2539
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,390
- Over the top? - the owner felt unnatural.

2540
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:46,419
(Soon, I will show you...)

2541
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:49,290
(something amazing.)

2542
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:53,359
(A fake owner that was told to act by the production crew?)

2543
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,799
The most unnatural one...

2544
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,229
- was the second owner. - Right.

2545
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,869
Ji Hye, you thought it was number three,

2546
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,299
- but now you're going with 1? - Number 1.

2547
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,469
I think it's number one.

2548
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:01,939
The whole theme...

2549
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:05,370
and the food didn't seem to suit each other.

2550
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:07,580
- That place felt off as well. - Right.

2551
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:13,520
(Number 1, Baseball Izakaya with Puffy Cheeks)

2552
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:15,349
What is it?

2553
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,720
"Rice balls can fly over your head in this place."

2554
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,090
(The rice ball will be thrown!)

2555
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,660
(Out-of-this-world ball-throwing serving)

2556
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:26,929
(The rice ball has been delivered.)

2557
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:29,099
The baseball theme is fake.

2558
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,329
(Unnatural dishes made to fit the baseball theme?)

2559
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:32,800
- Right. The rice was sweet. - It was a regular restaurant.

2560
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,070
- The rice was sweet? - The rice was sweet.

2561
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:39,110
I wouldn't have made it sweet if I was the owner.

2562
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,280
What if it's a real place?

2563
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,249
I want to follow my initial thought.

2564
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,549
- Which one? - I choose number two.

2565
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,649
Number two felt so off.

2566
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,749
- There are three votes then. - Right.

2567
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,449
There are 3 votes for number 2 and 1 vote each for 1 and 3.

2568
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,650
What about you?

2569
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,619
As for me...

2570
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,136
(Where will Jae Seok's last vote head toward?)

2571
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,630
(Tell us.)

2572
01:30:57,190 --> 01:30:58,459
- I think it's number 2 as well. - Number 2.

2573
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,430
- Number 2. - There are 4 votes for number 2?

2574
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:01,999
There are 4 votes for number 2.

2575
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,270
- I think it's right. - Right.

2576
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,169
- We choose number 2. - Number 2.

2577
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:06,199
- How does that sound? - Let's go for it.

2578
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,269
- They look glum. - Right.

2579
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:09,809
- We had to decide quickly. - It's number two!

2580
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,009
- Well, - They look glum.

2581
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:12,809
- we got it wrong last time. - Right.

2582
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:14,410
We have to get it right this time.

2583
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,449
It was hard. I was torn between number 1 and number 2.

2584
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:18,050
- Right. - It's not number three.

2585
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:20,170
- Right. - I don't think it's number three.

2586
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,079
(What is today's answer?)

2587
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,749
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,750
(Today's travel destination)

2589
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:26,590
(Daejeon)

2590
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,490
(There's one place that is fake!)

2591
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,459
(Puffy Cheeks)

2592
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,629
(A rice ball gets thrown to you when you order pork cutlet?)

2593
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:33,729
- This was... - But...

2594
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,499
this feels a bit off.

2595
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,629
- Right. Isn't it strange? - It feels strange.

2596
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,499
Isn't the glove the best thing to trick us?

2597
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,540
Right.

2598
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:43,240
- I feel like it's number 1. - Is it number 1?

2599
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:45,610
(Loaded with Explosive Cannons)

2600
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,809
This was really good.

2601
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:49,810
(A suspicious encounter with German fresh ham...)

2602
01:31:49,811 --> 01:31:50,849
(and Korean army stew)

2603
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,450
(Number 2, Owner with Explosive Cannons)

01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,680
(Full of Intelligence)

2605
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:57,319
I think this place is real.

2606

(Menu items full of scientific intelligence)

2607
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:01,019
(A hot place that represents the science city?)

(Number 3, Owner Full of Intelligence)

2609
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,266
Why does this person feel so fake all of a sudden?

2610
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,199
Wasn't that so awkward?

2611
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,699
- Wasn't that awkward? - That felt off.

2612
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,799
He felt really fake.

2613
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,069
(Do they all seem real?)

2614
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,170
I have no idea today.

2615
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:16,569
(Which place will go against your expectation...)

2616
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:18,886
(as the fake one in Daejeon, the City Bursting with Bread?)

2617

Let's get it right in Daejeon.

2618
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,760
- Which one is the fake one? - Which one is the fake one?

2619
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,779
- Please! - Please!

2620
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,050
We have to get it right today!

2621
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:30,450
Please!

2622
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:34,990
(Which place is fake out of the three?)

2623
01:32:35,356 --> 01:32:36,756
Please!

(Which place is fake out of the three?)

2625
01:32:41,696 --> 01:32:43,436
- What? - Which one is it?

2626
01:32:45,596 --> 01:32:46,965
(Number 1, Owner with Puffy Cheeks)

2627
01:32:46,966 --> 01:32:50,176
(Fake)

2628
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:51,806
I told you!

2629
01:32:52,676 --> 01:32:54,845
(I told you!)

2630
01:32:54,846 --> 01:32:55,976
This one is fake?

2631
01:32:57,516 --> 01:32:59,315
(They failed to find the fake place.)

2632
01:32:59,316 --> 01:33:01,116
I was right!

2633
01:33:01,586 --> 01:33:02,986
Gosh, this place was fake?

2634
01:33:04,256 --> 01:33:05,286
They got us.

2635
01:33:06,226 --> 01:33:08,256
No wonder the rice was sweet.

2636
01:33:08,556 --> 01:33:10,096
(What's with this guy and the rice?)

2637
01:33:11,126 --> 01:33:13,225
- I said the rice was too sweet. - Earlier,

2638
01:33:13,226 --> 01:33:15,165
I had this thought all of sudden.

2639
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:16,895
It was the best thing to trick us with.

2640
01:33:16,896 --> 01:33:17,995
- Right. - Right.

2641
01:33:17,996 --> 01:33:20,106
I got that thought a lot later!

2642
01:33:20,206 --> 01:33:21,706
Ji Hye!

2643
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:24,076
You sensed the right answer.

2644
01:33:24,806 --> 01:33:26,476
Gosh, we got it wrong again.

2645
01:33:27,906 --> 01:33:29,786
- This was 75 days ago? - This was 75 days ago?

2646
01:33:30,016 --> 01:33:32,916
We have to think of the project for Daejeon.

2647
01:33:33,186 --> 01:33:35,046
What's Daejeon famous for?

2648
01:33:35,186 --> 01:33:36,815
- Bread? - Kalguksu.

2649
01:33:36,816 --> 01:33:37,816
(Kalguksu)

2650
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:38,985
(Science)

2651
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:41,125
Actually, baseball is hot these days.

2652
01:33:41,126 --> 01:33:42,995
(Baseball is hot in Daejeon these days.)

2653
01:33:42,996 --> 01:33:44,995
It's the Eagles.

2654
01:33:44,996 --> 01:33:47,596
That was why I thought it felt more reasonable.

2655
01:33:48,996 --> 01:33:50,165
(The Eagles were doing very well during the meeting.)

2656
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:53,365
("Eagles, Leaders in 1st Half for the 1st Time in 33 Years")

2657
01:33:53,366 --> 01:33:54,665
Shall we go with the baseball theme?

2658
01:33:54,666 --> 01:33:56,152
(Shall we go along with their popularity?)

2659
01:33:56,176 --> 01:34:00,406
(The Eagles enter the Korean Series after 19 years!)

2660
01:34:00,606 --> 01:34:02,145
("Eagles, Korean Series After 19 Years")

2661
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:03,716
(Fly high again, Eagles!)

2662
01:34:03,876 --> 01:34:05,375
(Strongest...)

2663
01:34:05,376 --> 01:34:07,045
(Hanhwa)

2664
01:34:07,046 --> 01:34:09,046
(Daejeon is crazy about the Eagles right now.)

2665
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:12,415
Daejeon is crazy about baseball these days.

2666
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:14,255
(Baseball City Daejeon is painted with orange.)

2667
01:34:14,256 --> 01:34:16,296
(However, )

2668
01:34:16,496 --> 01:34:18,416
(small business owners suffered from recession.)

2669
01:34:18,626 --> 01:34:21,496
(Even with various baseball-related events, )

2670
01:34:21,826 --> 01:34:23,095
(the streets were empty due to the recession.)

2671
01:34:23,096 --> 01:34:24,456
There has been a slump these days.

2672
01:34:26,366 --> 01:34:27,906
- Including this place. - Hello.

2673
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:30,805
I run an izakaya in Daeheung-dong...

2674
01:34:30,806 --> 01:34:32,076
and my name is Lee Dong Joon.

2675
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:34,846
How are sales compared to last year?

2676
01:34:35,206 --> 01:34:37,116
Sales have cut in half.

2677
01:34:37,916 --> 01:34:39,446
The economy has been slow...

2678
01:34:39,586 --> 01:34:41,522
and the drinking culture has changed a lot as well.

2679
01:34:41,546 --> 01:34:43,215
Not a lot of people come out.

2680
01:34:43,216 --> 01:34:44,576
There has been a slump these days.

2681
01:34:44,616 --> 01:34:46,085
(He has come to save the place that is struggling!)

2682
01:34:46,086 --> 01:34:47,156
Hello.

2683
01:34:47,226 --> 01:34:49,325
I entered "Culinary Class Wars" as a White Spoon chef.

2684
01:34:49,326 --> 01:34:51,225
- I'm a Japanese cuisine chef. - He was on "Culinary Class Wars!"

2685
01:34:51,226 --> 01:34:52,495
- Right! - Right?

2686
01:34:52,496 --> 01:34:54,965
- The food was really good. - Right.

2687
01:34:54,966 --> 01:34:56,536
The pork cutlet was really good.

2688
01:34:57,666 --> 01:35:00,765
The most I ran was up to 14,

2689
01:35:00,766 --> 01:35:02,805
including doing all of the cooking.

2690
01:35:02,806 --> 01:35:05,536
Now, I'm running five restaurants.

2691
01:35:05,736 --> 01:35:08,206
- That's amazing. - That's amazing.

2692
01:35:08,706 --> 01:35:09,945
(The Man of 9 Billion, Jang Ho Joon)

2693
01:35:09,946 --> 01:35:11,315
Annual sales of nine billion?

2694
01:35:11,316 --> 01:35:12,316
(The Man of 9 Billion, Jang Ho Joon)

2695
01:35:12,317 --> 01:35:15,185
Since baseball is hot in Daejeon right now,

2696
01:35:15,186 --> 01:35:17,515
we thought about a baseball-themed restaurant.

2697
01:35:17,516 --> 01:35:19,085
- Right. - That's the idea we have.

2698
01:35:19,086 --> 01:35:21,256
If there's a bowl that is shaped like a ball park...

2699
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:24,795
If the salmon is spread out, the ball park would be...

2700
01:35:24,796 --> 01:35:27,225
So it was put together by an expert.

2701
01:35:27,226 --> 01:35:28,325
That's how it can be used.

2702
01:35:28,326 --> 01:35:30,166
(That was how it came to be.)

2703
01:35:30,696 --> 01:35:33,206
Now that I think about it, it was the easiest to set up.

2704
01:35:33,766 --> 01:35:37,035
There's another thing that came into mind.

2705
01:35:37,036 --> 01:35:38,105
(He shows them a video.)

2706
01:35:38,106 --> 01:35:39,746
- What is it? - This is what it's like.

2707
01:35:40,876 --> 01:35:43,575
(A popular restaurant in the US where the bread is thrown)

2708
01:35:43,576 --> 01:35:45,076
So this was actually a thing?

2709
01:35:45,716 --> 01:35:47,516
This actually existed.

2710
01:35:48,216 --> 01:35:50,985
Something round had to be thrown.

2711
01:35:50,986 --> 01:35:52,285
There had to be a glove as well.

2712
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:54,025
(The birth of the glove pork cutlet)

2713
01:35:54,026 --> 01:35:56,496
- That was a good idea. - Right.

2714
01:35:56,956 --> 01:35:58,896
Hello.

2715
01:35:59,256 --> 01:36:00,495
(The two have gathered for the recipe.)

2716
01:36:00,496 --> 01:36:03,165
You don't have to move sideways. Just hit on the exact spot.

2717
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:05,435
He taught him every single detail?

2718
01:36:05,436 --> 01:36:06,665
(A special lesson to fool the Sixth Sense members)

2719
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:08,266
How many grams is the salmon?

2720
01:36:08,466 --> 01:36:10,805
The owner did so well to explain...

2721
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:11,905
- each of the details. - He did a great job.

2722
01:36:11,906 --> 01:36:14,005
Right before we left.

2723
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:15,006
- Right. - Right.

2724
01:36:15,007 --> 01:36:17,216
I hope you do really well with this.

2725
01:36:17,616 --> 01:36:19,175
- Good luck. - Thank you.

2726
01:36:19,176 --> 01:36:20,976
(Chef Jang Ho Joon did his best to help him.)

2727

(The Art Team steps up for the baseball restaurant!)

2728

01:36:28,186 --> 01:36:30,095
(Sir, here's the draft of the interior design.)

2730
01:36:30,096 --> 01:36:31,155
(Right! It looks great.)

2731
01:36:31,156 --> 01:36:32,676
(The owner was happy with it as well!)

2732
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:35,866
(The original place was full of Japanese design.)

2733
01:36:36,896 --> 01:36:38,795
- All of it was changed? - It was changed?

2734
01:36:38,796 --> 01:36:40,112
(We're here to change this place up!)

2735
01:36:40,136 --> 01:36:41,535
Gosh, the ceiling was drilled like that?

2736

(Sixth Sense Assembled is back!)

2737
01:36:43,236 --> 01:36:46,146
(From the display case for baseball goods...)

2738

(to the TV for baseball games)

2739
01:36:47,946 --> 01:36:50,976
- Even the TV was set up? - TVs were set up on both sides.

2740
01:36:51,346 --> 01:36:54,216
So the original place was given a baseball theme.

2741
01:36:54,616 --> 01:36:56,085
The interior design was changed?

2742
01:36:56,086 --> 01:36:57,816
(Transforming into a baseball-themed place)

2743
01:36:58,816 --> 01:36:59,855
Look at that!

2744
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,125
She mentioned that!

2745
01:37:02,126 --> 01:37:03,456
I mentioned all of that.

2746
01:37:03,496 --> 01:37:05,595
- This is driving me crazy. - All of that.

2747
01:37:05,596 --> 01:37:07,072
(Adding details to make the place look older)

2748
01:37:07,096 --> 01:37:08,396
(As a result, )

2749
01:37:08,696 --> 01:37:09,765
(the regular izakaya changed into a fan-owned place.)

2750
01:37:09,766 --> 01:37:12,936
- The owner must've liked it. - Right.

2751
01:37:13,336 --> 01:37:16,276
- It felt so real though. - Very real.

2752

- What else? - That's amazing.

2763

- Well, - What now?

2764
01:37:39,226 --> 01:37:40,986
We had a lot more, but they were thrown out.

- Eun Hyeong! - Eun Hyeong!

The place had Eun Hyeong's autograph.

2769
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:50,206
Right. Along with Jae Jun's autograph.

I had to help him.

We have a lot of uniforms.

2776

- They still won't say anything. - They weren't told about it?

01:39:14,756 --> 01:39:17,595
If it's a baseball-themed place,

2809
01:39:17,596 --> 01:39:19,795
- Jae Seok loves baseball... - Right.

2810
01:39:19,796 --> 01:39:21,966
And he will certainly ask about baseball.

2811
01:39:22,596 --> 01:39:24,096
Why use that kind of photo?

2812
01:39:24,896 --> 01:39:26,066
(Dumbfounded)

2813
01:39:26,236 --> 01:39:28,336
(They came up with a plan to solve that situation.)

2814
01:39:28,436 --> 01:39:29,465
(Have you all...)

2815
01:39:29,466 --> 01:39:31,535
(seen the owner's ear?)

2816
01:39:31,536 --> 01:39:32,836
That?

2817
01:39:32,906 --> 01:39:34,476
- I told you! - You were right!

2818
01:39:34,506 --> 01:39:35,676
You were right!

2819
01:39:36,146 --> 01:39:38,215
- He said it was an ear infection. - Gosh.

2820
01:39:38,216 --> 01:39:39,445
He said it was an ear infection.

2821
01:39:39,446 --> 01:39:40,685
(I don't like you.)

2822
01:39:40,686 --> 01:39:41,686
(The members all panic together.)

2823
01:39:41,687 --> 01:39:43,055
How did you sense that, Mimi?

2824
01:39:43,056 --> 01:39:45,286
We had so many crucial clues.

2825
01:39:45,386 --> 01:39:46,625
(Shocked)

2826
01:39:46,626 --> 01:39:47,856
Gosh.

2827
01:39:47,926 --> 01:39:50,125
(Cutting-edge technology was used for the baseball rookie.)

2828
01:39:50,126 --> 01:39:51,496
That's amazing.

2829
01:39:52,126 --> 01:39:53,895
(Putting on)

2830
01:39:53,896 --> 01:39:56,765
Who are the Eagles players with retired numbers?

2831
01:39:56,766 --> 01:39:59,935
Jung Min Cheul, Song Jin Woo,

2832
01:39:59,936 --> 01:40:01,766
and Chang Jong Hoon.

2833
01:40:02,636 --> 01:40:04,235
(Inputting)

2834
01:40:04,236 --> 01:40:05,835
(Outputting)

2835
01:40:05,836 --> 01:40:07,905
(The avatar is synced.)

2836
01:40:07,906 --> 01:40:10,176
An expert was on standby for him?

2837
01:40:10,476 --> 01:40:11,776
(Sighing)

2838
01:40:11,916 --> 01:40:13,396
(Across the place during the shoot, )

2839
01:40:13,886 --> 01:40:15,416
(who is this person waiting?)

2840
01:40:15,786 --> 01:40:18,426
(Producer, Eagles fan for 20 years, happy that they won yesterday)

2841
01:40:18,486 --> 01:40:19,925
When you mentioned that,

2842
01:40:19,926 --> 01:40:21,686
the production crew would've felt so scared.

2843
01:40:22,526 --> 01:40:24,656
(D-15 to the shoot, fake dishes sold!)

2844
01:40:25,726 --> 01:40:29,126
(The baseball restaurant started getting attention.)

2845
01:40:29,266 --> 01:40:30,636
That's amazing.

2846
01:40:31,396 --> 01:40:34,406
(The baseball fans gave a great response.)

2847
01:40:34,806 --> 01:40:38,935
It was a fun and fascinating time to film for Sixth Sense.

2848
01:40:38,936 --> 01:40:42,506
I will do my best as if a homerun had come to my life.

2849
01:40:43,376 --> 01:40:45,945
Sixth Sense, this place is fake.

2850
01:40:45,946 --> 01:40:47,385
(Owner with Puffy Cheeks, fake)

2851
01:40:47,386 --> 01:40:49,885
I hope the owner does well with the place.

2852
01:40:49,886 --> 01:40:50,955
- Right. - Right.

2853
01:40:50,956 --> 01:40:53,556
I feel proud. That's great for him.

2854
01:40:53,856 --> 01:40:55,096
It's going to be a big success.

2855
01:40:55,326 --> 01:40:56,726
Gosh, Ji Hye.

2856
01:40:57,096 --> 01:40:58,402
- What a bummer. - She sensed it well.

2857
01:40:58,426 --> 01:41:00,425
But to think about it, he said he had an ear infection.

2858
01:41:00,426 --> 01:41:01,965
Right. He blocked up his ear.

2859
01:41:01,966 --> 01:41:04,165
- He had a bandage on his ear. - Right.

2860
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:06,336
It should be exposed to air.

2861
01:41:06,466 --> 01:41:07,536
Right.

2862
01:41:07,836 --> 01:41:10,676
Gosh, we got it wrong for two consecutive weeks.

2863
01:41:11,376 --> 01:41:14,675
- This is bad. - We have a lot of mushy members.

2864
01:41:14,676 --> 01:41:16,845
- We're all so blunt. - "Gosh."

2865
01:41:16,846 --> 01:41:18,075
"Is that so?"

2866
01:41:18,076 --> 01:41:19,146
(What is deduction?)

2867
01:41:19,646 --> 01:41:20,745
We all agree with everything.

2868
01:41:20,746 --> 01:41:21,785
(They all agree with things without questioning them.)

2869
01:41:21,786 --> 01:41:24,192
- We all agree with everything. - We have to pick one, right?

2870
01:41:24,216 --> 01:41:25,685
I don't want to make the cringy social media post.

2871
01:41:25,686 --> 01:41:28,085
- It won't be Mimi again, will it? - Please!

2872
01:41:28,086 --> 01:41:29,225
(Episode 1 penalty, Mimi)

2873
01:41:29,226 --> 01:41:30,795
- Choose one, Ji Hye. - Please!

2874
01:41:30,796 --> 01:41:31,895
Pick your own name.

2875
01:41:31,896 --> 01:41:32,955
(Another name of fate was picked again.)

2876
01:41:32,956 --> 01:41:33,996
All right.

2877
01:41:34,726 --> 01:41:35,726
Who is it?

2878
01:41:37,236 --> 01:41:38,396
(Yu Jae Seok)

2879
01:41:41,306 --> 01:41:42,736
(Congratulations!)

2880
01:41:42,866 --> 01:41:45,235
- One more time! - She's on fire today.

2881
01:41:45,236 --> 01:41:47,206
- Nice one. - Why pick me, Jae Seok?

2882
01:41:47,446 --> 01:41:48,805
Nice one!

2883
01:41:48,806 --> 01:41:50,615
This is driving me crazy!

2884
01:41:50,616 --> 01:41:52,816
- What am I going to do? - Gosh!

2885
01:41:53,216 --> 01:41:55,746
(The message receiver, Cho Sae Ho)

2886
01:41:55,816 --> 01:41:57,185
(Sae Ho, I thought of you while looking at the night sky.)

2887
01:41:57,186 --> 01:41:58,515
(The moon is able to shine...)

2888
01:41:58,516 --> 01:41:59,956
(because of the darkness around it.)

2889
01:42:00,286 --> 01:42:03,826
(Sae Ho was touched.)

2890
01:42:04,033 --> 01:42:06,193
(A campus in Seoul on a fall day)

2891
01:42:06,363 --> 01:42:08,703
(They are definitely unrelated to this school.)

2892
01:42:09,103 --> 01:42:11,533
(Where is this place that made the members feel excited?)

2893
01:42:12,073 --> 01:42:14,673
(Third City Tour, Gangbuk university area)

2894
01:42:14,803 --> 01:42:16,519
(This is the taste of the university area.)

2895
01:42:16,543 --> 01:42:17,943
(Why is it so sour?)

2896
01:42:18,143 --> 01:42:19,572
(This sourness...)

2897
01:42:19,573 --> 01:42:21,212
(must have felt delicious!)

2898
01:42:21,213 --> 01:42:22,543
(I like it then!)

2899
01:42:22,683 --> 01:42:25,453
(The middle-aged man who would die for youth)

2900
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:27,482
(Enjoying the cute places...)

2901
01:42:27,483 --> 01:42:30,452
(in the university area with youth, romance, )

2902
01:42:30,453 --> 01:42:32,453
(and strangeness?)

2903
01:42:32,553 --> 01:42:35,193
(They can't believe their eyes.)

2904
01:42:35,293 --> 01:42:36,563
(Shocked)

2905
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:37,792
(Something suspicious...)

2906
01:42:37,793 --> 01:42:39,563
(has appeared in the university area.)

2907
01:42:39,733 --> 01:42:42,303
(Suspect everything that catches your eye!)

2908
01:42:42,933 --> 01:42:44,433
(This is fake.)

2909
01:42:44,803 --> 01:42:46,002
(There are also...)

2910
01:42:46,003 --> 01:42:47,342
(two silhouettes of extraordinary people?)

2911
01:42:47,343 --> 01:42:49,719
(MIYEON and Lee Dong Hwi have come to take over the university area.)

2912
01:42:49,743 --> 01:42:50,942
(Your bottom to top...)

2913
01:42:50,943 --> 01:42:52,442
(A big difference in temperature)

2914
01:42:52,443 --> 01:42:53,982
(Isn't it top to bottom?)

2915
01:42:53,983 --> 01:42:55,843
(Seok Jin's killer has arrived.)

2916
01:42:56,143 --> 01:42:57,952
(Dong Hwi's deduction step 1: Intuition)

2917
01:42:57,953 --> 01:42:59,859
(Dong Hwi's deduction step 2: Collection of evidence)

2918
01:42:59,883 --> 01:43:01,022
(Dong Hwi's deduction step 3: Certainty)

2919
01:43:01,023 --> 01:43:02,382
(Wait until you go to a different place.)

2920
01:43:02,383 --> 01:43:04,292
(The other place will feel fake.)

2921
01:43:04,293 --> 01:43:05,553
(Laughing)

2922
01:43:06,423 --> 01:43:08,023
(Big Nose Copy)

2923
01:43:09,323 --> 01:43:10,962
(He is 200 percent accurate with his impersonation of Seok Jin.)

2924
01:43:10,963 --> 01:43:13,463
(A teasing festival except for just one person)

2925
01:43:14,363 --> 01:43:16,303
(There's someone behind your chair.)

2926
01:43:17,073 --> 01:43:18,432
(Aren't you covering her too much?)

2927
01:43:18,433 --> 01:43:19,633
(Seok Jin!)

2928
01:43:20,303 --> 01:43:21,372
(This is for you.)

2929
01:43:21,373 --> 01:43:22,742
(Close-up face cam)

2930
01:43:22,743 --> 01:43:24,143
(What else is there besides that?)

2931
01:43:24,873 --> 01:43:25,873
This.

2932
01:43:25,874 --> 01:43:27,342
(Perfect angle, on point)

2933
01:43:27,343 --> 01:43:29,542
(Her idol charms explode.)

2934
01:43:29,543 --> 01:43:30,713
(But soon after, )

2935
01:43:30,883 --> 01:43:33,283
(MIYEON really explodes.)

2936
01:43:33,523 --> 01:43:34,782
(In my opinion, )

2937
01:43:34,783 --> 01:43:35,953
(the taste of the food.)

2938
01:43:37,093 --> 01:43:38,152
(Close up on me.)

2939
01:43:38,153 --> 01:43:39,423
(I'm really sharp right now.)

2940
01:43:41,063 --> 01:43:43,432
(The strange Sixth Sense members are coming soon...)

2941
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:45,966
(to the strange university area.)
