- Hello, Seok Jin.
- Hello.

00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,286
- We're in Gangneung.
- We're in Gangneung.

00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,085
Gangneung is my mother's...

7
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,225
- Seok Sam is...
- Gangwon Province?

8
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:43,855
- Yes.
- from Jeongseon, Gangwon Province.

9
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,425
I'm the son of Gangwon Province.

10
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:46,656
He's the son of Gangwon Province.

11
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:47,865
- We're here in Gangneung today.
- Really?

12
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,566
We're in Gangneung.

38
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,375
- Due to the drought...
- You're right.

39
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,005
Thankfully, things turned out okay.

40
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,645
You must've worked very hard.

41
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:40,075
- Well done.
- Well done, everyone.

42
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:41,745
- It's such a relief.
- Yes.

43
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:43,145
After the drought,

44
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,455
- there have been many tourists.
- Right.

45
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,615
In the history of Gangneung,

46
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,085
it received the highest number of tourists.

47
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,225
This year,

48
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:52,195
about 1.37 million people visited Gangneung.

49
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,425
There are so many amazing places...

50
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,665
- in Gangneung.
- Exactly.

51
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,895
It's also very beautiful.

52
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:57,665
Kyung Pyo, do you know much about Gangneung?

53
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,665
I did my military service in Samcheok.

54
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,666
I see.

55
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,735
That was why he stayed quiet.

56
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:03,765
Yes.

57
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,605
Maybe that's why he's standing up straight.

58
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,175
It's been a while since I came to Gangneung. The weather is nice.

59
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,545
- The weather is wonderful.
- It's very sunny.

60
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,945
Also, it's warm today.

61
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,376

(Exclaiming)

63
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:14,646
It's very big.

64
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:17,715
This is the gingko tree in Okcheon-dong.

65

(The gingko tree in Okcheon-dong behind the Sixth Sense members)

66
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,185

00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:22,626
(Gasping)

68
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,055

(a gingko tree that's been protecting Gangneung)

72
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:34,035
This gingko tree is...

73
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,965
like Seok Sam in the world of variety shows.

74
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,706
No, I'm not that old.

75
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,335
Seok Jin, you're the eldest member on variety shows.

76
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,346
Am I?

77
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:43,805
Anyway, I'm setting new records one at a time.

78
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:44,915
- Exactly.
- Yes.

79
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,216
Then I'll make a wish in front of you, Seok Jin.

80
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,985
Yes, you can make a wish.

81
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,416
- In front of you.
- Go ahead.

82
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,886
(What is this?)

83
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:55,225
- Make a wish in front of him.
- How did I become a wishing tree?

84
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,426
- May I touch your nose just once?
- No, you may not.

85
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,395
Come and see me after you get married.

86
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,925
- After I get married?
- You'll get a son right away.

87
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,695
- After I get married?
- Get married first.

88
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,165
- Once you get married...
- That's right.

89
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,665
- Yes.
- Nose hareubang.

90
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,135
- Here's the map.
- Please give us the map.

91

- Mimi will get it.
- The amazing kid will get it.

92

- What do we have today?

(What is today's theme?)

94

- "Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath." - Hot bath?

100
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,426
"Cheese on the Jang."

101
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:31,625
(In the vast mudflats,)

102
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:32,956

- They're strange again.

123
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,436
From the mudflats?

124
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:18,806
- What's Pizza from the Mudflats?
- What's Pizza from the Mudflats?

125
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,635
We should go to the meeting place first.

126

Yes, to meet the guests.

127
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,775
- They're at the central market.
- I like going to markets.

128

It must be very fascinating.

Hello.

158
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,806
Goodness. Be careful, or you'll fall.

159
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:27,075
- Only Jae Seok's getting attention.
- Be careful, or you'll fall.

160
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,306
- He should run for something.
- Hello.

161
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,406
You're Grasshopper.

162
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,375
"Grasshopper."

163
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,346
Honestly, you should run for office.

164
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:39,115
- I'm being serious.
- Be quiet.

165
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,186
(He keeps Mimi quiet without running for anything.)

166
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,426
- Farther inside?
- A meeting place.

167
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,196
This place is also lively.

168
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:47,726
These are wild pine mushrooms.

169
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:51,026
You're right. There's also salted seafood.

170
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,296
Half-dried saury looks delicious.

171
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:54,836
Laver.

172
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,336
- My goodness.
- Goodness.

173
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:59,275

(He's so busy.)

176
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,816
- Only Jae Seok is...
- Hello.

177
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,375
Are the guests somewhere here?

178
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:09,146
It must be this teahouse.

179
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:10,446
Is this it?

180
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,685
(Located on the alleyway inside the market)

181
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:13,856
Retro Cafe?

182
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:15,656
A place like this is fun.

183
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:17,856
Their desserts must be delicious.

184
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:20,356
What is this place?

185
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,425
We can start with a warm cup of coffee.

186
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:23,496
I know.

187
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,266
They're very boisterous.

188
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,106
- Who are you?
- Who is it?

189
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,536
(Very suspicious-looking backs)

190
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,606
From the back, could it be Kyeong Hwan?

191
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:37,706
(Peeking)

192
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,545
(I was right. It is Kyeong Hwan.)

193
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:42,646
He recognized you.

194
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,245
- Hello.
- Gosh.

195
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:45,586
- Goodness.
- Oh, my. This is...

196
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:47,415
(Played Sung Bo Ra in "Reply 1988")

197
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,556
(Played Sung Bo Ra in "Reply 1988")

198
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:51,926
(From natural, everyday acting)

199
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:56,266
(Playing in romances that made the whole nation swoon)

200
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:01,366
(Even the role of a sharp-witted lawyer)

201
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:05,506
(The versatile actress, Ryu Hye Young)

202
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,906
(And)

203
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:12,716
(A master of variety shows and a creator of countless catchphrases)

204
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:14,815
(His second time on Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

205
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,716
(He even answered correctly.)

206
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,156
(The catchphrase vending machine, Heo Kyeong Hwan)

207
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,985
My goodness.

208
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,255
- Hello.
- Hye Young.

209
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:26,326
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

210
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,425
It's my first time meeting you.

211
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:29,895
- Yes, it's our first time.
- Kyeong Hwan.

212
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,136
Why did you come here with Hye Young?

213
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,165
Can't I come here with her?

214
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,705
(Laughing)

215
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,366
(That's so funny.)

216
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,176
Seriously, why did you come here with Hye Young?

217
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:43,006
There's no liaison between you and Hye Young.

218
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,045
Kyung Pyo is our liaison.

219
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,275
- Right, there's Kyung Pyo.
- Right.

220
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,645
- I know both of them.
- The three of you?

221
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,346
Yes, the three of us.

222
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:51,585
It must be Kyung Pyo's Friends Special.

223
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:52,655
Is it?

224
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:54,155
(Today must be Kyung Pyo's Friends Special.)

225
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:56,925
It'd be a special if Hye Young had come alone.

226
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,156
Since Kyeong Hwan also joined, you're just Kyung Pyo's friends.

227
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:00,796
"It's unbalanced."

228
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,325
- You're just Kyung Pyo's friends.
- We are...

229
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:03,966
- "It's unbalanced." - "It's unbalanced."

230
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:06,096
(Let's just call it Unbalanced Special.)

231
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:09,266
There are so many pretty things here.

232
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,736
(The place where Kyeong Hwan and Hye Young were waiting)

233
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,275

235
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,716
(From famous movies in the 90s...)

236
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,516
(to iconic albums that dominated the era)

237
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:30,426
(It feels like we traveled back in time on a time machine.)

238
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:34,296
(The cafe became popular thanks to the retro craze.)

239
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:36,295
There are so many things...

240
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,496
that existed when I was a child.

241
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,195
Hye Young, there's also "Reply 1988."

242
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:42,406
I know. I thought that this place was fake.

243
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:45,036
(The poster for the drama where Kyung Pyo and Hye Young were in)

244

(Kyung Pyo and Hye Young 10 years ago)

245
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:50,105
Do you like "Reply 1988?"

246
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:51,176
Yes.

247
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,045
We were in it.

248
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,816
(Please recognize us.)

249
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,715
We've changed a lot, haven't we?

250
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,316
(It was 10 years ago.)

251
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,985
These are so familiar to me.

252
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,526
When I was young... This is Shin Hae Chul.

253
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,996
(An album by Late Shin Hae Chul with Seok Jin's childhood memories)

254
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:09,196
When I was debuting as a singer...

255
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:12,166
in 1992, Shin Hae Chul was a big star.

256
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,965
(He made a glamorous debut as the winner...)

257
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,066

(Seok Jin made an ambitious debut as a singer.)

262
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,386
- Was your debut song "I Know?" - "I Know."

263
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,116
(He recalls his debut song after a long time.)

264
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,186
Seok Jin, it's this band when it comes to "I Know."

265
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:38,756
Seo Tai Ji and Boys.

266
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:44,866
(Seo Tai Ji and Boys also debuted with a song called "I Know.")

267
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,435
I debuted at the same time as Seo Tai Ji and Boys...

268
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,566
in 1992.

269
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:49,965
- With the same song title...
- I'm serious.

270
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,566
(Seok Jin lost in the intense competition.)

271
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:52,805
Have a seat here.

272
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:53,875

We were at a retreat together recently.

276
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,115
- That's right.
- For "Reply 1988."

277
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,685
- "Reply 1988 10th Anniversary..." - Right.

278
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,786
retreat.

- Yes.

283
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,956
We cried a lot. After ten years...

284
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:12,195
with a sense of nostalgia.

285
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,996
Who participated in the retreat?

286
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,365
(One of them didn't understand.)

287
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,725
Everyone including the production crew?

288

289
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:20,065
- Did you already say it?
- Yes.

290
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,305
Hey, Kyung Pyo. Listen to me carefully.

291
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:24,306
Seok Jin, please listen to others.

292
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,305
- As a tvN variety show.
- As a variety show?

293
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:28,306
Tell him twice.

294
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:30,645
- Kyung Pyo, tell him twice.
- I'll explain.

295
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,515
- Kyeong Hwan, twice isn't enough.
- It's not?

296
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,015
- No.
- Five times is minimum.

297
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,986
- He said it during the last shoot.
- Of course.

298
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,616
- Kyeong Hwan knows a lot of people.
- He's an insider.

299
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:41,016
I only know Kyung Pyo.

300
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:45,086
He refuses to be an insider.

301
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,325
Are you an insider or not?

(Controversy Over Comedian Heo Kyeong Hwan's Being an Insider)

303
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,266
I'm an insider.

00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:52,096
I stay at home all the time.

305
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:53,996
You stay at home all the time?

306
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,366
You're usually at home?

307
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,736
Inside your house?

308
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,106
Why are you breaking into a sweat already?

309
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,376
(He starts to sweat profusely from the failed joke.)

310
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:04,876
(This is hilarious.)

311
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:07,115

00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,746
My microphone is on here.

313
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,145
Anyway, I was...

314
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,256
(No matter how hot it is, he can't give up on his microphone.)

315
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,316
(Laughing)

316
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:16,886
(What is he doing?)

317
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:20,026
He's breaking into a sweat.

318
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:21,355
- He couldn't talk smoothly...
- Stop focusing on me.

319
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,395
during the opening segment.

320
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,636
So he is breaking into a sweat.

321
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:27,935

- He's a cute boy.

- They look beautiful.
- The beverages are here on time.

325
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:32,476
They look pretty.

(A table full of beverages that look too pretty to drink)

337
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,135
It's parfait that we couldn't eat because we didn't have money.

338
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,365
- Wait.
- Why?

339
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,905
- Do you have to light it?
- It's hot.

340

(Lighting the candle like it's a birthday cake)

341
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:08,006
Seok Jin, when is your birthday?

342
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,205
Why do you want to know?

343
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:10,605
(Being sensitive)

344
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,846
You're being so cold.

345
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,115
- Is that hard to answer?
- That's not important.

346
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,445
It's neither in November nor December.

347
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,815
Is it because you don't want to get older?

348
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,415
Well, I already told everyone...

349
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,386
that I won't get older for the next three years.

350
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,785
He's actually 6 years older than me, but now he's only 3 years older.

351
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,486
- Really?
- My age doesn't change.

352
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,126
He's six years older than you?

353
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,126
Seok Jin looks very young for his age.

354
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,895
He does look young, but there's a limit.

355
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:32,035
He keeps saying that he looks like he's in his 30s.

356
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,935
(That's a little excessive.)

357
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,835
He's out of his mind these days.

358
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:37,466
(Close to the madness in the movie "The Substance")

359
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,636
He got so angry when I asked him about his birthday.

360
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,545
About two days ago,

361
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,175
this is what Se Chan said during "Running Man."

362
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:45,715
Seok Jin's back looked hunched, so Se Chan said,

363
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,675
"You can tell Seok Jin's age from the back now."

364
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:48,886
Seok Jin said, "You punk."

365
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,916
I know.

366
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:52,285
He cursed at him.

367
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:54,585
- He was never like this.
- Seok Jin wasn't like this before.

368
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:55,685
(Laughing)

369
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,285
He used to laugh it off.

370
00:12:57,286 --> 00:13:00,156
A citizen was filming all of it from the back.

371
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,396
So I told him, "Please upload it." He agreed.

372
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,895
Don't be shocked. On social media,

373
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:08,636
you might see a clip of Seok Jin cursing.

374
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:09,966
(Chuckling)

375
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,436
There will be an issue about his character.

376
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:13,736
- He's violent.
- No, that's not true.

377
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,475
You've never seen me angry, have you?

378
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,875
- I saw you get angry a moment ago.
- A moment ago?

379
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,215
(Laughing)

380
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,486
Hye Young, do you have any siblings?

381
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:23,886
I have an older sister.

382
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:26,255
I thought you'd have an older sister.

383
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:27,585
- She's also an actress.
- She's an actress.

384
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:28,625
- She's an actress?
- Yes.

385
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,355
- Really?
- Her name is Abel?

386
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,556
That's right.

387
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,156
- Abel?
- Yes.

388
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:37,495
Is her name Abel or Kim Abel?

389
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,636
- Ryu Abel. I'm Ryu Hye Young.
- Ryu Abel.

390
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:42,235
Goodness. I'm very shocked.

391
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:43,236
(A culture shock)

392
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:45,165
She's Ryu Hye Young, and it's her older sister.

393
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,776
How could he say "Kim Abel?"

394
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,805
I'm getting to know her.

395
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:52,245
- We must start with the first spot.
- Yes.

396
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,645
It's Pizza from the Mudflats.

397
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,975
We would know only when we get there.

398
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,146
(The keyword of the first popular place)

399
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:57,545
Maybe there's webfoot octopus on it.

400
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,815
- Right. From the mudflats...
- Mudflats.

401
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:00,485
- Seafood from the mudflats.
- Caught in the mudflats.

402
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,885
Seafood from the mudflats.

403
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:04,325
You can find long-legged octopus in mudflats.

404
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,595
- There's long-legged octopus.
- Long-legged octopus and clams.

405
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,055
You can also find razor clams...

406
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,526
- in the mudflats.
- Right.

407
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,666
This must be it from the mudflats.

408
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,535
- There's mud in the mudflats.
- Yes.

409
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:14,865
With that mud...

410
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:18,405
- The camouflage?
- No, they made a brazier with it.

411
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,635
Excuse me, Seok Jin.

412
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:21,676
- You're shedding fuzz.
- I'm sorry.

413
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,576
(From Seok Jin who's explaining passionately)

414
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:28,076
(Fuzz is shedding.)

415
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:30,216
That must be why my nose is running.

416
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,155
Hye Young's nose is running.

417
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:33,855
- My nose keeps itching.
- Are you allergic to fur?

418
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,186
Is it really because of me?

419
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,985
- You're also wearing a sweater.
- It might not be you.

420
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:39,655
He's also wearing one.

421
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,725
Could you stay still as much as possible?

422
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:42,925
Like this? Without moving?

423
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:43,926
Yes, please stay still.

424
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:46,396
Hye Young is also sensitive.

425
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,535
- You just met him.
- This is difficult.

426
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:49,605
(We look forward to seeing Hye Young's performance today.)

427
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:50,706
You're very particular.

428
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,035
- Shall we go to the first place?
- Let's go.

429
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,076
Let's go to the mudflats.

430
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,745
(They set out to the first place.)

431
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,746
(They get inside a car to get there.)

432
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,575
- Why is it leaning so far back?
- We ate a lot of dalgona.

433
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,286
- Why is it...
- Okay.

434
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:04,886
Isn't that too upright?

435
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,115
It's at the same angle as in a bus.

436
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,426
- Kyeong Hwan seems uncomfortable.
- No, I'm okay.

437
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,695
Doesn't it look like Kyeong Hwan got arrested?

438
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:13,696
(Totally)

439
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,826
- Definitely.
- He's being taken to the police.

440
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:16,996
Seriously.

441
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,365
I will tell you when we get there.

442
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,995
Please let go of my arms.

443
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:22,736
- Let go of my arms.
- I heard you, you punk.

444
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:23,906
Don't do anything else.

445
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,005
I'll talk if you let my arms go.

446
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,036
(They set out to catch the fake, not Kyeong Hwan.)

447
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,745
- Kyeong Hwan.
- Yes?

448
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,676
LP records were lined up, and the writing was small.

449
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,976
- You can't see it?
- He couldn't see the writing.

450
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:37,215
Do you have severe presbyopia?

451
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,216
Yes.

452
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,255
Oh, no. You got presbyopia even before getting married.

453
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:43,655
It has nothing to do with marriage.

454
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:44,956
You aren't married?

455
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:46,726
- Doesn't he look married?
- Yes.

456
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,355
These kinds of talks are delaying...

457
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,795
- my marriage.
- Right.

458
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:51,565
Hye Young thought that you were married.

459
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,795
Right.

460
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:54,065
Doesn't he seem like a married man?

461
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,765
Yes, he would have a wife who's similar to him.

462
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:56,935
Someone cute.

463
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,235
Quite a lot of people think that Kyeong Hwan is married.

464
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,276
- There are many.
- Many people think so.

465
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:04,945
Mimi was the first one who said it clearly on TV.

466
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,675
Really? What did she say?

467
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:07,676
During Season One...

468
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,676
(The perpetrator of the leak is caught.)

469
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,116
(In February, during Sixth Sense: City Tour 1)

470
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:14,315
(Isn't he married?)

471
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,456
(Is he divorced?)

472
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,726
(What? Watch your mouth.)

473
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:21,196
(That's how she spread the rumor about him being married.)

474
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,666
So I was upset with her for one year.

475
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,396
With Mimi?

476
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,935
I bet a lot of people hit on you.

477
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,336
- There's no one.
- I see.

478
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:30,636
Wait a minute.

479
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,305
(There's no one.)

480
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:33,605
(Wait a minute.)

481
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:34,905
Aren't you being quick to judge?

482
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,546
- I thought that it was Kyeong Hwan.
- Me too.

483
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:37,745
Wait.

484
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,876
Do you live with me or what?

485
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,345
- I have a sixth sense.
- There was a time when...

486
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:42,945
- You're right.
- Right?

487
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:45,715
There was a time when he got hit on but not anymore.

488
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:48,715
Now, there are no gatherings.

489
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,885
- You should organize them.
- When I go to a gathering,

490
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,125
I'm the oldest person there.

491
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,425
I know. You should either run or join a sports club.

492
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:55,726
I'm sorry, but I'm still talking.

493
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,496
Or go to church.

494
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:01,566
- You should go to gatherings.
- Don't you have friends?

495
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,265
- No, I don't.
- You act like you've been alone...

496
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,805
I'm his friend.

497
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,905
I'm his friend and a younger brother.

498
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:09,105
- I'm also his senior.
- He's my senior.

499
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:10,445
I'm his senior as a TV personality.

500
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,675
You're his senior in all aspects.

501
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,246
I'm his everything.

502
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:16,145
- We're here.
- We arrived.

503
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,715
(They arrive at Pizza from the Mudflats with the versatile friend.)

504
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:18,746
- Okay.
- Thank you.

505
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:19,915
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

506
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,016
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

507
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:23,185
The weather is so nice.

508
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:24,225
It's warm.

509
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,526
Today's weather is amazing.

510
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:27,955
I agree.

511
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:30,465
This must be the pizza restaurant. This is it.

512
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,796
(They face the first popular place right away.)

513
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,666
- It looks very ordinary.
- This is it.

514
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:36,635
How is it related to mudflats?

515
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:38,305
- I know.
- I can't tell from the outside.

516
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,335
Right, it was pizza from the mudflats.

517
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:43,645
(It looks like an ordinary pizza place without a trace of mudflat.)

518
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,206
- This place looks real.
- What's important is...

519
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,645
Either the menu or the owner could be fake.

520
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,716
That's possible.

521
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,286
(Exclaiming)

522
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,916
Gosh, this is...

523
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,356
(What you see when you enter)

524
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:00,626
(A neon sign that grabs your attention)

525
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,525
- It looks so pretty.
- It's very pretty and exotic.

526
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:05,325
What's this? It feels like we're abroad.

527
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:06,496
(Including the overseas vibe you can feel everywhere)

528
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:09,236
(What will be Pizza from the Mudflats at this place?)

529
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,135
- Wait. It's Seok Cheon.
- It's Hong Seok Cheon.

530
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,536
They run a YouTube channel together.

531
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,275
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Lee Won Il?

532
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,145
Hong Seok Cheon and Lee Won Il.

533
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,505
- You're right.
- Right.

534
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:19,575
Don't they run a YouTube channel together?

535
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:22,016
They visit tasty restaurants. They must have come here.

536
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:23,886
They also took photos here.

537
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,215
This place is really... Look at this.

538
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:29,956
(And selfies with the owner?)

539
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:33,396
(A real pizza restaurant where star chefs visited?)

540
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,026
Shall we sit down first?

541
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,125
Did you take it off because you're hot?

542
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:41,636
- By the way, I'm adjusting to you.
- By the way.

543
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,665
Don't you think you look better with something white?

544
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,306
- I took it off. It's too hot.
- Really?

545
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:48,175
I'm sorry,

546
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,306
but I can only see your face because of the background.

547
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:52,205
I'm serious.

548
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:53,275
(He became one with the wall unintentionally.)

549
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,245
I took it off.

550
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,715
- By the way...
- By the way...

551
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,045
It's not what you think.

552
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,485
- At the border...
- You're right.

553
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,716
- You're at the border.
- We can only see your face.

554
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,456
I'm willing to do anything for the show.

555
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:06,396
Anything for the show?

556
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,325
(Looking around)

557
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:10,466
If I were to say something...

558
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:14,195
Since we're at a pizza restaurant, there's a smell of pizza...

559
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,436
that's nice and familiar.

560
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,805
If they used seafood,

561
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:18,905
- it should smell too.
- Right.

562
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,175
It only smells like pizza here.

563
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,545
(There's no smell of seafood which is suspicious.)

564
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,616
I got a hunch. This place is fake.

565
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,315
Don't you think so?

566
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,475
It's a real pizza restaurant,

567
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,085
but the pizza menu is fake.

568
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,615
(At that time)

569
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,716
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

570
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,415
- Hello.
- Yes.

571
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,425
Sir,

572
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,155
this is called Pizza from the Mudflats.

573
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,656
Why is it Pizza from the Mudflats?

574
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:42,125
We use cockles here.

575
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:44,065
(We use cockles here.)

576
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,396
We make pizzas with seasoned cockles.

577
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:49,836
- Seasoned cockles?
- Seasoned cockles?

578
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,135
Hello, I run a pizza restaurant...

579
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,706
in Gangneung. My name is Kim Young Il.

580
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:58,475
I had wanted to make pizzas with seafood.

581
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:01,675
At the same time, I wanted to be different from others.

582
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,916
(Let's make unprecedented seafood pizza.)

583
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:04,516
I came up with the idea all of a sudden.

584
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:07,286
Why don't I top it with seasoned cockles?

585
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:12,656
(A groundbreaking meeting of cockles and pizzas)

586
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:17,095
(The talk of the town on social media with a special menu)

587
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,395
This summer,

588
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:20,466
my average sales per month were 60,000 dollars.

589
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:24,736
(Is seasoned cockle pizza real?)

590
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,576
- They're seasoned cockles.
- Yes.

591
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:30,205
Are cockles from Gangneung?

592
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,246
- Aren't they from the Yellow Sea?
- The Yellow Sea.

593
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,306
- Right?
- They're from the Yellow Sea.

594
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:34,546
- You find cockles in mudflats.
- Why is this in Gangneung?

595
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:35,945
That's why it's strange.

596
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:36,986
Exactly.

597
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:40,555
There's a famous cockle restaurant in Gangneung.

598
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,915
- Really?
- That cockle bibimbap...

599
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,486
- took the nation by storm.
- With yukjeon...

600
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:44,986
And so...

601
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:46,895
maybe they used that restaurant...

602
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,925
- as a motive to create a fake one.
- Slightly...

603
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,665
They knew that cockle bibimbap was famous.

604
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,695
I apologize. We're supposed to be suspicious on the show.

605
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:54,165
I'm sorry. In front of him...

606
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,596
I just saw the look on your face.

607
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,105
His look said, "Did I get caught?"

608
00:20:58,106 --> 00:20:59,135
(His look said, "Did I get caught?")

609
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:02,506
I saw that Chef Lee Won Il and Seok Cheon were here.

610
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:04,076
Yes, that's right.

611
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,476
In the beginning, I had a hard time selling cockle pizzas.

612
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,445
So I sent a message...

613
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:10,945
to Hong Seok Cheon.

614
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,316
- Is that so?
- Really?

615
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:15,825
In the beginning, there was hardly any business.

616
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,085
I contacted him and explained my situation.

617
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:21,025
He said that he happened to have an empty restaurant in Itaewon.

618
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,666
He told me to contact him again.

619
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:24,325
That's how we made a pop-up store.

620
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,035
(That's how he got to know Seok Cheon.)

621
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,636
(It gained popularity through the pop-up store.)

622
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:32,475
(It became known as a popular place on social media.)

623
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:33,975
The cockle pizza is becoming...

624
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:36,906
a type of pizza that you must try once in your life.

625
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:39,515
This took the social media by storm?

626
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:40,615
Yes.

627
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,076
- Really?
- It did?

628
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:44,245
Hye Young, do you have any questions?

629
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:45,686
Are you from Gangneung?

630
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,986
I'm a Gangneung native.

631
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:49,286
- So that's why you picked here...
- Sir.

632
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:52,756
Do you know where Jee Seok Jin's hometown is?

633
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:54,026
Is it in Gangwon Province?

634
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,896
How did you know?

635
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,695
- But...
- I'm the son of Gangwon Province.

636
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,725
This is what he said.

637
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:00,096
"Could it be Gangwon Province?"

638
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:03,236
(You must listen to sentences in Korean until the end.)

639
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:04,906
Is that what you said?

640
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,405
- He said it...
- He didn't know?

641
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:07,975
without knowing.

642
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,145
I'm the son of Gangwon Province. I'm from Jeongseon.

643
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,375
I moved to Seoul when I was three,

644
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:12,815
- but I was born there.
- Of course.

645
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,075
Did you move to Seoul by foot when you were three?

646
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,316
That's not possible.

647
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,046
How could I have walked to Seoul?

648
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,415
It was a joke. Can't you respond with a smile?

649
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,685
- You're so cold.
- He's getting angry instead.

650
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,155
- You're being so cold today.
- What kind of joke is that?

651
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:24,825
- Could we taste some pizza?
- Okay.

652
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,026
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

653
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:28,555
- The restaurant owner is real.
- It sounds delicious.

654
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:29,826
The restaurant owner must be real.

655
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:31,365
The owner is so calm...

656
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,536
that I can trust him.

657
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,096
Also, this...

658
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:37,935
It looks like it was made in a rush.

659
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:39,135
- So this is a little...
- I agree.

660
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,175
This is strange.

661
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,936
- Could this be...
- This is strange.

662
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:45,276
"Pizza Guide?"

663
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:48,345
(Detailed descriptions of pizza types)

664
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,615
This is very detailed.

665
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,445
There are even alcohol and beverages that go well with the pizza.

666
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:53,685
Exactly.

667
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:54,855
- It's excessive.
- Right.

668
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,456
- That's what's excessive.
- I bet...

669
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,625
I bet Seok Cheon and Chef Won Il...

670
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,596
- Didn't they contribute?
- contributed in this.

671
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,965
That's exactly it.

672
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,196
Maybe they developed it together.

673
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,266
- So that's why it's fake.
- In my opinion...

674
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:07,565
He's back.

675
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,735
- Your pizzas are here.
- Okay.

676
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:09,806
Excuse us.

677
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:11,136
It looks delicious.

678
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:14,705
(All eyes are on them.)

679
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:15,706
Chives?

680
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:17,146
(Her eyes are quivering.)

681
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,576
It looks amazing.

682
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,016
After spreading olive oil on a deep frying pan,

683
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:28,556
I place the dough.

684
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:31,656
I put pepperoni at the bottom...

685
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:32,956
and cover it with cheese.

686
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:36,166
I tie the dough on top and bottom together.

687
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:38,765
(When the dough is ready,)

688
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:40,195
(he leaves it in the oven for a while.)

689
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:41,465
While it's in the oven,

690
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,706
I prepare seasoned cockles.

691
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,435
These cockles are HACCP certified.

692
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,905
I could have used cheaper cockles,

693
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,605
but I didn't want to make a compromise.

694
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:50,775
I wanted to use good-quality ones,

695
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,546
so I insist on using them.

696
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,746
I mix them in the seasoning.

697
00:23:56,546 --> 00:24:00,086
(It's time to dance for the cockles and the chives.)

698
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:02,556
(Entering the final stage, on top of the pizza)

699
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:05,886
(It's ready once seasoned cockles are spread all over the dough.)

700
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:09,265
(Seasoned cockle pizza)

701
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,295
My restaurant became...

702
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,866
one of the places you must visit in Gangneung.

703
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:14,895
Sixth Sense members,

704
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,235
is this place real?

705
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:17,936
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

706
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:21,305
I thought that they were inside the pizza.

707
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:22,306
They're on top.

708
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:23,745
- On top, - He made them separately...

709
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:25,206
- and put them on top.
- shouldn't there be cheese?

710
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:27,546
- This will be refreshing.
- It's a little strange.

711
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,445
- All right, sir.
- We'll try it.

712
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:30,485
- We'll try it first.
- Thank you.

713
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:31,986
- Thank you for the food.
- It looks like...

714
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,255
It looks fake.

715
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:35,116
- It looks very fake.
- It looks really fake.

716
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:36,385
It's definitely fake.

717
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:37,956
I have a hunch. It's fake.

718
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,325
(Raising a piece)

719
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:41,525
- Look at this.
- When you look at...

720
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:42,895
(Jae Seok first)

721
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:43,965
- Hey.
- Gosh.

722
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,095
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

723
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:46,936
We don't do this. It's unpleasant.

724
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:48,565
- This...
- This is awkward.

725
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,266
How could you give me a piece without cockles?

726
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,565
(Empty)

727
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:55,536
The cockles are on their way.

728
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:58,045
All the cockles fell off.

729
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,845
- Thank you, Kyung Pyo.
- You're welcome.

730
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,245
Thank you.

731
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:02,416
(Let's try it first.)

732
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:04,816
If it tastes good...

733
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:06,815
(Taking a big bite with some cockles)

734
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,985
I'll try it like this too.

735
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:09,756
- I shouldn't cut it.
- I think...

736
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:12,755
(Like Jae Seok, Kyeong Hwan also takes a bite.)

737
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:13,926
How does it taste?

738
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,956
It tastes good.

739
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:17,296
(Nodding)

740
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:18,496
It's delicious.

741
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:21,866
(Mimi with the MZer's palate also takes a bite.)

742
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,306
It's good.

743
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,935
(I like cockles.)

744
00:25:26,936 --> 00:25:27,975
It's good.

745
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,376
- Is it good?
- It's good.

746
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:31,105
I'm curious.

747
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:32,146
(Eating neatly with a fork)

748
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:33,816
(Her eyes widen.)

749
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,546
Don't the cockles...

750
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,745
- reduce the greasy taste?
- Right.

751
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,785
It's very delicious.

752
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:40,255
This place has to be real.

753
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:42,455
You can sense the owner's expertise.

754
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:43,955
- Definitely.
- Right?

755
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:46,896
(The perfect balance with cheese pizza)

756
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:48,296
The flavors go well together.

757
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:50,665
It tastes like gorgonzola pizza...

758
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,396
- with honey on top.
- Yes.

759
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:54,195
It's sweet, and it tastes like pizza.

760
00:25:54,196 --> 00:25:55,595
(With a generous amount of seasoned cockles)

761
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,905
The dough tastes good.

762
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:59,135
I never had pizza like this before.

763
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,206
(Pizza with the ultimate spicy, sweet, salty, and savory taste)

764
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:03,146
And there's cheese inside the dough.

765
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:07,645
(The explosion of cheese is irresistible.)

766
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,485
Gosh, why is it so delicious?

767
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,246
- Is it delicious?
- This is difficult.

768
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:14,716
For me...

769
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,155
I don't think...

770
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,256
(On the other hand)

771
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,356
Isn't it good?

772
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:22,156
(What?)

773
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:23,726
It tastes unusual.

774
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,265
What if it's real?

775
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:26,495
I don't think it's very good.

776
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:27,965
- I like it.
- Me too.

777
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:29,436
- Does it taste amazing?
- Yes.

778
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:32,165
- You don't think it's good?
- It's good,

779
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,306
but pizza should taste like pizza.

780
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:35,776
- Me too.
- Right?

781
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:37,345
This isn't pizza.

782
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,745
Then go to Pizza Hut.

783
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:40,075
(Then go to Pizza Hut.)

784
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:41,276
You came here,

785
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:43,685
but you keep saying...

786
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,286
- that it's not right.
- I'm just saying my opinion.

787
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:48,015
Why if this is real?

788
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,786
- I bet it's fake.
- It clearly seems fake, right?

789
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,825
- This place is real.
- What? It's real?

790
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,256
- It's real.
- How so?

791
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,426
I have a hunch that it's real.

792
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:55,956
Her sixth sense is...

793
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,226
What do you think, Hye Young?

794
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:58,866
Is it fake?

795
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,196
It tastes good.

796
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:01,995
- It tastes good, but...
- Yes, it's good.

797
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,265
But it doesn't taste like pizza.

798
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:04,706
- Right, it's not pizza.
- Right?

799
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,135
This isn't pizza.

800
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,805
It does taste like pizza.

801
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:08,975
It tastes like pizza.

802
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:10,275
(Disagreeing)

803
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,546
It tastes good.

804
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,345
- All of a sudden?
- No, I mean...

805
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:14,616
It tastes good.

806
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:16,415
The seasoned cockles taste good.

807
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,416
- After not even a minute...
- What I mean is...

808
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,985
In Seok Jin, there are two people in dispute.

809
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:22,256
(In Seok Jin, there are two people in dispute.)

810
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:24,886
The one in the beginning was real Seok Jin.

811
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:27,326
- The one after that was him on TV.
- Just now?

812
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:29,155
(Real, fake)

813
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:30,325
When you hear him talk,

814
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:31,596
it sounds like two people are talking.

815
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,695
He says that it's delicious, but it's not.

816
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,265
"No, that's not it."

817
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:36,365
"Yes, it's like pizza."

818
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:37,936
(That's hilarious.)

819
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,876
If this is fake,

820
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,575
- this episode is...
- What?

821
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:43,676
a little easy.

822
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:45,305
- How is it easy?
- It's easy?

823
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:46,475
It seems so fake.

824
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:47,616
Wait until we go...

825
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:49,145
- It will be the same.
- to the 2nd or the 3rd place.

826
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:50,285
- You'll think that they're fake.
- They will also seem fake.

827
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:51,715
Then I'll change my mind.

828
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,816
(Then I'll change my mind.)

829
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:55,185
I'm just talking about the present.

830
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:56,725
I haven't been there yet.

831
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:57,956
Nice.

832
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,525
You two don't get along at all.

833
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:00,726
Not at all.

834
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:04,265
(In the midst of an animated discussion)

835
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,565
- Here's another pizza.
- Okay.

836
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:06,765
- Okay.
- Let's try it.

837
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:07,866
It's another pizza.

838
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,636
Is it a regular pizza?

839
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:10,805
- Cilantro?
- Is it cilantro?

840
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,266
It's pizza with cilantro on top.

841
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:14,935
Mutton...

842
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:16,205
- Mutton?
- It smells like mutton.

843
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:17,505
- It's not mutton...
- I like mutton.

844
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:19,045
- I love mutton.
- Is it mutton?

845
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:20,516
- It's not mutton.
- That's a relief.

846
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,645
I mixed pork with spices.

847
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:24,916
(Topped with pork mixed with spices)

848
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:27,856
I created a pizza that tastes like mutton.

849
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,655
To make it look nice,

850
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:33,595
I tore and added cilantro on top.

851
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:36,926
(Mutton pizza)

852
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:38,726
It smells like mutton.

853
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:39,965
There's no mutton,

854
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:40,995
- but it tastes like it?
- Yes.

855
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:42,905
How could it taste like mutton without any?

856
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,005
Is there pizza that tastes like mutton?

857
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:45,235
How is it possible?

858
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:46,835
This is ridiculous.

859
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:48,775
- Let's try it. First...
- Thank you.

860
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,775
- The cilantro...
- It's freshly made.

861
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:52,305
As I always say...

862
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:53,416
This is it.

863
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:54,615
First of all,

864
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,246
bring me your plate.

865
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:57,815
- The elderly first.
- The cheese...

866
00:28:57,816 --> 00:28:58,885
It's okay.

867
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:00,815
- Why don't you...
- Don't do that.

868
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:01,915
Don't do it.

869
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,256
I'll take it.

870
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:05,326
I'll take it.

871
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,055
(What?)

872
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:09,796
Seok Jin was ready to take it.

873
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,596
He was ready to take it.

874
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,166
He said not to do it, so don't do it.

875
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:14,565
All right. Don't do it.

876
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,595
(The next piece is...)

877
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,035
(for Hye Young.)

878
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:18,435
Are you really not doing it?

879
00:29:18,436 --> 00:29:20,036
Why would he? You told him not to.

880
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:22,135
- Don't do what he tells you not to.
- Okay.

881
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,605
Listen to him.

882
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,276
Listening to the elderly won't hurt.

883
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,676
(Turning away like a boomerang)

884
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:30,545
- I will take it.
- Of course.

885
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:31,686
- Okay.
- I'd be happy to.

886
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,155
Goodness.

887
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:34,156
I'd be happy to take it.

888
00:29:34,157 --> 00:29:35,655
- Still...
- I'd be happy to.

889
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:37,056
- You can stop there.
- Yes.

890
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:38,385
- Still...
- Don't serve him.

891
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:39,386
Goodness.

892
00:29:39,387 --> 00:29:41,195
(The last one is for me.)

893
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,595
- Okay.
- It's close to you.

894
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:43,695
Sure. Don't do it.

895
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,595
- Don't do it.
- Don't do it.

896
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:46,665
- Okay.
- I can serve myself.

897
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,196
Don't even say goodbye to him when we go home.

898
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:50,665
- He doesn't like it.
- I don't like it.

899
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,706
He doesn't like it. Don't do it. Leave him alone.

900
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:54,935
He will call me after a long time.

901
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:56,006
"Kyeong Hwan."

902
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:57,806
Wait, let's taste it.

903
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,846
(How is the pizza that tastes like mutton?)

904
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,016
Wait a minute.

905
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:05,346
It's delicious.

906
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,515
(Both of his eyes widen.)

907
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:09,355
- Is it good?
- I like the combination.

908
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:10,386
It tastes like...

909
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,995
- a panini.
- You have to eat it with cilantro.

910
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:14,196
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

911
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,096
They go well together.

912
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:20,035
- It goes well with cilantro.
- This is good.

913
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:21,796
- It's very delicious.
- It's good.

914
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,735
- It smells like mutton.
- Yes, the smell is strong.

915
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,306
- How does it smell like mutton?
- I can't eat mutton.

916
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,305
You keep repeating...

917
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:30,446
- what everyone says.
- Like a parrot.

918
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:32,506
My question is how is it possible?

919
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,446
Seok Jin is on my shoulder.

920
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:36,986
How does it taste like mutton?

921
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:39,286
- It has no mutton.
- Hye Young can't stop laughing.

922
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,855
Hye Young, was it funny?

923
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:42,185
(It's fine as long as it made Hye Young laugh.)

924
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:43,626
He's on my shoulder.

925
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:45,755
I can eat it...

926
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,025
because it doesn't have that strong and unique taste of mutton.

927
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:50,096
There's a strong, particular flavor.

928
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:52,996
- It only has the smell.
- Cilantro is a must.

929
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,335
It's much better with it.

930
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:55,496
- Surprisingly...
- Yes.

931
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:57,766
Here's what I don't understand.

932
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,135
Why doesn't he just add mutton?

933
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,206
Why does he make it taste like mutton...

934
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:04,206
- Exactly.
- with a different type of meat?

935
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:05,445
He could use mutton.

936
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,815
Some people might not like mutton.

937
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,215
Some really hate mutton.

938
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:13,785
When it comes to ordering meat...

939
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:15,586
How shall I put it?

940
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:18,156
He might have his reason.

941
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:20,725
- For what reason...
- I don't know that either.

942
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:22,195
Explain in detail.

943
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:24,396
(I don't know that either.)

944
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,895
- I bet...
- I can understand, but...

945
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:28,436
the owner's MBTI is INTP.

946
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,806
- INTP?
- How do you know?

947
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:34,135
He must be INTP but diligent.

948
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:35,276
Ask him.

949
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:37,306
- Sir?
- Yes?

950
00:31:37,846 --> 00:31:39,176
What's your MBTI?

951
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,216
It's INTP.

952
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,915
(She hits the mark.)

953
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,386
- How did you guess?
- Seriously?

954
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:47,385
- Really?
- Did you hear what she said before?

955
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:48,386
No way.

956
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:49,726
- Is he another parrot?
- Isn't it INTP?

957
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:52,056
Is he a parrot?

958
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,526
- Why you...
- Sir.

959
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:57,096
- We have a question.
- I was just playing along.

960
00:31:57,296 --> 00:31:59,395
Sir, we have a question.

961
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:01,696
To make it taste like mutton,

962
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,835
you can add mutton to it.

963
00:32:03,836 --> 00:32:07,475
Why do you use different meat to make it taste like mutton?

964
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,536
It's expensive.

965
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,906
- Is mutton expensive?
- What did I tell you?

966
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:12,745
Wasn't I right?

967
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,015
Now I can understand.

968
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,846
- Because of the cost...
- Because it's expensive?

969
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:18,616
- You aren't INTP, are you?
- I am.

970
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:20,055
- Is it true?
- He's definitely INTP.

971
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:21,285
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

972
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:22,355
Based on the composition...

973
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:23,425
- of the menu, - Does it show that he's INTP?

974
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:24,825
he's INTP.

975
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:27,596
He could've used mutton and increased the price,

976
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:29,225
but he doesn't because it's expensive.

977
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,826
Due to a personal reason...

978
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:33,195
- It's his preference.
- He's nodding.

979
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,865
Right? As it's his preference...

980
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:35,866
- It's fascinating.
- Is that why?

981
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,165
He found his idea brilliant.

982
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,735
After making it, he said,

983
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:43,176
"Try it. This is a strange type of pizza that I made."

984
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:45,175
When people like it, he isn't surprised.

985
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:47,616
When people don't like it, they don't know what tastes good.

986
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:49,785
That's how he feels.

987
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:50,985
(The INTP type agrees.)

988
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:52,045
Oh, my.

989
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,316
- Hye Young.
- She's so sharp.

990
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,485
In his head, he has more ideas...

991
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:57,185
- like this.
- In that case...

992
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:58,925
He has a thousand recipes in his head.

993
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,425
Does it mean that this pizza was created like that?

994
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:02,426
(Is the seasoned cockle pizza a real dish by the INTP owner?)

995
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:05,125
The production crew saw right through it.

996
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:08,666
They realized that the restaurant was run by an INTP.

997
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,905
They saw right through it,

998
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,705
- and they asked him...
- The restaurant name...

999
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:15,375
- should change to INTP Pizza.
- Right.

1000
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,945
(Is this the production crew's design that pierced through...)

1001
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:18,276
(the psychology of an INTP?)

1002
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,546
Hye Young, have you always been this talkative?

1003
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,816
Then why did you get such a role?

1004
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,186
- This is how you really are.
- Won Ho.

1005
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:29,616
Hye Young is very talkative.

1006
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:31,226
Let it all out here.

1007
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,555
When did the owner leave?

1008
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:35,056
He was just here.

1009
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:36,595
Is this typical of an INTP?

1010
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,065
He isn't interested...

1011
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,835
in what people say.

1012
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:42,535
"Since they're not talking about me, I don't have to be here anymore."

1013
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:44,606
That's why he left right away.

1014
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:46,875
- She's somewhat observant.
- Hye Young is sharp.

1015
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,376
Also, they're usually lazy.

1016
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,675
- An INTP is lazy.
- He might hear you.

1017
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:51,975
- An ISFP...
- All of them are...

1018
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,615
An ISFP is also very lazy.

1019
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,145
- They're all lazy.
- ISFP.

1020
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:57,516
But he put it into practice.

1021
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:58,715
That's why...

1022
00:33:58,716 --> 00:34:00,455
- I'd like to...
- I'm also INTP.

1023
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,456
Right?

1024
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,715
While listening to her, I thought...

1025
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:04,955
- "Is she talking about me?" - Does it describe you?

1026
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,325
- Are you lazy?
- I'm INTP.

1027
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:08,455
I'm lazy, but I try to be diligent.

1028
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,625
- They're lazy, - I can't get up in the morning.

1029
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:10,725
but they do what they have to do.

1030
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:12,495
- They do what they have to do.
- Of course.

1031
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,495
Then what's your MBTI, Hye Young?

1032
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,605
- I'm INTJ.
- INTJ?

1033
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:18,106
- TJ is worse than me.
- Yes.

1034
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,135
(Did you hear that?)

1035
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:21,306
She's being competitive.

1036
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:22,735
How is TJ worse?

1037
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,706
TJ type is...

1038
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:27,115
- much more detailed.
- They're the judging type.

1039
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:28,245
They're the judging type.

1040
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,985
- You're the opposite of me.
- You must be intense.

1041
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,315
You're the complete opposite.

1042
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:33,455
- Are you ESFP?
- I'm ESFP.

1043
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:35,086
- I'm ESFP.
- I'm ISFP.

1044
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,355
- What about you?
- I'm ISFJ.

1045
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:39,456
- ISFJ?
- We're all different.

1046
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:41,495
I'm INFJ.

1047
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,725
- INFJ?
- INFJ?

1048
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:44,226
- We're all different.
- All of us are different.

1049
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:45,926
We might have a fight today.

1050
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:47,895
- Right?
- Go ahead.

1051
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,665
One of you is going down today.

1052
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,536
- Throw over the table.
- Whoever it may be...

1053
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,676
Since the opening segment,

1054
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:56,136
- it's unbalanced.
- It's unbalanced.

1055
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:57,946
I'm worried.

1056
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:59,746
- I'm worried.
- I'm worried.

1057
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:01,245
- I'm worried.
- The more I eat,

1058
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:02,376
the more confused I get.

1059
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:03,715
Shall we go to the next place?

1060
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:04,915
- Yes.
- I can't tell.

1061
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,945
Let's go.

1062
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:07,556
(1. A menu made by Hong Seok Cheon? 2. A fake menu based on...)

1063
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:11,485
We're going to get street food that's popular in this neighborhood.

1064
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,685
Is that so?

1065
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:13,695
Nice.

1066
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,695
- Can we eat without suspecting?
- Exactly.

1067
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,696
- Okay.
- But if you eat too much,

1068
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,465
you'll talk less and less.

1069
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:19,496
Okay.

1070
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,835
I bet this is where...

1071
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,465
- young people come on weekends.
- Right?

1072
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,865
- Doesn't it have that vibe?
- I agree.

1073
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:26,775
Isn't it obvious that...

1074
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,276
many people come here on weekends?

1075
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:30,406
- You're stating the obvious.
- That's why I said it.

1076
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:32,506
- That's so obvious.
- Can't I say something obvious?

1077
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,446
You say so many things that are obvious.

1078
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:35,676
Hello.

1079
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:37,816
Why did you say hello when there's no one?

1080
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:40,515
He's polite by habit.

1081
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:42,315
- Do you see something?
- Seok Jin.

1082
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:44,025
Even if you see something, don't follow it.

1083
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,685
I mean, there's no one.

1084
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,055
Go home first.

1085
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:49,025
There wasn't anyone, but he said hello.

1086
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:50,565
To whom are you saying hello?

1087
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,826
- Hello.
- To whom?

1088
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:54,936
- That's so funny.
- The cameras are filming us.

1089
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,165
- What can we buy?
- In Gangneung...

1090
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,766
Seok Jin used to sell jeans.

1091
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:00,405
- I ran a store that sold jeans.
- He did?

1092
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:01,775
- You sold jeans?
- Of course.

1093
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:02,805
You know what?

1094
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:04,576
Because of your outfit,

1095
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:06,275
I didn't recognize who you were.

1096
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:07,316
That's...

1097
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:09,776
- You don't look like a celebrity.
- I was wondering...

1098
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,686
why a middle-aged man was with us.

1099
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,246
Excuse me.

1100
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:15,155
Move out of my way.

1101
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:17,885
You should go to a hair salon, Kyeong Hwan.

1102
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,626
I was doomed from the start today.

1103
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:21,496
I'm doomed.

1104
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,766
Why are you always doomed?

1105
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:26,225
- It must be a potato place.
- "Gangneung-gil Potato."

1106
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,195
- What's this?
- It's tornado potatoes.

1107
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:29,396
Tornado potatoes.

1108
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:32,706
(What is this place that's covered with potatoes?)

1109
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:34,835
(It became popular for its street food...)

1110
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:36,976
(made with potatoes from Gangwon Province.)

1111
00:36:37,246 --> 00:36:39,346
(Full of waiting customers even on weekdays)

1112
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:41,115
(The most popular place in Gangneung these days)

1113
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,645
(You must visit this place when traveling in Gangneung.)

1114
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:44,585
- I've seen this place.
- Isn't this real?

1115
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:45,615
- This is real.
- It's real.

1116
00:36:45,616 --> 00:36:46,756
It's real, right?

1117
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:49,656
- I'll touch it.
- Okay.

1118
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:51,755
Cup potatoes...

1119
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:53,655
- and sausage...
- Order one of each.

1120
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:55,056
- What's the difference?
- Order a variety of things.

1121
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:56,895
Buldak mayo is the best.

1122
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:57,995
- "Buldak mayo?" - Yes.

1123
00:36:57,996 --> 00:37:00,135
If you don't like spicy food, I recommend garlic soy sauce.

1124
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,535
- Garlic soy sauce?
- I want buldak mayo.

1125
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:02,566
Can we get two of these?

1126
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:05,365
It's time for Jae Seok to spend money.

1127
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:06,606
Right.

1128
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:08,735
- Are you really paying?
- Yes.

1129
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,805
- It's real.
- It's real.

1130
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:11,046
- Thank you.
- I paid.

1131
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,576
Mom, Mr. Jae Seok bought me...

1132
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:15,345
- potatoes.
- "Mr. Jae Seok?"

1133
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:16,785
I can buy them for you too.

1134
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:17,815
I made it.

1135
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:19,785
Seok Jin hasn't bought us anything yet.

1136
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:22,756
- Not yet? Buy us something today.
- I'll get a chance.

1137
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:25,156
- Shall we go next door?
- Jae Seok paid.

1138
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:27,556
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1139
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:29,796
- Is this another place?
- After you make an order...

1140
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:31,965
- Is this it?
- Like this?

1141
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,366
After making an order over there?

1142
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:35,195
Instead of that place...

1143
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:36,595
- I think so.
- Here you go.

1144
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:37,865
Thank you.

1145
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:38,906
It looks delicious.

1146
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,806
- It's different.
- It's different.

1147
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:45,706
(Corn dog in the shape of a tornado made with potato dough)

1148
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:50,416
(Covered with buldak mayo and garlic soy sauce)

1149
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:53,486
(Sausage potatoes)

1150
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,715
- They look very unusual.
- This is amazing.

1151
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:58,785
- It's not tornado potatoes.
- This is different.

1152
00:37:58,786 --> 00:37:59,826
This is...

1153
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,525
- It's more like a corn dog.
- Try it.

1154
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:03,666
It's a corn dog made with potatoes.

1155
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,225
There's a sausage inside.

1156
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,136
(There's a sausage inside the potatoes.)

1157
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:11,306
(The sausage is wrapped with 100-percent potato dough.)

1158
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:16,706
(The sausage potato gets ready when deep-fried in oil.)

1159
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:18,945
(And a variety of sauces you can choose)

1160
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:21,876
(Spicy fried chicken, basil mayo, garlic soy sauce, ketchup)

1161
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,746
(I am the trendy hot item in Gangneung.)

1162
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:26,245
Who likes spicy food?

1163
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:27,456
- Who likes spicy food?
- Me.

1164
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,616
It's a corn dog made with potatoes.

1165
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:31,655
How does it taste?

1166
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:34,196
(Chewy)

1167
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,426
- How does it taste?
- It's good. Try it.

1168
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,825
It looks very good.

1169
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,066
(Stretching)

1170
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:42,836
(Exclaiming)

1171
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,806
(What is this?)

1172
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,335
This is amazing.

1173
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:49,336
(Clapping automatically)

1174
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:51,375
(Everyone is in awe.)

1175
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:52,376
(Humming)

1176
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:54,915
- This is really good.
- Yes.

1177
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,615
- How is this so chewy?
- It's very good.

1178
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:57,616
My gosh.

1179
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,486
(A fantastic combo of chewy potatoes and a crunchy sausage)

1180
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:02,315
The dough is potatoes, not flour.

1181
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,425
(Extremely excited)

1182
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,486
This is amazing.

1183
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:07,055
I'm sorry, but you haven't tried it.

1184
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:08,056
(Laughing)

1185
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,455
- Based on the look.
- Based on the look?

1186
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:11,025
- I thought you tried it.
- Me too.

1187
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:12,996
- I thought you already tried it.
- Just the look of it.

1188
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:15,366
- This is exactly like...
- The dough tastes like potato jeon.

1189
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,306
- The outside is potato jeon.
- Yes.

1190
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:18,865
More than potato jeon...

1191
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:20,505
- How shall I put it?
- It's softer.

1192
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:21,805
It's softer than that.

1193
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:23,845
The texture is very fascinating.

1194
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:25,375
- It's like sticky rice.
- It's literally...

1195
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:28,676
(Nice and chewy)

1196
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:30,685
Thank you so much. Wait, what's that?

1197
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:32,145
These are cup potato bites.

1198
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:33,186
Wait, that...

1199
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:36,786
(Another popular dish at this place)

1200
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,886
(The potato dough is pulled off into small knobs.)

1201
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:42,626
(Fried until crisp in clean oil)

1202
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:46,166
(Cup potato bites)

1203
00:39:46,596 --> 00:39:49,966
(A trendy dish with younger people)

1204
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:52,035
This is a lot like ongsimi.

1205
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:53,036
(They look very similar to ongsimi, which are potato balls.)

1206
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:56,576
(What do they taste like?)

1207
00:39:56,976 --> 00:40:00,745
(Jae Seok tries one first.)

1208
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:03,746
- It's like sticky rice cake.
- Yes, it's like rice cake.

1209
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:05,645
This is so good.

1210
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:07,855
This is so soft. It reminds me of a chewy potato jeon.

1211
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:10,016
(It stretches like sticky rice cake.)

1212
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:12,555
(Taking a bite)

1213
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:13,795
(Chewy)

1214
00:40:13,796 --> 00:40:16,256
(Feeling the chewiness in every bite)

1215
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:17,425
- This is really good.
- I agree.

1216
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,065
How can it be this nice and chewy?

1217
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,836
(Fascinated)

1218
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:23,065
Judging by how the food tastes, this place must be popular.

1219
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:25,565
- It's so good.
- How can it be this nice and chewy?

1220
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:27,075
The texture is what keeps me...

1221
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:28,675
- coming back.
- It's the best.

1222
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,775
It's chewy.

1223
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:32,745
I recommend this spicy sauce.

1224
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,646
- It's better with the sauce.
- I should try it.

1225
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:37,115
Why didn't you try it earlier?

1226
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:38,685
- You said you can't eat spicy food.
- I saw you enjoy it.

1227
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,686
Come on.

1228
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:42,555
- Who likes spicy food?
- Me.

1229
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:43,855
(Earlier, Kyeong Hwan avoided anything spicy.)

1230
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:45,255
- What about you?
- I can't handle spicy food.

1231
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,256
(Mimi can't handle spicy food.)

1232
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,996
I thought you couldn't handle spicy food.

1233
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:49,555
I'll try that then.

1234
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:50,896
(She took the spicy one to help Kyeong Hwan out.)

1235
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:52,295
(The spiciness is too much for her.)

1236
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:53,765
- No way.
- When did you open?

1237
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:54,796
It's so spicy.

1238
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,135
He said he wouldn't have the spicy one,

1239
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:58,565
so he kept the soy sauce one.

1240
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,875
Then he suddenly got hooked on the buldak sauce.

1241
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,476
You're a regular while I'm a guest here.

1242
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:06,576
Is it too much to ask for some consideration?

1243
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,376
He's just an old man in town,

1244
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:12,015
- and...
- Let me talk, will you?

1245
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:13,385
- Mister.
- Shut it.

1246
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:15,655
Just eat the potatoes and get going, mister.

1247
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,186
Why treat me this way when we're both getting older?

1248
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:20,795
Shop owners these days are incredible.

1249
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:21,796
(Shop owners these days are incredible.)

1250
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:23,726
I think this will sell well overseas.

1251
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:28,035
I once sold corn dogs in the US.

1252
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:29,665
- Of course. I saw that.
- On a show.

1253
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:31,405
- How was it?
- They were crazy about it.

1254
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,506
Really?

1255
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:36,436
(Kyeong Hwan sold corn dogs on a variety show in the US.)

1256
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:40,546
(The Korean hot dog was a huge hit.)

1257
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:42,175
It was the most popular dish.

1258
00:41:42,176 --> 00:41:44,016
You should've stayed there selling those.

1259
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:46,016
Why did you come back?

1260
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:48,786
You would have a much better career.

1261
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,726
I'm a man with a dream.

1262
00:41:52,656 --> 00:41:53,656
You know that, right?

1263
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:55,526
(I'm a man with a dream.)

1264
00:41:55,656 --> 00:41:57,966
Mr. I Have a Dream.

1265
00:41:58,526 --> 00:42:00,696
I'm not sleep...

1266
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:02,496
yet.

1267
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:05,006
- You're not what?
- Yet.

1268
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:08,575
- He's not sleep?
- He's not sleep.

1269
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,875
- "I'm not sleep." - He's not sleep.

1270
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:11,876
- He's not sleep.
- He's not sleep.

1271
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,145
If you focus on the wrong words like that,

1272
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:14,415
you'll never gain confidence speaking English.

1273
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,746
You should still know what mistakes you made.

1274
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:18,416
I'll figure it out at home.

1275
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:20,585
Anyway, we enjoyed everything.

1276
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:22,685
(Shall we head to the second location?)

1277
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:24,356
Shall we head to the next location?

1278
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,226
I have a feeling we'll get it right today.

1279
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,395
- We have Hye Young to lean on.
- Exactly.

1280
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:30,695
I haven't seen anyone as sharp as her before.

1281
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:32,065
- That's right.
- I agree.

1282
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:33,165
I think we'll get it right too.

1283
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,935
Somehow, I've become the brains of the group.

1284
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:36,466
Hye Young really impressed me.

1285
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:38,535
I don't know who she'll end up dating,

1286
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:39,636
but he's done for.

1287
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,805
Just look at her analyzing every move.

1288
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:43,006
He shouldn't ever lie.

1289
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:44,846
No way. Don't ever lie.

1290
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,275
The moment I find out he's lying,

1291
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:48,545
- I'll end it.
- Right?

1292
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:49,645
She sounds like a real profiler.

1293
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:51,815
From that moment, I'd mentally press rewind...

1294
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,285
- and figure out...
- Press rewind?

1295
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:54,756
why he acted the way he did.

1296
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:56,885
Earlier, Seok Jin said quietly...

1297
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,226
that she was like a shaman.

1298
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:01,126
I wasn't kidding.

1299
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:03,455
That's hilarious.

1300
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,625
(A shaman among the soft-hearted)

1301
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,566
Over there. That's the famous hotel.

1302
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:09,695
- No way.
- What a view.

1303
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:10,705
(A serene view of the lake appears before them.)

1304
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:13,335
I can't believe it. Wait, isn't this a lake?

1305
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:14,776
It doesn't look like the sea.

1306
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:16,576
Seok Jin, this is a lake.

1307
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:18,175
The lake's right next to the beach.

1308
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:19,646
(Beside the lake is the blue Gyeongpo Beach.)

1309
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,276
I came here for my summer vacation this year.

1310
00:43:21,746 --> 00:43:22,815
- Really?
- Really?

1311
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:24,515
- Yes, this is the place.
- Did you come here?

1312
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:26,585
Yes, I took photos and painted.

1313
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,355
This is where I got my inspiration.

1314
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,986
(Inspired by the Gangneung sea last summer,)

1315
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:34,496
(Kyung Pyo held an exhibition of his artwork.)

1316
00:43:34,626 --> 00:43:36,426
Ko Kyung Pyo and Gyeongpo Pavilion.

1317
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:37,996
That has a nice ring to it.

1318
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:39,795
- Kyung Pyo and Gyeongpo Pavilion.
- Is it Kyungpo Pavilion?

1319
00:43:39,796 --> 00:43:40,835
It's the perfect spot.

1320
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,435
This place reminds me...

1321
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:45,106
of when I came here with my wife while we were dating.

1322
00:43:45,966 --> 00:43:47,006
We had rockfish stew.

1323
00:43:47,776 --> 00:43:48,935
- Rockfish stew?
- It takes me back...

1324
00:43:48,936 --> 00:43:50,075
to when we had spicy rockfish stew.

1325
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:51,146
I see your wife cried.

1326
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:53,446
- She cried?
- What are you talking about?

1327
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:56,945
- Accept the joke, will you?
- What was that?

1328
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:58,886
- He completely blocked it.
- Why did you block it?

1329
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,456
Why?

1330
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,586
He was like, "What was that?"

1331
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:04,025
- Kyeong Hwan.
- Yes?

1332
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:05,985
- That was a decent joke.
- Sure.

1333
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:08,255
It might've been funny if he had played along with it.

1334
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:11,266
- But the way he refused...
- I mean, that was cold.

1335
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:14,536
Look at the shimmering light on the water. See it sparkle.

1336
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:17,065
The Korean word for that is beautiful.

1337
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:18,206
Is that called "yunseul?"

1338
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:21,175
Yes, yunseul.

1339
00:44:21,176 --> 00:44:22,176
(Shimmering light on the water, like glitter)

1340
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:23,975
- Look at it sparkle.
- It's beautiful.

1341
00:44:23,976 --> 00:44:25,006
It's so pretty.

1342
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:26,946
- Is that called "yunseul?" - That's right.

1343
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:28,976
Seok Jin, do you remember Yun Seul?

1344
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:31,646
That was a long time ago.

1345
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:33,645
He's playing along.

1346
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:34,816
Yun Seul, how have you been?

1347
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:37,856
His mood swings every few seconds.

1348
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,926
Some viewers might actually think that's true.

1349
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:45,425
Wait, isn't this near the Chodang soft tofu district?

1350
00:44:45,426 --> 00:44:46,925
See? You can see the signs now.

1351
00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:49,136
There are a few famous restaurants around here.

1352
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:51,306
- Chodang...
- That's right.

1353
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,035
- Is Chodang around here?
- Here. The streets.

1354
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:55,175
It must be around here.

1355
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:56,576
Where are we going next?

1356
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:59,406
- Our next destination?
- Let's have soft tofu.

1357
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:04,216
- Otak! I mean On...
- Oh, it's the tiramisu.

1358
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:06,085
- Hot Bath...
- Mimi?

1359
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:07,685
- Mimi?
- Let's do better.

1360
00:45:07,686 --> 00:45:09,015
- You're a rapper, aren't you?
- Take it slow.

1361
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:11,726
Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath.

1362
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:13,655
- A hot bath?
- A hot bath...

1363
00:45:13,656 --> 00:45:15,995
- Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath.
- There's a drawing of a pot.

1364
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:17,296
- A steaming pot.
- Then,

1365
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:19,565
is tiramisu served in a hot pot?

1366
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:22,196
Do you think it's a stew or soup with innards or roe?

1367
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:24,235
My gosh, please no!

1368
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:25,335
Please no.

1369
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,335
We'd be doing tiramisu wrong.

1370
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:28,535
To be honest...

1371
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:30,746
This is it. This is the place.

1372
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:34,276
Wait, what's this? Bean pork bone stew?

1373
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:35,645
(What?)

1374
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:36,915
(As they approach, a sign comes into view.)

1375
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,845
Pork bone stew?

1376
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:39,846
(Pork bone stew?)

1377
00:45:39,847 --> 00:45:41,286
But we were told that it was tiramisu.

1378
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:42,816
Is it in the stew?

1379
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:45,685
- Is there tiramisu in the stew?
- Please no.

1380
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:46,985
- That's just...
- No way.

1381
00:45:46,986 --> 00:45:48,395
- That'd be the worst.
- That makes no sense.

1382
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:50,395
- Aren't I right?
- Gosh, no!

1383
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:51,725
Unbelievable.

1384
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:52,865
I thought it'd be in milk.

1385
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:54,465
I knew it wouldn't be a real bath.

1386
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:57,365
I'm sure it'll be delicious. I'm just not fond of the approach.

1387
00:45:57,366 --> 00:45:59,265
Everyone's angry.

1388
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:00,536
- This won't be easy.
- I highly doubt it.

1389
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:01,705
- No way.
- That makes no sense.

1390
00:46:01,706 --> 00:46:03,106
It wouldn't be in a pork bone stew.

1391
00:46:03,276 --> 00:46:05,675
It's just wrong.

1392
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:07,546
(Seok Jin hurries to the front door.)

1393
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:10,445
Hey, hold on.

1394
00:46:10,446 --> 00:46:11,446
(Did he spot something?)

1395
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,286
(What is it?)

1396
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:16,656
Chef Lee Won Il's autograph is here as well.

1397
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:17,826
What?

1398
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:19,056
Here too?

1399
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:21,956
- Chef Lee Won Il and...
- And Ryu Geun Il.

1400
00:46:22,426 --> 00:46:25,496
(Inside the mysterious pork bone stew place)

1401
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:29,666
(Chef Lee Won Il's autograph greets them again.)

1402
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:31,765
I don't see one from Seok Cheon,

1403
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:32,836
so they must not have come here together.

1404
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:36,835
(Lee Won Il greets them a second time.)

1405
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,976
There's a separate dish made with aged kimchi.

1406
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:40,276
Hold on.

1407
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:42,416
Wait, the photos.

1408
00:46:43,146 --> 00:46:44,486
Don't the photos seem a bit off?

1409
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,186
- How does tiramisu fit in?
- They seem awkward in them.

1410
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,285
They were taken recently.

1411
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:52,286
(A: Photos that seem like they were taken recently)

1412
00:46:52,386 --> 00:46:54,226
Doesn't this millstone look unused?

1413
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:56,995
- It's only for show.
- It's purely decorative.

1414
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:57,996
(B: A decorative display of a millstone)

1415
00:46:57,997 --> 00:47:00,795
It's been featured on many TV shows.

1416
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:02,266
(C: A popular restaurant featured on many TV shows?)

1417
00:47:02,796 --> 00:47:06,036
(A mysterious tiramisu pork bone stew restaurant)

1418
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:08,075
I don't smell any tiramisu.

1419
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,105
(Where's the tiramisu?)

1420
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:11,205
- But...
- I smell cheonggukjang though.

1421
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:13,176
- Exactly. I smell that too.
- I can smell the beans.

1422
00:47:13,606 --> 00:47:17,245
(Tiramisu)

1423
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:18,315
Let's take a seat for now.

1424
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:20,816
(What's the secret behind Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath?)

1425
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:22,785
Doesn't tiramisu...

1426
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:24,556
- in a pork bone stew sound off?
- That's...

1427
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:27,055
There isn't anything that says tiramisu.

1428
00:47:27,056 --> 00:47:28,925
You can't see it anywhere.

1429
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:31,465
There's an option for extra Chodang beans.

1430
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:33,766
- Extra Chodang beans.
- It's linked to Chodang somehow.

1431
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:35,996
Wouldn't that be it? Or maybe not.

1432
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:39,036
"Heart, Star, Bear, Rabbit, choose one."

1433
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:40,805
(Choose your topping!)

1434
00:47:40,806 --> 00:47:42,176
(Heart, Star, Bear, Rabbit, choose one.)

1435
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:46,806
(A strange menu displayed on one side of the restaurant)

1436
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:49,716
(Staring)

1437
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:52,146
That must be it!

1438
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:53,815
(Did you find...)

1439
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,455
(the tiramisu?)

1440
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,486
Similar to latte art, with powdered images on top,

1441
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:00,926
it's added here as a topping using a stencil.

1442
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:03,455
(Stencil printing: An art method...)

1443
00:48:03,456 --> 00:48:05,565
(that uses a stencil as a template to apply paint...)

1444
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,736
(and form images or letters)

1445
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:12,636
(It's often used to decorate desserts.)

1446
00:48:13,206 --> 00:48:15,675
(You see it used to decorate the tops of tiramisu too.)

1447
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:16,776
Really?

1448
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:18,245
Hence the tiramisu reference.

1449
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,876
That's why we can choose the shape of the topping.

1450
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:23,946
(Is Hye Young right about this?)

1451
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:25,916
That's very sharp of you.

1452
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:28,216
She's not as dense as we are.

1453
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:29,816
She's different.

1454
00:48:29,817 --> 00:48:31,785
(We're dense.)

1455
00:48:31,786 --> 00:48:32,786
That's very sharp of her.

1456
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:34,655
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

1457
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:36,055
- Gosh, hello.
- You're the second-generation...

1458
00:48:36,056 --> 00:48:37,056
owner shown in the photo.

1459
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:38,596
- That's right.
- Sir,

1460
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:40,525
our keyword was Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath.

1461
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:41,566
Can you explain what that means?

1462
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:44,305
Unlike typical pork bone stew,

1463
00:48:44,306 --> 00:48:47,635
this is served with soybeans that look like tiramisu...

1464
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,975
to elevate the savory flavors.

1465
00:48:49,976 --> 00:48:51,306
Soybeans?

1466
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:54,745
It's served with soybeans, not actual tiramisu.

1467
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:56,976
We mold the freshly ground beans.

1468
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:59,545
For instance, he molds it into a heart.

1469
00:48:59,546 --> 00:49:00,546
(It's formed in a mold.)

1470
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,615
What a relief.

1471
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:03,616
Isn't it a relief?

1472
00:49:03,617 --> 00:49:04,625
(He's finally smiling again.)

1473
00:49:04,626 --> 00:49:06,825
How did you come up with this dish?

1474
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:09,995
My mother ran the restaurant before me,

1475
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:12,365
and the ground beans were simply added as a dollop.

1476
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,396
(Pork bone stew with beans, version 1.0)

1477
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:15,795
To appeal to a younger generation,

1478
00:49:15,796 --> 00:49:17,706
it needed to go viral on social media.

1479
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,175
(How did he upgrade it visually?)

1480
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:23,276
There's something else we're curious about.

1481
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:25,246
Was Chef Lee Won Il here?

1482
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:28,516
(His name reappears after the previous restaurant.)

1483
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:30,145
When our restaurant went viral,

1484
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:31,586
he came to try the food.

1485
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:33,785
He didn't visit by chance.

1486
00:49:33,786 --> 00:49:35,755
- He chose to come here.
- He knew what he wanted to try.

1487
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:38,025
He knew about our restaurant, so he came and had the food.

1488
00:49:38,026 --> 00:49:40,025
I'm curious. Can we try the food?

1489
00:49:40,026 --> 00:49:41,896
- Okay, I'll have it ready.
- Thank you.

1490
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:43,856
This place feels real.

1491
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:45,326
I think it's real here.

1492
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:47,535
But the first place felt real too.

1493
00:49:47,536 --> 00:49:49,035
No. I think the first place is fake.

1494
00:49:49,036 --> 00:49:50,066
This place is real.

1495
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:53,135
Normally, pork bone stew restaurants...

1496
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:55,505
- don't smell of beans so strongly.
- Exactly.

1497
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:57,235
- It's pretty strong.
- The scent is very strong.

1498
00:49:57,236 --> 00:49:58,505
They couldn't have brought the beans today.

1499
00:49:58,506 --> 00:49:59,575
- You're right.
- No.

1500
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:01,845
You can't have this smell from just a day or two.

1501
00:50:01,846 --> 00:50:04,286
(At that moment, tiramisu pork bone stew arrives.)

1502
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:05,646
(Surprised)

1503
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:06,886
(Astonished)

1504
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:10,016
(How does tiramisu pork bone stew look like?)

1505
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:12,667
(At that moment, tiramisu pork bone stew arrives.)

1506
00:50:12,894 --> 00:50:14,034
(Surprised)

1507
00:50:14,164 --> 00:50:15,164
(Astonished)

1508
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,703
(How does tiramisu pork bone stew look like?)

1509
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:18,774
Why? How is it?

1510
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:20,273
- It's tofu.
- It's tofu.

1511
00:50:20,274 --> 00:50:21,343
- Tofu is made of beans, right?
- Yes.

1512
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:22,704
It's made of beans.

1513
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:26,425
(Tiramisu?)

1514
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:30,234
My restaurant is known for placing...

1515
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,005
heart-shaped ground beans on pork bone stew.

1516
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:35,775
(This is tiramisu pork bone stew.)

1517
00:50:36,235 --> 00:50:39,004
I served well-boiled pork bones.

1518
00:50:39,005 --> 00:50:40,044
(Well-boiled pork backbones)

1519
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:43,814
Since delicious food comes from fresh ingredients,

1520
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:46,684
I use beans harvested in Gangwon Province.

1521
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:47,715
(Beans are made in Gangwon Province.)

1522
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:51,924
(Soybeans ground finely using a grinder)

1523
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,054
Ground beans...

1524
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,194
are shaped using a heart-shaped mold.

1525
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:56,425
(Dive into a heart-shaped mold.)

1526
00:50:56,695 --> 00:50:59,525
(Press them down according to the mold's shape.)

1527
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:02,665
(It's reborn into a heart.)

1528
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:06,405
(Color the heart with chili powder.)

1529
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:10,434
(The most popular tiramisu in Gangneung)

1530
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,844
Young customers asked...

1531
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:15,014
if there were other shapes.

1532
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:16,774
So I tried rabbit-shaped beans...

1533
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:18,885
with faces and so on.

1534
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,614
It was well-received.

1535
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,114
(Various types of tiramisu pork bone stew are born.)

1536
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:23,384
After I started doing this,

1537
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:25,885
the revenue doubled.

1538
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:29,925
(It's very popular on social media too.)

1539
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,524
Sixth Sense members,

1540
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:32,994
is this place real?

1541
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:34,065
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1542
00:51:34,565 --> 00:51:35,964
- This...
- This is beans.

1543
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:37,334
It's beans, not tofu. Right?

1544
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,265
Yes, it's raw beans.

1545
00:51:39,665 --> 00:51:41,334
This is worth taking pictures.

1546
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:42,504
It looks like tiramisu.

1547
00:51:42,505 --> 00:51:44,675
- You took photos of it immediately.
- Yes, of course.

1548
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:48,515
(You can't help but take photos when you see this.)

1549
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:50,015
Please move aside.

1550
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:51,845
It's a bear.

1551
00:51:52,315 --> 00:51:53,315
(Look at the bear.)

1552
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:54,455
- It's cute.
- Look at this.

1553
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:56,785
(Hello.)

1554
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:00,455
(A bean bear on top of pork bone stew)

1555
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:02,724
It's cute.

1556
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:04,594
- You should take photos of this.
- It's so detailed.

1557
00:52:04,595 --> 00:52:07,835
- It's ours. Don't take photos.
- Why not?

1558
00:52:08,665 --> 00:52:09,765
Why not?

1559
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:11,435
There's no such thing as yours and mine.

1560
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:13,364
- We...
- We ordered it.

1561
00:52:13,365 --> 00:52:14,434
- Taking a photo won't...
- No.

1562
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:16,374
(Super childish)

1563
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,645
- Taking a photo won't...
- No.

1564
00:52:17,845 --> 00:52:19,304
- Let me take a photo.
- We ordered it.

1565
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:20,675
- Please let me.
- Okay.

1566
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:22,315
(He gets to take a photo by begging him.)

1567
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:23,444
That's a good photo.

1568
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:24,915
- This is amazing.
- It really is.

1569
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:26,744
If you're done taking photos, can I mix the beans?

1570
00:52:26,745 --> 00:52:28,115
- Sure.
- Yes.

1571
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:29,714
- Is this raw?
- Yes.

1572
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:31,354
- They're raw beans.
- They're raw.

1573
00:52:31,355 --> 00:52:32,485
It looks delicious.

1574
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:34,154
I've never had bean pork bone stew.

1575
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:35,454
I'm glad...

1576
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,695
it's not the tiramisu I imagined.

1577
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:41,134
(Crush heart bean pork bone stew...)

1578
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:44,165
(with a spoon.)

1579
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:48,305
(The beans are getting mixed with pork bone stew.)

1580
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,005
- It looks delicious.
- That's amazing.

1581
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,904
When you see a heart like this,

1582
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,815
do people send the picture to their lovers?

1583
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:56,614
I've never had one, so I don't know.

1584
00:52:56,615 --> 00:52:58,015
- You've never had one?
- No.

1585
00:52:58,245 --> 00:52:59,845
You have dated at least once, right?

1586
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,855
- Mimi is an idol singer.
- I...

1587
00:53:01,885 --> 00:53:03,154
She's an idol, so she can't simply...

1588
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:04,385
- You can't talk about it.
- That's right.

1589
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:05,854
(An idol smile)

1590
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:07,155
- I really didn't have a date.
- Well...

1591
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,655
You would've had one at one point.

1592
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:10,964
- When I was in high school.
- High school.

1593
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:12,524
When I was in my 1st year, I dated for about 50 days.

1594
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:15,094
- And that was it.
- Why did it end at 50 days?

1595
00:53:15,095 --> 00:53:18,004
(Just why?)

1596
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:19,464
Why did it end at 50 days?

1597
00:53:19,465 --> 00:53:20,565
He cheated on me.

1598
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:22,705
- That is...
- The guy cheated on you?

1599
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,545
Did he have another girlfriend?

1600
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:26,645
He was two-timing me.

1601
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:29,115
- Darn it.
- That punk.

1602
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:30,944
- He's so...
- A high schooler...

1603
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:32,145
That darn jerk.

1604
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:34,955
(Swearing)

1605
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:38,784
- You're pissed.
- Mimi.

1606
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:40,225
Your pronunciation was good.

1607
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,494
- That was accurate.
- That was accurate.

1608
00:53:42,495 --> 00:53:43,754
My pronunciation is accurate when I swear.

1609
00:53:43,755 --> 00:53:44,795
When I swear...

1610
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:46,325
I'll just...

1611
00:53:46,895 --> 00:53:47,995
But...

1612
00:53:48,035 --> 00:53:49,895
he might not know Mimi is that girl.

1613
00:53:50,035 --> 00:53:51,965
- He won't know.
- He might not know.

1614
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:55,274
(The heart has disappeared like Mimi's first love.)

1615
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,475
(They're only left with the bean bear.)

1616
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:01,315
- I feel bad to crush it.
- Me too.

1617
00:54:01,545 --> 00:54:02,644
- Don't you feel sorry?
- The bear is so cute.

1618
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:03,745
I feel bad to crush the bear.

1619
00:54:04,315 --> 00:54:06,784
(Will you crush me?)

1620
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,014
It's heartbreaking.

1621
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:09,284
- What's heartbreaking?
- Hey!

1622
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:10,485
(Cold-hearted)

1623
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:13,225
(The bear is smashed.)

1624
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:15,424
(Shocked)

1625
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:17,225
(Horrified)

1626
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:19,964
We need to eat.

1627
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,435
(Touched)

1628
00:54:21,765 --> 00:54:24,434
(The bean bear is mixed with the soup.)

1629
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:25,504
Do you want ramyeon noodles?

1630
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:26,705
That sounds nice.

1631
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:28,934
(He welcomes the news.)

1632
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:30,635
Why didn't you add it beforehand? Did you forget?

1633
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:32,575
Shouldn't we add it after we eat a bit first?

1634
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:35,015
No, we should add it now.

1635
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:37,744
No, we should add it now.

1636
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:39,114
(What is that?)

1637
00:54:39,115 --> 00:54:40,645
- Now?
- Yes.

1638
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:43,615
We're about to add it.

1639
00:54:43,955 --> 00:54:45,755
(He was imitating me.)

1640
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:48,225
- Add it here.
- Then...

1641
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:50,895
Kyeong Hwan, place it at the side here.

1642
00:54:51,465 --> 00:54:53,065
(Glancing)

1643
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:55,795
(Full of other ingredients)

1644
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,034
Me?

1645
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:58,535
(So he breaks it in half.)

1646
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:00,605
- Place it at the side here.
- Me?

1647
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,274
- Why did you break it?
- You...

1648
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:05,244
Why did you break it?

1649
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:06,944
- Oh, no.
- You...

1650
00:55:06,945 --> 00:55:08,145
You broke it in half?

1651
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:11,085
I'm sorry.

1652
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:13,684
(Kyeong Hwan is funny when he feels wronged.)

1653
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,615
- Why did you do that?
- You don't need to go so far.

1654
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:17,255
- This...
- How could you?

1655
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:18,954
- That ruins the taste.
- Why did you break it?

1656
00:55:18,955 --> 00:55:20,685
- You...
- There's no space.

1657
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,854
The noodles will be cut in half when I eat them.

1658
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:23,895
I'm about to do it.

1659
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:25,225
(Kyeong Hwan is about to be broken in half.)

1660
00:55:25,226 --> 00:55:26,825
- We're too different.
- Anyway...

1661
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,664
Ramyeon lovers...

1662
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:32,205
can't even think of doing this.

1663
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:35,375
That didn't sound like me.

1664
00:55:35,575 --> 00:55:37,375
- That's not me.
- Hey.

1665
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,975
- It keeps changing, Jae Seok.
- Here.

1666
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:46,115
(Meanwhile, the bean-mixed stew starts to boil.)

1667
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,884
- We should try the soup.
- Exactly.

1668
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:49,615
I wonder how it tastes.

1669
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:51,885
Kyeong Hwan.

1670
00:55:52,155 --> 00:55:54,385
Kyeong Hwan, try the soup.

1671
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:55,754
At some point,

1672
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:57,494
he stopped sounding like me.

1673
00:55:57,495 --> 00:55:58,965
- Kyeong Hwan.
- You're right.

1674
00:55:59,095 --> 00:56:00,795
(Making strange noises)

1675
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:03,135
That's the sound elderly people make when they're cold.

1676
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:04,665
(Mimicking)

1677
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:06,234
- Kyeong Hwan.
- Guys.

1678
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:08,075
Try this. It's fantastic.

1679
00:56:08,705 --> 00:56:09,805
It's so delicious.

1680
00:56:10,205 --> 00:56:12,145
- Is the soup really good?
- It looks delicious.

1681
00:56:12,345 --> 00:56:15,015
(Pork bone soup and soybeans)

1682
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:19,485
(How do ground beans and pork bone soup taste together?)

1683
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,815
- Is the soup really good?
- It looks delicious.

1684
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:23,655
(Amazed)

1685
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:25,285
It's really good, right?

1686
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:26,654
(Mimi blows it.)

1687
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,455
Can I eat it like this?

1688
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,324
Isn't it amazing?

1689
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:34,165
This reminds me of that.

1690
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:37,495
(It makes her sing 3 consecutive high notes.)

1691
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:39,734
It's spicy and light.

1692
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:42,134
- Do you know ground soybean stew?
- Yes.

1693
00:56:42,135 --> 00:56:44,005
- It tastes a bit like that, right?
- I agree.

1694
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:45,574
(Ground soybean stew is made using the bean residue left...)

1695
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:46,845
(from making tofu.)

1696
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:50,515
(But bean pork bone stew uses whole ground beans.)

1697
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:52,144
Smooth ground soybean stew.

1698
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:53,985
(So the texture is a lot smoother.)

1699
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:57,285
- Doesn't the soup taste Western?
- Yes.

1700
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,625
- It's creamy.
- Creamy, yes.

1701
00:56:59,825 --> 00:57:01,354
It's like risotto.

1702
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:02,694
It's so delicious.

1703
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:05,295
(It's very thick because ground beans and soup are mixed.)

1704
00:57:05,595 --> 00:57:07,024
It's right up my alley.

1705
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:08,094
(Kyung Pyo falls in love yet again today.)

1706
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,295
- It's perfect for sobering up, no?
- Yes. I really like this.

1707
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:13,305
(He eats the meat too.)

1708
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:15,534
(Everyone is enjoying the food.)

1709
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:16,905
It's tasty.

1710
00:57:18,345 --> 00:57:19,744
It's getting saltier.

1711
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:20,745
(Only Kyeong Hwan finds it a bit too salty.)

1712
00:57:21,215 --> 00:57:23,715
(He infiltrates the next table.)

1713
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:25,144
This is a bit salty too.

1714
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:26,544
- It's salty.
- Try it.

1715
00:57:26,545 --> 00:57:27,615
This...

1716
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:29,454
(He tries a bit.)

1717
00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:31,825
Dip it in. It's like a sauce.

1718
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:33,054
It tastes a bit different.

1719
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:34,555
(They taste different?)

1720
00:57:35,055 --> 00:57:37,855
(Same soup, different taste?)

1721
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:41,465
I don't want to bring it up since it's already happened.

1722
00:57:41,565 --> 00:57:43,465
(What is he going to say?)

1723
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:45,334
We put in the ramyeon noodles too early.

1724
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:47,705
- Yes, I kept telling you.
- So it's...

1725
00:57:48,305 --> 00:57:49,604
It's very...

1726
00:57:49,605 --> 00:57:51,375
"It's already happened."

1727
00:57:51,975 --> 00:57:53,274
- We should add some water.
- Is it salty?

1728
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:54,275
I think it's a bit salty.

1729
00:57:54,276 --> 00:57:56,375
We can add water.

1730
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:58,485
(Diluting it by adding cold water)

1731
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:00,214
Ramyeon...

1732
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:02,314
- Kyeong Hwan.
- Because we added ramyeon.

1733
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:04,985
- We can add water.
- It's...

1734
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:10,094
(Making it less salty for Kyeong Hwan)

1735
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:12,624
If I simply say it...

1736
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,695
(Taking another sip)

1737
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,434
It's good.

1738
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:16,435
(Did the taste change?)

1739
00:58:16,436 --> 00:58:17,464
The soup...

1740
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:20,035
- But...
- It's so good.

1741
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:21,574
I added the water here. If you try that one,

1742
00:58:21,575 --> 00:58:22,775
- it'll still be salty.
- Right.

1743
00:58:23,005 --> 00:58:24,074
I added the water here. If you try that one,

1744
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:25,505
- it'll still be salty.
- Right.

1745
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:28,745
(At a loss for words)

1746
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:30,215
What are you doing?

1747
00:58:30,345 --> 00:58:32,645
I added the water here, not there.

1748
00:58:32,715 --> 00:58:34,884
I think it's still a bit salty.

1749
00:58:34,885 --> 00:58:35,914
Yes.

1750
00:58:35,915 --> 00:58:38,285
(Seok Jin watches the whole scene play out.)

1751
00:58:39,255 --> 00:58:42,025
Kyeong Hwan is rather foolish.

1752
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:45,065
Rather foolish.

1753
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:48,265
Why are you speaking like that?

1754
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:52,204
(Why are you speaking like that?)

1755
00:58:52,205 --> 00:58:54,005
Was that a message sent from up above?

1756
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,905
(Seok Jin came down from the sky to speak.)

1757
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,705
(Very serious and solemn)

1758
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,745
"Rather foolish."

1759
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:05,645
"Kyeong Hwan is rather foolish."

1760
00:59:07,245 --> 00:59:08,885
- It's a message.
- Yes.

1761
00:59:09,085 --> 00:59:10,254
(A deity has possessed him.)

1762
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,684
You comedians are funny.

1763
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:14,425
My dear comedians.

1764
00:59:14,825 --> 00:59:16,025
- Look at the meat.
- But...

1765
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,095
it's full of protein.

1766
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:20,995
(Hidden behind the cute visual...)

1767
00:59:21,335 --> 00:59:23,595
(is bean pork bone soup's unexpected charm.)

1768
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:25,035
Meat is protein.

1769
00:59:26,365 --> 00:59:29,805
(Soybean is very high in protein, with 40g of protein per 100g.)

1770
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:31,904
I feel healthier.

1771
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:32,905
Yes.

1772
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:35,615
- This is...
- But...

1773
00:59:36,175 --> 00:59:37,375
this is confusing.

1774
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:39,784
I can't tell at all.

1775
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,985
(He takes a big chunk of meat.)

1776
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:42,884
- I think it's real.
- Why?

1777
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:46,255
(Consuming protein)

1778
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:50,325
(It tastes best when you bite the meat off from the bone.)

1779
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:52,365
Hold on. Which is the bone?

1780
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:55,265
(A bone holding a bone)

1781
00:59:55,395 --> 00:59:57,365
(He's fooling around.)

1782
00:59:57,665 --> 00:59:58,865
This is the bone.

1783
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:02,335
(He scores a goal.)

1784
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:04,844
- You guys hit it off.
- He is...

1785
01:00:04,845 --> 01:00:06,905
- This is how you should respond.
- Thank you, Jae Seok.

1786
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:08,414
Seok Jin would've become angry.

1787
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:09,714
- "What's this?" - He would've become angry.

1788
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:11,015
"Darn you." He would've done this.

1789
01:00:11,815 --> 01:00:13,044
My wife always tells me...

1790
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:14,885
that I'm too generous and kind.

1791
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:15,915
- Really?
- Yes.

1792
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,514
- I'll call her and ask.
- Don't.

1793
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:19,055
(Laughing)

1794
01:00:19,425 --> 01:00:21,425
(A rather rushed response)

1795
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:23,554
Today is their wedding anniversary.

1796
01:00:23,555 --> 01:00:25,265
- It's their wedding anniversary.
- It's our wedding anniversary.

1797
01:00:25,465 --> 01:00:26,824
That's why I thought...

1798
01:00:26,825 --> 01:00:28,064
- That's why I asked this.
- Do you...

1799
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:30,934
This heart.

1800
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:32,205
(A photo of heart pork bone stew)

1801
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:33,464
Did you send it to her?

1802
01:00:33,465 --> 01:00:35,574
No. I was thinking of doing it, but it'll feel fake...

1803
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:36,874
- when I normally don't do that.
- That's right.

1804
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,474
Things might take a wrong turn.

1805
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:40,245
(He's at the age where he needs to be careful.)

1806
01:00:40,305 --> 01:00:42,675
And the heart is on pork bone stew.

1807
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:47,685
(Congratulations on your wedding anniversary, Seok Jin.)

1808
01:00:48,155 --> 01:00:50,355
- If this place is fake, - Yes.

1809
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:52,355
what would be fake?

1810
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:54,954
- This menu.
- This menu.

1811
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:57,755
Adding beans to this doesn't make sense.

1812
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,125
- Really?
- Actually,

1813
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:01,795
they only sell pork bone stew.

1814
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,864
- And they added...
- The heart-shaped beans.

1815
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:05,365
beans to it. Yes.

1816
01:01:06,735 --> 01:01:07,964
This place is real.

1817
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,804
- This place is real.
- This place is real.

1818
01:01:09,805 --> 01:01:12,475
The smell of beans isn't something...

1819
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,844
- you can fake overnight.
- That's right.

1820
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:16,444
- It's more than a few days.
- So I'm confused.

1821
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:17,614
You're right.

1822
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:18,814
The smell is permeated in the restaurant.

1823
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:21,114
The restaurant smells like beans.

1824
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:22,554
- Right?
- The owner said...

1825
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:24,884
the owner before him...

1826
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,985
just placed the beans on top.

1827
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:29,895
- The current owner modified it.
- For photo-taking.

1828
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:32,924
- But that's typically...
- That's right.

1829
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:34,094
what the staff and the broadcast station would do...

1830
01:01:34,095 --> 01:01:35,265
when they do a collaboration.

1831
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:37,194
- Stuff like this.
- I agree with you.

1832
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,204
Chef Lee Won Il came here and...

1833
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:40,234
Exactly.

1834
01:01:40,235 --> 01:01:41,335
(It's Chef Lee Won Il again.)

1835
01:01:41,635 --> 01:01:42,635
(Pondering)

1836
01:01:42,636 --> 01:01:44,105
Consuming protein.

1837
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:45,445
I think...

1838
01:01:45,645 --> 01:01:48,775
(Did he spot something?)

1839
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:50,944
I need to go to the next restaurant to decide.

1840
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:51,985
Yes.

1841
01:01:52,385 --> 01:01:54,044
(He's saying that again.)

1842
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:56,684
They have similar vibes.

1843
01:01:56,685 --> 01:01:58,384
It's very hard to guess.

1844
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:01,455
It's my preferred diet, so I'm confused.

1845
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:03,054
Everyone is guessing,

1846
01:02:03,055 --> 01:02:05,165
but he's filming "Home Alone."

1847
01:02:06,095 --> 01:02:07,665
Talk more, Kyeong Hwan.

1848
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,165
Guess.

1849
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:11,395
(Flailing)

1850
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:13,135
(Flailing)

1851
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:17,375
He's a workout mate.

1852
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:18,904
A shoulder workout mate.

1853
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:20,245
(All he did was eating protein and working out his shoulders.)

1854
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,675
- He's funny.
- As I listen,

1855
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,515
I analyze.

1856
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:26,014
Let's wrap it up.

1857
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:28,514
(Wrapping it up like comedians)

1858
01:02:28,515 --> 01:02:29,555
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1859
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:30,854
Okay.

1860
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:32,254
(Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath)

1861
01:02:32,255 --> 01:02:33,684
(1. Fake menu added to a pork bone stew restaurant?)

1862
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:34,995
(2. The smell can't be faked. 3. Chef Lee Won Il again?)

1863
01:02:35,725 --> 01:02:38,195
We must think carefully.

1864
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:39,925
The first place looks fake too,

1865
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:41,424
but the second place...

1866
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,134
- The second place looks real.
- feels a bit more fake to me.

1867
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,464
It's too much.

1868
01:02:45,465 --> 01:02:46,635
(Tilting his head)

1869
01:02:46,905 --> 01:02:49,605
- The second place feels real.
- I think it's real too.

1870
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:51,434
It was too much.

1871
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,245
- They're both too much.
- Don't you think it was too much?

1872
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:56,875
But when that "too much" entered my mouth,

1873
01:02:56,945 --> 01:02:59,214
- it tasted delicious.
- It was delicious.

1874
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:00,344
- I was persuaded.
- It was delicious indeed.

1875
01:03:00,345 --> 01:03:02,354
- That's true.
- I understood why they did that.

1876
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:03,455
Wasn't it salty?

1877
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:04,714
Today...

1878
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,424
(They have conflicting opinions on the fake restaurant.)

1879
01:03:06,425 --> 01:03:07,654
Look, it's tofu tiramisu.

1880
01:03:07,655 --> 01:03:09,394
Tofu tiramisu is popular.

(Another tofu tiramisu?)

1882
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:12,795
- Tofu tiramisu is popular.
- This...

1883
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:16,034
- Chodang is known for soft tofu.
- It looks delicious.

1884
01:03:16,035 --> 01:03:17,035
Yes.

1885
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:19,404

- It's real tiramisu.
- This place is real.

1891

Yes, this place is real.

Are we just stopping by?

1893
01:03:33,385 --> 01:03:34,984
Yes, we're just stopping by.

1894
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,554
(Let's enjoy the hot spot without thinking hard.)

1895
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:38,114
Tofu tiramisu?

- Hello.
- Hello.

1898
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,724
You must have a long queue of customers.

- The waiting list...
- Hello.

1901
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:48,735
- Look at this.
- That's tofu?

1902
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:52,865
We sell tofu tiramisu...

1903
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:54,935
made of Gangneung's Chodang tofu.

1904
01:03:57,705 --> 01:04:02,774
(Tofu tiramisu became even more popular...)

1905
01:04:02,775 --> 01:04:05,315
(because it's made using Gangneung's Chodang tofu every morning.)

1906
01:04:05,485 --> 01:04:07,984
All the white parts are tofu.

1907

(Full of tofu instead of cheese)

1908
01:04:09,885 --> 01:04:12,725
You can enjoy it without worrying about gaining weight.

1909
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:14,724
Shall we buy a few and share?

1910
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,695
- Yes.
- Give us one each.

1911
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,794
(Try it now.)

1912
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:21,265
- Thank you, sir.
- That's a lot.

1913
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:24,264
- Gosh, sir. Thank you.
- It looks delicious.

1914
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:26,235
Thank you.

1915
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:27,834
- It looks delicious.
- It's so pretty.

1916
01:04:27,835 --> 01:04:28,875
It's nice.

1917
01:04:29,835 --> 01:04:31,705
I must take a photo of it.

1918
01:04:32,045 --> 01:04:34,745
(I can't miss out on it too.)

1919
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,114
Thank you.

1920
01:04:36,115 --> 01:04:38,685
(Taking a photo of Mimi too)

1921
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:41,184
Shall we try tofu tiramisu?

1922
01:04:41,185 --> 01:04:42,584
(They try the signature menu, tofu tiramisu.)

1923
01:04:42,585 --> 01:04:44,784
The texture is exactly...

1924
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:45,854
- like tiramisu.
- It's pastry.

1925
01:04:45,855 --> 01:04:48,755
- It's like tiramisu.
- It feels a bit like rice cake.

1926
01:04:49,225 --> 01:04:50,325
(Amazed)

1927
01:04:50,495 --> 01:04:52,524
It tastes very similar to normal tiramisu.

1928
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:53,595
It does.

1929
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:56,265
It tastes like healthy tiramisu.

1930
01:04:57,235 --> 01:04:59,934
(How does injeolmi tiramisu taste?)

1931
01:04:59,935 --> 01:05:01,465
You were looking over there.

1932
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:03,374
Let me try.

1933
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,745
(Jae Seok chooses injeolmi tiramisu.)

1934
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:07,444
- This is because...
- It's tasty.

1935
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,515
- you want to eat tiramisu, but...
- It's pastry.

1936
01:05:09,675 --> 01:05:12,745
It feels a bit like rice cake.

1937
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,014
- This is very much like injeolmi.
- Here it is.

1938
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:17,055
- Right?
- Yes.

1939
01:05:17,185 --> 01:05:19,324
As the owner said, it isn't too sweet.

1940
01:05:19,325 --> 01:05:20,355
My goodness.

1941
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:22,495
- It's delicious.
- It's pastry.

1942
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:24,925
- This is tofu?
- This is because...

1943
01:05:25,365 --> 01:05:29,465
(Tofu dessert which you scoop up and eat?)

1944
01:05:30,165 --> 01:05:31,395
- What's this?
- Yes.

1945
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:34,005
I taste tofu and soda.

1946
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:35,304
- Do you?
- Yes.

1947
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:38,805
(Signature tofu drink, tofu ocean drink)

1948
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:42,874
(The base is soda, which reminds you of the sea.)

1949
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:45,414
(White pearl and soft tofu fill up the cup.)

1950
01:05:45,415 --> 01:05:48,144
(The black bits are pepper.)

1951
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,454
- Would you like to try?
- Can I?

1952
01:05:49,455 --> 01:05:50,614
I taste pepper too.

1953
01:05:50,615 --> 01:05:51,755
- Pepper?
- Yes.

1954
01:05:52,485 --> 01:05:54,684
(It's hard to imagine the taste. How does the ocean drink taste?)

1955
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:56,595
- It's delicious.
- It's really delicious.

1956
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:58,894
(It's not my type of drink.)

1957
01:05:58,895 --> 01:06:00,195
It's really delicious.

1958
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:01,934
(Smiling awkwardly)

1959
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:04,634
(Interested)

1960
01:06:04,635 --> 01:06:05,835
Try it.

1961
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:07,564
- But...
- This is...

1962
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:08,904
(Sipping)

1963
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:10,274
It's possible that it's not to my taste.

1964
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:11,334
Of course.

1965
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:12,474
Kyeong Hwan.

1966
01:06:12,475 --> 01:06:14,104
- It's fine once you drink it.
- Where...

1967
01:06:14,105 --> 01:06:15,274
- I...
- Which of the four sides...

1968
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:16,445
did you not put your mouths?

1969
01:06:16,715 --> 01:06:18,245
Which is it?

1970
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:19,984
Guess which one.

1971
01:06:19,985 --> 01:06:22,114
- Three people drank.
- Which is it?

1972
01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:23,254
Is it this side?

1973
01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:25,284
- Do you know?
- I know.

1974
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,285
Drink it.

1975
01:06:26,286 --> 01:06:28,794
Three people drank it. One side is clean.

1976
01:06:28,795 --> 01:06:30,624
- Which side is it?
- Let's see.

1977
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,895
(Which side is untouched?)

1978
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:35,265
(Guess the remaining side out of 4 sides!)

1979
01:06:35,765 --> 01:06:37,835
I know Kyeong Hwan drank from here.

1980
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:40,365
Then the opposite side.

1981
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:43,905
- Guess which one.
- One side is clean.

1982
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:45,574
Which is it?

1983
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:46,605
Is it this side?

1984
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,575
I know which side

1985
01:06:49,815 --> 01:06:50,975
(Checking the smell)

1986
01:06:53,345 --> 01:06:55,554
That was Jae Seok's.

1987
01:06:55,555 --> 01:06:56,914
(A kiss with Jae Seok)

1988
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:58,555
(His dopamine is recharged.)

1989
01:06:58,955 --> 01:06:59,955
(Groaning)

1990
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:03,655
(Happy birthday)

1991
01:07:03,795 --> 01:07:06,065
- How is this a birthday?
- Happy birthday

1992
01:07:06,265 --> 01:07:08,324
An anniversary. An indirect kiss anniversary.

1993
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:09,534
On your wedding anniversary,

1994
01:07:09,535 --> 01:07:11,064
you have an indirect kiss with another man.

1995
01:07:11,065 --> 01:07:13,165
(Upset)

1996
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,405
Heo Kyeong Hwan.

1997
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:16,934
- Heo Kyeong Hwan.
- Why would you say that?

1998
01:07:16,935 --> 01:07:18,174
Kyeong Hwan.

1999
01:07:18,175 --> 01:07:19,945
It's been so long since I last heard the term "indirect kiss."

2000
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,275
How can you say it's an indirect kiss?

2001
01:07:22,715 --> 01:07:24,175
On your wedding anniversary.

2002
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:28,345
Hye Young's new movie will be released, right?

2003
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,114
It's called "The Intern."

2004
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:32,354
The Hollywood movie...

2005
01:07:32,355 --> 01:07:33,454
The one starring Anne Hathaway.

2006
01:07:33,455 --> 01:07:35,024
- Yes.
- I really enjoyed it.

2007
01:07:35,025 --> 01:07:36,995
- It's my favorite film.
- Choi Min Sik...

2008
01:07:37,225 --> 01:07:38,394
is playing Robert's role.

2009
01:07:38,395 --> 01:07:40,195
Who's playing Robert De Niro's role?

2010
01:07:40,865 --> 01:07:41,934
Choi Min Sik...

2011
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:42,964
- He's perfect for it.
- is playing Robert's role.

2012
01:07:42,965 --> 01:07:44,464
Then are you...

2013
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:46,605
I'm Choi Min Sik's senior. A secretary.

2014
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:48,204
The CEO's secretary.

2015
01:07:48,205 --> 01:07:49,934
- The CEO is played by Han So Hee.
- The CEO's secretary.

2016
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:50,975
I know.

2017
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,774
I'm her secretary.

2018
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:54,805
I hope it'll be released soon. I want to watch it.

2019
01:07:55,005 --> 01:07:56,475
Kyung Pyo, what's your favorite film?

2020
01:07:56,645 --> 01:07:59,044
Me? I have a favorite director.

2021
01:07:59,045 --> 01:08:00,045
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

2022
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:03,715
He's Jaco van Dormael, a French director.

2023
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:04,955
(Jaco)

2024
01:08:05,755 --> 01:08:07,985
(I miss you, what should I do)

2025
01:08:09,225 --> 01:08:10,325
Come on!

2026
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:12,565
We're talking about his favorite film.

2027
01:08:12,725 --> 01:08:14,594
Kyung Pyo is...

2028
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:16,594
- speaking.
- Speaking.

2029
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:18,934
Don't cut in and cause an unbalance.

2030
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:20,264
- Kyung Pyo.
- That...

2031
01:08:20,265 --> 01:08:22,035
- I have no knowledge.
- How could you?

2032
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:24,604
What kind of movies did he make?

2033
01:08:24,605 --> 01:08:27,175
- There's "The Eighth Day." - "The Eighth Day?"

2034
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:28,775
His movies have philosophical messages.

2035
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,414
- You like difficult movies.
- Hold on. Hey, mister.

2036
01:08:31,415 --> 01:08:33,515
Why did you take my coaster?

2037
01:08:34,915 --> 01:08:37,085
I was drinking it.

2038
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:41,895
(After asking a question in a natural way)

2039
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:43,725
(Taking)

2040
01:08:45,565 --> 01:08:46,724
(Bursting out in laughter)

2041
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:47,864
Why did you take it?

2042
01:08:47,865 --> 01:08:49,765
You can take it back when I lift my cup.

2043
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,405
You can take it back when I lift my cup.

2044
01:08:52,565 --> 01:08:53,565
(I see.)

2045
01:08:54,335 --> 01:08:55,875
I see. That's one way to do it.

2046
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,604
That's right. Share a coaster.

2047
01:08:59,605 --> 01:09:01,274
That works.

2048
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:03,515
- What's the movie of your life?
- Isn't he Anger?

2049
01:09:04,075 --> 01:09:05,884
There's a movie titled "Life Is Beautiful."

2050
01:09:05,885 --> 01:09:07,485
- What?
- "Life Is Beautiful."

2051
01:09:08,655 --> 01:09:11,714
One man tries to keep his child from knowing...

2052
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:12,955
the meaning of the war.

2053
01:09:13,185 --> 01:09:14,384
I watched it before I became a dad.

2054
01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:15,425
Who is the leading actor?

2055
01:09:15,995 --> 01:09:16,995
No.

2056
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,194
- "No." - I won't tell you.

2057
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:21,294
- "No?" - No.

2058
01:09:21,295 --> 01:09:24,294
- What kind of an answer is "No?" - "No."

2059
01:09:24,295 --> 01:09:25,704
I don't want to tell you.

2060
01:09:25,705 --> 01:09:26,705
(Coy)

2061
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:27,705
I don't want to tell you.

2062
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:29,674
- How is his answer "No?" - The movie...

2063
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,104
You didn't reveal the movie of your life.

2064
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:32,175
I won't reveal it.

2065
01:09:33,305 --> 01:09:34,674
(Mirror therapy)

2066
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:35,914
- Tell us.
- No.

2067
01:09:35,915 --> 01:09:37,345
Even if it leads to my death,

2068
01:09:38,145 --> 01:09:39,815
I won't answer your question.

2069
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:42,415
Kyeong Hwan, how about you?

2070
01:09:42,885 --> 01:09:44,084
Which movie do you like?

2071
01:09:44,085 --> 01:09:46,025
I like "I Am Legend."

2072
01:09:46,585 --> 01:09:48,584
- A zombie movie.
- Will Smith is in it.

2073
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:49,655
That's right.

2074
01:09:49,925 --> 01:09:51,394
- He has a dog.
- Yes.

2075
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,464
I become absorbed in that movie when I watch it.

2076
01:09:54,465 --> 01:09:56,265
"What would I do if I were in Will Smith's position?"

2077
01:09:56,435 --> 01:09:58,365
I think you'd do this alone.

2078
01:09:58,965 --> 01:10:01,534
(Shouting his catchphrase at the end of the world)

2079
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:03,975
By the way, there are zombies.

2080
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:07,005
Hey, this is too unbalanced.

2081
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:09,845
My life is unbalanced.

2082
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:11,474
I'm anxious.

2083
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:12,644
(In the world where he's alone)

2084
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:14,585
He'd shout his catchphrases alone.

2085
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:16,415
Alone.

2086
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,614
(He'd shout his catchphrases in front of the zombies.)

2087
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:20,324
Is that all you can say about the best movie in my life?

2088
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:21,954
I'll need to go home...

2089
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:23,454
and rewatch the movies that came up.

2090
01:10:23,455 --> 01:10:24,455
(After the shoot, he'll rewatch the members' favorite movies.)

2091
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:27,165
I laughed a lot thanks to Kyeong Hwan.

2092
01:10:28,595 --> 01:10:29,994
What's the last place?

2093
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:32,364
The last place is Cheese on the Jang.

2094
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:33,365
(They move to the last place of the day.)

2095
01:10:33,535 --> 01:10:35,104
- Cheese on the Jang?
- What's that?

2096
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,534
- I think it's jangdokdae.
- I think that's what "Jang" is.

2097
01:10:37,535 --> 01:10:39,744
- Doenjang, makjang, gochujang...
- That's right.

2098
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:40,774
Cheese.

2099
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:42,374
- Jang.
- Is it cheese fondue?

2100
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:44,545
- Is that it?
- Cheese on the Jang.

2101
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:45,745
Cheese on...

2102
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:46,785
(What's Cheese on the Jang?)

2103
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:49,885
By the way, I think the fake place is...

2104
01:10:50,755 --> 01:10:52,185
- the second one.
- I think...

2105
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:53,255
Isn't it the first one?

2106
01:10:53,685 --> 01:10:55,995
Chili powder was sprinkled on the top, right?

2107
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:59,324
The heart shape had a lot of chili powder...

2108
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:01,294
- while the bear shape didn't.
- You're right.

2109
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:03,195
(The bear shape only had a bit of chili powder.)

2110
01:11:03,265 --> 01:11:04,534
That'll change the flavors.

2111
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:06,805
- That'll change the flavors.
- That's unbalanced.

2112
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:08,264
That must be why...

2113
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:10,134
their soup tasted different.

2114
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:11,834
- That must be it.
- That must be it.

2115
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:12,844
It wasn't because of ramyeon.

2116
01:11:12,845 --> 01:11:15,074
The bear's eyes and nose were made of chili powder.

2117
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:16,175
This is a big giveaway.

2118
01:11:17,215 --> 01:11:18,615
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

2119
01:11:18,785 --> 01:11:20,384
- He thought of it now.
- Right.

2120
01:11:20,385 --> 01:11:22,784
Yes. The reason is simple. You're sensitive, aren't you?

2121
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:23,854
Earlier, he just enjoyed the food.

2122
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:25,184
- You're sensitive.
- You're sensitive.

2123
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:26,984
You're sensitive. Can't it be a catchphrase?

2124
01:11:26,985 --> 01:11:28,154
- I'm sorry.
- It's too high-pitched.

2125
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:29,824
Is it too high-pitched? You're sensitive.

2126
01:11:29,825 --> 01:11:31,225
You're sensitive.

2127
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:33,094
Would you make a catchphrase and give it to me?

2128
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:34,894
- What? Do you want a catchphrase?
- If you make me one,

2129
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:37,134
- I'll use it.
- His tone always remains the same.

2130
01:11:37,135 --> 01:11:39,204
That's right.

2131
01:11:39,205 --> 01:11:41,564
"I'm anxious." "You're sensitive."

2132
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:43,234
"By the way, I'm doing this."

2133
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:44,805
"It's unbalanced."

2134
01:11:45,705 --> 01:11:47,075
They're the same.

2135
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,474
His tone really remains the same.

2136
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:49,875
- It remains the same.
- I'll be able to use it.

2137
01:11:51,075 --> 01:11:52,084
(What?)

2138
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:53,514
Chodang jang kalguksu?

2139
01:11:53,515 --> 01:11:55,584
- Jang.
- Their jang kalguksu is well-known.

2140
01:11:55,585 --> 01:11:57,014
(A jang kalguksu restaurant catches their eyes.)

2141
01:11:57,015 --> 01:11:58,484
Gangneung's jang kalguksu is very well-known.

2142
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,685
- Really?
- Yes.

2143
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,855
(The haven of jang kalguksu, Gangneung!)

2144
01:12:03,895 --> 01:12:06,025
It's my favorite dish, kalguksu.

2145
01:12:06,695 --> 01:12:08,595
(They get out of the van quickly.)

2146
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:11,295
I guess they put cheese on top of kalguksu.

2147
01:12:11,735 --> 01:12:14,065
Adding cheese to jang kalguksu is a bit...

2148
01:12:14,805 --> 01:12:16,005
I'm curious.

2149
01:12:16,405 --> 01:12:17,674
- Shall we go?
- Does it matter...

2150
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:20,205
that they've changed the signboard?

2151
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,114
- You're right. The signboard...
- It used to be Chodanggol.

2152
01:12:23,115 --> 01:12:24,275
What's up with the signboard?

2153
01:12:25,945 --> 01:12:28,744
(They study the signboard outside the restaurant.)

2154
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:30,114
Chodanggol.

2155
01:12:30,115 --> 01:12:31,684
They changed it from Chodanggol.

2156
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:32,985
(Why is there a remnant of another restaurant?)

2157
01:12:33,285 --> 01:12:35,594
- They wouldn't have done that.
- It's too obvious.

2158
01:12:35,595 --> 01:12:37,454
- I don't think it's...
- It's too obvious.

2159
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:38,764
- the work of the production crew.
- I don't think it's a clue.

2160
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:39,765
- I don't think it's a clue.
- Really?

2161
01:12:39,766 --> 01:12:41,024
- Okay.
- "Come often. Let's be friends."

2162
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:43,435
But you never know. Anything can happen.

2163
01:12:43,665 --> 01:12:44,994
"Come often. Let's be friends."

2164
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:46,264
Anything can happen.

2165
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:48,265
- You never know.
- Restaurants have those signs.

2166
01:12:49,105 --> 01:12:50,405
I think this place is real.

2167
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:55,045
(They pass through the entrance where the kitchen is located.)

2168
01:12:55,845 --> 01:12:57,945
It has the overall atmosphere...

2169
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,084
of a new restaurant.

2170
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:01,214
Everything is too new.

2171
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,185
(The interior of the restaurant is nice and clean.)

2172
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,924
(The mascots of the restaurant welcome them.)

2173
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:08,154
(Is this place real or fake?)

2174
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,424
Hye Young and Mimi should do it today.

2175
01:13:10,425 --> 01:13:12,424
Let's get it right. Let's keep the energy going.

2176
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:14,425
- We had consecutive failures.
- Okay.

2177
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:16,934
Imagine a spicy dish with cheese.

2178
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:18,394
This restaurant was on "Amazing Saturday."

2179
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:19,834
I know. It was on "Amazing Saturday."

2180
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:21,364
- "Amazing Saturday?" - Really?

2181
01:13:21,365 --> 01:13:22,375
(The banner on the wall shows...)

2182
01:13:22,475 --> 01:13:25,945
(the various programs the restaurant was on.)

2183
01:13:27,845 --> 01:13:28,845
But...

2184
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:31,214
I've never heard of these shows.

2185
01:13:31,215 --> 01:13:33,685
"Food Propagandist." "Taste Camp."

2186
01:13:33,745 --> 01:13:36,984
I've never heard of them either. Has anyone heard of these shows?

2187
01:13:36,985 --> 01:13:39,325
They could be local shows.

2188
01:13:39,525 --> 01:13:41,225
(Is that so?)

2189
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:45,224
(Food programs of unfamiliar titles?)

2190
01:13:45,225 --> 01:13:46,494
Hello.

2191
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,924
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

2192
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:49,165
Nice to meet you.

2193
01:13:49,365 --> 01:13:50,365
I'll take it.

2194
01:13:50,366 --> 01:13:51,935
(The owners are a married couple.)

2195
01:13:52,865 --> 01:13:55,035
(The owners look exactly like the mascots.)

2196
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:57,505
What's Cheese on the Jang?

2197
01:13:58,075 --> 01:14:00,104
It's jang kalguksu with cheese inside.

2198
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:01,274
- Inside?
- Yes.

2199
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,615
Not on the top?

2200
01:14:02,715 --> 01:14:04,315
- It goes on the top.
- On the top?

2201
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:09,584
It's a mix of pizza cheese, green onion, and jang kalguksu.

2202
01:14:09,585 --> 01:14:11,554
So the name is pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu.

2203
01:14:11,555 --> 01:14:14,255
- Pizza jang green onion jang.
- Pizza jang green onion jang.

2204
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,724
We sell jang kalguksu in Gangneung.

2205
01:14:17,725 --> 01:14:18,794
I'm Lee So Young.

2206
01:14:18,795 --> 01:14:19,925
I'm Lee Ju Yeol.

2207
01:14:20,765 --> 01:14:23,064
When we decided to sell jang kalguksu,

2208
01:14:23,065 --> 01:14:25,135
we knew that it couldn't be ordinary.

2209
01:14:26,305 --> 01:14:29,175
We knew that we needed special dishes.

2210
01:14:29,505 --> 01:14:33,675
That was how we developed jjajang kalguksu and edge gimbap.

2211
01:14:33,775 --> 01:14:38,144
To appeal to the young customers, we made kalguksu...

2212
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,384
with pizza cheese and green onion.

2213
01:14:39,385 --> 01:14:40,945
(Pizza cheese, green onion, and jang kalguksu)

2214
01:14:41,385 --> 01:14:44,254
Thus, pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu came to be.

2215
01:14:44,255 --> 01:14:45,624
(Pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu)

2216
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:48,954
- Gen Zers use social media a lot.
- Yes.

2217
01:14:48,955 --> 01:14:51,794
They take photos of the dishes first.

2218
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:53,494
Many people...

2219
01:14:53,495 --> 01:14:56,334
travel to Gangneung,

2220
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:59,104
- so they've developed the dishes...
- That's right.

2221
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:01,064
- that'd go viral on social media.
- Yes.

2222
01:15:01,065 --> 01:15:03,105
Have you always been in the foodservice business?

2223
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,844
We've always been in the foodservice business.

2224
01:15:05,845 --> 01:15:07,874
As for my husband, it has been about 18 years.

2225
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:10,014
This feels homely because I'm from Gangwon Province.

2226
01:15:10,015 --> 01:15:11,045
The owners' dialect...

2227
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,644
- You're from the area, right?
- Yes.

2228
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:13,884
I knew it.

2229
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:16,254
Did you know that Seok Jin was from Gangwon Province?

2230
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:17,755
(You knew, right?)

2231
01:15:18,155 --> 01:15:19,725
(Curious)

2232
01:15:19,885 --> 01:15:21,655
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

2233
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:24,294
- People are beginning to find out.
- Not many people know.

2234
01:15:24,295 --> 01:15:26,024
I keep talking about it.

2235
01:15:26,025 --> 01:15:27,824
I'm the son of Jeongseon.

2236
01:15:27,825 --> 01:15:28,965
I didn't spend many years there,

2237
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:30,694
but I was born in Gangwon Province.

2238
01:15:30,695 --> 01:15:34,264
Please prepare some dishes...

2239
01:15:34,265 --> 01:15:35,534
- we can try.
- We'll prepare them.

2240
01:15:35,535 --> 01:15:37,175
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2241
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,305
- The owners are real.
- Yes.

2242
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:42,545
- They're real.
- They seem very nice.

2243
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,344
Look over there.

2244
01:15:44,345 --> 01:15:46,514
Wednesday is their day off.

2245
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:47,544
(We close every Wednesday.)

2246
01:15:47,545 --> 01:15:48,684
That means it's a popular restaurant.

2247
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:50,614
- I think it's a popular restaurant.
- Is it a popular restaurant?

2248
01:15:50,615 --> 01:15:52,015
- They work on weekends.
- Why do they close on Wednesdays?

2249
01:15:52,355 --> 01:15:54,424
- It's their least busy day.
- Right. Their least busy day.

2250
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,794
When people visit the area, they include the weekend.

2251
01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:58,194
- That's right.
- Yes.

2252
01:15:58,195 --> 01:15:59,924
- That's why it's a weekday.
- That's right.

2253
01:15:59,925 --> 01:16:01,295
- They need to take a day off.
- Nice.

2254
01:16:01,325 --> 01:16:02,894
Why do you think they do that?

2255
01:16:02,895 --> 01:16:04,364
- This restaurant is popular.
- Insanely popular?

2256
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:05,764
- Yes.
- That's right.

2257
01:16:05,765 --> 01:16:07,364
So in overall,

2258
01:16:07,365 --> 01:16:09,405
this isn't a restaurant that needs a solution.

2259
01:16:09,905 --> 01:16:11,174
(That makes sense.)

2260
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:13,674
Then there's a big chance this restaurant is real.

2261
01:16:13,675 --> 01:16:15,104
- You're sharp.
- I haven't been sharp in a while.

2262
01:16:15,105 --> 01:16:17,044
- You're sharp.
- You're sharp.

2263
01:16:17,045 --> 01:16:18,045
(They turn everything into a catchphrase.)

2264
01:16:18,046 --> 01:16:19,714
- You're sharp.
- You're sharp.

2265
01:16:19,715 --> 01:16:21,185
(The copyright holder is taken aback.)

2266
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,515
- You're sharp.
- You're sharp.

2267
01:16:23,315 --> 01:16:24,315
It isn't mine.

2268
01:16:24,785 --> 01:16:26,724
I've never heard of that catchphrase.

2269
01:16:26,725 --> 01:16:27,725
(He gives up on the copyright.)

2270
01:16:28,855 --> 01:16:30,055
Whose autograph is it?

2271
01:16:30,455 --> 01:16:31,695
Is it Chef Lee Won Il's autograph again?

2272
01:16:32,765 --> 01:16:34,765
(There are photos and autographs on the wall.)

2273
01:16:34,795 --> 01:16:36,634
The "Cirque du Soleil" team.

2274
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,094
(The "Cirque du Soleil" team)

2275
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:39,904
- Actor Ha Jae Suk.
- Actor Ha Jae Suk.

2276
01:16:39,905 --> 01:16:41,504
(Actor Ha Jae Suk)

2277
01:16:41,505 --> 01:16:42,604
Actor Park Byung Eun.

2278
01:16:42,605 --> 01:16:45,205
(Actor Park Byung Eun)

2279
01:16:45,335 --> 01:16:47,375
Doesn't Jae Suk live in Sokcho?

2280
01:16:47,805 --> 01:16:50,115
- She lives in Goseong.
- Goseong, right?

2281
01:16:50,745 --> 01:16:53,515
(Is it a real restaurant celebrities have visited?)

2282
01:16:53,815 --> 01:16:54,845
The food is coming.

2283
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,485
We'll know once we have a bite.

2284
01:16:58,115 --> 01:17:00,584
(Pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu is here.)

2285
01:17:00,585 --> 01:17:03,324
It's cheese. Real cheese. Potato chips?

2286
01:17:03,325 --> 01:17:04,325
It's medium-level spiciness.

2287
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:05,765
(What is she saying?)

2288
01:17:05,965 --> 01:17:07,665
I think you said different words at the same time.

2289
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:09,064
I think they clashed.

2290
01:17:09,065 --> 01:17:11,194
"It's cheese. Potato chips?"

2291
01:17:11,195 --> 01:17:13,034
There are cheese and pepperoni.

2292
01:17:13,035 --> 01:17:14,964
- Where is cheese?
- Inside.

2293
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:17,034
- Cheese is inside.
- Is it inside?

2294
01:17:17,035 --> 01:17:19,675
- Is this kalguksu?
- This one is a bit spicy.

2295
01:17:20,075 --> 01:17:22,614
This isn't the kalguksu I'm used to.

2296
01:17:22,615 --> 01:17:25,145
- How is this possible?
- Gosh, this is...

2297
01:17:27,415 --> 01:17:29,515
(The perfect transformation of jang kalguksu)

2298
01:17:29,655 --> 01:17:32,254
Dried pollack, anchovy, dried shrimp...

2299
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:33,624
We make the broth with various ingredients.

2300
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,785
(Making the secret broth of jang kalguksu!)

2301
01:17:36,295 --> 01:17:38,294
Then we use our signature gochujang.

2302
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:39,295
(The kick of the jang kalguksu is their signature gochujang.)

2303
01:17:39,695 --> 01:17:40,894
(Boil until the dish takes on rich flavors.)

2304
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:43,065
Boil until the consistency turns thick.

2305
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:48,205
(The jang kalguksu component is complete.)

2306
01:17:48,505 --> 01:17:51,775
(It's time to make the toppings.)

2307
01:17:51,975 --> 01:17:53,675
We stir-fry kimchi in a pan...

2308
01:17:54,075 --> 01:17:56,414
and put a generous amount of pizza cheese on the top.

2309
01:17:56,415 --> 01:17:57,674
Then we melt it slowly.

2310
01:17:57,675 --> 01:18:00,044
(Add a generous amount of pizza cheese.)

2311
01:18:00,045 --> 01:18:02,784
We lay stir-fried kimchi and cheese over jang kalguksu...

2312
01:18:02,785 --> 01:18:04,084
as if it was a blanket.

2313
01:18:04,085 --> 01:18:06,225
(Lay stir-fried kimchi and cheese over jang kalguksu.)

2314
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:09,854
Green onion stir-fried in butter, deep-fried potato chips,

2315
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:12,524
and pepperoni go on the top to complete the dish.

2316
01:18:12,525 --> 01:18:13,595
(Finish the dish with colorful toppings.)

2317
01:18:14,725 --> 01:18:17,665
(Pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu)

2318
01:18:18,095 --> 01:18:22,475
(It's a well-known restaurant in Gangneung.)

2319
01:18:22,735 --> 01:18:24,504
Thanks to pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu,

2320
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:26,775
we get many young customers.

2321
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:29,615
We make about 50,000 dollars a month.

2322
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:32,515
- Sixth Sense members.
- Is this place...

2323
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:34,084
- real?
- Real?

2324
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,985
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

2325
01:18:36,055 --> 01:18:37,515
How is this possible?

2326
01:18:37,655 --> 01:18:38,784
- Gosh, this is...
- This is nothing like...

2327
01:18:38,785 --> 01:18:40,684
- strange.
- Strange.

2328
01:18:40,685 --> 01:18:42,024
Hold on. Shouldn't we take...

2329
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:43,824
- a photo of this?
- Hold on.

2330
01:18:43,825 --> 01:18:45,895
(He has no interest in photos.)

2331
01:18:46,095 --> 01:18:49,394
(Jae Seok mixes it.)

2332
01:18:49,395 --> 01:18:51,335
Please don't mix it.

2333
01:18:51,735 --> 01:18:53,135
Don't mix it, Jae Seok!

2334
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:55,334
For goodness' sake. You should've waited.

2335
01:18:55,335 --> 01:18:58,305
- By the way, I'm mixing it.
- By the way, I'm mixing it.

2336
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:01,274
Stack up a potato chip,

2337
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:03,245
pepperoni, and green onion.

2338
01:19:03,345 --> 01:19:05,345
Then eat everything with kalguksu.

2339
01:19:05,515 --> 01:19:07,785
How is this possible? Green onion and...

2340
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:09,984
The potato chips are a bit shocking.

2341
01:19:09,985 --> 01:19:10,985
- Suddenly...
- Hey.

2342
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:13,254
- Does it feel like a chef's work?
- I know.

2343
01:19:13,255 --> 01:19:15,285
Doesn't the presentation have that vibe?

2344
01:19:17,295 --> 01:19:20,295
(Jang kalguksu with the presentation that seems like a chef's work?)

2345
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:21,824
It's suspicious.

2346
01:19:21,825 --> 01:19:23,194
(Full of suspicion)

2347
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:26,035
The presentation is the most suspicious, to be honest.

2348
01:19:27,005 --> 01:19:30,605
(They use the method the owner told them.)

2349
01:19:35,475 --> 01:19:36,674
It's tasty.

2350
01:19:36,675 --> 01:19:38,175
(Impressed)

2351
01:19:38,215 --> 01:19:39,745
They go well together.

2352
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:41,185
This is a dish...

2353
01:19:41,186 --> 01:19:42,984
- Gen Zers will like.
- Yes.

2354
01:19:42,985 --> 01:19:44,054
- Right?
- Yes.

2355
01:19:44,055 --> 01:19:45,754
- The potato chips are tasty.
- Yes.

2356
01:19:45,755 --> 01:19:47,054
- They go well together.
- Yes.

2357
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:49,324
The potato chips are tasty. The potato chips provide a kick.

2358
01:19:49,325 --> 01:19:50,555
(The crunchy potato chips provide a kick.)

2359
01:19:50,855 --> 01:19:51,855
It's tasty.

2360
01:19:51,856 --> 01:19:54,165
(Slurping)

2361
01:19:54,425 --> 01:19:55,725
This place seems real.

2362
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:57,395
- Does it suddenly seem real?
- Yes.

2363
01:19:57,865 --> 01:19:59,735
People would come here to eat.

2364
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:03,775
(The dish suits his taste.)

2365
01:20:04,205 --> 01:20:05,304
(The man who wants to be a Gen Zer tries the dish quickly...)

2366
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:06,405
(upon seeing the Gen Zers' reactions.)

2367
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,705
It doesn't suit your taste, right?

2368
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:09,944
Is it tasty?

2369
01:20:09,945 --> 01:20:11,444
- It doesn't suit your taste.
- Is this pizza?

2370
01:20:11,445 --> 01:20:12,914
(His reaction is awkward.)

2371
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:15,085
(Unsure)

2372
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:16,655
- Gen Zers.
- It's something I haven't had.

2373
01:20:16,755 --> 01:20:19,115
(He slurps the noodles.)

2374
01:20:19,455 --> 01:20:20,855
(Impressed)

2375
01:20:20,985 --> 01:20:22,285
- His reaction changed.
- It's good, right?

2376
01:20:22,695 --> 01:20:23,695
- It's good, right?
- Young people...

2377
01:20:23,696 --> 01:20:25,924
Young people and I have the same taste.

2378
01:20:25,925 --> 01:20:27,064
My goodness.

2379
01:20:27,065 --> 01:20:28,464
He suddenly became a Gen Zer.

2380
01:20:28,465 --> 01:20:29,635
My goodness.

2381
01:20:29,835 --> 01:20:30,865
Look at this.

2382
01:20:30,995 --> 01:20:32,265
Seok Jin, I bet...

2383
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:33,805
you'll inhale kimchi stew later today.

2384
01:20:34,365 --> 01:20:35,905
(He got caught.)

2385
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:38,235
Don't get a stomachache at home.

2386
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:40,345
(He got caught for the 2nd time.)

2387
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:41,774
- How did you know?
- Eat a small bit at a time.

2388
01:20:41,775 --> 01:20:43,415
- Hye Young, how did you know?
- Eat a small bit at a time.

2389
01:20:43,575 --> 01:20:45,945
How do you know me so well when we've just met today? Eat up.

2390
01:20:46,345 --> 01:20:47,585
See? I like it.

2391
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:50,315
(He braves a stomachache to be like a Gen Zer.)

2392
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:52,785
This kalguksu is spicy.

2393
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:54,884
- That's right. It's spicy.
- It's tasty.

2394
01:20:54,885 --> 01:20:56,355
(It has a spicy aftertaste.)

2395
01:20:56,595 --> 01:20:58,254
I think it's nice.

2396
01:20:58,255 --> 01:20:59,525
It's tasty.

2397
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:00,595
(Sweating)

2398
01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:01,825
The taste of pepperoni...

2399
01:21:02,395 --> 01:21:05,135
(The spiciness makes them sweat.)

2400
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:07,365
When I eat it with pepperoni, it tastes like spicy pizza.

2401
01:21:07,965 --> 01:21:09,304
That's right. It tastes more like pizza.

2402
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:10,835
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

2403
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:13,205
The owners are good at making jang kalguksu.

2404
01:21:13,305 --> 01:21:14,445
I know.

2405
01:21:14,905 --> 01:21:17,275
(He tries the soup.)

2406
01:21:17,645 --> 01:21:18,775
The soup is nice.

2407
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:20,745
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

2408
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,445
To be honest,

2409
01:21:22,585 --> 01:21:24,515
it's much tastier to eat jang kalguksu by itself.

2410
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:28,125
(There's regular jang kalguksu underneath the toppings.)

2411
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:33,964
(The dish is unique without losing the original taste.)

2412
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:36,194
I think this restaurant has a chance of being real...

2413
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:37,864
- since it sells other dishes.
- That's right.

2414
01:21:37,865 --> 01:21:40,105
- They sell regular jang kalguksu.
- Yes.

2415
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:42,434
(They sell regular jang kalguksu.)

2416
01:21:42,435 --> 01:21:44,775
- The owners told us...
- That's right.

2417
01:21:44,835 --> 01:21:46,944
that they targeted the Gen Zers.

2418
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:49,075
If this dish suits the Gen Zers' taste, it's a success.

2419
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:50,275
It's tasty.

2420
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,814
That's the most basic one.

2421
01:21:52,815 --> 01:21:54,015
(Refilling the side dishes)

2422
01:21:54,185 --> 01:21:55,545
Sir, this jang kalguksu...

2423
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,885
- This jang kalguksu is tasty.
- Yes.

2424
01:21:58,455 --> 01:21:59,854
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2425
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:01,355
- It's so tasty.
- Thank you.

2426
01:22:01,555 --> 01:22:03,255
Did you add pepperoni because of pizza cheese?

2427
01:22:03,425 --> 01:22:04,755
The dish...

2428
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,024
we benchmarked...

2429
01:22:06,025 --> 01:22:08,225
was kimchi pizza tangsuyuk.

2430
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:10,035
- I see.
- Kimchi pizza tangsuyuk.

2431
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:11,895
- It's the same taste.
- You're right.

2432
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:13,804
- It's the same taste.
- You're right.

2433
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:14,934
- I knew it was a familiar taste.
- What was that?

2434
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,504
It tastes exactly like KPT.

2435
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:17,535
What's KPT?

2436
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:20,105
- Kimchi pizza tangsuyuk.
- Kimchi pizza tangsuyuk.

2437
01:22:20,205 --> 01:22:22,204
Many people come up with new combinations these days.

2438
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:24,314
I thought the combination was a bit unnatural,

2439
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:26,045
but your words made me think that it was real.

2440
01:22:26,185 --> 01:22:27,745
I think this place is real.

2441
01:22:27,815 --> 01:22:28,984
I think this place is real.

2442
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,715
- This place?
- Yes. What do you think?

2443
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:35,055
Why did they color the menu as if it were old?

2444
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,224
Exactly.

2445
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:37,795
- Because of that...
- It's so suspicious.

2446
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:40,364
(There's a menu board on the wall.)

2447
01:22:40,365 --> 01:22:43,165
(It appears old in a fake way.)

2448
01:22:44,095 --> 01:22:45,665
The menu board is...

2449
01:22:45,765 --> 01:22:47,165
- new.
- Take a look.

2450
01:22:47,405 --> 01:22:48,664
They make it look old...

2451
01:22:48,665 --> 01:22:50,405
- on purpose.
- Right?

2452
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:52,174
You sprinkle coffee on the wallpaper...

2453
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:54,144
- to make it appear old.
- That's right.

2454
01:22:54,145 --> 01:22:55,344
- Has it been altered?
- The arts team does that...

2455
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,974
- on the set.
- Coffee powder. That's right.

2456
01:22:56,975 --> 01:22:58,815
It's so suspicious.

2457
01:23:00,145 --> 01:23:01,514
Maybe a customer fell down...

2458
01:23:01,515 --> 01:23:03,055
and poured coffee.

2459
01:23:03,455 --> 01:23:05,184
It occurs commonly.

2460
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:07,024
- Listen.
- Are you a spy?

2461
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:08,084
Kyeong Hwan, listen.

2462
01:23:08,085 --> 01:23:09,925
- But the wall isn't discolored.
- That's right.

2463
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,094
They cleaned the wall, but...

2464
01:23:12,095 --> 01:23:13,625
Let's leave it.

2465
01:23:14,225 --> 01:23:15,565
(He gives up on making deductions.)

2466
01:23:15,595 --> 01:23:16,994
You won't see Hye Young again...

2467
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:18,865
- anytime soon.
- That's right.

2468
01:23:19,835 --> 01:23:21,134
- Speak your mind with confidence.
- This is...

2469
01:23:21,135 --> 01:23:22,135
Say what you want to say.

2470
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:23,505
I'll see you on TV.

2471
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,935
(Chuckling)

2472
01:23:27,305 --> 01:23:28,475
This isn't easy.

2473
01:23:28,975 --> 01:23:31,375
I don't think they colored it for the cool vibe.

2474
01:23:32,415 --> 01:23:34,115
- This isn't easy.
- Why did they color it?

2475
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:36,314
Today, Mimi and Hye Young should guess.

2476
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:37,454
I have no idea.

2477
01:23:37,455 --> 01:23:39,854
All places seem fake in some ways.

2478
01:23:39,855 --> 01:23:41,384
Seriously. This is driving me crazy.

2479
01:23:41,385 --> 01:23:42,725
I don't know.

2480
01:23:43,425 --> 01:23:44,594
My goodness.

2481
01:23:44,595 --> 01:23:45,924
This is confusing.

2482
01:23:45,925 --> 01:23:47,895
I don't know.

2483
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:49,595
Today,

2484
01:23:50,095 --> 01:23:52,365
you should decide. I give up.

2485
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:54,464
- What do you think?
- Let's organize the information.

2486
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:56,175
- Let's do that.
- Take turns and pick a place.

2487
01:23:56,735 --> 01:23:58,435
I say this...

2488
01:23:58,935 --> 01:24:00,404
with seriousness.

2489
01:24:00,405 --> 01:24:03,145
I'm suspicious of the gamjatang place.

2490
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:04,475
Number two?

2491
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:05,945
(Why?)

2492
01:24:06,245 --> 01:24:11,085
(Number 2, Tiramisu Inside Hot Bath)

2493
01:24:11,555 --> 01:24:14,624
(The creamy soup...)

2494
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:17,755
(got everyone's compliment.)

2495
01:24:17,795 --> 01:24:19,895
Chili powder was sprinkled on the top, right?

2496
01:24:20,865 --> 01:24:23,195
(The heart had a lot of chili powder.)

2497
01:24:23,695 --> 01:24:25,665
(The bear had little chili powder.)

2498
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:29,975
(A fake restaurant that doesn't keep the taste consistent?)

2499
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:32,004
That's suspicious.

2500
01:24:32,005 --> 01:24:33,544
- It's unbalanced.
- Chili powder. Yes.

2501
01:24:33,545 --> 01:24:34,745
The amount of chili powder.

2502
01:24:35,105 --> 01:24:36,174
The amount was...

2503
01:24:36,175 --> 01:24:39,114
unbalanced.

2504
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:40,344
- It was like that.
- Seriously.

2505
01:24:40,345 --> 01:24:41,684
- You're the best.
- Yes.

2506
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:43,214
- The original version is different.
- Yes.

2507
01:24:43,215 --> 01:24:44,584
- It's different.
- So...

2508
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,114
- It's different from the copies.
- Unbalanced.

2509
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:47,324
- It's unbalanced.
- How nice.

2510
01:24:47,325 --> 01:24:48,454
- What a tone.
- Yes.

2511
01:24:48,455 --> 01:24:50,454
If the restaurant is real,

2512
01:24:50,455 --> 01:24:51,695
they should adjust the recipe...

2513
01:24:52,925 --> 01:24:54,494
to keep the taste balanced.

2514
01:24:54,495 --> 01:24:56,294
That's what I think.

2515
01:24:56,295 --> 01:24:57,664
- Is there "Balanced?" - He came up with it.

2516
01:24:57,665 --> 01:24:58,665
I do this for "Balanced."

2517
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,404
You can tell that it's the original.

2518
01:25:00,405 --> 01:25:02,234
- It's different.
- The original version is different.

2519
01:25:02,235 --> 01:25:04,434
The original version. This is...

2520
01:25:04,435 --> 01:25:06,404
- the taste.
- This is the taste.

2521
01:25:06,405 --> 01:25:07,474
(Wrapping up Kyeong Hwan's catchphrases)

2522
01:25:07,475 --> 01:25:08,475
This one too.

2523
01:25:08,476 --> 01:25:10,015
He's the best.

2524
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:11,915
Kyung Pyo, what do you think?

2525
01:25:12,045 --> 01:25:13,784
I think...

2526
01:25:13,785 --> 01:25:16,044
- it's number 1.
- Number 1.

2527
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:17,184
I also think it's number one.

2528
01:25:17,185 --> 01:25:18,984
I can't shake off the first impression.

2529
01:25:18,985 --> 01:25:20,525
- What should I do?
- You know,

2530
01:25:20,955 --> 01:25:24,124
- seasoned cockles is a Korean dish.
- That's right.

2531
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:26,994
And pizza dough is a Western dish.

2532
01:25:26,995 --> 01:25:28,025
That's...

2533
01:25:28,495 --> 01:25:29,565
(Sighing)

2534
01:25:30,635 --> 01:25:33,965
(Seasoned cockles on top of pizza?)

2535
01:25:34,305 --> 01:25:36,635
(They were surprised by the appearance.)

2536
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:40,305
(They were surprised again by the taste!)

2537
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:43,615
(It was tasty, but it didn't taste like pizza.)

2538
01:25:44,115 --> 01:25:47,515
(Did the production crew come up with a fake dish...)

2539
01:25:48,515 --> 01:25:51,755
(that was based on cockle bibimbap?)

2540
01:25:52,455 --> 01:25:55,224
- I think number 2 is real.
- You think number 2 is real.

2541
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:57,025
- It's either number 1 or 3.
- Okay.

2542
01:25:57,095 --> 01:25:59,354
Number three is suspicious because of the menu board.

2543
01:25:59,355 --> 01:26:00,465
What we saw earlier?

2544
01:26:01,325 --> 01:26:03,335
(Forget about the regular jang kalguksu!)

2545
01:26:03,495 --> 01:26:07,235
(Pizza jang green onion jang kalguksu with unique looks)

2546
01:26:07,605 --> 01:26:10,605
(But the menu board was more suspicious than the menu.)

2547
01:26:10,905 --> 01:26:13,745
(It looked like it was made to appear old.)

2548
01:26:14,045 --> 01:26:16,174
(What was the reason behind the brown spots?)

2549
01:26:16,175 --> 01:26:17,214
And a photo showed...

2550
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:20,614
- the "Cirque du Soleil" team...
- That's right. I saw the photo.

2551
01:26:20,615 --> 01:26:22,245
had visited the restaurant.

2552
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:23,754
I think it was taken today!

2553
01:26:23,755 --> 01:26:25,055
(I think it was taken today!)

2554
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:30,495
(Did they take the photo in a hurry to decorate the fake restaurant?)

2555
01:26:30,955 --> 01:26:32,324
- Mimi, what do you think?
- I'll go...

2556
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:33,424
with number one.

2557
01:26:33,425 --> 01:26:35,394
- The reason is clear.
- Tell us.

2558
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:37,265
The pizza was cold.

2559
01:26:38,265 --> 01:26:41,705
(The cheese was a bit hardened.)

2560
01:26:42,265 --> 01:26:43,634
In Season One,

2561
01:26:43,635 --> 01:26:45,805
we once had a cold dish at a fake restaurant.

2562
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:48,074
- You speak from experience.
- They prepare the dish in advance.

2563
01:26:48,075 --> 01:26:49,105
That's right.

2564
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:50,744
They're still a bit unfamily...

2565
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:52,645
with the recipe, so...

2566
01:26:53,015 --> 01:26:54,915
- "Unfamily?" - "Unfamily?"

2567
01:26:55,145 --> 01:26:57,055
(That came out wrong.)

2568
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:58,454
What's "Unfamily?"

2569
01:26:58,455 --> 01:27:00,654
They're still a bit unfamiliar.

2570
01:27:00,655 --> 01:27:01,925
- Unfamiliar.
- Unfamiliar.

2571
01:27:02,255 --> 01:27:04,025
(Yes.)

2572
01:27:04,055 --> 01:27:05,395
- Unfamiliar.
- Unfamiliar.

2573
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,064
- Unfamiliar.
- Not "Unfamily."

2574
01:27:07,065 --> 01:27:08,425
(She's unfamily with the pronunciation.)

2575
01:27:08,525 --> 01:27:10,994
The owner made a mistake...

2576
01:27:10,995 --> 01:27:13,504
because he was nervous today.

2577
01:27:13,505 --> 01:27:16,605
(The cold pizza was the nervous owner's mistake.)

2578
01:27:16,635 --> 01:27:19,235
Like you guys,

2579
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,504
I think it's number 1 or 2.

2580
01:27:21,505 --> 01:27:22,544
- Number 2...
- I think number 3 is real.

2581
01:27:22,545 --> 01:27:24,015
- Number 2.
- Number 2 has to be real.

2582
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:25,874
It's just my opinion.

2583
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:27,115
In any case,

2584
01:27:27,845 --> 01:27:29,145
someone else should decide.

2585
01:27:29,515 --> 01:27:31,555
What do you think it is? Do you think it's number two?

2586
01:27:31,655 --> 01:27:33,054
- Number 1.
- Number 1 or 2.

2587
01:27:33,055 --> 01:27:35,455
I'm not sure. It's number 1 or 2.

2588
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:36,754
Today, Mimi should decide.

2589
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:38,224
- Mimi has had a good hunch...
- Mimi.

2590
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:39,254
- these days.
- She has a good hunch.

2591
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:40,794
- I also think Mimi should do it.
- Mimi has a good hunch.

2592
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:42,594
- Mimi and Hye Young should do it.
- Seriously.

2593
01:27:42,595 --> 01:27:44,564
- Number One.
- Mimi and Hye Young should decide.

2594
01:27:44,565 --> 01:27:46,294
- Let's go with number 1.
- Number 1? Okay.

2595
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:47,304
Number one.

2596
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:48,604
- Okay.
- Is the dust at number three okay?

2597
01:27:48,605 --> 01:27:49,605
Number three?

2598
01:27:49,705 --> 01:27:51,235
I suddenly feel like it's number three.

2599
01:27:51,275 --> 01:27:52,934
- Listening to you...
- But...

2600
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:54,705
makes me feel like number one is real.

2601
01:27:54,745 --> 01:27:56,445
- Mimi, go with your hunch.
- Yes.

2602
01:27:56,515 --> 01:27:57,974
- After all, - That's right.

2603
01:27:57,975 --> 01:28:00,084
- we would've been correct...
- I have no experience.

2604
01:28:00,085 --> 01:28:02,345
two more times had we listened to Mimi.

2605
01:28:02,545 --> 01:28:04,255
Mimi and Hye Young should decide.

2606
01:28:04,615 --> 01:28:06,015
- All right.
- What's the answer?

2607
01:28:06,055 --> 01:28:07,254
One, two, three.

2608
01:28:07,255 --> 01:28:08,825
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

2609
01:28:09,425 --> 01:28:11,055
Let's get consecutive answers.

2610
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:13,165
Let's go.

2611
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:14,664
We'll reveal the answer.

2612
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,224
Number one has potential.

2613
01:28:16,225 --> 01:28:17,634
What will we do if it's number two?

2614
01:28:17,635 --> 01:28:18,935
Is it number three?

2615
01:28:19,235 --> 01:28:23,075
(A place full of things to enjoy)

2616
01:28:23,935 --> 01:28:28,104
(Eighth city, Gangneung is Coming)

2617
01:28:28,105 --> 01:28:30,945
(Fake on the Gangneung)

2618
01:28:31,115 --> 01:28:33,044
(Are you ready to turn on Deduction Mode?)

2619
01:28:33,045 --> 01:28:35,444
- It's so hard today.
- Let's get it right today!

2620
01:28:35,445 --> 01:28:37,785
This is impossible to get right.

2621
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:41,455
(The one fake that has come to Gangneung)

2622
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:42,884
(The well-mixed seasoned cockles didn't go on top of rice.)

2623
01:28:42,885 --> 01:28:44,225
Right. It didn't go on top of rice.

2624
01:28:44,795 --> 01:28:46,965
It went on top of Chicago-style pizza.

2625
01:28:47,495 --> 01:28:49,495
I think it could be number one.

2626
01:28:51,435 --> 01:28:52,994
All of a sudden, on the pork bone stew...

2627
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:55,035
Right. There was that cookie cutter.

2628
01:28:55,865 --> 01:28:57,204
There was too much chili powder

2629
01:28:57,205 --> 01:28:58,734
- Right.
- There was too much.

2630
01:28:58,735 --> 01:29:00,775
(On top of the running gochujang and doenjang...)

2631
01:29:02,005 --> 01:29:03,445
The cheese melted on top.

2632
01:29:04,975 --> 01:29:06,814
(Number 3, Cheese on the Jang)

2633
01:29:06,815 --> 01:29:09,185
Let's get two consecutive wins!

2634
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:10,415
Let's do this!

2635
01:29:11,015 --> 01:29:12,354
- Let's pick up the pace!
- Let's go!

2636
01:29:12,355 --> 01:29:13,655
"The answer is coming!"

2637
01:29:13,755 --> 01:29:14,924
Coming!

2638
01:29:14,925 --> 01:29:16,654
- Let's go!
- Which place is fake?

2639
01:29:16,655 --> 01:29:17,725
(Which place is fake?)

2640
01:29:18,195 --> 01:29:19,525
(The answer is coming!)

2641
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:21,494
- Run!
- So that means...

2642
01:29:21,495 --> 01:29:23,495
- the other two are real.
- Right.

2643
01:29:23,895 --> 01:29:26,835
That's so weird. The other two are real.

2644
01:29:26,965 --> 01:29:28,934
- Please!
- Here we go!

2645
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:31,404
(Which place is fake?)

2646
01:29:31,405 --> 01:29:32,435
Which place is it?

2647
01:29:33,205 --> 01:29:34,345
- Which place is it?
- What number is it?

2648
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:36,609
- Let's go!
- Which place is fake?

2649
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:38,679
- That means the other two are real.
- Right.

2650
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:40,249
That's so weird.

2651
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:42,448
- Please!
- Here we go!

2652
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:45,489
(Which place is fake?)

2653
01:29:46,759 --> 01:29:47,959
- Which place is it?
- What number is it?

2654
01:29:48,789 --> 01:29:52,059
(Which place is fake?)

2655
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:55,658
(Number 3, Cheese on the Jang)

2656
01:29:55,659 --> 01:29:57,129
It's number three!

2657
01:29:57,869 --> 01:29:59,699
(We got it wrong again.)

2658
01:30:00,099 --> 01:30:01,369
This place is fake?

2659
01:30:01,799 --> 01:30:02,938
- What?
- You got it right, Hye Young.

2660
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,109
This place is fake!

2661
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:06,809
- It's fake. The owner felt fake.
- Number one is real?

2662
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:08,379
Number one is real?

2663
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,549
- I'm so sorry, owner of number one.
- Gosh.

2664
01:30:10,749 --> 01:30:11,908
Number one?

2665
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:15,549
Didn't they choose to go for a fake owner after a while?

2666
01:30:15,819 --> 01:30:17,288
You got it right, Hye Young.

2667
01:30:17,289 --> 01:30:19,388
As soon as I got there, I got suspicious about the place.

2668
01:30:19,389 --> 01:30:21,289
- "Why was all this decorated?" - It was really weird.

2669
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:23,328
- I even talked about the kitchen.
- Right.

2670
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:25,389
- I wondered why everything was new.
- Right.

2671
01:30:26,559 --> 01:30:27,658
This was 60 days ago.

2672
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:29,258
- Two months before today.
- Two months before today.

2673
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:31,268
The drought is severe in Gangneung.

2674
01:30:31,269 --> 01:30:32,469
- Drought.
- Drought.

2675
01:30:32,999 --> 01:30:34,338
It was upsetting to see the drought.

2676
01:30:34,339 --> 01:30:35,339
- Right.
- It was very upsetting.

2677
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,138
Restaurants and accommodations...

2678
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,409
are carrying on with business in great concern.

2679
01:30:40,339 --> 01:30:42,108
They were all short on water.

2680
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:43,109
Right.

2681
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:45,409
(Let's do anything to help!)

2682
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,679
(That was how the production crew went to Gangneung.)

2683
01:30:49,549 --> 01:30:51,719
It didn't rain for a while at that time.

2684
01:30:51,949 --> 01:30:52,949
Right.

2685
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,619
(It's located slightly away from the Chodang Soft Tofu Village.)

2686
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:56,489
It's the place we went to earlier.

2687
01:30:57,629 --> 01:31:00,499
We run a jang kalguksu restaurant in Gangneung.

2688
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:02,428
I'm 42-year-old Lee So Young.

2689
01:31:02,429 --> 01:31:03,598
- I'm 50 years old...
- So they were actual owners.

2690
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:05,068
- and my name is Lee Joo Yeol.
- Gosh, hello.

2691
01:31:05,069 --> 01:31:06,098
(Owner, Lee Joo Yeol)

2692
01:31:06,099 --> 01:31:07,938
Due to the drought damage,

2693
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:10,408
our business really hit rock bottom.

2694
01:31:10,409 --> 01:31:12,138
This was our biggest difficulty.

2695
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:13,779
I see.

2696
01:31:14,109 --> 01:31:16,539
- So they are actual owners.
- Right.

2697
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:19,448
(For the owner couple who have suffered from the drought damage,)

2698
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:22,079
(a special helper has come.)

2699
01:31:22,179 --> 01:31:23,179
Hello.

2700
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,548
I made the kimchi pizza tangsuyuk...

2701
01:31:24,549 --> 01:31:25,719
- for the first time in the world.
- KPT!

2702
01:31:25,949 --> 01:31:27,519
- Gosh!
- KPT!

2703
01:31:27,689 --> 01:31:29,218
(It was actually based on KPT!)

2704
01:31:29,219 --> 01:31:30,588
- She's the creator.
- Right!

2705
01:31:30,589 --> 01:31:32,859
- It did have that taste.
- That's just amazing.

2706
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:35,529
(Kimchi pizza tangsuyuk out of nowhere?)

2707
01:31:36,459 --> 01:31:39,269
(D-52, during the Daejeon shoot for Episode 2)

2708
01:31:39,599 --> 01:31:41,339
Did they go somewhere after the shoot?

2709
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:42,669
Where did they go?

2710
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:44,239
Did they go to a KPT place?

2711
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:45,909
(We came to have some KPT.)

2712
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:46,978
- I've never tried this.
- Same here.

2713
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:48,008
It looks delicious.

2714
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:50,848
Right. I heard that it started from the Chungcheong Province.

2715
01:31:50,849 --> 01:31:51,849
Really?

2716
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:52,908
- You heard that?
- Chungcheong Province.

2717
01:31:52,909 --> 01:31:54,318
It started from the Chungcheong Province.

2718
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:55,319
(A few days later)

2719
01:31:55,949 --> 01:31:57,488
(This suddenly came into mind.)

2720
01:31:57,489 --> 01:31:59,588
(How about we mix the jang kalguksu with the KPT we had earlier?)

2721
01:31:59,589 --> 01:32:01,188
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 2 Production Crew Chat Room)

2722
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:02,789
- That's amazing.
- Gosh.

2723
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,059
(That's a good idea!)

2724
01:32:04,059 --> 01:32:05,059
(I wonder how it will taste. Let's go for it.)

2725
01:32:05,759 --> 01:32:07,358
(KPT and jang kalguksu)

2726
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:09,528
- Like that?
- After talking on the phone...

2727
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:11,468
- Right.
- with you yesterday,

2728
01:32:11,469 --> 01:32:12,728
I tried 2 to 3 different kinds.

2729
01:32:12,729 --> 01:32:14,168
- You tried making them?
- Right.

2730
01:32:14,169 --> 01:32:16,538
I wanted to try making them while I was at it.

2731
01:32:16,539 --> 01:32:18,938
- These are bigger.
- I see.

2732
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:19,968
(She developed the KPT and jang kalguksu dish...)

2733
01:32:19,969 --> 01:32:20,978
(whenever she could.)

2734
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:22,309
Gosh, she went through so much.

2735
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:25,909
- It was delicious.
- It really was delicious.

2736
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:28,519
(However...)

2737
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:30,818
(The kick of the pizza jang and green onion jang kalguksu)

2738
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:33,289
(Potatoes)

2739
01:32:33,419 --> 01:32:35,859
- It was delicious.
- The potatoes were fried.

2740
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,588
(Helping Gangneung's potato farms)

2741
01:32:38,589 --> 01:32:39,889
"Helping Gangneung's potato farms?"

2742
01:32:40,329 --> 01:32:42,598
(Where did they head to after some research?)

2743
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:43,699
Where did they go?

2744
01:32:44,269 --> 01:32:45,269
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2745
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:48,239
I'm Kwon Hyuk Gi from an agricultural company.

2746
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:50,738
I developed a superior seed in Korea...

2747
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:52,338
and due to my service...

2748
01:32:52,339 --> 01:32:54,638
of helping many potato farms that struggled,

2749
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,408
I was given the title of Seed Potato Master.

2750
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:57,509
Seed Potato Master.

2751
01:32:57,709 --> 01:32:58,878
(It helps out farms...)

2752
01:32:58,879 --> 01:33:00,079
(as a lot of crop is produced with fast growth.)

2753
01:33:00,349 --> 01:33:02,979
(Gangneung Dano potato)

2754
01:33:03,349 --> 01:33:05,418
(After hearing from the production crew)

2755
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,389
These are the Dano ugly potatoes.

2756
01:33:07,689 --> 01:33:09,158
Put them to good use.

2757
01:33:09,159 --> 01:33:10,688
- The ugly potatoes.
- The ugly potatoes.

2758
01:33:10,689 --> 01:33:12,758
(Dano potatoes were gladly provided for the new dish.)

2759
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:14,699
So those potatoes were fried.

2760
01:33:14,999 --> 01:33:17,199
- The potatoes tasted great.
- Right.

2761
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:19,898
(D-20 before the Episode 8 shoot)

2762
01:33:19,899 --> 01:33:20,969
Gosh.

2763
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:22,068
(The menu gets switched first.)

2764
01:33:22,069 --> 01:33:23,939
The menu was switched! That was mentioned earlier.

2765
01:33:24,509 --> 01:33:25,668
(The lacquer spray for wood was used to make it look used.)

2766
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:27,338
Right. They have these things.

2767
01:33:27,339 --> 01:33:28,479
No way!

2768
01:33:28,879 --> 01:33:30,348
- Gosh.
- You were spot on.

2769
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:32,809
- She kept suspecting it.
- That's awesome.

2770
01:33:32,979 --> 01:33:34,919
(D-15, dish on sale)

2771
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:38,289
(It received a lot of attention after its release.)

2772
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:39,748
(The tables were always busy thanks to the new dish.)

2773
01:33:39,749 --> 01:33:40,759
Look at that!

2774
01:33:40,959 --> 01:33:43,118
- Business went well.
- So it was sold beforehand.

2775
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:44,189
Business went really well.

2776
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:45,959
- What now?
- What?

2777
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:48,928
(Did you see the banner on one side of the wall?)

2778
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:51,569
Right. It looked so realistic.

2779
01:33:52,369 --> 01:33:55,039
I think that was made.

2780
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:57,408
- "Today." - Is that fake?

2781
01:33:57,409 --> 01:33:58,668
Is that fake as well?

2782
01:33:58,669 --> 01:34:00,008
(Was her show appearance fake as well?)

2783
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:01,609
- It's mulhoe pork cutlet.
- It's mulhoe pork cutlet.

2784
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:03,448
(The owner appeared on the show with mulhoe pork cutlet...)

2785
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:04,578
(at her previous restaurant.)

2786
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:07,979
So she was on the show before.

2787
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:10,349
With mulhoe pork cutlet.

2788
01:34:10,889 --> 01:34:13,588
Right. No wonder it felt old.

2789
01:34:13,589 --> 01:34:15,018
- It didn't seem recent.
- It was from before.

2790
01:34:15,019 --> 01:34:16,019
Right.

2791
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:18,629
It was edited from the footage from before.

2792
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:20,198
They went that far for this?

2793
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:21,199
(Original footage)

2794
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,028
(Fake footage)

2795
01:34:23,029 --> 01:34:24,298
This was so hard.

2796
01:34:24,299 --> 01:34:26,269
(Also...)

2797
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:28,238
(There's another secret...)

2798
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,309
(hidden on the banner.)

2799
01:34:31,009 --> 01:34:32,808
- Right. Those shows don't exist.
- "Gourmet Store."

2800
01:34:32,809 --> 01:34:34,578
Right. I mentioned that.

2801
01:34:34,579 --> 01:34:36,008
(When the first characters of the shows are read...)

2802
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:37,409
(Mimi babo)

2803
01:34:37,749 --> 01:34:39,079
- "Mimi babo." - "Mimi babo."

2804
01:34:40,849 --> 01:34:41,949
Gosh!

2805
01:34:42,119 --> 01:34:43,349
I missed that.

2806
01:34:43,489 --> 01:34:46,388
(A small hint for the Sixth Sense members)

2807
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,689
And I kept saying the first place was fake.

2808
01:34:49,289 --> 01:34:50,629
I said this place was real.

2809
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:52,459
There were fun clues hidden all around.

2810
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:56,158
(To be known as a good restaurant,)

2811
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,129
(celebrity autographs are a given!)

2812
01:34:58,699 --> 01:35:00,199
(However, the location is Gangneung!)

2813
01:35:00,839 --> 01:35:03,338
(Find celebrities that would come to Gangneung!)

2814
01:35:03,339 --> 01:35:04,368
Hello?

2815
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:06,569
Hello. Is this Actress Ha Jae Suk?

2816
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:08,079
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

2817
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:11,708
- Right. The Lady of Goseong.
- Right.

2818
01:35:11,709 --> 01:35:13,179
She lives in Goseong.

2819
01:35:13,819 --> 01:35:15,978
We want to get your permission...

2820
01:35:15,979 --> 01:35:18,489
to put up a fake autograph of yours on the wall.

2821
01:35:18,619 --> 01:35:20,958
- That's fine with me.
- Thank you for helping us.

2822
01:35:20,959 --> 01:35:21,959
Hello?

2823
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,688
- Hello.
- Hello.

2824
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:24,689
We heard you enjoy fishing...

2825
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,399
- and visit Gangwon Province often.
- Right.

2826
01:35:27,599 --> 01:35:28,859
It's Byung Eun.

2827
01:35:29,629 --> 01:35:32,128
- Right. He loves fishing.
- He loves fishing.

2828
01:35:32,129 --> 01:35:33,468
Would it be okay...

2829
01:35:33,469 --> 01:35:34,799
- to put up a fake autograph?
- That would be fine.

2830
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:37,438
- We will make sure to make it well.
- They weren't asked for autographs.

2831
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:39,769
- They were asked to copy theirs?
- Right.

2832
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:41,838
- So that was how they were copied.
- Just like that?

2833
01:35:41,839 --> 01:35:43,548
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2834
01:35:43,549 --> 01:35:45,049
(There's one doubt that comes into mind at this point.)

2835
01:35:45,809 --> 01:35:47,618
(Did the members of "Cirque du Soleil" really come?)

2836
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:48,678
Right.

2837
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:50,348
It felt like it was taken on the day of.

2838
01:35:50,349 --> 01:35:51,718
Why would the members of "Cirque du Soleil..."

2839
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:53,089
come for kalguksu?

2840
01:35:53,689 --> 01:35:55,059
Was it during their tour?

2841
01:35:55,989 --> 01:35:57,028
(Why are they at Seoul Sports Complex...)

2842
01:35:57,029 --> 01:35:58,058
(all of a sudden?)

2843
01:35:58,059 --> 01:36:00,458
- It's the stadium.
- They perform in Jamsil.

2844
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:01,498
(The place with posters of "Cirque du Soleil...")

2845
01:36:01,499 --> 01:36:03,598
(and the Trickster)

2846
01:36:03,599 --> 01:36:04,868
(This is the place where "KOOZA" is performed.)

2847
01:36:04,869 --> 01:36:06,099
- "KOOZA." - "KOOZA."

2848
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:09,939
(Where have they gone to after following a staff member?)

2849
01:36:10,169 --> 01:36:11,638
(This is the artist practice room.)

2850
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:13,608
- They're training.
- Gosh, they even went there?

2851
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:15,638
(They are all training here and there.)

2852
01:36:15,639 --> 01:36:16,978
This is where they train.

2853
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,278
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing.

2854
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:19,849
They went all the way there?

2855
01:36:20,349 --> 01:36:21,478
It's them.

2856
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:22,878
We're going to Photoshop

2857
01:36:22,879 --> 01:36:25,219
- and add in the four of you guys.
- Okay.

2858
01:36:25,349 --> 01:36:26,488
- That's okay.
- Yes.

2859
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,588
(They gladly decide to participate in fooling the Sixth Sense members.)

2860
01:36:27,589 --> 01:36:29,789
- They're taking pictures.
- The photo was edited?

2861
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:32,859
- My gosh.
- Thank you so much.

2862
01:36:33,629 --> 01:36:35,298
- They didn't even go there.
- Right.

2863
01:36:35,299 --> 01:36:36,829
Editing technology has developed so much.

2864
01:36:38,569 --> 01:36:39,798
It looks so real!

2865
01:36:39,799 --> 01:36:41,639
It's so hard to tell.

2866
01:36:42,099 --> 01:36:44,369
When I suggested that we start a jang kalguksu business,

2867
01:36:44,609 --> 01:36:47,308
I was told that it shouldn't be just regular kalguksu.

2868
01:36:47,309 --> 01:36:49,238
Through this opportunity,

2869
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:51,449
the biggest advantage was to get a new dish.

2870
01:36:51,949 --> 01:36:54,719
After our current restaurant grows,

2871
01:36:55,079 --> 01:36:57,849
I wish for us to be able to run another restaurant.

2872
01:36:58,189 --> 01:37:00,689
- Sixth Sense.
- This dish...

2873
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:02,919
- is fake!
- It's fake!

2874
01:37:03,489 --> 01:37:04,989
You can sell it now.

2875
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:06,458
It was delicious.

2876
01:37:06,459 --> 01:37:09,129
- It was really good.
- It was really good.

2877
01:37:09,499 --> 01:37:11,129
- We got it wrong again.
- We got it wrong again.

2878
01:37:11,999 --> 01:37:13,668
Don't listen to me from now on.

2879
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:14,898
- Gosh.
- What a bummer.

2880
01:37:14,899 --> 01:37:16,468
- That was so hard.
- Well then.

2881
01:37:16,469 --> 01:37:17,968
- The cringeworthy post.
- The penalty draw will be done.

2882
01:37:17,969 --> 01:37:19,168
- It's the penalty.
- On social media,

2883
01:37:19,169 --> 01:37:20,908
a cringeworthy post must be posted.

2884
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:22,538
You're not allowed to explain yourself.

2885
01:37:22,539 --> 01:37:24,278
(Cringeworthy post on social media)

2886
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:26,248
Please don't be me. I can't stand these things.

Who is it?

2889
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:30,249
It must be herself.

2890
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:33,419
No way. It's herself!

2891
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:35,058
It's herself!

2892
01:37:35,059 --> 01:37:36,288
- Mimi!
- Mimi!

2893

- What?
- It's always Mimi.

(It's always Mimi.)

2896
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:42,098
- It's always her.
- Why is it always you?

2897
01:37:42,099 --> 01:37:43,558
- What?
- Gosh!

2898
01:37:43,559 --> 01:37:45,298
- That's amazing.
- I'm sorry!

2899
01:37:45,299 --> 01:37:48,698
Your fans won't be so surprised by the posts now.

2900
