00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,179
Hello.

2
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,178
- Hello, Kyung Pyo. Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,378
Hello, elderly.

4
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:34,779
I'm not an elderly, you punk.

5
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,519
Goodness.

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,188
Seok Jin, do you remember her name?

7
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:40,288
(What is the name of this director?)

8
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,888
He remembers. You do, don't you?

9
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:42,959
It's Sang Eun.

10
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,188
How did you know?

11
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,429
Sang Eun.

12
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,859
But I don't know her last name.

13
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:48,659
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

14
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,929
Is it Lee Sang Eun? No, it's not.

15
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,669
I memorized her name as Lee Sang Eun.

16
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,239
- It's Lee Sang Eun's song.
- The one who sings "Dam Da Di."

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,769
Hello.

18
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:59,868
Hello, I'm sorry for being late.

19
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,339
Don't be ridiculous.

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,508
(Shall we start again today energetically?)

21
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,649
This place is really nice.

22
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,309
The house was remodeled...

23
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,279
- to build this.
- What?

24
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,879
The house was remodeled to build this.

25
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,919
(The cafe was built in a 2-story house in a residential area.)

26
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,228
(You're greeted by a spacious yard...)

27
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,629
(filled with lush greenery like a forest.)

28
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,629
(As you walk across the yard and enter inside...)

29
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,739
These days, such a vibe... This place is so beautiful.

30
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,339
(A real popular spot in Mangwon-dong)

31
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,409
(Popular for its vibe of a Scottish mountain cabin)

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,078
(Offering a touch of green serenity in the gray-toned city)

33
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,678
This is where "Whenever Possible" was shot.

34
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:41,679
- Here?
- Yes.

35
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:42,679
When?

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,918
- "Whenever Possible..." - It's been over a year.

37
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,089
I wasn't in it.

38
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,589
But I was.

39
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:47,819
Okay.

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,859
Shouldn't we talk about something that we can relate to?

41
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,188
I was talking to myself.

42
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:53,629
You were? I ended up hearing it.

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,998
Why would you overhear my conversation?

44
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,898
- Why would you talk to yourself...
- What?

45
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,168
loudly enough that we can hear you?

46
00:01:58,169 --> 00:01:59,469
"I ended up hearing it" sounds so funny.

47
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,738
The season for warm latte has arrived.

48
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,098
I know. The weather is amazing today.

49
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,539
- It's really nice.
- Seriously.

50
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,038
I'm so happy that summer is finally over.

51
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,508
Yes, it's nice and cool.

52
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,779
I hate it when it's summer.

53
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:13,349
Jae Seok has always hated the summer season for sweating.

54
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,478
I really hate summer.

55
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,549
I also hate bugs.

56
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,288
Mosquitos.

57
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,849
Have you gotten a mosquito bite on your back?

58
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,618
A bite on the back is uncommon.

59
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:23,989
It drives me crazy because I can't reach it.

60
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,589
These days, I look for edges on the wall at home.

61
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,229
Against the edge...

62
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,099
You should put clothes on at home.

63
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:33,699
It's because you aren't wearing clothes.

64
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,838
- Is that why...
- That's why they bite your back.

65
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,009
- He realized it at the age of 59.
- Speaking of which...

66
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,639
The mosquito...

67
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,239
sucked his blood because it was hungry.

68
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,339
However, it wasn't very nutritious.

69
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,179
Hey.

70
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,049
Are you looking down on my blood?

71
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,689
The result wasn't worth the effort.

72
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,558
Despite feeling full...

73
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,758
after eating at a restaurant,

74
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,328
you think, "The food wasn't so good."

75
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,358
Hey.

76
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,828
(Upset)

77
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,359
Why are you looking down on my blood?

78
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,699
If my blood tasted bad,

79
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:07,098
I would've only gotten one bite.

80
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,069
The mosquito forced itself to suck your blood.

81
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,639
(The mosquito has no intention to come back.)

82
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,339
What are we doing today?

83
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,138
Today's tour will take place...

84
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,939
- Okay.
- in Mapo-gu.

85
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,048

86

- there are many incredible places.
- Here?

102
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,448
We invited guests...

103
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,918
who are perfect for Mapo-gu.

104
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,978
- Really?
- We'll call them right now.

105
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,689
- Perfect for Mapo-gu?
- Are they hipsters?

106

(On the 2nd floor of the cafe at that time)

107
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,088
It must be over there.

(Someone is watching everything that's happening.)

109
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,559
I bet I know at least one place.

110
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,429
Right? You know so many places here.

111
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,368
If he had appeared on Sixth Sense,

112
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,199
people would know right away that he's fake.

Hello.

124
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,458
Gosh, Won Hun.

125
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,859
- Hello.
- Won Hun.

126
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,099

127
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,168
- They're the hottest right now.
- Hello.

128

They're really hot now.

129

- I see Won Hun often these days.
- Really?

130

By the way...

131
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,909
- Is that Labubu?
- Labubu.

132
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,568
That's not fake, is it?

133
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,409
- It's not fake. It's real.
- This...

134
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,878
- By the way...
- I heard that...

135
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,609
everyone carries it these days.

136
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,878
(Staring)

137
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,919
Won Hun, why is your nose scraped?

138
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,289
I went to see a dermatologist yesterday.

139
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,519
- Did you pop pimples on your nose?
- Yes.

140
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,859
- Is that why your nose is so red?
- Yes.

141
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,829
(He got a comedo extraction at the dermatologist's clinic.)

142
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,729
That's why...

143
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,898
I'm not dressed as Rudolph. This is my real nose.

144
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,098
I got an intense comedone extraction yesterday.

145
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,269
When the extraction is intense, you get swollen.

146
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,808
If you point that out, my ears will turn red.

147
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,108
(Won Hun with red ears in Mapo-gu)

148
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,178
My ears turn red...

149
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,508
out of embarrassment.

150
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,648
Only his face isn't red because of the makeup.

151
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,908
- His neck is red.
- This is embarrassing.

152
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,818
Please don't pay attention to me.

153
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,018
People will think that it's special effects.

154
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,118
I'm getting embarrassed.

155
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,358
Your nose looks very red.

156
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:44,188
I don't like getting so much attention like this.

157
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,259
- By the way, - Yes?

158
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:48,259
I didn't know, but you have a bigger nose than mine.

159
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:51,158
Right. However, my nose is well proportioned...

160
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,228
- in relation to my facial features.
- That's not true.

161
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,269
I wouldn't say that it's well proportioned.

162
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:58,268
Your nose is very thick in the front.

163
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,308
Let me explain.

164
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:02,739
Seok Jin, why are you embarrassing Won Hun? He just got here.

165
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,079
For me...

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,609
My nose looks exactly the same as my dad's.

167
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:07,778
By saying that,

168
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,478
you'll make my family sad while watching this.

169
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,888
(Creating a catch-22)

170
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,449
- Goodness.
- Sir.

171
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,988
I didn't mean it. I apologize.

172
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,828
Won Hun, have you been living in Mapo for a long time?

173
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,058
I moved here about five months ago.

174
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,128
You moved here?

175
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,868
I lived in Incheon for a long time.

176
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,599
- Don't you live in Incheon?
- I know. Yes.

177
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,168
I've lived in Sangsu...

178
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,598
and Hapjeong for seven years.

179
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,038
I spent most of my 20s here.

180
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,208
I know the area quite well.

181
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,879
Since Ji Yoon and Won Hun are with us today,

182
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:39,148
I hope that you'll distinguish which is fake.

183
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,449
Where are we going today?

184
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,349
"New World Mapo?"

185
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,589
(By the way, what's the name of the operation?)

186
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,018
(New World.)

187
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,619
(It's called New World Mapo.)

188
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,759
The first one is Very Sour Meal.

189
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,299
The second is New Type of Taco.

190
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,929
- The third is Exciting Pub.
- Pub.

191
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,239
(An unprecedented journey to the New World)

192
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,409
(What's the New World that awaits Sixth Sense members?)

193
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,079
(There's Very Sour Meal in Mapo?)

194
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:11,009
(The taste that even makes real men cry)

195
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,449
(Is it a meal that's spicy?)

196
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:14,948
(If not,)

197
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,019
(it's a new flavor that we've never tasted before.)

198
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,189
(Or is it a meal of new flavors?)

199
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,589
(What could Very Sour Meal be?)

200
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,388
(It's really delicious.)

201
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,859
(This is what a taco is about.)

202
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,159
(Forget about tacos you've had until now.)

203
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,098
(Since the Walking Taco on Episode 3)

204
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,169
(Another unbelievable type of taco)

205
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,099
(New Type of Taco is coming up.)

206
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,239
(You killed the mood. Take responsibility for it.)

207
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,439
(Okay, I will.)

208
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,316
(All you have to do is come in.)

209
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,409
(We will make you have fun.)

210
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,449
(Exciting Pub)

211
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,748
(Very Sour Meal)

212
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,048
(New Type of Taco)

213
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,488
(Exciting Pub)

214
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:57,219
(New World Mapo, which one is fake?)

215
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,329
The first one is a sour meal.

216
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:02,828
Does it mean spicy? Or is it sour like lemon?

217
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,169
She's making a face.

218
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,899
I think it's sour like lemon.

219
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,438
Food that tastes sour?

220
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,439
I don't like it either.

221
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:11,669
Could it be...

222
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:13,809
tom yum kung?

223
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,338
(A Thai dish, tom yum kung?)

224
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,249
Your reasoning is terrible.

225
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,309
Come over here.

226
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,018
You, come here.

227
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,179
What isn't terrible for you?

228
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,589
(He finds it funny.)

229
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,019
Come here. Tell me one of your guesses.

230
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:31,789
The way he beckons makes him look like Grim Reaper.

231
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,859
Sometimes, I see people whom you don't see.

232
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:35,859
What?

233
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,798
Sometimes, I get confused.

234
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,269
Don't we have two Grim Reapers today?

235
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:41,299
- You're both wearing black.
- They have matching outfits.

236
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,468
- Oh, no.
- You're right.

237
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,069
(He's determined not to follow them today.)

238
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,468
Shall we go to the first one?

239
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,009
- Okay.
- Very Sour Meal.

240
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,578
Let's get going.

241
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,549
(Real or fake? They head to the first popular spot.)

242
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,279
It's nice and quiet.

243
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,678
- Right.
- It's nice in Mangwon-dong.

244
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,819
- It's the best neighborhood.
- Mangwon-dong is...

245
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,188
(From Mangwon Market)

246
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,089
Aren't there many popular restaurants in Mangwon?

247
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:03,619
There are a lot.

248
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,259
(Mangwon-dong is full of popular restaurants.)

249
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,498
- There are also many bakeries.
- Right.

250
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,799
(It's also full of bakeries that Mimi likes.)

251
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,728
Many of my junior comedians and colleagues live...

252
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:14,729
- in this neighborhood.
- Right?

253
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,568
- Around this area.
- When I ask my juniors...

254
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:17,768
where they live, most of them live in Mangwon-dong...

255
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:18,769
- or Yeonnam-dong.
- You said...

256
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,469
that it was nice and quiet here. Please keep it quiet.

257
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,708
- Can't I talk like this?
- It's still morning.

258
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,348
I know, but I'm not being noisy at 4am.

259
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:26,378
Seok Jin.

260
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,978
I've never seen Mangwon-dong this loud.

261
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:28,979
- Right?
- Yes.

262
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,949
After saying how nice and quiet it was,

263
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,188
he's being very loud.

264
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,249
(Please don't disrupt the peace.)

265
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,219
He's truly a master.

266
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,558
A master of martial arts.

267
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,289
(I'm passing by.)

268
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,399
- In that position...
- He's a real master.

269
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,368
In Mangwon-dong, there are many hidden masters.

270
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:46,369
In my opinion...

271
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,499
He was so relaxed.

272
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,069
It has a similar vibe as in Hongdae.

273
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,038
- While scratching himself...
- Was he doing acrobatics?

274
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,508
(A martial arts rider in Mangwon-dong)

275
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,478
He looks like a character in a Taiwanese movie.

276
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,879
(He's real.)

277
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:59,278
I started my married life in Seongsan,

278
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,409
which isn't far from here.

279
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:02,679
In Seongsan-dong?

280
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,188
- Isn't it far from here?
- Seongsan is far from here.

281
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,189
No, it's not.

282
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,219
Is Yeonnam-dong far from here or not?

283
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,558
- Yeonnam is quite far from here.
- I see.

284
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,829
Then let's say that Seongsan is a bit far.

285
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,658
(Tailoring his expression to suit the public opinion)

286
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:18,029
Are you changing the distance on your own?

287
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:21,029
I was talking about how long it takes by car.

288
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,699
In that case, everywhere in Seoul is...

289
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,209
- nearby.
- Hey.

290
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:27,668
(Our seniors are fighting again.)

291
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,808
You, come here.

292
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,038
- Memories of my early married life.
- "You, come here."

293
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,409
Think about it.

294
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,279
Goodness. Anyway,

295
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,679
this is what upsets me while working with Jae Seok.

296
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:40,688
- You know those up-and-comers?
- Yes.

297
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:42,858
You have to deal with them early.

298
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,089
I failed to stop Jae Seok 20 years ago.

299
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,629
You were still my junior 20 years ago.

300
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,228
- What?
- He was his junior by two years.

301
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:50,929
If I tell you to drop to all fours, you have to.

302
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:52,499
Hey.

303
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,829
Things have gotten much better these days.

304
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,839
Drop to all fours in his 60s?

305
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,409
Hey, I'm 59.

306
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,068
I'm Young 50. I'll be in my 50s forever.

307
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:03,209
- In your 50s forever.
- I'll stay 59 next year.

308
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:07,278
It's not a location where you'd find a restaurant.

309
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,879
(The first popular place is in the middle of a residential area?)

310
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:11,149
Is this it?

311
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,619
- Lemon Bar?
- It must be lemon.

312
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,189
- It's something sour.
- Here it is.

313
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,329
Is this it?

314
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,699
- Oh, my gosh.
- So it was lemon.

315
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:26,828
It meant sour like lemon.

316
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:27,829
(The sour taste of lemon?)

317
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,699
(When you follow the quiet alley)

318
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,238
(Located in a residential area)

319
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,739
It's right next to a house.

320
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,208
It's shaped like a bar.

321
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,209
It looks so hip.

322
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,219
This place is...

323
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,189
really pretty.

324
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,158
(The tone and the style are refreshing like lemon.)

325
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,528
It's really beautiful.

326
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,199
(The entire shop is colored with lemon.)

327
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,969
(A popular place in Mangwon-dong)

328
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,238
It looks like it was built in a hurry...

329
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,269
- Right?
- like a pop-up store.

330
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,608
That's what you need to look for.

331
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:10,238
I think this place was up for rent not so long ago.

332
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,239
- Seriously?
- Really?

333
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,279
- I saw it while passing by.
- Really?

334
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,849
(Was this refreshing place empty not so long ago?)

335
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,078
- Seriously?
- Really?

336
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,318
This can be set up quickly...

337
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,649
- with a design team.
- That's right.

338
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,559
He's sharp.

339
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,059
When did you see the sign, Won Hun?

340
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,488
- It's been about 2 years.
- About 2 years?

341
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:28,528
I saw it while passing by.

342
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,198
- It's been about 2 years.
- About 2 years?

343
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,698
- I saw it while passing by.
- Goodness.

344
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,669
- That's such a long time ago.
- Two years?

345
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,269
Does it take two years to set up a restaurant?

346
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,868
This place...

347
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,569
It takes about 2 months, not 2 years.

348
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,079
Although it's fake, it runs like it's real.

349
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:43,939
Let's go in first.

350
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,048
(Carefully)

351
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,579
It looks so pretty inside.

352
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,448
(Mimi's Camera)

353
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,518
It's pretty.

354
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,849
(Mimi's Camera)

355
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,659
- It looks so beautiful here.
- I know.

356
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,459
You can come here with your friends...

357
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,429
and rent the entire space.

358
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,328
I'm sure many people do that.

359
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:04,359
(This unusual space makes you want to click "Like.")

360
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,129
What do they do with lemon?

361
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,168
I've never been to a restaurant specializing in lemon.

362
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,399
There's a lot of lemon in the fridge.

363
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,308
(With so much lemon)

364
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,579
It's hard to guess what kind of food they sell here.

365
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,608
Excuse me.

366
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:22,419
(What will be the first item in New World Mapo?)

367
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,318
- Hello.
- Hello.

368
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,088
- Hello.
- There are two of you.

369
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:29,458
- Hello.
- Hello.

370
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,059
Do the two of you run the restaurant?

371
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,188
Yes, we both own the restaurant.

372
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,888
We've been friends for 20 years.

373
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,358
(Old friends)

374
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,099
Are you really friends?

375
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:40,628
- Yes, since high school.
- We're friends from high school.

376
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:42,498
Which high school did you go to?

377
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:43,869
- Naksaeng High School.
- Naksaeng High School.

378
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:47,438
In which region is the high school located?

379
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:48,708
One, two, three.

380
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:49,879
- Pangyo.
- Daejang-dong.

381
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,109
(Their answers are different from each other's.)

382
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,249
It's fake.

383
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:57,849
Daejang-dong is in Pangyo.

384
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:00,549
(Flustered)

385
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,759
They might give themselves away too fast if I dig too dip,

386
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,559
so I'll restrain myself.

387
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,958
It looks like you already know the answer.

388
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,128
I know.

389
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,429
- I already know.
- Do you have a hunch?

390
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,628
Their T-shirts are way too clean.

391
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,269
I also think that the restaurant owners are fake.

392
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:16,799
We thought that...

393
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,838
it was something spicy. Is it referring to sour taste instead?

394
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,938
As you can see,

395
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,678
we use lemon as our main ingredient.

396
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,818
We offer a course meal with various lemon dishes.

397
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,379
(A lemon course meal?)

398
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,718
Our restaurant became quite popular on social media.

399
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,989
(A popular restaurant on social media)

400
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:37,688
We opened the restaurant in 2022.

401
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,158
This is our third year.

402
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,558
(The old friends have been running the restaurant for 3 years.)

403
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,598
After wandering around the alleys of Mangwon-dong,

404
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,898
we liked how sunny it was...

405
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,198
and its peaceful atmosphere.

406
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,238
We thought that this place could give an exotic vibe.

407
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,239
(They picked Mangwon-dong for its peaceful vibe.)

408
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,808
In the beginning, the regulars were our main customers.

409
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,409
We didn't think that keeping the same menu would be interesting.

410
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:05,179
Then we came up with the idea of making a course meal with lemon.

411
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,849
That's how it came about.

412
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,118
(Of lemon)

413
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,988
(By lemon)

414
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:14,629
(For lemon)

415
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:16,328
For our course meal,

416
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,969
there are four types, spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

417
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,038
We always offer...

418
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,439
one or two dishes made with seasonal ingredients.

419
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,139
There's a restaurant in Mangwon-dong that offers a lemon course meal.

420
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,538
It's a paradise for lemon lovers.

421
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,379
(It became a must-visit spot for photos in Mangwon.)

422
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,078
Sixth Sense members,

423
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,149
- is this place real?
- Is this place real?

424
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,018
You make a course meal with lemon?

425
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,988
Yes, we will use lemon...

426
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:46,358
for the entire course from appetizers to desserts.

427
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,359
(In awe)

428
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,528
(Exclaiming)

429
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:49,599
(Lemon omakase?)

430
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,798
- Lemon omakase.
- As I started making lemon omakase,

431
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,999
all the reservations are...

432
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,369
- Are they fully booked?
- Yes.

433
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,998
How much is it per person?

434
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,869
- It's 50 dollars per person.
- I see.

435
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,938
It's not as expensive as I thought.

436
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,109
- It's still an omakase.
- Right.

437
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,279
There aren't many seats at the restaurant.

438
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,018
In terms of profit...

439
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,318
- There are two restaurant owners.
- Right.

440
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,888
- The rent is relatively low.
- Is it low?

441
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,019
It is?

442
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,418
Here's why we're asking.

443
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,228
Didn't we figure out the fake a few times based on the sales?

444
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,099
- Yes.
- Something was off with the sales.

445
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,199
I see.

446
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,768
When the cost doesn't add up,

447
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,328
- it shows immediately.
- Right, that's happened before.

448
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:30,038
Didn't you guess correctly only once during this season?

449
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,138
- Yes.
- Yes.

450
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,268
You...

451
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:34,308
(My role model who can't guess correctly)

452
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,579
(Dropping his head)

453
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,009
Won Hun.

454
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,649
Stop criticizing us.

455
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,679
Why are you discouraging us?

456
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,949
Mimi is terrible at guessing.

457
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,859
(Kim Won Hun is going crazy.)

458
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,589
All of them are blunt.

459
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,259
Won Hun's nose is red.

460
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,059
He's been drunk since this morning.

461
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,399
No, I'm not drunk.

462
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,669
You look like a drunkard.

463
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,739
Ji Yoon, do you have any questions?

464
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,838
The restaurant owners seem fake.

465
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,109
(The old friends who own the restaurant seem fake.)

466
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,309
Why?

467
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,679
When you like lemon...

468
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,638
(Those who like lemon)

469
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,009
Most people who like lemon are lean.

470
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:17,548
It's used for detox...

471
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:19,489
and losing weight.

472
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:21,018
You shocked him all of a sudden.

473
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,958
A jjajangmyeon restaurant owner...

474
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,918
doesn't necessarily like jjajangmyeon.

475
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,059
That's true.

476
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,159
Here's what's important.

477
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,428
They could run the restaurant, but the menu could be fake.

478
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:33,728
- Right.
- You're right.

479
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,998
May we try your course meal?

480
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,168
Please.

481
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,509
- More than anything, I'm curious.
- Yes, omakase.

482
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,078
Since it's a small space,

483
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,738
- they can hear everything.
- Yes.

484
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:46,609
For their convenience, we'll give them headphones to block the sound.

485
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,279
That's very thoughtful.

486
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:53,849
(Putting on the headphones)

487
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,719
(Starting to make the lemon course meal)

488
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,289
(Sniffing)

489
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,528
Gosh, the scent is...

490
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:03,558
(The lemon scent hits the tip of the nose.)

491
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,128
- It smells nice.
- Yes,

492
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,328
That's lemon tea.

493
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,429
- By the way, - Despite the headphones,

494
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:09,439
they can hear everything.

495
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:12,039
Despite the headphones, they seem to hear everything.

496
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,009
Do you hear us?

497
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:16,409
Is noise canceling not working?

498
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,209
- This lemon tea is...
- It's delicious.

499
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:21,378
- not sour.
- You're right.

500
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,218
- It has a right amount of flavor.
- It's very delicious.

501
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,348
When you take a sip,

502
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:26,288
the lemon flavor spreads over the palate.

503
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:27,289
It's refreshing.

504
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,119
(It stimulates the appetite before the course meal.)

505
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,318
It feels like we're abroad.

506
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,828
- Isn't the taste exotic?
- Yes.

507
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:33,859
(An exotic vibe experienced in Mangwon-dong)

508
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,199
Why did you pick lemon?

509
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:38,458
Why did you pick lemon as your main ingredient?

510
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,768
He's pretending not to hear us.

511
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:41,628
Both of them look like...

512
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,039
musical actors to me.

513
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,239
- Really?
- Yes.

514
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,709
I feel like I've seen them in "Man of La Mancha."

515
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,778
They look like people related to musicals.

516
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,649
Speaking of which, he looks like Sancho from "Don Quixote."

517
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,948
They look like actors with a strong personality.

518
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:56,778
While acting like they couldn't hear us,

519
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:59,088
the look on their face was so diverse.

520
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,519
(Are the restaurant owners actors with various charms?)

521
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,818
Like Meat and Mat... I mean, what are their names?

522
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,258
- It's Pat and Mat.
- Pat.

523
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,828
- Pat and Mat.
- Meat? Are you talking about meat?

524
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,229
I couldn't remember it.

525
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,458
It's very...

526
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:10,459
(She’s bluntness itself.)

527
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,529
I believe Mimi knows that.

528
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,468
- Yes, I know that.
- She knows.

529
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,038
- I know, but...
- Instead of saying noise canceling,

530
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,968
she said ear canceling.

531
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:19,969
- I almost pointed it out.
- She is not that dumb.

532
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,439
Is ear canceling not working?

533
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,509
(Giggling)

534
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,079
(Should I point it out or not?)

535
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,518
- We understand what she's saying.
- I just can't remember.

536
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,118
- Communication with her flows well.
- Right?

537
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,189
You know what's nice? For all of us,

538
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,818
- It'd be 300 dollars.
- it'd cost 300 dollars.

539
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,018
The price isn't bad.

540
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,118
It's nice.

541
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,089
Making sales of 300 dollars...

542
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,758
The presentation of the lemon...

543
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,559
- seems unnatural.
- I agree with that.

544
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,969
- There's too much lemon.
- Aren't they making it too obvious?

545
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:49,298
(The exaggerated lemon theme)

546
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:52,909
(Is it the production crew's setup?)

547
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,238
There's too much lemon.

548
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,368
The lemon seems...

549
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,508
It smells great.

550
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,579
By the way...

551
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,108
It smells great.

552
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:01,409
(Possessed by the fragrance while reasoning)

553
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,178
- It smells amazing.
- Right?

554
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,619
The smell is awesome.

555
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:05,789
It's incredible.

556
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:06,919
- It smells really delicious.
- Also...

557
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:08,918
Let me explain the dish.

558
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,018
- Okay.
- Please wait.

559
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:11,159
(The first lemon dish in the course meal)

560
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,089
- It smells amazing.
- How do we eat it?

561
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:16,228
- There's rice at the bottom.
- Is it rice?

562
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:17,429
(What is the first lemon dish?)

563
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,228
This is how we make it.

564
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:21,528
This is lemon marinated crab.

565
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,038
(Lemon marinated crab?)

566
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,639
What you'll taste is lemon marinated crab.

567
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,309
We also made lemon salted shrimp.

568
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:31,978
This is how we make lemon marinated crab.

569
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:33,748
(Seasonal blue crabs that are full of meat)

570
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:36,718
After sterilizing a glass jar, we add lemon slices,

571
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,218
green onions, green peppers, red peppers,

572
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,189
and blue crabs that are cleaned.

573
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,718
We pour lemon soy sauce made in person...

574
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:47,059
until all the ingredients are submerged.

575
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:51,628
Once we seal the jar and let it ferment for 72 hours,

576
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,968
the lemon marinated crab is ready.

577
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:57,139
(Lemon salted shrimp is also made the same way.)

578
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,968
There's risoni inside.

579
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:01,008
- It's cooked like rice.
- Is it lemon marinated crab?

580
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,239
It's a transformation of a dish that goes well with rice.

581
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,178
When the water boils,

582
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,019
risoni is cooked for four minutes.

583
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,688
We add black pepper, butter,

584
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,189
chili oil, and sesame oil to the pasta.

585
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:16,919
We mix them well until they become smooth.

586
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,528
The marinated crab is pressed...

587
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:23,599
to extract only the meat.

588
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,828
The well-cleaned salted shrimp is...

589
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:28,799
lightly seared on the surface with a torch.

590
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,768
We serve the risoni in a bowl.

591
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,439
It's topped with marinated crab and salted shrimp.

592
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,578
Then the last topping is added.

593
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,179
It's a type of rice cracker called five-color arare.

594
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,618
(The first dish is composed of lemon marinated crab and salted shrimp...)

595
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:49,458
(with risoni)

596
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,619
If you like the acid flavor, add more lemon juice.

597
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,689
Mix them together and enjoy.

598
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,758
- I've never seen this before.
- I can't imagine how it'd taste.

599
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,469
- It's my first time eating it.
- I see.

600
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:00,928
Lemon marinated crab?

601
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:01,999
(Smiling)

602
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,169
- I will try it.
- This is...

603
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:06,909
It's excellent.

604
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:08,238
(Eating)

605
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,509
It's delicious.

606
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,109
- It tastes very unusual.
- Gosh.

607
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,548
It's so delicious.

608
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:13,949
It's very delicious.

609
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:15,779
Gosh, this is...

610
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,648
It tastes really good.

611
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:19,749
(He's stunned again today.)

612
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,818
With marinated crab...

613
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,519
Yes, but it's lemon marinated crab.

614
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:25,758
- There's something fresh about it.
- Right.

615
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,228
It's slightly different from the marinated crab we know.

616
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,029
- It's different.
- Yes, the flavor is different.

617
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,958
- It's good.
- It's nice and clean.

618
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,028
Gosh.

619
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:34,368
(Smiling)

620
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,068
It's so delicious.

621
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:37,668
(Getting emotional)

622
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,409
Did you also cook the rice with lemon?

623
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:43,308
We used the lemon juice and lemon in the cooking.

624
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,439
Right?

625
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:46,808
In other words,

626
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,578
the tangy flavor...

627
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:51,079
- stimulates the palate.
- It's incredible.

628
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,218
- It tastes amazing.
- This can't be fake.

629
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:57,219
They couldn't have come up with...

630
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,788
such an amazing recipe just for the show.

631
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:59,988
When it's fake,

632
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:02,398
a chef gets invited to set up the menu.

633
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,558
That's also possible.

634
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,799
(In awe)

635
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:07,229
I definitely think that it's real.

636
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:09,799
- It totally whets the appetite.
- The price doesn't cover the cost.

637
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,469
You know what I see?

638
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,368
Ji Yoon is in love with it.

639
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:15,908
- Seriously.
- Definitely.

640
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,478
It increased my appetite completely.

641
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,938
I can tell...

642
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,778
that it's a taste that MZers would love.

643
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,578
Exactly. It tastes amazing.

644
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,219
Seok Jin couldn't finish his dish.

645
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,048
- He's already...
- I'm still eating.

646
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:28,948
- It's so delicious.
- Won Hun can't eat much either.

647
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,458
I'm taking my time with it.

648
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:31,688
Me too. I'm savoring it.

649
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:34,159
I'm an MZer, so this is perfect for me.

650
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:36,358
- It tastes amazing.
- It's really good.

651
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,828
- Seriously.
- Here's what I think.

652
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:39,168
The restaurant owners targeted...

653
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,369
- those around Ji Yoon's age.
- Right.

654
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:44,139
They would love this dish.

655
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:46,639
Is this dry-cured ham?

656
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:47,938
It's prosciutto.

657
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,109
It's the same thing.

658
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:50,978
Isn't it wrapped...

659
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,508
- with a cracker?
- Yes.

660
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:53,649
It's called senbei.

661
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,819
- That's correct.
- I haven't heard that in a while.

662
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,919
My father brought it home when I was a child.

663
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:01,618
Mangwon-dong has many old-fashioned snacks that can be easily found.

664
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,589
Mangwon Market is just around the corner,

665
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:06,759
so we buy them personally at the market.

666
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,728
What are you putting inside?

667
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:10,058
- This is...
- What you're putting in.

668
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:12,729
mashed potatoes flavored with lemon salt.

669
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,628
- It's mashed potatoes...
- I see.

670
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,399
- with a sour taste.
- Potatoes?

671
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,638
Inside a ginger rice cracker is filled...

672
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:22,409
with potato salad seasoned with lemon.

673
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,008
The rice cracker with a filling is...

674
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:28,249
wrapped with prosciutto.

675
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:32,219
It's topped with lemon zest to finish.

676
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:37,088
I've seen citron zest used as a topping,

677
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,559
but I've never seen lemon zest before.

678
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:42,559
(A combination of a traditional snack and a sour flavor)

679
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:47,399
(Potato cannoli, the second dish of the lemon course meal)

680
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:49,438
Can I eat it with my hand to be hip?

681
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,768
The second dish is called potato cannoli.

682
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:52,938
(Laughing)

683
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:55,938
- Seok Jin, wash your hands first.
- I washed them.

684
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,709
You didn't even wash your hands.

685
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,478
- That's not hip at all.
- Hey.

686
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:02,178
- Is eating with your hand hip?
- Of course. Listen.

687
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:04,448
When you eat sushi, you must eat it with your hand.

688
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:05,518
- If you go to India, - Seriously.

689
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,849
you'd go crazy.

690
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:08,548
(Laughing)

691
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,119
That's what I like.

692
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:11,459
I'd fit right in.

693
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,088
I haven't been to India yet.

694
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,159
I should go there one day.

695
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,958
(Without caring, he's busy enjoying the potato cannoli.)

696
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,968
(Chewing)

697
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,198
I should go there one day.

698
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,639
(The true wrinkling of the forehead)

699
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:26,939
This is also...

700
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,009
This is also...

701
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,578
It's mashed potatoes, but they taste sour.

702
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,609
(What's this?)

703
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:35,049
Gosh, you know what?

704
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,848
The menu is real.

705
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,219
There's a strong scent of lemon.

706
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,419
- It tastes good.
- It's really good.

707
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:43,888
Gosh, this is...

708
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,358
It's sweet, refreshing,

709
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,859
- and sour. Right?
- Yes.

710
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,058
How did you come up with the idea of wrapping it with dry-cured ham?

711
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:53,068
We wanted to make it salty and sweet.

712
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,428
Ginger rice cracker and prosciutto are...

713
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,438
sweet and salty.

714
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,069
That's how we came up with the combination.

715
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,738
Is this sold elsewhere?

716
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:04,609
I created it, and it's only sold here.

717
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:05,738
(You can taste it only in Mangwon-dong.)

718
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:07,878
- Here's what I think.
- It's delicious.

719
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,778
There are mashed potatoes inside,

720
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:11,949
but they aren't ordinary.

721
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,319
As they're flavored with lemon,

722
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,218
everything about them including the scent...

723
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:17,918
It's savory at the same time.

724
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,988
(Including the attractive savory taste from the lemon)

725
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:20,388
Wait a minute.

726
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:22,189
It looks like herbal medicine from the past.

727
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,158
It only costs 50 dollars,

728
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,398
- but the course meal is...
- It can't be 50 dollars.

729
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,528
The main dish must be coming up.

730
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:28,728
Is meat included in the meal?

731
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:29,739
What's this?

732
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,368
- It's fish.
- Is it eel?

733
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:33,768
The next dish is...

734
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:35,808
made with lemon wine.

735
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,438
It's steamed hairtail that's in season.

736
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,678
- Hairtail?
- Hairtail?

737
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,579
- It looks so good.
- 50 dollars, with steamed hairtail?

738
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,279
- That's ridiculous.
- And dry-cured ham.

739
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:43,619
That's impossible.

740
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,548
The meat of the hairtail is...

741
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,789
seasoned with lemon salt flakes and black pepper.

742
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:51,388
It's lightly seared...

743
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:53,959
with a torch on both sides.

744
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:59,268
On a sheet of baking paper, place the prepared hairtail,

745
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:01,129
taro, shallots,

746
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:02,768
sun-dried tomatoes,

747
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:03,968
short-necked clams,

748
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,269
lemon slices,

749
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,439
edamame,

750
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:07,539
thyme,

751
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:11,039
and lemon wine called lemon spritz.

752
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:16,749
Bake it in a pre-heated oven at 200°C for 9 minutes.

753
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,248
It's baked with seasonal vegetables in autumn.

754
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,758
It tastes even better...

755
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,228
with brachycarpa and sauces.

756
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,228
(Lemon steamed hairtail)

757
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,399
(The third dish in the lemon course meal)

758
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,058
The price isn't enough to cover everything.

759
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,299
I have two pieces of hairtail.

760
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,398
This is impossible. Hairtail is so expensive.

761
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,568
This doesn't make sense.

762
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,739
I removed all the bones from the hairtail.

763
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,238
- It won't cover the labor cost.
- Exactly.

764
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,779
Look how thick it is.

765
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,938
- Sir, this isn't possible.
- Look at this.

766
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:48,349
- Fifty dollars isn't enough.
- The restaurant owner is fake.

767
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,419
That's how it's cooked. The hairtail...

768
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:55,319
(Eating with both hands)

769
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:56,618
Whether it's...

770
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,658
fake or real, it tastes so good.

771
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:01,189
- I can't think straight.
- That's what happens.

772
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,499
- That's why it's difficult.
- It's so good.

773
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,458
With the lemon,

774
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:06,998
it doesn't smell fishy at all.

775
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,628
- It tastes amazing.
- I agree.

776
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:09,799
(Lemon's acidity and flavor remove all the fishy smell.)

777
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:12,368
We don't need to be suspicious of this restaurant.

778
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,368
- We should just enjoy it.
- Really?

779
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,668
The food tastes good,

780
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:19,549
but more importantly, both of them cook professionally.

781
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,879
Both of them are real.

782
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:22,578
If this place is fake,

783
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,319
I want to invest and open up a restaurant like this.

784
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,678
(Showing off his bluntness)

785
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,049
I'm serious. It tastes excellent.

786
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,048
Yes, it's delicious. It's not fishy at all.

787
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:31,119
Kyung Pyo loves to invest.

788
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:32,888
Kyung Pyo.

789
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:35,589
- He's an investment fanatic - He's such an investment fanatic.

790
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,959
I'm planning a business right now. Do you want to join me?

791
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,599
Give me the information in a PowerPoint presentation.

792
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,598
Do I have to prepare a presentation for you?

793
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,999
Seok Jin doesn't know how to use PowerPoint.

794
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,068
You don't know how to use PowerPoint.

795
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:49,609
I can tell my manager to do it.

796
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,938
You should do it. Why would you ask your manager?

797
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,209
I bet you'll be tempted by it.

798
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:57,119
I haven't started it because the other person hasn't agreed yet.

799
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:59,179
It will be an organic bakery.

800
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,049
Why don't you return to farming instead?

801
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,788
(You've worked hard so far.)

802
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,928
Even if he starts farming,

803
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:10,458
he'll be known as the man who works without a shirt.

804
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,528
(Farmer Jee, a man who works without a shirt)

805
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:13,998
(The meat appears.)

806
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,469
There's even beef?

807
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:17,298
- What? No way.
- No way.

808
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,639
But it's only 50 dollars.

809
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,539
You even serve meat?

810
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:23,079
It can't be an omakase without meat.

811
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,449
For the top blade steak, we mix our homemade seasoned soy sauce...

812
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,619
and pear juice in a 2-to-1 ratio.

813
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,988
Sesame oil and crushed garlic are added.

814
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:35,849
We marinate the meat in the mixture for an hour.

815
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:39,288
We place whole garlic cloves, green onions, green peppers,

816
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,329
red peppers, and the marinated meat in a vacuum bag.

817
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,229
After adding lemon oil to it,

818
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,328
it's cooked in a sous-vide machine...

819
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,129
for 45 minutes.

820
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,268
The top blade steak confit is...

821
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,308
lightly torched on the surface to keep it warm...

822
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:56,238
It's cooked according to your preference.

823
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,478
(By searing the surface of the meat cooked in sous-vide,)

824
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,909
(the cooking is complete.)

825
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:02,409
Slice the beef appropriately...

826
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,849
and serve it stacked over romesco sauce.

827
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:11,359
(Lemon butter combo, the fourth dish of the lemon course meal)

828
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,928
It's inspired by braised ribs.

829
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:17,599
It's made with butter, beef, mushrooms, and pickles.

830
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,028
The smell is incredible.

831
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,099
Please dip it in the sauce and enjoy it.

832
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:25,138
(The plate of mesmerizing visuals that evokes awe)

833
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,108
- This is crazy.
- The meat melts in the mouth.

834
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:29,478
(The appearance passes the test. How about the taste?)

835
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,709
Please dip it in the sauce and enjoy it.

836
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,579
The meat is incredible. Try it.

837
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,948
(The stunning taste knocks him out continuously.)

838
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:37,978
It tastes amazing.

839
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,219
- Does it?
- Yes.

840
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,889
The meat melts in the mouth.

841
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:42,719
I'm not a huge fan of fusion food,

842
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,858
but I love this.

843
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:45,859
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

844
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:46,989
Seriously.

845
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:48,829
All the dishes up until now were appetizers.

846
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:51,929
This is the main dish.

847
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,499
This is impossible.

848
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,539
The meat is cooked perfectly.

849
00:30:58,369 --> 00:30:59,668
It tastes so good.

850
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:02,339
- The meat melts.
- It's very delicious.

851
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,649
We put a lot of effort in the cooking process.

852
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:08,378
Like sous-vide at a low temperature,

853
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:09,949
we used a method called confit.

854
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:13,388
We added ingredients like lemon oil to it.

855
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:14,648
What's this?

856
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:16,219
(Cooked slowly at a low temperature for tender meat and lemon fragrance)

857
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:19,659
(Everyone is impressed by the taste and the care.)

858
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:20,859
Bravo.

859
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,428
(Happy)

860
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,298
(Nice shot, sir.)

861
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,628
What's this white thing?

862
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,769
- It's lemon butter.
- Lemon butter?

863
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:34,138
We made it by adding lemon juice to the butter.

864
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:35,168
It tastes so good.

865
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:38,509
(Handmade lemon butter made with lemon juice and butter)

866
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,408
This is the one you can spread on the bread at a family restaurant.

867
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:42,708
- Is it?
- This is exactly it.

868
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,249
- Is it the same butter?
- I think so.

869
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:46,918
Did you also season the mushrooms with lemon?

870
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,218
We pickled the mushrooms with lemon.

871
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,988
These mushrooms are key.

872
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:51,559
(Another key ingredient, lemon mushroom pickles)

873
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:53,558
- The mushrooms are great.
- They're amazing.

874
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,589
They're so delicious.

875
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:55,629
(Lemon mushroom pickles provide a refreshing taste.)

876
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:58,299
Seok Jin enjoyed this dish the most in the course meal.

877
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,869
Right.

878
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:01,899
So far, this is the best dish in the meal.

879
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,738
I don't care whether it's real or fake. It just tastes delicious.

880
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:07,908
I want to keep eating.

881
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:09,939
(All the ingredients blend so well that you keep wanting more.)

882
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,009
We should finish the shoot here.

883
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,549
It's game over.

884
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,048
The price isn't enough to cover the costs.

885
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,179
Definitely not.

886
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:20,589
I've seen those kinds of cases at some restaurants.

887
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:24,289
When all the food is served,

888
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:26,388
the chef asks for a ten-dollar bill...

889
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:27,829
for a magic trick.

890
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,399
It's a magic trick where the bill disappears.

891
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,559
They could do that to cover the costs.

892
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,769
- What is he saying?
- Won Hun.

893
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:37,338
- Your imagination is impressive.
- That can't be done these days.

894
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:39,399
- You can get in trouble for that.
- I'm serious.

895
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,338
It's better to increase...

896
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:42,908
- the price by 20 dollars.
- Right.

897
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,638
That would be upsetting.

898
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:45,808
- "The money disappeared." - You could get arrested.

899
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,249
- You would feel robbed.
- Wouldn't that be a scam?

900
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:49,508
The price isn't...

901
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,779
- enough to cover the costs.
- Right.

902
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:55,348
- It's wearing a lemon hat.
- The dessert looks amazing.

903
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,118
- It looks so pretty.
- That has to be good.

904
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,259
Lemon sorbet.

905
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:00,958
Is this the last dish?

906
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,058
Yes, your dessert will be served.

907
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:07,029
(Lemon ice cream, the fifth dish in the lemon course meal)

908
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:09,369
Yes.

909
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:15,468
- The ice cream is...
- It's sour.

910
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:16,539
(3 levels of admiration)

911
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,439
It's very sour.

912
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:21,649
(Shutting his eyes tight)

913
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,079
Seok Jin doesn't like it. I don't think he likes it.

914
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,419
I love it.

915
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,519
(Even the dessert is insanely good.)

916
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:30,818
Are they able to cover the costs?

917
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:32,119
This is impossible.

918
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,088
Seok Jin, this can't be real.

919
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:35,989
- Isn't it so good?
- It seems very fake.

920
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:39,028
If I were to make this course meal, it'd cost more than 50 dollars.

921
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:40,229
- Right.
- That's my guess.

922
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,469
What's suspicious is that...

923
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:46,068
the chefs served the food directly from the containers.

924
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,109
All they did was cooking with a torch.

925
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:51,708
What Ji Yoon said sounds reasonable.

926
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,278
Right? All they did was serve the food.

927
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,949
(All the dishes were prepared in advance.)

928
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,918
Kyung Pyo, take a look at the lemon bottles up there

929
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,118
Are those bottles available for sale?

930
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,849
It looks like a Japanese beer.

931
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,588
- Lemon beer?
- Japanese lemon beer.

932
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:05,319
Can you take that one out too? There's zero written on it.

933
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:06,489
- This one?
- Yes.

934
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,158
I can take it out. This is real.

935
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,288
This is it.

936
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,629
There's a lot of dust on it.

937
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,269
It's covered with dust.

938
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,999
- It's covered with dust.
- It's covered with dust.

939
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,638
- What?
- It's covered with dust.

940
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,039
It's covered with dust.

941
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,178
I think they actually run this restaurant.

942
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,678
(Is it a running restaurant?)

943
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,348
- Am I wrong?
- They couldn't come up with...

944
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:28,578
a way to hide the dust.

945
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:29,719
I don't think so.

946
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:31,048
It's a type of dust that the design team...

947
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:32,548
- can't make.
- Right.

948
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:34,648
You can tell when the dust is made by the design team.

949
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,619
(Is this place real?)

950
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,229
When the restaurant theme is lemon, would that bring a lot of business?

951
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,658
I doubt it.

952
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,899
(Lemon course meal)

953
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,228
The price doesn't make sense.

954
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:48,299
Right.

955
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,169
The costs would be too high.

956
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,868
The price can't be 50 dollars.

957
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:56,979
- Right.
- I agree.

958
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:59,178
This is impossible.

959
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,408
It's impossible.

960
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:01,409
(Cost of 500 dollars is still suspicious.)

961
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,318
- Should I go in?
- No, I'll go in.

962
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:04,478
- It's okay.
- I'll go in.

963
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,719
You should sit in the middle.

964
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,649
- "In the middle?" - That's the most uncomfortable.

965
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:10,889
- He pretended to be considerate.
- He's the worst.

966
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:13,228
Ji Yoon, did you see how terrible he is?

967
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:14,829
- Sit here.
- He almost sounded considerate.

968
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,698
Sit where it's safe.

969
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:17,758
(A safe seat?)

970
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:18,958
- A safe seat?
- A safe seat.

971
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,299
- It's the safest seat.
- That's funny.

972
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:24,099
- This is really difficult.
- It is.

973
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,568
Most customers would be in their 20s and 30s.

974
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:29,169
The price of 50 dollars could be appropriate.

975
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,209
We should've asked the price of alcohol.

976
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,348
When food price isn't enough to cover the costs...

977
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,719
- It's adjusted with alcohol prices.
- Right.

978
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,478
If the monthly rent is 500 to 600 dollars,

979
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:42,048
- it could be possible.
- Yes, the rent sounds reasonable.

980
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,388
Right? It's on an alley, and the surface area is small.

981
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,389
Exactly.

982
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:47,289
I think it's fake.

983
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,129
When I was giving them my autograph,

984
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:53,168
one of the owners knew the exact name of the restaurant.

985
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:55,399
When I asked the other one about it,

986
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:56,898
he stammered.

987
00:35:56,899 --> 00:35:58,739
I asked, "Lemon or Lemong?"

988
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:02,368
He couldn't tell me clearly.

989
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,639
- Really?
- Yes.

990
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:07,249
(After the shoot, Ji Yoon was giving her autograph to the restaurant.)

991
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,179
- What is the restaurant called?
- Lemon, Lemong.

992
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,018
Okay.

993
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,148
- Thank you.
- Is Lemon correct?

994
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:13,748
(Nodding awkwardly)

995
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:16,249
(Suspicious)

996
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:18,388
(He got confused with the restaurant's name.)

997
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:22,359
(I caught him!)

998
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,529
- Really?
- He couldn't tell me clearly.

999
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,668
That place seemed totally fake.

1000
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:27,829
(The first place seemed completely fake.)

1001
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:29,468
I took photos of the food for the first time.

1002
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:31,598
- Really?
- I really loved it.

1003
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,209
- Seok Jin also took photos.
- I took a photo of the meat.

1004
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:36,338
My favorite was the rice that we had first.

1005
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:38,008
- The marinated crab rice?
- Wasn't it amazing?

1006
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,178
The first dish was excellent.

1007
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:40,809
- I know.
- It was delicious.

1008
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,478
Seok Jin didn't eat the rice.

1009
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,218
(Feeling guilty)

1010
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:45,248
Right?

1011
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:47,049
Won Hun also had a hard time eating it.

1012
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:49,788
- It's because...
- Won Hun is a middle-aged man now.

1013
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:51,118
Seok Jin, I'm not a middle-aged man.

1014
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,688
Yes, you are. You couldn't even eat it.

1015
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:54,288
You couldn't digest what we had.

1016
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,658
Ji Yoon is young enough to digest it.

1017
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:56,828
You can't compare me to you.

1018
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:57,928
- Seok Jin.
- Why not?

1019
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:59,358
I'm the president of Generation MZ.

1020
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,768
- President, my foot.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1021
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,098
Were you elected as president?

1022
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,738
When were you elected as the president of Generation MZ?

1023
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,038
I've never heard of such an election.

1024
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,309
Won Hun.

1025
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:09,309
Your nose looks like a middle-aged person.

1026
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:10,438
(He wants to run away.)

1027
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,479
Goodness.

1028
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,608
- Gosh.
- It's because...

1029
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,879
Won Hun got a comedone extraction on his nose.

1030
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:19,548
Won Hun, I'm being serious about this.

1031
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:21,288
I haven't seen a strawberry nose in a long time.

1032
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,289
(Laughing)

1033
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,189
I haven't seen a strawberry nose in a long time.

1034
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,359
The last time was a drunk man I saw when I was a child.

1035
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:31,298
- I haven't seen it in a long time.
- You know what?

1036
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:33,398
Many people say that I look like Jackie Chan.

1037
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:35,729
- Your nose is like Jackie Chan's.
- You do look like him.

1038
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,168
You look like Jackie Chan.

1039
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:39,238
When it comes to your nose, you're my senior.

1040
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,468
You have a middle-aged nose.

1041
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:43,779
Seok Jin got his nose wings reduced.

1042
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:45,138
- Really?
- Seriously?

1043
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,208
You didn't know?

1044
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:48,878
- So that's why.
- That's why it looks unusual here.

1045
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:51,518
It's not the same nose he had on "X-Man."

1046
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,118
I've never been on "X-Man."

1047
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,318
- Really?
- "Star Golden Bell."

1048
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,488
- My goodness.
- Where did I see him?

1049
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:56,888
- Really?
- "Star Golden Bell."

1050
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:58,588
- Where did I see him?
- "Star Golden Bell?"

1051
00:37:58,589 --> 00:37:59,788
I really enjoyed the show.

1052
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:02,329
Weren't you sitting at the second row from the back?

1053
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,128
- He was the host.
- He was the host.

1054
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:05,259
He was the host.

1055
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,898
- He was the host.
- Yes, of course.

1056
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:08,899
(As the host of "Star Golden Bell," he never sat in the rows.)

1057
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:09,899
(Laughing)

1058
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,098
You are offended, right?

1059
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,098
- I enjoyed that show so much.
- Seok Jin's offended.

1060
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,369
- I think he's offended.
- I see.

1061
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:15,609
"Star Golden Bell?"

1062
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,379
Seok Jin was the host,

1063
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:20,349
but his work didn't stand out or anything.

1064
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,048
- I played it safe.
- Safe but boring.

1065
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:25,718
- It was stable.
- Right, it was stable.

1066
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,719
(They reach the next location without any fuss.)

1067
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,989
Hold on. Isn't this place...

1068
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:29,488
- What about this place?
- It's Hapjeong Station.

1069
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:31,389
This is my home turf!

1070
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:33,828
- This area...
- Is it your home turf?

1071
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:35,559
I know a lot of the restaurants here.

1072
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:36,729
Really?

1073
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:38,699
We come to this area often.

1074
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:39,928
Here?

1075
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:41,268
- I know every place around here.
- We're in Hapjeong.

1076
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:42,269
(The area zoomer Ji Yoon knows like the back of her hand.)

1077
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:43,538
Hapjeong.

1078
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:46,809
(Dazzling at night)

1079
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:50,408
(Hapjeong, the capital of all hipster spots)

1080
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:52,309
Before we head to the second location,

1081
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:55,508
we'll visit a place that's been going viral on social media.

1082
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:57,578
- Really?
- We'll make a brief stop.

1083
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:58,579
It's an existing place, right?

1084
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,988
I went clubbing here a lot.

1085
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,018
- Really?
- The B club around here...

1086
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:04,218
- That's a famous! It's near here.
- Right?

1087
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,818
- Ji Yoon instantly knew.
- Tell me about it.

1088
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:07,328
- What did I tell you?
- Brownie, right?

1089
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:09,228
- You don't know the place, do you?
- What was that?

1090
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:10,258
Dancing at Club Brownie, right?

1091
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,399
He got the name wrong.

1092
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:12,559
He already got it wrong.

1093
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:13,698
Club Brownie.

1094
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:16,198
Isn't a brownie the name of a dessert?

1095
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:18,339
His ears have gotten even redder.

1096
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,839
- A brownie is something you eat.
- Look how red his ears are.

1097
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:23,438
- Over here.
- I used to go clubbing a lot.

1098
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,939
- This must be it.
- What is this place?

1099
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,808
- I know what this is!
- Really? It's completely new to me.

1100
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,709
- What is it?
- Huge matcha...

1101
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,019
- This place...
- I know what this is!

1102
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,919
- Matcha makgeolli?
- I haven't heard of this before.

1103
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:35,219
Matcha tteokbokki has been all the rage lately.

1104
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,759
You should try it.

1105
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:39,858
It's a must-visit spot in Hapjeong for daydrinking.

1106
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:40,859
(Flooded with reviews on social media)

1107
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:45,699
(A place that even celebrities fell in love with)

1108
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,068
- If KEY was here, that says it all.
- Absolutely.

1109
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:49,329
- Of course.
- Hyoyeon was here too.

1110
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:52,638
Won Hun, isn't this the kind of look you need to rule zoomers?

1111
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,839
That's the hair color I had in mind.

1112
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,269
Seriously.

1113
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,408
I'm going to bleach my hair next week.

1114
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:58,409
I don't think you should.

1115
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:00,008
- Let's go in for now.
- I look good in that color.

1116
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:01,779
"Sexy food that even celebrities fell for."

1117
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,149
It looks good even from the photos.

1118
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,479
I can't believe they have matcha makgeolli.

1119
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,789
I'm impressed.

1120
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:11,188
Honestly, I'm not too sold on matcha tteokbokki.

1121
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,189
It's the same with matcha latte.

1122
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:15,358
It's tasty but has a slightly unpleasant earthy taste.

1123
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,828
- Exactly.
- Yes, your throat dries up.

1124
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:20,398
That's why I don't enjoy a lot of matcha-based drinks or desserts.

1125
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,399
I just don't favor them.

1126
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,998
- Same here.
- Right?

1127
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:26,038
Young people these days are more health-conscious,

1128
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,508
which is why matcha has been trending.

1129
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,038
- There's even matcha-core fashion.
- Exactly.

1130
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,078
- Really?
- They dress in green items...

1131
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,848
and take photos drinking matcha-based drinks.

1132
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,048
- Has that been trending?
- Yes.

1133
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,919
(Matcha's rising popularity has even affected companies.)

1134
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,419
- Oh, that?
- Matcha latte instead of coffee.

1135
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,318
I took some photos that play into that theme...

1136
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:45,159
to post on social media.

1137
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:46,788
- Really?
- Did you take a lot?

1138
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,128
- I wore green items.
- Can you show us?

1139
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,329
- I forgot to bring my phone.
- Have strawberry latte today.

1140
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,369
- Do you have strawberry latte?
- I'm afraid we don't.

1141
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,698
- What's this?
- It's matcha tteokbokki.

1142
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:58,438
(Instead, matcha tteokbokki is served.)

1143
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,709
This wasn't ice!

1144
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:02,201
It's matcha tteokbokki.

1145
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,731
(The matcha tteokbokki they ordered is served.)

1146
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:06,031
This wasn't ice!

1147
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,141
They look like pebbles.

1148
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:08,172
Thank you.

1149
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:11,412
(The rice cakes have a surface as smooth as pebbles.)

1150
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,181
They look like pebbles.

1151
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:16,142
(Soft, chewy rice cakes sit in a thick matcha sauce.)

1152
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,312
(Matcha tteokbokki)

1153
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:20,452
Thank you.

1154
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:23,721
These days,

1155
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:25,991
part-timers everywhere are so tall.

1156
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:27,121
I mean...

1157
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:28,391
I'm intimidated by them.

1158
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:29,522
(His eyes were glued on the part-timer.)

1159
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:30,932
- Looks must be one of the criteria.
- Right?

1160
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:34,702
Honestly, he looks more like a celebrity than we do.

1161
00:41:35,302 --> 00:41:37,532
If we're comparing looks...

1162
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:39,971
- He has an ordinary nose.
- Us three shouldn't be celebrities.

1163
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:42,101
Why do you keep placing me in your group?

1164
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:44,372
Out of all of us, you look the most outdated.

1165
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:47,382
Your nose, I mean.

1166
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:48,781
These three are a team,

1167
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:50,282
and you're one of us today.

1168
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:51,681
- Jae Seok, please.
- No, he's with them.

1169
00:41:51,682 --> 00:41:52,851
Won Hun, come on.

1170
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:55,322
- Stop it, will you?
- I don't like being seen that way.

1171
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:57,192
- Why don't we eat in groups?
- What?

1172
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:58,522
- Like this.
- Come on.

1173
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:00,592
This...

1174
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:01,822
- I'll enjoy.
- Will this taste all right?

1175
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,962
- I'll enjoy.
- We should go to Seongsu sometime,

1176
00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:05,162
- and go to a pretty cafe...
- Get over here.

1177
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:06,891
(Get over here.)

1178
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,062
Get over here. You're one of us.

1179
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:12,472
(The zoomers continue to eat without caring.)

1180
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:15,201
- It's delicious!
- How is this tteokbokki?

1181
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,272
Nice.

1182
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:18,372
(Trying some)

1183
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:20,581
It's good.

1184
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:24,611
(You can't help but smile after tasting it.)

1185
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:25,982
- Right?
- It's really good.

1186
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:28,781
This is injeolmi without powdered soybean.

1187
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:29,782
It's tasty.

1188
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:30,791
(Like sweet injeolmi without powdered soybean)

1189
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,851
It's not the tteokbokki we'd expect.

1190
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:33,861
- But the sweetness...
- It's like a dessert.

1191
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:36,061
It's tasty in a way that a kkultteok would be.

1192
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:37,732
- It's a sweet kkultteok.
- I'll tell you what it is.

1193
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,061
- It's what young people like.
- That's right.

1194
00:42:41,062 --> 00:42:42,961
- It's a dessert.
- A sweet rice cake dish.

1195
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:44,671
It's sweet but bitter.

1196
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:45,701
- That's right.
- Exactly.

1197
00:42:45,702 --> 00:42:46,702
(Sweet yet bitter, a fusion of flavors)

1198
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:48,171
It's nothing like the red tteokbokki.

1199
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:49,402
- It's like this.
- Not at all.

1200
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:50,911
Mimi, what do you think?

1201
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:52,041
I really like it.

1202
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,942
- I like it too.
- Guys, hear Seok Jin out.

1203
00:42:54,312 --> 00:42:56,211
I didn't realize you were saying something.

1204
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:57,352
- Won Hun.
- Yes?

1205
00:42:57,982 --> 00:42:59,551
Sorry, Seok Jin.

1206
00:42:59,552 --> 00:43:00,882
We can't hear you over here.

1207
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,651
You guys are excused since you're zoomers,

1208
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:04,252
but you're one of us.

1209
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:06,152
You're with us!

1210
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,762
I was talking to them just fine.

1211
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,661
There was no need to stress it while flipping your bangs.

1212
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:11,731
That's because I had to face you.

1213
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:12,732
(Expressing his anger by flipping his bangs)

1214
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:15,401
(While they are talking, the next dish arrives.)

1215
00:43:15,402 --> 00:43:16,831
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1216
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:18,671
- This is corn jeon.
- What on earth?

1217
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:20,131
(Jaw-dropping)

1218
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:21,371
- That looks good.
- This is what I'd like.

1219
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:22,502
What on earth is this?

1220
00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:26,441
We pour flames onto the jeon. Would that be all right?

1221
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:28,081
- Sure.
- You pour flames onto it?

1222
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:29,182
Yes, flames.

1223
00:43:30,182 --> 00:43:31,412
What on earth is this?

1224
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:35,521
(Heated whiskey...)

1225
00:43:35,522 --> 00:43:37,222
(is poured onto the jeon.)

1226
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:38,691
I see the flames.

1227
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:40,391
- There you go.
- It caught on.

1228
00:43:40,392 --> 00:43:43,992
(Flaring up)

1229
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:45,232
The honey's melting.

1230
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:47,631
So that's how you melt the cheese.

1231
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:48,632
That's right.

1232
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,001
This looks good.

1233
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,002
(Visually stunning, honey corn jeon)

1234
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:52,702
(Crispy)

1235
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:53,872
(My gosh)

1236
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:55,972
We also serve matcha makgeolli.

1237
00:43:56,002 --> 00:43:57,002
(No way)

1238
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:59,012
You know what?

1239
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,741
There's a slight spiciness...

1240
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,041
- It's so good.
- that balances out the richness.

1241
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:04,052
Is it spicy?

1242
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:07,082
Why is it spicy? It is unique.

1243
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:12,951
- Check out the lights.
- Gosh, the lights.

1244
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:14,661
They're porcelain.

1245
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:15,691
Porcelain?

1246
00:44:15,692 --> 00:44:17,291
- White porcelains.
- I hear they're trending.

1247
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,661
- Really?
- Really?

1248
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:20,732
- The so-called moon jars.
- Yes, moon jars.

1249
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:23,501
Moon jars were gifts presented to the king during...

1250
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:25,402
the Joseon dynasty.

1251
00:44:25,672 --> 00:44:27,372
You should take one to use as a chamber pot.

1252
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:32,041
- Won Hun, that was...
- Seriously?

1253
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,672
- That sounded personal.
- Don't worry about me.

1254
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,181
It's fine.

1255
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:36,781
- I was targeted so much on the bus.
- I know.

1256
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:39,652
- I must've been holding a grudge.
- That was obviously emotional.

1257
00:44:39,752 --> 00:44:41,181
- I don't need a chamber pot.
- No way.

1258
00:44:41,182 --> 00:44:42,851
Won Hun's emotions are running high.

1259
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:45,592
- I don't need a chamber pot.
- That's not how I usually am.

1260
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,391
- You'll head to the next location.
- Sure.

1261
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:51,992
(Before things get any more heated, they head to the next location.)

1262
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:54,532
- I think this was a taco place.
- A new type of taco?

1263
00:44:54,602 --> 00:44:55,631
Really?

1264
00:44:55,632 --> 00:44:57,172
(Is the second popular place located on a semi-basement floor?)

1265
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:58,471
- You'll know...
- Yes.

1266
00:44:58,472 --> 00:44:59,602
- since this is your turf.
- I do.

1267
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:01,101
Do you know this taco place?

1268
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:02,301
I think I've seen it before.

1269
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:04,872
I've seen it before. I remember the platter.

1270
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:08,082
(Is it a taco place Ji Yoon is familiar with?)

1271
00:45:08,512 --> 00:45:11,752
(What new type of taco is served here?)

1272
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,711
This place seems...

1273
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,782
- This seems too real.
- It is.

1274
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,821
What can be surprising about a taco?

1275
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:20,052
- Tell me about it.
- This restaurant looks real.

1276
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:22,461
The place already looks trendy.

1277
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:24,431
(Already looking trendy)

1278
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:26,061
You think anything that's flashy...

1279
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:27,462
- is trendy.
- It's so trendy.

1280
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,162
What if we took a photo here?

1281
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:30,871
- It'll look like we're abroad.
- It'll look like we're abroad.

1282
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,831
It is written as "Mexican Grill and Taco."

1283
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:34,972
(A flashy neon sign that's Jae Seok's type)

1284
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,142
- The overall vibe of the place...
- Check out the intense colors.

1285
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:38,842
Let's check it out.

1286
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:41,712
- It's even more stylish from here.
- How so?

1287
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:44,112
- It's trendy.
- Trendy and stylish.

1288
00:45:44,212 --> 00:45:45,411
Look at it from down the steps.

1289
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,552
(Colorful and trendy)

1290
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,121
(A stylish interior for hipsters with vivid colors)

1291
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,252
It's so trendy.

1292
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:53,752
Check this out.

1293
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:56,921
That'll scare off the elderly.

1294
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,131
(He represents the elderly.)

1295
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:00,231
- Just because it's trendy...
- Seok Jin.

1296
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:03,201
- It is too tiny to scare them off.
- Of course they're be alarmed.

1297
00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:06,071
Imagine seeing this at night. That would spook them!

1298
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:07,772
It's decorated in a Mexican theme.

1299
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:09,572
There's Coco and even skeletons.

1300
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:11,411
(An adorable skeleton theme? Hi!)

1301
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:12,472
I love the mood.

1302
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,711
There's a certain vibe to it.

1303
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:15,842
(It's a little scary.)

1304
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:17,811
- This place is real.
- What?

1305
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:19,281
- This place is real.
- Yes, it's real,

1306
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,052
but there's something peculiar.

1307
00:46:21,152 --> 00:46:23,991
- I wonder what that is.
- What kind of taco can be new?

1308
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:24,992
Tell me about it.

1309
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:27,461
We'll have to talk to the owner to find out.

1310
00:46:27,462 --> 00:46:28,492
(What's a new type of taco?)

1311
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,491
- Hello.
- Hi.

1312
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:31,662
Hi, sir.

1313
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:35,661
What new type of taco do you serve?

1314
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:39,501
Have you ever heard of dipping a taco into soup?

1315
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:40,502
- In a soup?
- Yes.

1316
00:46:40,503 --> 00:46:41,802
- That's new.
- You dip taco into soup.

1317
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:44,441
There's birria taco,

1318
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:47,111
a Mexican dish which you dip the taco into a broth.

1319
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:48,211
We put our own spin on it...

1320
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:52,311
and turned it into a taco you dip into instant cup ramyeon.

1321
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:53,481
(A Korean twist on a dish where you dip a taco into instant cup ramyeon)

1322
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:54,582
In instant cup ramyeon?

1323
00:46:55,552 --> 00:46:57,651
- In instant cup ramyeon?
- Do you mean the seasoning...

1324
00:46:57,652 --> 00:47:00,591
- or the noodle and broth?
- The whole thing.

1325
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:04,231
Won't you end up with a soggy taco?

1326
00:47:04,232 --> 00:47:05,661
- I can't imagine.
- What is that?

1327
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:06,691
You can't imagine, can you?

1328
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:07,732
- No.
- It's quite delicious.

1329
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:13,102
(A special meet up between taco and instant cup ramyeon)

1330
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:14,371
Birria tacos are tacos...

1331
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:17,242
which you dip them in chili sauce.

1332
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:19,042
Birria tacos was...

1333
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:24,011
the most searched food on Google in 2020.

1334
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:26,081
(The whole world went crazy for birria tacos.)

1335
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:28,451
Birria tacos became...

1336
00:47:28,452 --> 00:47:30,181
viral since then,

1337
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:33,222
and when Korean food became popular,

1338
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:36,261
a lot of people started dipping tacos in instant cup ramyeon...

1339
00:47:36,262 --> 00:47:38,192
and made a meme out of it too.

1340
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,761
We referenced the overseas meme...

1341
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:44,472
and made a menu whereby you dip tacos in instant cup ramyeon.

1342
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:48,301
(They reimported the Korean food culture...)

1343
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:51,271
(that was popular overseas and made taco with instant cup ramyeon.)

1344
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:53,871
Many of the customers like it,

1345
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,481
and when foreigners come,

1346
00:47:55,482 --> 00:47:57,551
they always order...

1347
00:47:57,552 --> 00:47:59,382
one birria taco each.

1348
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:05,692
(The trend now is to dip tacos in instant cup ramyeon.)

1349
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:06,891
Sixth Sense members,

1350
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:08,521
is this menu real?

1351
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:10,962
(Sixth Sense members, is this menu real?)

1352
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,962
When did you release this menu?

1353
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,261
As for the combination with ramyeon,

1354
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:18,501
last summer, about a year ago.

1355
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:19,632
- It's been quite a while.
- That's when we released it.

1356
00:48:20,972 --> 00:48:24,041
If that's the case, the word must've spread.

1357
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,541
(We should've heard about it at least once.)

1358
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:27,812
I quite like tacos,

1359
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:29,341
but I've never heard about this.

1360
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:30,442
Do people like it?

1361
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:32,051
They love it.

1362
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:33,852
We became famous...

1363
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:36,752
because customers came to order the ramyeon menu.

1364
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:39,751
So the restaurants...

1365
00:48:39,752 --> 00:48:41,561
The restaurant became crowded.

1366
00:48:41,562 --> 00:48:43,862
(Nostrils flaring)

1367
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:45,561
(Suspicious)

1368
00:48:45,562 --> 00:48:46,961
The owner seems a bit...

1369
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:48,032
(Do you think so too?)

1370
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:49,731
He keeps stuttering.

1371
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:52,002
- He feels a bit rushed.
- He stutters a bit.

1372
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:54,202
It feels like he memorized the lines.

1373
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:56,272
I'm sorry. We need to...

1374
00:48:56,472 --> 00:48:58,541
- We need to suspect everything.
- It's okay.

1375
00:48:58,542 --> 00:48:59,611
Even your laugh...

1376
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:01,881
(His laugh seems somewhat awkward too.)

1377
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:03,311
That's how you laugh when you do a skit.

1378
00:49:03,312 --> 00:49:04,412
Does your outfit mean something?

1379
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:07,982
(Is he a fake owner who memorized his lines hastily?)

1380
00:49:08,082 --> 00:49:09,722
- Here it comes.
- He's serving it right away.

1381
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:12,422
- Excuse me.
- It's really served like that.

1382
00:49:14,192 --> 00:49:16,091
Even the bowl looks like that.

1383
00:49:16,092 --> 00:49:17,292
- Wow.
- It looks delicious.

1384
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:19,491
- The bowl...
- What's this?

1385
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:20,561
It's the same size as the instant cup ramyeon.

1386
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:22,062
He made this.

1387
00:49:23,702 --> 00:49:25,531
(The restaurant's special bowls)

1388
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:26,772
That's amazing.

1389
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:29,072
In the shape of the instant cup ramyeon bowl,

1390
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:31,711
- I see. That's clever.
- he made the bowls.

1391

(Hip point: Special bowls for instant cup ramyeon)

(Taco with instant cup ramyeon)

1393

Dipping tacos in the soup is our signature menu.

1394
00:49:38,282 --> 00:49:40,412
Dip tortilla in chili oil...

1395
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:42,522
and place it on a hot grill.

1396
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:45,752
Pour heaps of cheese on it.

1397
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:48,721
Place birria torn into small pieces...

1398
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:49,762
on top of cheese.

1399
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:52,061
When tortilla becomes crispy,

1400
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:53,862
fold it in half and press it down.

1401
00:49:54,732 --> 00:49:56,461
Add birria soup, birria meat,

1402
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:58,832
boiled egg, and boiling water.

1403
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,302
Add cilantro and close the lid.

1404
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:05,942
(Innovative taco with instant cup ramyeon)

1405
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:09,842
(How would it taste like?)

1406
00:50:09,912 --> 00:50:11,982
Use the provided gloves.

1407
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:13,652
Thank you.

1408
00:50:14,082 --> 00:50:15,752
Sir, are you not wearing anything inside?

1409
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:17,321
(Inside?)

1410
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:18,821
I'm wearing an undershirt.

1411
00:50:18,822 --> 00:50:22,462
He's real.

1412
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:24,262
Saying he wore an undershirt? He's real.

1413
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:26,632
I think the owner is real.

1414
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:27,931
(Jae Seok loves Won Hun's joke.)

1415
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:29,602
"Undershirt" is so funny.

1416
00:50:30,262 --> 00:50:32,271
People usually say a sleeveless shirt.

1417
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:33,971
I haven't heard of that in a long time.

1418
00:50:33,972 --> 00:50:35,201
I would've become suspicious...

1419
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,401
if he was wearing a short-sleeved shirt inside.

1420
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:38,771
- An undershirt sounds real.
- But an undershirt...

1421
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:40,541
- Shall we open it?
- I'll open it.

1422
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,012
(Let's eat now!)

1423
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,081
- My gosh.
- Should I mix it?

1424
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,211
It's not the instant cup ramyeon we know.

1425
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:45,352
- It's not the same.
- What is it?

1426
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:48,182
- The sauce on the above.
- He added something else.

1427
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:50,721
The owner added...

1428
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:54,021
his own sauce to the ramyeon.

1429
00:50:54,022 --> 00:50:55,321
Aside from that,

1430
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,261
the tacos smell great.

1431
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,361
(It smells great already.)

1432
00:50:58,362 --> 00:51:00,392
This is how they eat it.

1433
00:51:01,302 --> 00:51:02,361
Is this right?

1434
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:03,932
This is so unique.

1435
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:06,171
It's...

1436
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:07,901
(It feels strange, but he takes a bite regardless.)

1437
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:09,101
You just dip it in like this?

1438
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:10,541
Just dip it in?

1439
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:13,812
(How does taco dipped in instant cup ramyeon taste?)

1440
00:51:14,012 --> 00:51:15,812
- It's so delicious.
- It's amazing.

1441
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:18,851
This is so good.

1442
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:19,912
It's good.

1443
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:23,481
I'm not kidding. It's so good.

1444
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:24,951
- It's amazing.
- Isn't it tasty?

1445
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,122
It's so delicious.

1446
00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:29,162
(His face tells the truth.)

1447
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,392
(You.)

1448
00:51:31,462 --> 00:51:32,531
Come here.

1449
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:34,332
(Please.)

1450
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:36,901
It's my first time on this show telling others to come here.

1451
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:38,332
- Really?
- I mean it.

1452
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:42,742
From the original instant cup ramyeon that we know,

1453
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:45,871
the owner added something to make it richer.

1454
00:51:45,872 --> 00:51:46,972
- Yes.
- Right.

1455
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:49,141
It's salty,

1456
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:51,012
- and it tastes more meaty.
- That's right.

1457
00:51:52,712 --> 00:51:53,951
It's good.

1458
00:51:53,952 --> 00:51:56,222
(Slurping)

1459
00:51:56,352 --> 00:51:58,051
Try it with the noodles.

1460
00:51:58,052 --> 00:51:59,691
- It's so tasty.
- It's so good.

1461
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,191
Ramyeon tastes good too.

1462
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:02,292
(Instant cup ramyeon and tacos make the best combination.)

1463
00:52:02,562 --> 00:52:05,032
I find something uncomfortable.

1464
00:52:05,432 --> 00:52:08,132
To double-dip after taking a bite of taco is...

1465
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:10,061
It's ill-mannered.

1466
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:11,401
- It's a bit...
- Right?

1467
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:12,631
You need to do this.

1468
00:52:12,632 --> 00:52:14,702
- Yes.
- Double-dipping is...

1469
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:16,301
- It's a bit suspicious.
- That's impossible.

1470
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:17,502
In terms of hygiene...

1471
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:18,941
It's impossible.

1472
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:20,172
Unless a family comes...

1473
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:21,312
I can dip the other side.

1474
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:23,611
- You're right.
- The other side.

1475
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:25,311
You can dip it twice.

1476
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,082
(Eating at the same time)

1477
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:30,252
- It tastes best when you dip it.
- Right?

1478
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:31,892
It tastes better when you dip it.

1479
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,691
Dipping it doesn't feel forced.

1480
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,562
- No. It's much tastier.
- It tastes a lot better this way.

1481
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:38,092
This...

1482
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:40,561
- This...
- This isn't forced.

1483
00:52:40,562 --> 00:52:41,662
It's real.

1484
00:52:42,862 --> 00:52:44,772
(Sneezing)

1485
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:46,731
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1486
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:47,842
We should clean up?

1487
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:49,571
Were you talking to Seok Jin?

1488
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:51,542
(Were you talking to Seok Jin?)

1489
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,741
I'll clean up later.

1490
00:52:52,742 --> 00:52:54,442
She speaks her mind.

1491
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:56,641
You hide it in your sneezes.

1492
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:58,081
(You cover up what you want to say in your sneezes.)

1493
00:52:58,082 --> 00:52:59,952
(Don't misunderstand.)

1494
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,151
Excuse me. Here's your zero coke.

1495
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:03,552
(The drinks they ordered are served.)

1496
00:53:03,682 --> 00:53:04,891
Thank you.

1497
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:06,491
(Observing carefully)

1498
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:07,892
You're welcome. Enjoy.

1499
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:10,591
(Is it my time to shine?)

1500
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:12,891
Sir, how much is the coke wholesale price?

1501
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:14,531
(How much is the wholesale price of the drinks?)

1502
00:53:14,532 --> 00:53:15,561
- The coke wholesale price?
- Yes.

1503
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:17,162
(Laughing)

1504
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:18,731
Coke costs...

1505
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:20,832
about something.

1506
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:23,802
That's a trade secret.

1507
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:25,771
It's different for restaurants.

1508
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:27,272
(But it's for restaurants, so it's different from the retail price.)

1509
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,141
Let me see if it is written as "for restaurants."

1510
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:30,241
Because...

1511
00:53:30,242 --> 00:53:31,552
(For restaurants)

1512
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:32,811
It is written in front.

1513
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:34,421
- Where?
- It is written in here.

1514
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:35,682
- It's written here.
- Yes.

1515
00:53:35,782 --> 00:53:36,951
(Staring)

1516
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:38,891
(Turning it around)

1517
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:40,051
(Three rounds)

1518
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,722
I said it is written in front.

1519
00:53:41,892 --> 00:53:44,762
(He chases after youth, but he has poor eyesight.)

1520
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,992
We have no choice but to get involved.

1521
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:49,062
It might look like...

1522
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:51,431
we're teasing him, but that's not the case.

1523
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:53,102
We need to guide him.

1524
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:54,641
(Humming)

1525
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:56,142
But you know,

1526
00:53:57,772 --> 00:53:58,972
I have no presbyopia.

1527
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:00,571
- You don't have presbyopia?
- No.

1528
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:01,781
- So your phone's font size...
- It's interesting.

1529
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:03,682
Then why do you look at your phone like this?

1530
00:54:04,112 --> 00:54:05,212
You look at it like this.

1531
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:07,312
- We took a photo of you last week.
- No.

1532
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:10,281
People with presbyopia look at their phones like this.

1533
00:54:10,282 --> 00:54:11,752
This is what my friends do.

1534
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:14,091
No. Looking it up close is also...

1535
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:15,361
No. This is...

1536
00:54:15,362 --> 00:54:16,762
- how young people look.
- Then...

1537
00:54:17,062 --> 00:54:18,131
Then why did you do this?

1538
00:54:18,132 --> 00:54:19,632
You looked at it like this.

1539
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:21,532
(Did I do that?)

1540
00:54:21,632 --> 00:54:22,901
But...

1541
00:54:22,902 --> 00:54:25,532
looking at his keyboard...

1542
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:27,801
- The DTMF keypad.
- The DTMF keypad.

1543
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:29,901
- Do you use...
- The QWERTY?

1544
00:54:29,902 --> 00:54:32,371
- I hold my keyboard around.
- The keyboard layout.

1545
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,571
- Do you use QWERTY?
- Yes.

1546
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:35,141
- That's called QWERTY.
- QWERTY.

1547
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:36,181
- QWERTY.
- QWERTY.

1548
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:37,751
- You didn't know either.
- I don't know.

1549
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,281
- Exactly.
- Do I need to know that?

1550
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:40,911
It's QWERTY keyboard.

1551
00:54:40,912 --> 00:54:42,952
I type super fast. I bet I'm faster than you on DTMF keypad.

1552
00:54:44,182 --> 00:54:45,892
(He can't believe Seok Jin just said that.)

1553
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:48,362
Can you type the first verse of the national anthem?

1554
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:50,292
- Send it to to you?
- Just...

1555
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:51,991
Shall we have a match?

1556
00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:53,461
- That sounds good.
- Turn on your note app.

1557
00:54:53,462 --> 00:54:54,561
Let's see who's faster.

1558
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:56,701
(Insulted)

1559
00:54:56,702 --> 00:54:57,732
I...

1560
00:54:57,802 --> 00:54:59,201
That sounds fun.

1561
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:00,202
(This is going to be fun.)

1562
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:02,141
Text it to me.

1563
00:55:02,142 --> 00:55:03,772
(Whoever texts him faster wins!)

1564
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:05,841
- I want to try too.
- Yes, let's do it together.

1565
00:55:05,842 --> 00:55:06,842
Give me a minute.

1566
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:08,781
- We'll start.
- Okay.

1567
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:09,942
(Seok Jin, Won Hun, and Ji Yoon, Sixth Sense's Typing Speed Battle)

1568
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:12,281
Jee Seok Sam, Sixth Sense,

1569
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:14,822
it's so fun.

1570
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,422
Jee Seok Sam, live a long and healthy life.

1571
00:55:19,092 --> 00:55:20,222
I sent it.

1572
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,991
(1st place, Won Hun)

1573
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:23,022
I got it.

1574
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:24,462
- Already?
- I got it.

1575
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:25,892
Won Hun.

1576
00:55:26,592 --> 00:55:27,632
Won Hun.

1577
00:55:28,402 --> 00:55:29,832
Eom Ji Yoon. I got it.

1578
00:55:30,932 --> 00:55:32,031
- Seok Jin.
- Jee...

1579
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:33,071
- Seok Sam.
- You're using one finger.

1580
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:34,472
Why're you acting like you're using both hands?

1581
00:55:35,072 --> 00:55:37,911
Live a long and healthy life.

1582
00:55:37,912 --> 00:55:39,072
(Only using his right finger)

1583
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:40,571
His left hand is there for show.

1584
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:42,311
I thought he was using both hands.

1585
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:43,681
He only uses one hand.

1586
00:55:43,682 --> 00:55:44,911
(His left hand is just there for support.)

1587
00:55:44,912 --> 00:55:46,081
- I sent it.
- He got it.

1588
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:47,082
It went through.

1589
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:49,121
- But...
- This is so funny.

1590
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:50,181
I...

1591
00:55:50,182 --> 00:55:51,321
Did you really send it so quickly?

1592
00:55:51,322 --> 00:55:53,022
I sent it right away.

1593
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:54,561
- You are fast.
- You're fast.

1594
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:56,421
He sure is fast.

1595
00:55:56,422 --> 00:55:57,932
(Envious)

1596
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,731
- But here...
- Here...

1597
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:01,432
(It's time to think.)

1598
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:02,931
This menu has to be real.

1599
00:56:02,932 --> 00:56:04,101
- Why?
- This feels totally real to me.

1600
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:05,472
It's so delicious.

1601
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:08,371
And he even designed the bowl.

1602
00:56:08,372 --> 00:56:10,442
- It feels very real.
- It feels real.

1603
00:56:10,472 --> 00:56:12,871
And they go so well.

1604
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:14,712
(It's real here! The bowl suits the menu perfectly.)

1605
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:16,111
And this ramyeon.

1606
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:18,451
There's a shop...

1607
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:21,121
in Yongsan where they sell ramyeon with food like this.

1608
00:56:21,122 --> 00:56:22,851
- How do they do it?
- It's a chicken restaurant.

1609
00:56:22,852 --> 00:56:23,981
- They add chicken on it?
- Yes.

1610
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:26,251
They add cilantro...

1611
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:27,692
and meat.

1612
00:56:27,722 --> 00:56:29,022
There's a restaurant that sells a menu like that.

1613
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:30,291
That shop...

1614
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:32,862
He might've gotten inspired by that restaurant.

1615
00:56:33,062 --> 00:56:34,092
- To make this menu?
- Yes.

1616
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:35,401
- That's what I think.
- So this place is real?

1617
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:37,561
How did you come to know about that restaurant?

1618
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:38,731
(How did you come to know about that restaurant?)

1619
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:39,732
You could've...

1620
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,242
been fooled by the staff.

1621
00:56:41,872 --> 00:56:43,671
- You could've been fooled.
- Because...

1622
00:56:43,672 --> 00:56:46,312
- a few, including Seok Sam...
- I'm serious.

1623
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:49,011
- This happened last week.
- They really do that.

1624
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:50,841
It was really scary last week.

1625
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,811
Tell him what happened last week.

1626
00:56:52,812 --> 00:56:53,951
It's a horror story.

1627
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,021
It was really scary.

1628
00:56:55,022 --> 00:56:56,281
- You know Chuu, right?
- Yes.

1629
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:57,521
Chuu was here.

1630
00:56:57,522 --> 00:56:58,922
We went to the last shop.

1631
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:01,091
Do they mix mulhoe with dongchimi?

1632
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:07,132
(Chuu ate dongchimi mulhoe before.)

1633
00:57:07,392 --> 00:57:09,761
(I tried it in Mangwon-dong.)

1634
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:15,001
(Incheon has the same menu?)

1635
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:16,801
"How do they also have it? It's a different region."

1636
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:18,812
- Exactly.
- How could it be the same?

1637
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:21,341
"This can't be fake. Is this place real?"

1638
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:23,942
- We thought it was real.
- But it turned out to be fake.

1639
00:57:24,582 --> 00:57:26,151
The place Chuu tried was fake too.

1640
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:28,352
- She was fooled by the staff.
- The meeting too...

1641
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:30,281
- The team dinner was fake too.
- They'd go that far?

1642
00:57:30,282 --> 00:57:34,321
(The staff made 2 fake restaurants to fool Chuu.)

1643
00:57:34,322 --> 00:57:36,791
That's why I asked how you ended up in that restaurant.

1644
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:39,491
- That's too much.
- It's for promotional purposes.

1645
00:57:39,492 --> 00:57:41,361
But that was...

1646
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:42,962
Did they start working on it five years ago?

1647
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,871
- That's not fake, then.
- It was way too long ago.

1648
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:47,941
(It's not fake.)

1649
00:57:47,942 --> 00:57:49,701
- That's not fake, then.
- It was way too long ago.

1650
00:57:49,702 --> 00:57:51,641
Then it's not fake.

1651
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,511
- It's not fake. Won Hun.
- I tried it five years ago.

1652
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,142
Won Hun, that's not fake.

1653
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:56,611
Five years ago...

1654
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:59,081
And five years ago, you weren't that popular yet.

1655
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:00,252
- Right?
- That's true.

1656
00:58:00,952 --> 00:58:02,482
If you say it that way...

1657
00:58:03,152 --> 00:58:04,281
It's true.

1658
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:05,521
- It's true, but...
- They wouldn't have fooled you...

1659
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:08,191
five years ago, expecting you to become successful.

1660
00:58:08,192 --> 00:58:09,691
Anyway, that wasn't a trick.

1661
00:58:09,692 --> 00:58:10,891
- It wasn't.
- It wasn't.

1662
00:58:10,892 --> 00:58:12,062
That must've been real.

1663
00:58:12,232 --> 00:58:15,032
Mimi and Seok Sam were trucked by them.

1664
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:16,531
Mine was the algorithm.

1665
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:18,231
- They input it in my algorithm.
- I...

1666
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:20,301
- How?
- What?

1667
00:58:20,302 --> 00:58:22,671
- Really?
- My manager did it.

1668
00:58:22,672 --> 00:58:24,672
- So it'd appear on your feed?
- He spoke to the phone and so on.

1669
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:27,572
- So it'd appear on her feed.
- They made her manager do it.

1670
00:58:28,082 --> 00:58:29,541
For example, this place is fake,

1671
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:31,111
but they made it so this food would keep showing on her phone.

1672
00:58:31,112 --> 00:58:33,851
- You'd believe it to be real.
- Of course.

1673
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:35,321
- You saw it yourself.
- Exactly.

1674
00:58:35,322 --> 00:58:36,421
(You'd definitely be fooled.)

1675
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:38,891
What if your feed is full of strawberries later?

1676
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:39,991
- Strawberry Nose?
- Strawberry Nose.

1677
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:41,891
- It will come up.
- Strawberry.

1678
00:58:41,892 --> 00:58:43,291
- Suddenly...
- It'll be full of strawberries.

1679
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,962
"Why do strawberries keep popping up?"

1680
00:58:45,332 --> 00:58:46,531
It's Won Hun.

1681
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:47,961
(The culprit is Won Hun the Strawberry Nose.)

1682
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,162
It's Won Hun.

1683
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:50,761
Shall we go to the last place?

1684
00:58:50,762 --> 00:58:52,131
- What about coffee before you go?
- Shall we?

1685
00:58:52,132 --> 00:58:53,571
- That sounds good.
- That's nice.

1686
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,402
(New Type of Taco. 1. Perfect taste and detailed bowl!)

1687
00:58:56,072 --> 00:58:57,372
I have no clue.

1688
00:58:57,642 --> 00:58:59,511
It's getting more and more confusing.

1689
00:58:59,512 --> 00:59:00,612
It's impossible to tell.

1690
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:03,441
I thought I could guess it...

1691
00:59:03,442 --> 00:59:05,481
because I knew this area well.

1692
00:59:05,482 --> 00:59:06,781
- But that's a misconception.
- It is.

1693
00:59:06,782 --> 00:59:08,852
- Seriously...
- Behind you.

1694
00:59:09,322 --> 00:59:10,521
How cool.

1695
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:11,652
(Colorful)

1696
00:59:12,892 --> 00:59:14,492
- How colorful.
- She's so cool.

1697
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:16,392
(Bye.)

1698
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:17,661
She even greeted us.

1699
00:59:17,662 --> 00:59:20,091
- Colorful.
- There sure are many hip people.

1700
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:21,901
- She said bye behind her back.
- Like this.

1701
00:59:21,902 --> 00:59:23,061
She's cool.

1702
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:24,161
Someone rode a unicycle...

1703
00:59:24,162 --> 00:59:25,932
- just now.
- That man just now.

1704
00:59:26,602 --> 00:59:28,642
Everyone riding a bicycle seems fake.

1705
00:59:29,242 --> 00:59:30,301
I totally agree.

1706
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:31,671
(He totally agrees.)

1707
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:33,511
- They...
- They all look...

1708
00:59:33,512 --> 00:59:34,812
like actors.

1709
00:59:35,512 --> 00:59:38,151
The people riding bicycles...

1710
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:39,152
(The colorful cyclist...)

1711
00:59:39,152 --> 00:59:40,152
(and the martial arts master cyclist are real.)

1712
00:59:40,612 --> 00:59:41,881
Before we go to the last place,

1713
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:43,522
We'll stop by another popular place in Hapjeong-dong.

1714
00:59:44,422 --> 00:59:45,692
- It must be here.
- Is this the place?

1715
00:59:46,522 --> 00:59:48,061
(It looks like an ordinary cafe.)

1716
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:49,361
Why is this place popular?

1717
00:59:49,362 --> 00:59:51,891
You can choose your own cup.

1718
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:53,332
- The cup?
- The cup?

1719
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:56,002
Places like this feel fake.

1720
00:59:56,662 --> 00:59:58,801
- We would've thought it was fake.
- Exactly.

1721
00:59:58,802 --> 01:00:00,102
It's so nice.

1722
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:05,872
(The cafe feels cozy.)

1723
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:08,682
(What stands out the most?)

1724
01:00:09,742 --> 01:00:11,111
- The cups?
- Are these the cups?

1725
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:12,151
Yes.

1726
01:00:12,152 --> 01:00:13,382
- Really?
- This place is real.

1727
01:00:14,082 --> 01:00:16,321
You can choose your own cup, and we'll serve the drink in it.

1728
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,022
(One side of the wall is full of different cups.)

1729
01:00:18,892 --> 01:00:21,122
(Choose whichever you want.)

1730
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:25,132
(This cafe's unique sales method...)

1731
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:28,402
(led to countless photos being posted on social media.)

1732
01:00:28,702 --> 01:00:30,802
I like this.

1733
01:00:31,032 --> 01:00:33,032
- Have that.
- The most colorful one.

1734
01:00:33,202 --> 01:00:36,042
"Armer farmer?" What?

1735
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:38,412
I'll take a cute one.

1736
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:42,642
(Ji Yoon gets a hip glass too.)

1737
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:46,312
I chose the same cup as Kyung Pyo.

1738
01:00:47,082 --> 01:00:48,221
What's this?

1739
01:00:48,222 --> 01:00:50,582
- I knew someone would choose this.
- Yes.

1740
01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:52,121
I chose this first,

1741
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:54,022
and Won Hun came to me quietly.

1742
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:55,822
"Pick me a cup."

1743
01:00:55,992 --> 01:00:58,062
I got the same cup.

1744
01:00:58,162 --> 01:00:59,831
(A while ago, Kyung Pyo was choosing his cup.)

1745
01:00:59,832 --> 01:01:01,292
Please choose me a hip cup.

1746
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:03,561
(He's at a loss for words.)

1747
01:01:03,562 --> 01:01:05,002
- Let's both pick this.
- Shall we?

1748
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:08,201
I got the same cup. How could this happen?

1749
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:09,501
We must have similar taste.

1750
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:10,772
(How did we choose the same glass?)

1751
01:01:11,102 --> 01:01:12,512
You need to choose your drink too.

1752
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:14,111
- I'd like an ade.
- An ade?

1753
01:01:14,112 --> 01:01:16,011
- We have grapefruit ade.
- I'll have that, please.

1754
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:17,381
Do you have strawberry ade?

1755
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,781
We don't have strawberry ade.

1756
01:01:18,782 --> 01:01:19,911
We have strawberry latte, though.

1757
01:01:19,912 --> 01:01:21,211
- Strawberry latte.
- Strawberry latte.

1758
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:22,351
(The hyenas use this chance to attack Strawberry Nose.)

1759
01:01:22,352 --> 01:01:23,521
- Strawberry latte.
- You should get strawberry latte.

1760
01:01:23,522 --> 01:01:25,222
If you have a knife, I'll slice my nose.

1761
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:27,252
He has a strawberry-shaped nose.

1762
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:29,422
His nose looks like a strawberry today.

1763
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:31,532
His nose looks like a strawberry today.

1764
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:34,132
Aren't you mentioning strawberry way too often?

1765
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,801
It's a strawberry special today.

1766
01:01:35,802 --> 01:01:37,331
- Strawberry.
- For too long...

1767
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:39,572
- Let's sit.
- Where shall we sit?

1768
01:01:40,672 --> 01:01:42,171
I think that was today's highlight.

1769
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:43,741
When Seok Jin uses his phone,

1770
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,311
he holds it with two hands but only uses his right thumb.

1771
01:01:46,312 --> 01:01:47,941
- It's to fool others.
- To fool others.

1772
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,381
- Even the way he types is fake.
- It's hard to type like this.

1773
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:51,551
It's better than typing like this.

1774
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:52,851
- Exactly.
- That's true.

1775
01:01:52,852 --> 01:01:55,052
They say typing like this makes me look old.

1776
01:01:55,452 --> 01:01:57,381
Why're you so concerned about all that?

1777
01:01:57,382 --> 01:01:58,822
Just use however you like.

1778
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:01,291
- Just do what you find comfortable.
- I'm heading...

1779
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:03,122
toward it. It's not complete yet.

1780
01:02:03,322 --> 01:02:05,962
- Head where?
- Toward becoming a zoomer.

1781
01:02:06,092 --> 01:02:08,131
Why are you going against time to become a zoomer?

1782
01:02:08,132 --> 01:02:09,602
That's how I want to live.

1783
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:12,071
It's my direction in life.

1784
01:02:12,072 --> 01:02:13,971
- Going against time.
- Why would you pick on it?

1785
01:02:13,972 --> 01:02:15,501
I just asked.

1786
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:16,841
- Are you insulted?
- Are you insulted?

1787
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:17,872
No.

1788
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:19,942
I'm not insulted. Not at all.

1789
01:02:20,742 --> 01:02:23,311
You said you'd be accepting of everything.

1790
01:02:23,312 --> 01:02:24,482
- I am.
- I see.

1791
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:26,882
(Teasing him)

1792
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:29,352
Bang.

1793
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:33,322
(Shooting him out of nowhere)

1794
01:02:33,822 --> 01:02:35,322
He's announcing a murder.

1795
01:02:35,592 --> 01:02:37,762
Announcing a murder.

1796
01:02:39,762 --> 01:02:40,931
(The new face...)

1797
01:02:40,932 --> 01:02:42,162
(of murder announcements)

1798
01:02:42,332 --> 01:02:43,531
(Attacking his heart)

1799
01:02:43,532 --> 01:02:45,132
That's for a month...

1800
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:48,031
You'll have bad luck for a week.

1801
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:49,542
- If you shoot me?
- Yes.

1802
01:02:50,402 --> 01:02:52,112
You shot me four times.

1803
01:02:52,612 --> 01:02:53,911
I'll give you a discount.

1804
01:02:53,912 --> 01:02:55,742
No. It'll last for three hours.

1805
01:02:56,112 --> 01:02:57,711
You'll have bad luck for three hours after the shooting is over.

1806
01:02:57,712 --> 01:02:59,181
- Watch out.
- After the shooting?

1807
01:02:59,182 --> 01:03:00,782
- Be careful on your way home.
- This is so...

1808
01:03:01,282 --> 01:03:03,252
Mimi, didn't you say you were releasing a new song?

1809
01:03:03,452 --> 01:03:04,952
I'm not.

1810
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:08,521
I said 4 to 5 times that I don't plan to.

1811
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:09,561
I see.

1812
01:03:09,562 --> 01:03:11,292
Everyone here can sing. He's a good singer too.

1813
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:13,061
- He's so good.
- No.

1814
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:14,331
- He's good.
- Ji Yoon, Won Hun...

1815
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,701
Kyung Pyo, Ji Yoon, Won Hun...

1816
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:17,831
They're all good.

1817
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:19,501
- Why didn't you mention me?
- "We were in love."

1818
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:21,331
I'm a singer.

1819
01:03:21,332 --> 01:03:23,441
- Producing and stuff...
- But I...

1820
01:03:23,442 --> 01:03:24,671
haven't heard you sing yet.

1821
01:03:24,672 --> 01:03:25,911
I know you rap well.

1822
01:03:25,912 --> 01:03:27,541
But I haven't heard you sing.

1823
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:28,681
- I don't sing often.
- Sorry?

1824
01:03:28,682 --> 01:03:30,111
- I don't really sing.
- You don't?

1825
01:03:30,112 --> 01:03:31,112
I don't.

1826
01:03:31,113 --> 01:03:33,551
Mimi used to post a lot of videos...

1827
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:34,882
of her dance practices.

1828
01:03:35,252 --> 01:03:36,651
There's a video of her dancing alone...

1829
01:03:36,652 --> 01:03:37,881
wearing hip clothes.

1830
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:39,421
- Dancing alone at home?
- Yes.

1831
01:03:39,422 --> 01:03:40,422
No. Wait.

1832
01:03:40,592 --> 01:03:42,092
It's my embarrazzing past.

1833
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:43,761
- When I was in middle school...
- "Embarrazzing past."

1834
01:03:43,762 --> 01:03:46,091
- Goodness.
- What's "embarrazzing past?"

1835
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:47,862
Yes, it's this video.

1836
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:49,301
- Mimi.
- The video of her dancing alone.

1837
01:03:49,302 --> 01:03:51,631
- You found it? Let's watch it.
- Come on, why...

1838
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:53,402
- Let's see.
- Don't do this.

1839
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:54,602
(Screaming)

1840
01:03:54,603 --> 01:03:55,801
(Screaming)

1841
01:03:55,802 --> 01:03:57,641
(She runs away.)

1842
01:03:57,642 --> 01:03:58,672
My gosh.

1843
01:03:58,912 --> 01:04:00,642
- That's Mimi?
- She looks cute.

1844
01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:03,482
No, Mimi, it's so cute.

1845
01:04:03,682 --> 01:04:05,182
She's dancing on her own.

1846
01:04:05,552 --> 01:04:06,811
(Mimi isn't here.)

1847
01:04:06,812 --> 01:04:07,851
(Flustered)

1848
01:04:07,852 --> 01:04:08,882
Wait.

1849
01:04:09,122 --> 01:04:10,722
You look like a doll.

1850
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:13,022
- Like a wind-up doll.
- Like a marionette.

1851
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:15,562
She's like a marionette, right? Like a wind-up doll.

1852
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:18,291
(Seok Jin doll is excited.)

1853
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:20,892
I'll get the drinks.

1854
01:04:21,432 --> 01:04:23,832
She choked herself hard halfway.

1855
01:04:24,062 --> 01:04:25,602
Her eyes rolled back slightly.

1856
01:04:26,772 --> 01:04:29,202
(Choking)

1857
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,841
I saw it in that split second.

1858
01:04:31,842 --> 01:04:32,942
That's hilarious.

1859
01:04:33,572 --> 01:04:35,181
Mimi, you brought them.

1860
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:36,982
What a great timing.

1861
01:04:37,382 --> 01:04:38,482
It's colorful.

1862
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:40,282
It's pretty.

1863
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:42,851
Everyone chose the cup according to their personality.

1864
01:04:42,852 --> 01:04:43,922
Yes.

1865
01:04:44,522 --> 01:04:45,751
It's very hip, isn't it?

1866
01:04:45,752 --> 01:04:47,121
(Taking a sip of the drink in the unique cups)

1867
01:04:47,122 --> 01:04:49,522
(Taking a sip of the drink in the unique cups)

1868
01:04:50,422 --> 01:04:51,832
Do they not clink glasses nowadays?

1869
01:04:52,632 --> 01:04:53,931
You want a toast?

1870
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,102
Don't they do it nowadays?

1871
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:57,502
- We do.
- Just clink gently.

1872
01:04:58,302 --> 01:05:00,572
Why would you clink your cups?

1873
01:05:00,832 --> 01:05:02,001
You're the one who suggested it,

1874
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:03,772
so why didn't you join in?

1875
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:06,771
(A fake toast following a fake thumb)

1876
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:07,842
(Making a U-turn)

1877
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:10,412
And Seok Jin, why do you keep reading others' faces?

1878
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,182
Trying to become a zoomer is tiring.

1879
01:05:13,352 --> 01:05:14,681
I'm getting tired.

1880
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:17,052
- I quit.
- Stop going against time.

1881
01:05:17,152 --> 01:05:18,551
(Jee Seok Jin Gives Up on Becoming a Zoomer...)

1882
01:05:18,552 --> 01:05:19,891
(After 5 Episodes. "I Quit.")

1883
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:21,022
I'm getting tired.

1884
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:23,361
(Laughing)

1885
01:05:23,362 --> 01:05:24,892
- I'm so stressed.
- You worked hard.

1886
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:27,162
(I'm so stressed that I can't continue anymore.)

1887
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:30,332
(Teary-eyed)

1888
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,031
I'm getting tired.

1889
01:05:32,032 --> 01:05:33,371
- Excuse me.
- I'm so stressed.

1890
01:05:33,372 --> 01:05:35,301
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1891
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:36,901
- This is...
- Thank you.

1892
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:39,811
They're chestnut tiramisu and pistachio tiramisu respectively.

1893
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,571
- They look delicious.
- Chestnut tiramisu?

1894
01:05:41,572 --> 01:05:42,712
Enjoy.

1895
01:05:43,212 --> 01:05:44,742
You must have chestnuts in fall.

1896
01:05:45,252 --> 01:05:47,252
They look delicious. Enjoy.

1897
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:49,882
- They look delicious.
- Chestnut tiramisu?

1898
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:51,722
(Exclaiming)

1899
01:05:52,222 --> 01:05:54,121
Seok Sam likes sweet stuff.

1900
01:05:54,122 --> 01:05:55,461
I have a sweet tooth.

1901
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:56,922
(Exclaiming)

1902
01:05:57,262 --> 01:05:58,591
This...

1903
01:05:58,592 --> 01:05:59,632
(Let me try it.)

1904
01:06:00,462 --> 01:06:01,592
(Humming)

1905
01:06:02,032 --> 01:06:03,901
(Recharging themselves with sugar)

1906
01:06:03,902 --> 01:06:04,962
(Exclaiming)

1907
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:07,702
Seok Jin, why do you keep saying "my gosh?"

1908
01:06:10,372 --> 01:06:13,371
It's been years since I heard someone say that.

1909
01:06:13,372 --> 01:06:15,542
I thought someone was playing the sound effect.

1910
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,141
Someone kept saying "my gosh."

1911
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:19,252
Who is My Gosh? Is there a My Gosh here?

1912
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:20,682
Is anyone named My Gosh?

1913
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:21,981
Is there a customer named My Gosh?

1914
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,852
(Teasing him even more)

1915
01:06:24,252 --> 01:06:26,922
(They find his joke very funny.)

1916
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:28,992
Pretend you didn't hear anything.

1917
01:06:29,762 --> 01:06:31,191
(Scolding him while holding the tiramisu)

1918
01:06:31,192 --> 01:06:32,262
Why?

1919
01:06:33,192 --> 01:06:34,392
You're laughing?

1920
01:06:35,502 --> 01:06:37,201
Bang.

1921
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:41,402
(3 consecutive shots of the bad luck gun)

1922
01:06:41,702 --> 01:06:44,442
(Seok Jin doesn't hold back!)

1923
01:06:45,642 --> 01:06:46,912
That's worth 30 minutes.

1924
01:06:47,312 --> 01:06:49,042
(He finds it funny too.)

1925
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,282
You'll have bad luck for 30 minutes.

1926
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:54,482
(He is tearing up.)

1927
01:06:54,712 --> 01:06:56,252
Seok Jin, I have a gun too.

1928
01:06:56,552 --> 01:06:57,782
It lasts for 12 years.

1929
01:06:58,852 --> 01:06:59,892
I bounced it off.

1930
01:07:01,092 --> 01:07:02,561
- You got shot.
- No, I didn't.

1931
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:03,661
- You got shot.
- No, I didn't.

1932
01:07:03,662 --> 01:07:05,092
- He got hit. I saw it.
- I didn't get hit.

1933
01:07:05,162 --> 01:07:06,962
- He did this after getting hit.
- No.

1934
01:07:07,392 --> 01:07:09,262
(He got shot and reflected it afterward.)

1935
01:07:09,402 --> 01:07:11,161
I think Seok Jin is a zoomer.

1936
01:07:11,162 --> 01:07:12,302
- Really?
- Yes.

1937
01:07:12,402 --> 01:07:14,601
- He has the zoomer vibes.
- I've come a long way.

1938
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:16,302
- I've come a long way.
- He's so funny.

1939
01:07:16,772 --> 01:07:18,441
- Shall we go to the next place?
- Okay.

1940
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:19,442
(Since we've laughed a lot, let's go and deduct now.)

1941
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:20,672
Let's go.

1942
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,482
The weather is...

1943
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:26,051
- Gosh.
- The weather is so nice.

1944
01:07:26,052 --> 01:07:27,411
Gosh, it's sunny.

1945
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:28,481
You say "Gosh" too.

1946
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:30,422
- I was copying you.
- Is that so?

1947
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:32,651
The weather is perfect for a picnic...

1948
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:34,021
- these days.
- Yes.

1949
01:07:34,022 --> 01:07:35,362
- It's the best.
- Seriously.

1950
01:07:35,962 --> 01:07:37,692
My voice is gone from laughing so much.

1951
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:40,232
My stomach hurts.

1952
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,361
- You ate too much, right?
- No, I laughed too much.

1953
01:07:43,362 --> 01:07:45,571
- We laughed too much.
- We laughed too much.

1954
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:47,332
(They're full today thanks to Seok Jin.)

1955
01:07:47,432 --> 01:07:50,042
That house has an interior design from the 1980s.

1956
01:07:50,202 --> 01:07:51,242
It's cool.

1957
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:53,312
Isn't it Sleeping Beauty's house?

1958
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:55,512
It's really cool.

1959
01:07:55,982 --> 01:07:59,051
(An old house in Hapjeong catches the Sixth Sense members' eyes.)

1960
01:07:59,052 --> 01:08:00,781
This used to be a residential area.

1961
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:03,782
(The ivy gives you a sense of its age.)

1962
01:08:04,322 --> 01:08:06,091
(The house stayed in the alley as the neighborhood turned popular.)

1963
01:08:06,092 --> 01:08:08,421
- I bet it looks nice inside.
- Right?

1964
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:09,721
Do you know what that is?

1965
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:10,722
(He spots something.)

1966
01:08:10,723 --> 01:08:12,661
- A hole.
- I haven't seen it in a while.

1967
01:08:12,662 --> 01:08:14,161
- It's a trash bin.
- It's a trash bin.

1968
01:08:14,162 --> 01:08:16,661
- I haven't seen it in a while.
- Before we began recycling,

1969
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:18,671
- we used this trash bin.
- Really?

1970
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:20,372
- This is incredible.
- When people threw away trash here,

1971
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:23,101
- waste collectors took it.
- That's right.

1972
01:08:23,102 --> 01:08:25,541
- Really?
- I haven't seen it in 30 years.

1973
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:26,841
I thought it was a hole.

1974
01:08:26,842 --> 01:08:28,781
- Right?
- Houses in my neighborhood...

1975
01:08:28,782 --> 01:08:30,081
- had that feature...
- I saw it in my childhood.

1976
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:31,082
in my childhood.

1977
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:34,012
(It's fascinating.)

1978
01:08:34,452 --> 01:08:35,481
(They leave the old memory behind.)

1979
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,451
Good houses had that feature.

1980
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:39,591
It's from the 1980s.

1981
01:08:39,592 --> 01:08:40,791
Hello.

1982
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:42,022
- It's a puppy.
- My goodness.

1983
01:08:42,392 --> 01:08:45,231
- That puppy likes her a lot.
- Kim Byung Sik.

1984
01:08:45,232 --> 01:08:46,861
Your name is Kim Byung Sik.

1985
01:08:46,862 --> 01:08:48,662
- Is the puppy named Byung Sik?
- Kim Byung Sik.

1986
01:08:48,732 --> 01:08:50,001
- Byung Sik.
- Hello.

1987
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:52,902
- This puppy loves people.
- Kim Byung Sik.

1988
01:08:53,072 --> 01:08:55,472
Kim Byung Sik. My goodness.

1989
01:08:55,772 --> 01:08:57,201
- Byung Sik.
- We'll get going.

1990
01:08:57,202 --> 01:08:59,211
- Bye, Byung Sik.
- I think Byung Sik will follow.

1991
01:08:59,212 --> 01:09:00,212
Byung Sik, bye.

1992
01:09:00,213 --> 01:09:01,371
This puppy loves people.

1993
01:09:01,372 --> 01:09:02,911
- This puppy loves people.
- It's another puppy.

1994
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:03,912
It's going insane.

1995
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:06,252
- Seok Sam.
- Why are you calling it Seok Sam?

1996
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:09,282
- What are you hinting at?
- It's nothing.

1997
01:09:09,682 --> 01:09:10,822
- It's nothing.
- You punk.

1998
01:09:11,352 --> 01:09:13,292
- The dog's name is Seok Sam.
- The puppy's name is Seok Sam.

1999
01:09:13,422 --> 01:09:15,722
- Its name really is Seok Sam.
- I suddenly thought of that name.

2000
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:18,161
- Where are we going?
- Seriously.

2001
01:09:18,162 --> 01:09:19,391
Was it...

2002
01:09:19,392 --> 01:09:21,762
- Exciting Pub?
- Exciting Pub.

2003
01:09:21,862 --> 01:09:24,801
- If it involves dancing...
- I don't think it'll be like that.

2004
01:09:24,802 --> 01:09:25,831
- It's too predictable.
- It's too...

2005
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:26,832
- Right?
- cliched.

2006
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:27,832
It's one-dimensional.

2007
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,272
I think this is the place.

2008
01:09:29,342 --> 01:09:31,302
- I know. It's red.
- That's right. This is the place.

2009
01:09:31,642 --> 01:09:32,671
This must be the place.

2010
01:09:32,672 --> 01:09:33,771
(On the street they were walking down,)

2011
01:09:33,772 --> 01:09:35,211
It has the analog vibe.

2012
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,212
(one place stands out.)

2013
01:09:36,742 --> 01:09:38,281
Is it a video arcade?

2014
01:09:38,282 --> 01:09:39,512
It has the retro vibe.

2015
01:09:39,912 --> 01:09:41,152
It's set up like the old days.

2016
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:43,851
"We're open."

2017
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:44,922
(A sign welcomes them in a homely way.)

2018
01:09:45,552 --> 01:09:46,621
I think this place is real.

2019
01:09:46,622 --> 01:09:49,092
(Is this Exciting Pub?)

2020
01:09:49,222 --> 01:09:51,391
- It has the analog vibe.
- It's set up like the old days.

2021
01:09:51,392 --> 01:09:53,262
- This is fun.
- The old days.

2022
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:55,302
It's hip.

2023
01:09:55,702 --> 01:09:57,161
It's hip.

2024
01:09:57,162 --> 01:10:00,372
(There's an old TV that films the street in real-time.)

2025
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,602
Shall we take a photo?

2026
01:10:03,072 --> 01:10:05,141
- One, two, three.
- It's hip.

2027
01:10:05,142 --> 01:10:06,171
(Entranced by the vibes, they take photos first.)

2028
01:10:06,172 --> 01:10:08,371
- You should say it.
- One, two, three.

2029
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:09,441
(The Sixth Sense members make one more memory.)

2030
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:11,081
(Photographer Mimi is satisfied.)

2031
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,352
It's atmospheric.

2032
01:10:12,782 --> 01:10:15,052
I feel like there'd be a roller skating rink inside.

2033
01:10:15,452 --> 01:10:18,382
(How is it inside the Exciting Pub?)

2034
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:20,022
(Oh, my!)

2035
01:10:20,622 --> 01:10:21,692
That's why it's exciting.

2036
01:10:23,422 --> 01:10:25,491
(You can feel the 80s' vibe when you open the door.)

2037
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:26,992
It's like the "Reply" series.

2038
01:10:28,232 --> 01:10:31,061
(There are retro props.)

2039
01:10:31,062 --> 01:10:32,532
There are retro props.

2040
01:10:33,332 --> 01:10:34,472
They're from our time.

2041
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:36,072
That's why it's exciting.

2042
01:10:36,142 --> 01:10:37,741
These are old.

2043
01:10:37,742 --> 01:10:39,542
(Is it Exciting Pub because of the retro toys?)

2044
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:42,312
- The ugly trio was on top of a TV.
- Yes.

2045
01:10:42,982 --> 01:10:45,181
These were Labubus of the past.

2046
01:10:45,182 --> 01:10:46,581
- That's right.
- They're cute.

2047
01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:47,911
- They were in the car.
- That's right.

2048
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:50,951
- You know.
- On the dashboard. My dad told me.

2049
01:10:50,952 --> 01:10:53,391
It can't be your dad. Think about it.

2050
01:10:53,392 --> 01:10:56,192
I know about the dressing game too.

2051
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:59,692
My female friends played with it.

2052
01:10:59,892 --> 01:11:01,792
There were paper clothes.

2053
01:11:01,962 --> 01:11:03,132
That's right.

2054
01:11:03,262 --> 01:11:04,262
In retrospect,

2055
01:11:04,263 --> 01:11:05,672
- we struggled to play.
- I know.

2056
01:11:06,572 --> 01:11:08,902
(Nodding)

2057
01:11:09,072 --> 01:11:11,372
- There are capsule toy machines.
- I know.

2058
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,412
- Gacha is popular these days.
- Yes.

2059
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:15,741
(Thinking)

2060
01:11:15,742 --> 01:11:17,542
- Is there a clue?
- These are for the dishes!

2061
01:11:19,282 --> 01:11:22,652
(Can you win dishes with the capsule toy machines?)

2062
01:11:23,152 --> 01:11:24,481
(These capsule toy machines look ordinary.)

2063
01:11:24,482 --> 01:11:25,651
How fascinating.

2064
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:26,921
It'll be fun.

2065
01:11:26,922 --> 01:11:29,291
(Can you win dishes with them?)

2066
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:30,322
It'll be fun.

2067
01:11:31,262 --> 01:11:34,632
(Their attention is on the machines.)

2068
01:11:34,892 --> 01:11:37,061
- It'll be so much fun.
- I mean..

2069
01:11:37,062 --> 01:11:39,701
If you win the 1st-place prize on the 3-coin machine,

2070
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:41,072
you get the king seafood soup.

2071
01:11:43,672 --> 01:11:44,941
(Various pub dishes for different numbers of coins)

2072
01:11:44,942 --> 01:11:47,312
- Let's give it a go.
- It'll be fun.

2073
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:51,242
Instead of ordering,

2074
01:11:52,012 --> 01:11:54,712
we win dishes through these capsule toy machines.

2075
01:11:54,812 --> 01:11:56,521
Some dishes aren't on the menu.

2076
01:11:56,522 --> 01:11:58,652
(Are there dishes that aren't on the menu?)

2077
01:11:58,822 --> 01:11:59,951
How fascinating.

2078
01:11:59,952 --> 01:12:00,952
(How will they win dishes through capsule toy machines?)

2079
01:12:00,953 --> 01:12:02,092
Shall we take a seat?

2080
01:12:03,322 --> 01:12:05,061
- I'm excited already.
- Why?

2081
01:12:05,062 --> 01:12:06,932
- The capsule toy machines.
- That's right.

2082
01:12:07,162 --> 01:12:08,932
To be honest,

2083
01:12:09,002 --> 01:12:10,261
I thought the owner would dance...

2084
01:12:10,262 --> 01:12:11,701
and go, "Welcome." I expected the psychedelic vibe.

2085
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:15,572
Then it would've been fake, obviously.

2086
01:12:16,402 --> 01:12:17,842
We're in trouble. This place seems real too.

2087
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:20,242
How will we get it right?

2088
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:22,111
Hello.

2089
01:12:22,112 --> 01:12:23,641
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2090
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:24,712
Hello.

2091
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,651
- We came to Exciting Pub.
- Yes.

2092
01:12:27,652 --> 01:12:29,152
Why is the concept Exciting Pub?

2093
01:12:29,382 --> 01:12:31,181
Unlike other pubs,

2094
01:12:31,182 --> 01:12:34,821
customers can order dishes through capsule toy machines.

2095
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:36,761
So you can order regularly...

2096
01:12:36,762 --> 01:12:38,961
or through capsule toy machines.

2097
01:12:38,962 --> 01:12:41,761
Yes. You can order regularly by looking at the menu.

2098
01:12:41,762 --> 01:12:43,261
If you want to try winning...

2099
01:12:43,262 --> 01:12:46,531
a more expensive dish, you can try a capsule toy machine.

2100
01:12:46,532 --> 01:12:47,731
(The probability of eating a more expensive dish goes up!)

2101
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:49,901
What's the most expensive dish...

2102
01:12:49,902 --> 01:12:52,771
you can win through the capsule toy machines?

2103
01:12:52,772 --> 01:12:56,112
On a 3-coin machine, you can win a 99-dollar dish.

2104
01:12:56,382 --> 01:12:57,581
(His eyes go wide.)

2105
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,911
(Oh, my)

2106
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:00,112
- It's triple the amount.
- Really?

2107
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:01,352
Which dish is it?

2108
01:13:01,682 --> 01:13:04,722
It's the dish we boast of, the king seafood soup.

2109
01:13:04,782 --> 01:13:06,251
- King seafood soup.
- King seafood soup.

2110
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:07,691
(KIng seafood soup!)

2111
01:13:07,692 --> 01:13:08,992
We have to try the vending machines.

2112
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:12,131
How much is each try?

2113
01:13:12,132 --> 01:13:16,002
There are 10-dollar, 20-dollar, and 30-dollar machines.

2114
01:13:16,132 --> 01:13:20,371
On a 10-dollar machine, you can win a dish that costs 7 to 30 dollars.

2115
01:13:20,372 --> 01:13:23,841
On a 20-dollar machine, you can win a dish that costs 18 to 49 dollars.

2116
01:13:23,842 --> 01:13:28,981
On a 30-dollar machine, you can win a dish that costs 28 to 99 dollars.

2117
01:13:28,982 --> 01:13:30,812
(The machines come in various price ranges.)

2118
01:13:31,012 --> 01:13:34,051
There's a vending machine where you can get coins.

2119
01:13:34,052 --> 01:13:35,052
(Exchange money for the capsule toy machine coins.)

2120
01:13:35,053 --> 01:13:38,322
(Pick the machine that has the dish you want.)

2121
01:13:38,382 --> 01:13:42,192
(Insert the coins and turn the lever.)

2122
01:13:42,822 --> 01:13:47,332
(Then you'll get a coupon you can use for the dish!)

2123
01:13:48,462 --> 01:13:53,671
(There are 20 dishes you can win!)

2124
01:13:53,672 --> 01:13:56,642
It has gone viral on social media,

2125
01:13:56,742 --> 01:13:59,311
so many people in their 20s and 30s visit the place.

2126
01:13:59,312 --> 01:14:00,342
(There are so many reviews!)

2127
01:14:00,742 --> 01:14:03,642
Sixth Sense members, is this place real?

2128
01:14:06,482 --> 01:14:08,681
Sir, each machine comes with the probability...

2129
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:10,481
- of winning the first-place prize.
- Yes.

2130
01:14:10,482 --> 01:14:12,081
What's the probability?

2131
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:13,151
(Their attention is...)

2132
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:14,351
(on the owner.)

2133
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:17,021
- It's a 1-in-70 chance.
- A 1-in-70 chance.

2134
01:14:17,022 --> 01:14:18,991
- Is there 1 in 70 capsules?
- That's right.

2135
01:14:18,992 --> 01:14:20,631
It's hard to get it,

2136
01:14:20,632 --> 01:14:23,061
but there are lucky customers who get it at once.

2137
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:25,131
- A 1-in-70 chance.
- Once it comes out,

2138
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:26,771
do you put it back in?

2139
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:28,871
- Of course. I do it every morning.
- You do it every morning.

2140
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:30,901
I do it every morning to maintain the probability.

2141
01:14:30,902 --> 01:14:33,511
- A 1-in-70 chance.
- Don't you think it's too low?

2142
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:35,441
(Secondhand embarrassment)

2143
01:14:35,442 --> 01:14:36,912
Are you here to investigate?

2144
01:14:37,582 --> 01:14:39,352
- Why are you so sensitive?
- A 1-in-70 chance...

2145
01:14:39,612 --> 01:14:41,911
is too low.

2146
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:44,981
- We need to make a living.
- Of course.

2147
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:48,922
What's the goblin character on the capsule toy machines?

2148
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:54,192
My older brother loves to draw.

2149
01:14:54,462 --> 01:14:57,832
I asked him to draw a character...

2150
01:14:57,932 --> 01:15:00,831
and he came up with a cute one. We made some merchandise.

2151
01:15:00,832 --> 01:15:02,131
(Popular among customers, it's sold as various kinds of merchandise.)

2152
01:15:02,132 --> 01:15:03,271
There are keychains too.

2153
01:15:03,272 --> 01:15:05,002
(Popular among customers, it's sold as various kinds of merchandise.)

2154
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:07,911
Is there a dish you can only win through the machines?

2155
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:11,141
There's a dish called the fried gacha balls.

2156
01:15:11,142 --> 01:15:12,712
- Fried gacha balls?
- Yes.

2157
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:13,782
You get balls of five flavors.

2158
01:15:13,783 --> 01:15:14,982
You can only win it through the machines.

2159
01:15:15,452 --> 01:15:16,781
(Fried gacha balls...)

2160
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:19,152
(look exactly like the capsules.)

2161
01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:21,091
They look the same on the outside.

2162
01:15:21,092 --> 01:15:22,092
(Five different flavors)

2163
01:15:22,562 --> 01:15:24,991
You don't know the flavor until you eat it.

2164
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:26,792
(It's fun because the flavor is a mystery!)

2165
01:15:27,432 --> 01:15:30,631
(If you want to try it, get the hidden menu!)

2166
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:32,001
- I want to get it.
- I want to try it.

2167
01:15:32,002 --> 01:15:33,332
- Yes.
- That's...

2168
01:15:33,932 --> 01:15:38,301
With 30 dollars, we can win a 99-dollar dish if we get lucky.

2169
01:15:38,302 --> 01:15:40,342
I'd try the 30-dollar machine 3 times.

2170
01:15:40,612 --> 01:15:42,982
You'd keep doing that instead of eating the dishes.

2171
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:45,011
The dishes would pile up.

2172
01:15:45,012 --> 01:15:47,111
- You'd give them away.
- You'd use 3,000 dollars.

2173
01:15:47,112 --> 01:15:48,112
I can't wait to try it.

2174
01:15:48,552 --> 01:15:50,451
- We should give it a go.
- Yes.

2175
01:15:50,452 --> 01:15:52,652
- I love the games of probability.
- Same here.

2176
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:55,762
- Which one should we try?
- It's worth 1, 2, or 3 coins.

2177
01:15:56,022 --> 01:15:58,061
- Let's try the 3-coin machine.
- The 3-coin machine.

2178
01:15:58,062 --> 01:15:59,331
- Mimi.
- Mimi, try it.

2179
01:15:59,332 --> 01:16:00,991
- Mimi, try it.
- Turn the lever.

2180
01:16:00,992 --> 01:16:02,732
(She turns the lever with force.)

2181
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:04,362
- Pink.
- What is it?

2182
01:16:04,902 --> 01:16:10,772
(What's the result of the 30-dollar machine?)

2183
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,572
I'm curious.

2184
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:14,211
(Peeking)

2185
01:16:14,212 --> 01:16:15,212
What is it?

2186
01:16:15,213 --> 01:16:16,741
(Disappointed)

2187
01:16:16,742 --> 01:16:18,811
- It's worth 30 dollars.
- It's worth 30 dollars.

2188
01:16:18,812 --> 01:16:19,812
The same amount.

2189
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:20,952
You got the money's worth.

2190
01:16:22,182 --> 01:16:24,822
Seafood ramyeon, tako wasabi, and hotteok ice cream.

2191
01:16:25,422 --> 01:16:26,692
The basic dishes.

2192
01:16:26,992 --> 01:16:28,951
- I'm disappointed.
- This is fun.

2193
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:29,962
(The probability was 14.29 percent.)

2194
01:16:30,492 --> 01:16:31,821
Let's try this one.

2195
01:16:31,822 --> 01:16:33,562
- The 2-coin machine.
- The 2-coin machine.

2196
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:34,861
(Jae Seok turns the lever.)

2197
01:16:34,862 --> 01:16:35,902
Let's go.

2198
01:16:36,162 --> 01:16:37,531
- This is fun.
- Open it.

2199
01:16:37,532 --> 01:16:38,861
Here, Ji Yoon.

2200
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:43,242
(On the 2-coin machine, you can win a 49-dollar dish.)

2201
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:44,871
Because of the Seok Jin Beam,

2202
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:46,372
- I'm unlucky for 30 minutes.
- That's right.

2203
01:16:46,512 --> 01:16:47,842
Gosh, Seok Jin.

2204
01:16:49,682 --> 01:16:50,741
Thirty minutes passed.

2205
01:16:50,742 --> 01:16:52,382
- No, it didn't.
- Thirty minutes passed, didn't it?

2206
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:53,581
First place!

2207
01:16:53,582 --> 01:16:54,751
(Screaming)

2208
01:16:54,752 --> 01:16:56,422
- First place!
- What?

2209
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:58,081
(It's a dopamine festival.)

2210
01:16:58,082 --> 01:17:00,051
- I can't believe it.
- Gosh.

2211
01:17:00,052 --> 01:17:02,151
- It really is a first-place prize.
- Really?

2212
01:17:02,152 --> 01:17:03,322
Seriously.

2213
01:17:03,422 --> 01:17:05,461
It's a 1-in-70 chance.

2214
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:06,491
Hey!

2215
01:17:06,492 --> 01:17:08,532
(Happy)

2216
01:17:09,302 --> 01:17:10,731
Did you manipulate it?

2217
01:17:10,732 --> 01:17:11,902
(Did you manipulate the probability?)

2218
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:17,571
(Is it a fake place that set up a winning situation?)

2219
01:17:17,572 --> 01:17:19,841
(Did you manipulate the probability?)

2220
01:17:19,842 --> 01:17:21,812
No, I didn't touch the machine.

2221
01:17:21,942 --> 01:17:25,752
(Evidence number 1, The production crew's real reaction)

2222
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:27,251
- It's a 1-in-70 chance.
- A 1-in-70 chance.

2223
01:17:27,252 --> 01:17:28,282
No way.

2224
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:30,251
You're so lucky.

2225
01:17:30,252 --> 01:17:31,481
- Unbelievable.
- Seok Jin.

2226
01:17:31,482 --> 01:17:33,991
I got a dopamine rush.

2227
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:35,252
This is incredible.

2228
01:17:35,352 --> 01:17:37,221
Seok Jin, try the three-coin machine.

2229
01:17:37,222 --> 01:17:38,421
- Shall I try it?
- Yes.

2230
01:17:38,422 --> 01:17:39,592
Seok Jin, try it.

2231
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:42,061
- Did you insert three coins?
- Okay.

2232
01:17:42,062 --> 01:17:43,332
Okay.

2233
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:45,231
No, it comes out through here.

2234
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:46,371
(He turns the lever of the upper machine.)

2235
01:17:46,372 --> 01:17:48,071
- I got a dopamine rush.
- No, it comes out through here.

2236
01:17:48,072 --> 01:17:50,801
(A bout of laughter)

2237
01:17:50,802 --> 01:17:51,941
Here.

2238
01:17:51,942 --> 01:17:53,811
(Mimi is the only one who looks after Seok Jin!)

2239
01:17:53,812 --> 01:17:56,011
(Seok Jin still isn't used to the Gen Z items.)

2240
01:17:56,012 --> 01:17:58,112
- He's out of it.
- Let's see.

2241
01:17:58,782 --> 01:18:04,582
(Will they get the 1st-place prize with the 3-coin machine as well?)

2242
01:18:05,752 --> 01:18:07,321
He's like a shaman. What is it?

2243
01:18:07,322 --> 01:18:08,651
- You can't read it, right?
- Right.

2244
01:18:08,652 --> 01:18:10,462
- What?
- He can't read it.

2245
01:18:10,522 --> 01:18:11,691
(The issue is age-related farsightedness.)

2246
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:13,461
- He can't read it.
- Are you serious?

2247
01:18:13,462 --> 01:18:16,462
I can read it if you give me more time.

2248
01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:18,661
- Give me more time.
- Seok Jin.

2249
01:18:18,662 --> 01:18:21,172
Increase the font size on your phone.

2250
01:18:21,272 --> 01:18:23,842
It's my first time seeing Seok Jin's face turn red.

2251
01:18:24,002 --> 01:18:26,971
(You can't watch his struggle without tearing up.)

2252
01:18:26,972 --> 01:18:28,741
- It's sad.
- I mean...

2253
01:18:28,742 --> 01:18:30,881
We got three servings of fried food.

2254
01:18:30,882 --> 01:18:31,942
- Fried food?
- Fried food.

2255
01:18:32,682 --> 01:18:33,751
This is...

2256
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:35,651
- fried gacha balls.
- Fried gacha balls.

2257
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:37,021
- It's here.
- These are fried gacha balls.

2258
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:38,281
It's a hidden menu.

2259
01:18:38,282 --> 01:18:39,492
This is it.

2260
01:18:40,222 --> 01:18:41,391
This is incredible.

2261
01:18:41,392 --> 01:18:42,862
It's what we saw earlier.

2262
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:44,862
- Fried gacha balls. Is it rare?
- Yes.

2263
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:46,231
I thought it was a regular fried dish.

2264
01:18:46,232 --> 01:18:48,662
- You can only eat it like this.
- This is incredible.

2265
01:18:48,762 --> 01:18:49,861
- How did I get this?
- We're getting all the prizes.

2266
01:18:49,862 --> 01:18:51,161
- We're getting all the prizes.
- This is a bit...

2267
01:18:51,162 --> 01:18:52,772
- I'm lucky.
- We didn't manipulate it.

2268
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,202
- Really?
- Really?

2269
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:56,201
- Sir, didn't you...
- I didn't touch the machine.

2270
01:18:56,202 --> 01:18:57,871
If we order too many dishes...

2271
01:18:57,872 --> 01:18:58,901
That's right.

2272
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,412
It'll be a waste of food.

2273
01:19:00,642 --> 01:19:02,071
Since you enjoyed the machines,

2274
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:04,311
you can eat the first-place prize and the fried gacha balls.

2275
01:19:04,312 --> 01:19:05,742
- Just give us those dishes.
- That'll do.

2276
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,382
I want to do it again.

2277
01:19:08,152 --> 01:19:09,482
- You need to stop now.
- Ji Yoon.

2278
01:19:09,982 --> 01:19:11,352
She'll end up spending...

2279
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:13,122
three hundred dollars here.

2280
01:19:13,392 --> 01:19:15,491
The concept is so interesting.

2281
01:19:15,492 --> 01:19:16,661
- It's fun.
- Yes.

2282
01:19:16,662 --> 01:19:18,421
Someone like me will end up spending 300 dollars.

2283
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:19,792
- I know.
- Seriously.

2284
01:19:19,862 --> 01:19:21,362
I want to do it again.

2285
01:19:21,592 --> 01:19:22,631
- She's in trouble.
- Seriously.

2286
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:25,002
- Ji Yoon is in trouble.
- It's addictive.

2287
01:19:25,162 --> 01:19:26,532
It gives you a dopamine rush.

2288
01:19:27,302 --> 01:19:28,371
The thing is,

2289
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:30,341
it'll be easy to make a fake place like this one.

2290
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:31,771
That's right. Won't it be easy?

2291
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,342
- Won't it be easy?
- Yes.

2292
01:19:33,572 --> 01:19:34,641
You just need the machines.

2293
01:19:34,642 --> 01:19:36,611
You can get those machines easily.

2294
01:19:36,612 --> 01:19:38,182
(Is it a fake place that added the capsule toy machines to a pub?)

2295
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:40,282
I think this place is real.

2296
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:43,722
This is hard.

2297
01:19:44,652 --> 01:19:46,421
(Let me think.)

2298
01:19:46,422 --> 01:19:49,892
I think the matcha tteokbokki is fake.

2299
01:19:50,462 --> 01:19:51,991
- That's real.
- That's real.

2300
01:19:51,992 --> 01:19:53,362
- That's real, Ji Yoon.
- Yes.

2301
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:56,461
Ji Yoon, don't get confused. You'll get me confused.

2302
01:19:56,462 --> 01:19:57,761
Excuse me.

2303
01:19:57,762 --> 01:19:59,271
What's this?

2304
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:01,172
Is this the king seafood soup?

2305
01:20:01,272 --> 01:20:02,801
The stove is as big as...

2306
01:20:02,802 --> 01:20:03,802
- the table.
- There are two burners.

2307
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:05,242
I didn't know they sold a stove with two burners.

2308
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:08,442
I guess we'll get something grand.

2309
01:20:08,912 --> 01:20:10,041
(It's a big one.)

2310
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,112
What is it?

2311
01:20:11,712 --> 01:20:13,711
It's the king seafood soup.

2312
01:20:13,712 --> 01:20:15,051
- It smells great.
- It smells great.

2313
01:20:15,052 --> 01:20:16,882
This octopus is huge.

2314
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:18,882
A live octopus,

2315
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:21,522
live scallops, abalones,

2316
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:23,822
and various seafood go into this dish.

2317
01:20:23,962 --> 01:20:27,692
It's a dish for the customers who love a hot and refreshing soup.

2318
01:20:28,092 --> 01:20:31,332
Customers would love this.

2319
01:20:31,902 --> 01:20:33,301
If you get this on a 30-dollar capsule toy machine,

2320
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:35,231
- it'll be incredible.
- It'll be incredible.

2321
01:20:35,232 --> 01:20:37,542
- People will clap and go wild.
- Yes.

2322
01:20:37,742 --> 01:20:39,441
Shall I cut it?

2323
01:20:39,442 --> 01:20:41,411
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

2324
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,441
We watch the owner cut things to determine...

2325
01:20:43,442 --> 01:20:45,812
- whether the place is real or fake.
- That's right.

2326
01:20:46,982 --> 01:20:48,811
Won Hun,

2327
01:20:48,812 --> 01:20:50,452
you look at the pants.

2328
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:53,221
- Why do you look at the pants?
- He looks at the pants.

2329
01:20:53,222 --> 01:20:55,252
- You're meticulous.
- Why do you look at the pants?

2330
01:20:56,462 --> 01:20:57,862
May I put my hand in your pocket?

2331
01:20:58,462 --> 01:20:59,791
(A strange way of deducting)

2332
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:01,292
The fabric is thin.

2333
01:21:02,532 --> 01:21:04,832
I feel like I've seen him on "Surprise."

2334
01:21:05,062 --> 01:21:06,231
(Won Hun's deduction based on the pants)

2335
01:21:06,232 --> 01:21:07,471
I think he's an actor.

2336
01:21:07,472 --> 01:21:08,702
(Is the owner a reenactment actor?)

2337
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:11,442
- Is the octopus ready?
- You can eat the octopus.

2338
01:21:14,842 --> 01:21:16,111
It's tasty.

2339
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:18,641
It's so chewy and tender.

2340
01:21:18,642 --> 01:21:19,812
(The octopus is chewy and tender.)

2341
01:21:20,852 --> 01:21:22,051
- Is it tasty?
- It's tasty.

2342
01:21:22,052 --> 01:21:24,622
(The taste makes them exclaim.)

2343
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:26,092
It's tasty.

2344
01:21:26,252 --> 01:21:28,222
(He tries a spoonful of soup.)

2345
01:21:28,522 --> 01:21:29,921
It's hard to do that.

2346
01:21:29,922 --> 01:21:31,322
The soup is tasty.

2347
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:33,431
The taste is spicy and clean.

2348
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:34,432
(The taste is spicy and clean.)

2349
01:21:35,032 --> 01:21:36,061
Excuse me.

2350
01:21:36,062 --> 01:21:38,102
I'll put the fried gacha balls on the table.

2351
01:21:38,262 --> 01:21:39,732
Look at this dish.

2352
01:21:40,332 --> 01:21:41,601
This is incredible.

2353
01:21:41,602 --> 01:21:43,141
- We won it.
- It isn't on the menu.

2354
01:21:43,142 --> 01:21:44,941
That's right. It's hard to get this dish.

2355
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:47,112
Are the flavors different?

2356
01:21:47,412 --> 01:21:49,172
There are five flavors.

2357
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,611
There's one dud.

2358
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:52,212
- Dud?
- For fun,

2359
01:21:52,682 --> 01:21:54,152
one flavor contains wasabi.

2360
01:21:54,512 --> 01:21:55,581
- You might get it.
- Let's pick.

2361
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:57,321
(Flustered)

2362
01:21:57,322 --> 01:21:58,482
This is a real deal.

2363
01:21:59,182 --> 01:22:01,451
(They look the same on the outside.)

2364
01:22:01,452 --> 01:22:04,261
Fried gacha balls come in five flavors.

2365
01:22:04,262 --> 01:22:05,462
(Fried gacha balls have different ingredients inside.)

2366
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:06,732
Fried fish ball.

2367
01:22:07,732 --> 01:22:09,402
Fired mac and cheese ball.

2368
01:22:10,032 --> 01:22:11,802
Fried buldak and meat ball.

2369
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:13,872
Fried pork hamburg ball.

2370
01:22:15,172 --> 01:22:17,472
Inside the dud, fried wasabi and potato ball,

2371
01:22:18,202 --> 01:22:20,011
is 3g of wasabi.

2372
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:21,442
(Inside the dud is 3g of wasabi.)

2373
01:22:21,742 --> 01:22:26,082
(It's fun to pick among the fried balls.)

2374
01:22:26,282 --> 01:22:29,521
Only one contains wasabi.

2375
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:31,951
The usage of wasabi feels like the work...

2376
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,751
- of a variety show writer.
- I know.

2377
01:22:33,752 --> 01:22:35,191
I thought this place was real.

2378
01:22:35,192 --> 01:22:37,191
Regular restaurants don't do that.

2379
01:22:37,192 --> 01:22:38,392
No, they don't.

2380
01:22:38,492 --> 01:22:40,091
Regular restaurants don't do that.

2381
01:22:40,092 --> 01:22:41,361
This place is fake.

2382
01:22:41,362 --> 01:22:43,101
- I think this place is real.
- Really?

2383
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:46,131
Yes. Challenges are popular these days.

2384
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:47,431
This is a feature that makes a place go viral.

2385
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:49,402
How could there be such a variety show-coded pub?

2386
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,602
Wasabi?

2387
01:22:52,002 --> 01:22:53,971
This is something we do as a joke...

2388
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:56,111
when we go to a restaurant.

2389
01:22:56,112 --> 01:22:57,282
(A special dish to make the place go viral?)

2390
01:22:57,882 --> 01:23:00,352
Things are so confusing today.

2391
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:03,051
This place is real. I think this place is real.

2392
01:23:03,052 --> 01:23:04,521
This place is real.

2393
01:23:04,522 --> 01:23:05,552
(Ji Yoon strongly agrees.)

2394
01:23:05,582 --> 01:23:07,251
This dish wasn't made by a chef.

2395
01:23:07,252 --> 01:23:08,352
- No.
- Right?

2396
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:11,291
That's why it suits a pub.

2397
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:12,292
(The food really suits the vibes of a pub!)

2398
01:23:12,422 --> 01:23:14,862
I'm 100 percent sure that it's number 1.

2399
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:18,532
(The restaurant that's serious about lemons)

2400
01:23:18,762 --> 01:23:20,201
(Lemons were used...)

2401
01:23:20,202 --> 01:23:22,372
(for everything from the appetizer to the dessert.)

2402
01:23:22,572 --> 01:23:24,701
(They had never heard of such a thing.)

2403
01:23:24,702 --> 01:23:26,541
(A lemon course meal?)

2404
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:30,611
(Various dishes that were made with lemons)

2405
01:23:30,612 --> 01:23:33,051
(Is Very Sour Meal fake?)

2406
01:23:33,052 --> 01:23:34,052
It's number one.

2407
01:23:34,053 --> 01:23:36,751
There was dust on the liquor bottles.

2408
01:23:36,752 --> 01:23:39,251
Lemons have more grooves,

2409
01:23:39,252 --> 01:23:40,951
so it's easier for them to collect dust.

2410
01:23:40,952 --> 01:23:42,691
But there was no dust on the lemons.

2411
01:23:42,692 --> 01:23:43,891
(She has a point.)

2412
01:23:43,892 --> 01:23:44,921
- You're sharp.
- But...

2413
01:23:44,922 --> 01:23:47,761
I think they changed a bar or a ramen place.

2414
01:23:47,762 --> 01:23:48,832
(Ji Yoon's observation: Number 1 is a bar of a ramen place!)

2415
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:50,862
I gave it some thought.

2416
01:23:51,132 --> 01:23:53,671
The first place had dishes...

2417
01:23:53,672 --> 01:23:55,902
that'd be tasty even without lemons.

2418
01:23:56,572 --> 01:23:57,641
That's right.

2419
01:23:57,642 --> 01:23:59,342
So I think number one is fake.

2420
01:24:00,472 --> 01:24:02,811
- Strangely, I think it's number 2.
- Number 2.

2421
01:24:02,812 --> 01:24:04,741
Do I need reasons?

2422
01:24:04,742 --> 01:24:06,011
Taco with instant cup ramyeon.

2423
01:24:06,012 --> 01:24:07,051
Do I need reasons?

2424
01:24:07,052 --> 01:24:09,412
I've done this for several episodes. I don't have reasons.

2425
01:24:10,152 --> 01:24:14,552
(Cup ramyeon and taco, the new type of a combination)

2426
01:24:14,952 --> 01:24:18,691
(Although the way of eating was unusual,)

2427
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:21,532
(it was tasty.)

2428
01:24:22,232 --> 01:24:26,102
(How could you double-dip the taco in the cup ramyeon?)

2429
01:24:26,372 --> 01:24:30,272
(Is number 2, New Type of Taco, fake?)

2430
01:24:30,372 --> 01:24:31,841
What do you think is fake?

2431
01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:33,312
My guess is the capsule toy machine.

2432
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:35,172
- Do you think it's fake?
- Why?

2433
01:24:35,412 --> 01:24:37,641
Capsule toy machines are very popular these days.

2434
01:24:37,642 --> 01:24:39,011
The production crew...

2435
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:40,811
must've thought, "Shall we combine the two?"

2436
01:24:40,812 --> 01:24:42,481
I think that was how the idea came to be.

2437
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:43,581
I'm 100 percent sure...

2438
01:24:43,582 --> 01:24:45,621
that the pub with the capsule toy machines...

2439
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:46,851
- is fake.
- You think it's fake.

2440
01:24:46,852 --> 01:24:48,552
- Why?
- If this place...

2441
01:24:48,622 --> 01:24:50,792
- isn't fake, - Okay.

2442
01:24:51,362 --> 01:24:53,161
I'll join Sixth Sense...

2443
01:24:53,162 --> 01:24:54,291
instead of Seok Jin.

2444
01:24:54,292 --> 01:24:56,301
(I'll join Sixth Sense instead of Seok Jin.)

2445
01:24:56,302 --> 01:24:59,302
- Agreed.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

2446
01:25:00,172 --> 01:25:01,431
Make sure you keep your promise.

2447
01:25:01,432 --> 01:25:03,202
- I'll keep my promise.
- Okay.

2448
01:25:03,242 --> 01:25:05,842
I'll put my faith in your opinion...

2449
01:25:06,442 --> 01:25:07,612
and vote for number three.

2450
01:25:08,412 --> 01:25:11,412
If things go badly, I won't be on the show starting next week.

2451
01:25:12,642 --> 01:25:15,011
This is an important episode.

2452
01:25:15,012 --> 01:25:16,321
(This is an important episode.)

2453
01:25:16,322 --> 01:25:17,451
That's so funny.

2454
01:25:17,452 --> 01:25:18,681
It's hard.

2455
01:25:18,682 --> 01:25:19,721
- Number two...
- It's hard, right?

2456
01:25:19,722 --> 01:25:21,322
You said earlier that it'd be easy.

2457
01:25:21,692 --> 01:25:23,291
(Exciting Pub 1. Owner who looks like a reenactment actor)

2458
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:24,961
(2. Food that suits the pub)

2459
01:25:24,962 --> 01:25:26,392
(3. Penalty dish that suits a variety show)

2460
01:25:26,492 --> 01:25:27,832
I think it's real.

2461
01:25:28,532 --> 01:25:29,961
The machines aren't new.

2462
01:25:29,962 --> 01:25:31,332
They aren't new.

2463
01:25:31,402 --> 01:25:33,101
I think they've been used.

2464
01:25:33,102 --> 01:25:37,471
(Is there something else?)

2465
01:25:37,472 --> 01:25:41,342
(Looking around)

2466
01:25:41,472 --> 01:25:45,142
(Absorbed in looking for the clues)

2467
01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:49,381
(An eye watches Mimi.)

2468
01:25:49,382 --> 01:25:52,352
(I'm watching you.)

2469
01:25:52,952 --> 01:25:54,322
Is this a restroom?

2470
01:25:57,422 --> 01:25:59,322
(It's an intruder.)

2471
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:01,091
(We sensed a break-in at the storage room.)

2472
01:26:01,092 --> 01:26:04,061
(We sensed a break-in at the storage room.)

2473
01:26:04,062 --> 01:26:05,531
Mimi, don't open that door.

2474
01:26:05,532 --> 01:26:07,001
There's an intruder alert system,

2475
01:26:07,002 --> 01:26:08,002
- so an alarm will sound.
- Really?

2476
01:26:08,003 --> 01:26:09,271
Hey, it says so right here. If you open it,

2477
01:26:09,272 --> 01:26:10,371
you'll get apprehended right away.

2478
01:26:10,372 --> 01:26:12,341
The security guards will come. You need to be careful.

2479
01:26:12,342 --> 01:26:14,041
- Will you get alerted right away?
- Of course.

2480
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:16,072
It says that it's a security area.

2481
01:26:16,112 --> 01:26:17,612
- It's very thorough.
- Yes.

2482
01:26:17,642 --> 01:26:18,642
We're sorry.

2483
01:26:18,643 --> 01:26:19,982
- We're sorry.
- Okay.

2484
01:26:20,012 --> 01:26:21,081
Let's run away.

2485
01:26:21,082 --> 01:26:23,552
(Let's stop with the deductions and run away.)

2486
01:26:24,282 --> 01:26:28,022
(This is a safe area!)

2487
01:26:28,722 --> 01:26:30,561
(It's time for the final decision.)

2488
01:26:30,562 --> 01:26:32,662
What are we going to do?

2489
01:26:32,822 --> 01:26:34,661
Am I the only one who thinks it's number two?

2490
01:26:34,662 --> 01:26:36,031
Number two...

2491
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,531
- Is it real?
- We'll need to put it to a vote...

2492
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:40,331
since it's the least popular option.

2493
01:26:40,332 --> 01:26:41,931
Okay. I prefer the majority decision.

2494
01:26:41,932 --> 01:26:44,242
Between number 1 and number 3...

2495
01:26:44,302 --> 01:26:46,512
- The difficulty level is insane.
- Today...

2496
01:26:47,242 --> 01:26:48,971
Today, the opinionated member...

2497
01:26:48,972 --> 01:26:50,942
should lead the others.

2498
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:54,352
Everyone wants to follow another's lead.

2499
01:26:54,452 --> 01:26:56,452
I don't have a clue.

2500
01:26:57,182 --> 01:26:58,551
It's number one.

2501
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:00,021
- Really?
- It's number one.

2502
01:27:00,022 --> 01:27:01,921
(Follow me.)

2503
01:27:01,922 --> 01:27:03,221
- It's number 1 or number 3.
- It's number 1.

2504
01:27:03,222 --> 01:27:04,392
- Choose between the two.
- It's too easy.

2505
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:05,721
- Really?
- It's too easy.

2506
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:07,131
Ji Yoon kept saying it's number one.

2507
01:27:07,132 --> 01:27:08,691
- It's definitely number one.
- She's strongly saying it.

2508
01:27:08,692 --> 01:27:09,762
Right.

2509
01:27:09,932 --> 01:27:13,002
It was too full of lemons.

2510
01:27:13,572 --> 01:27:15,071
It's number one.

2511
01:27:15,072 --> 01:27:17,371
- Number one feels real.
- It feels real.

2512
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:19,401
(Is this the opposing party against number 1?)

2513
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:21,411
Not knowing the company name...

2514
01:27:21,412 --> 01:27:23,712
might be a mistake out of nervousness.

2515
01:27:23,812 --> 01:27:25,782
- No.
- Are you 100 percent certain?

2516
01:27:26,512 --> 01:27:29,182
We have to decide quickly before we get there.

2517
01:27:29,482 --> 01:27:30,921
- It's number 1.
- Are you certain about number 1?

2518
01:27:30,922 --> 01:27:32,021
- It's number one.
- What about you?

2519
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:33,422
- You said it was number 1, right?
- I think it's number 1 as well.

2520
01:27:33,552 --> 01:27:34,751
I think it's number one.

2521
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:36,592
- But I wish for it to be real.
- Let's go with number 1.

2522
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:38,121
- Let's go with number 1.
- Let's go with number 1.

2523
01:27:38,122 --> 01:27:39,961
- The majority votes for number one.
- Okay.

2524
01:27:39,962 --> 01:27:41,431
Wasn't it weird...

2525
01:27:41,432 --> 01:27:43,602
that there was wasabi out of the nine gacha balls?

2526
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:45,102
That was really weird.

2527
01:27:46,062 --> 01:27:47,571
- That was weird.
- But everything else was weird.

2528
01:27:47,572 --> 01:27:49,131
Dipping it in the ramyeon was weird as well.

2529
01:27:49,132 --> 01:27:50,441
- Dipping it in the ramyeon?
- Right.

2530
01:27:50,442 --> 01:27:52,602
Could that be constantly done while considering hygiene?

2531
01:27:53,072 --> 01:27:55,471
It didn't fit this area.

2532
01:27:55,472 --> 01:27:56,541
- Okay. Let's go with number 1.
- We should go with number 1 then.

2533
01:27:56,542 --> 01:27:58,182
- I hope we can get it right today.
- Right.

2534
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:02,682
Oh, this! This place also has this sign.

2535
01:28:03,222 --> 01:28:05,822
- This place also has this sign.
- Right.

2536
01:28:06,252 --> 01:28:08,421
- This is seen very often.
- Right.

2537
01:28:08,422 --> 01:28:09,762
Security is tight.

2538
01:28:09,862 --> 01:28:10,991
I'm really curious about today's result.

2539
01:28:10,992 --> 01:28:12,691
- We have to get it right.
- I still think it's number two.

2540
01:28:12,692 --> 01:28:13,932
We should go with number one.

2541
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:15,291
Have you all decided?

2542
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:17,702
- You guys have made up your mind.
- I have no idea at all.

2543
01:28:17,962 --> 01:28:19,031
- Right.
- So today,

2544
01:28:19,032 --> 01:28:22,902
we will follow Ji Yoon's opinion.

2545
01:28:23,002 --> 01:28:25,041
Thank you for supporting my opinion.

2546
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:26,141
- Nice one.
- Gosh.

2547
01:28:26,142 --> 01:28:28,012
(Is she giving her award acceptance speech?)

2548
01:28:28,112 --> 01:28:29,782
So you're certain about it, right, Ji Yoon?

2549
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:33,051
I wasn't sure when I just went to the first place.

2550
01:28:33,052 --> 01:28:34,352
After going to the third place,

2551
01:28:35,182 --> 01:28:38,281
I thought that the first place was the fake place.

2552

(She wins his trust.)

2553
01:28:39,922 --> 01:28:41,891
What is your choice? One, two, three.

2554
01:28:41,892 --> 01:28:42,952
- Number 1!
- Number 1!

2555
01:28:43,392 --> 01:28:44,461
We decided the fastest.

2556
01:28:44,462 --> 01:28:46,732
It feels a bit suspicious that things are going quickly.

2557
01:28:47,662 --> 01:28:48,691
We must be right.

2558
01:28:48,692 --> 01:28:49,732
(Please tell us we're right.)

2559
01:28:49,862 --> 01:28:52,102
The clip for the answer will be revealed.

2560
01:28:52,502 --> 01:28:53,832

Mapo is a trendy place.

2564
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:02,942
- They are the stars of this street.
- Right.

01:30:15,252 --> 01:30:17,522
I think we're right with number one.

2597
01:30:17,852 --> 01:30:22,091
(Which place is fake?)

2598
01:30:22,092 --> 01:30:23,192
Please!

2599
01:30:23,622 --> 01:30:25,622
Ji Yoon said it with absolute confidence.

2600
01:30:25,892 --> 01:30:27,461
I have my pride in Mapo.

2601
01:30:27,462 --> 01:30:28,531
Right.

2602
01:30:28,532 --> 01:30:33,832
(Which place is fake?)

2603
01:30:34,402 --> 01:30:36,271
- I think we're right.
- It must be number one.

2604
01:30:36,272 --> 01:30:37,371
- Is it number 1?
- Is it number 1?

2605
01:30:37,372 --> 01:30:38,572
- It must be number one.
- Hold on!

2606
01:30:38,802 --> 01:30:39,872
Which place is it?

2607
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,397
- I think we're right.
- It must be number one.

2608
01:30:42,398 --> 01:30:43,467
- Is it number 1?
- Is it number 1?

2609
01:30:43,468 --> 01:30:44,498
- It must be number one.
- Hold on!

2610
01:30:44,798 --> 01:30:45,868
Which place is it?

2611
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:49,438
(Which place is fake?)

2612
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:52,208
(Exciting Pub, Dish Drawing Bar)

2613
01:30:52,338 --> 01:30:53,447
- What?
- What?

2614
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:54,808
(Fake)

2615
01:30:54,861 --> 01:30:56,031
- That's not it, is it?
- What?

2616
01:30:56,178 --> 01:30:57,278
- What?
- What?

2617
01:30:59,018 --> 01:31:00,148
What?

2618
01:31:01,888 --> 01:31:03,017
(Shocked)

2619
01:31:03,018 --> 01:31:05,088
(Eyes shaking)

2620
01:31:05,388 --> 01:31:08,258
(They all become speechless at the shocking result.)

2621
01:31:08,488 --> 01:31:10,098
So Won Hun was right.

2622
01:31:10,598 --> 01:31:12,057
- So Won Hun was right.
- Are you serious?

2623
01:31:12,058 --> 01:31:13,128
Well...

2624
01:31:14,228 --> 01:31:16,298
(I told you it was number 3.)

2625
01:31:16,498 --> 01:31:17,568
Hey, Won Hun.

2626
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:19,738
The one with wasabi...

2627
01:31:20,138 --> 01:31:22,668
was really weird. It felt just like a variety show.

2628
01:31:22,938 --> 01:31:24,438
- You're saying that now?
- Earlier...

2629
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:26,108
- But...
- I'm a bit late, aren't I?

2630
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:28,908
Hold on! What?

2631
01:31:29,748 --> 01:31:32,277
(What?)

2632
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:34,348
- So was that really 50 dollars?
- Yes.

2633
01:31:34,688 --> 01:31:36,118
I must definitely go there.

2634
01:31:36,318 --> 01:31:38,517
- Steamed hairtail and steak?
- Right.

2635
01:31:38,518 --> 01:31:39,858
- All of that for 50 dollars?
- Yes.

2636
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:41,328
But...

2637
01:31:41,488 --> 01:31:43,428
Let's continue to watch the clip.

2638
01:31:43,828 --> 01:31:46,358
(When the gacha machine is turned,)

2639
01:31:47,098 --> 01:31:49,327
(dishes appear!)

2640
01:31:49,328 --> 01:31:52,838
This place was the easiest to set up.

2641
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:54,408
Gosh!

2642
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:58,338
(The Dish Drawing Bar loved by the Gen MZers)

2643
01:31:58,478 --> 01:32:01,608
That place felt like a great place for business.

2644
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:05,178
(The representative place of hot places, Mapo-gu, Hongdae)

2645
01:32:05,348 --> 01:32:08,388
(However,)

2646
01:32:08,588 --> 01:32:13,188
(the business area of Hongdae faces a crisis.)

2647
01:32:13,658 --> 01:32:15,527
There has been an increase of empty stores.

2648
01:32:15,528 --> 01:32:17,497
In many shopping districts of this area,

2649
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:18,858
many places had lease inquiry signs.

2650
01:32:18,998 --> 01:32:20,197
On our way here,

2651
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:21,927
- there were some places like that.
- Right.

2652
01:32:21,928 --> 01:32:23,467
There are a lot of places that are empty.

2653
01:32:23,468 --> 01:32:25,297
There are a lot of places with those signs.

2654
01:32:25,298 --> 01:32:29,038
(What's even more serious...)

2655
01:32:29,238 --> 01:32:30,637
(is the difference...)

2656
01:32:30,638 --> 01:32:36,548
(between the main street and the alleys.)

2657
01:32:36,948 --> 01:32:39,118
Sales have dropped massively on that street we saw.

2658
01:32:39,348 --> 01:32:41,887
- I see.
- I thought it was doing well.

2659
01:32:41,888 --> 01:32:43,358
(I didn't know that.)

2660
01:32:43,488 --> 01:32:45,087
Are you begging for forgiveness, Ji Yoon?

2661
01:32:45,088 --> 01:32:46,558
- Gosh.
- Are you begging for forgiveness?

2662
01:32:46,658 --> 01:32:48,327
- Gosh.
- That was a massive shock to her.

2663
01:32:48,328 --> 01:32:49,788
- I was completely shocked.
- A massive shock.

2664
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:54,368
(Find a place in need in the unpopular area!)

2665
01:32:54,598 --> 01:32:57,597
Sales have dropped...

2666
01:32:57,598 --> 01:32:59,238
a lot more than when we first opened.

2667
01:32:59,698 --> 01:33:02,237
We're making around 300 to 500 dollars a day.

2668
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,877
On a bad day, we would get around three tables.

2669
01:33:05,878 --> 01:33:07,148
Just 300 dollars a day?

2670
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,418
As sales have dropped massively,

2671
01:33:10,578 --> 01:33:12,318
I was at the point...

2672
01:33:13,018 --> 01:33:15,987
of thinking about whether to close down the place.

2673
01:33:15,988 --> 01:33:17,017
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2674
01:33:17,018 --> 01:33:18,258
My goodness.

2675
01:33:18,518 --> 01:33:19,858
If...

2676
01:33:21,288 --> 01:33:22,757
I didn't have my family...

2677
01:33:22,758 --> 01:33:25,958
and was just running the place on my own in my early 30s,

2678
01:33:26,558 --> 01:33:27,698
well,

2679
01:33:28,298 --> 01:33:30,937
it would've been fine as I would have the time to get back up.

2680
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,638
But that's not the case for me right now.

2681
01:33:33,738 --> 01:33:34,767
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2682
01:33:34,768 --> 01:33:36,438
He was holding on for his family.

2683
01:33:36,638 --> 01:33:37,978
He had a baby.

2684
01:33:38,178 --> 01:33:40,777
As I have a family to support, it's the hardest...

2685
01:33:40,778 --> 01:33:43,147
(It's tough when sales are down as the breadwinner.)

2686
01:33:43,148 --> 01:33:45,417
when we don't get much in sales.

2687
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:48,387
(It's tough when sales are down as the breadwinner.)

2688
01:33:48,388 --> 01:33:49,887
I hope things will turn around with this opportunity.

2689
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:50,988
Right.

2690
01:33:51,218 --> 01:33:52,587
We failed to find the fake spot,

2691
01:33:52,588 --> 01:33:54,327
- but we wish all the best for them.
- Right.

2692
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:57,298
(The fake place has been chosen!)

2693
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:00,198
Was it always a place with retro vibes?

2694
01:34:00,498 --> 01:34:02,367
- I think it was.
- Right.

2695
01:34:02,368 --> 01:34:03,837
- So the gacha machines are fake.
- Right.

2696
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,138
The gacha machines are fake.

2697
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:09,207
(The one that cooks brands, Kim Hoon)

2698
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:10,378
Even new dishes were made?

2699
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:13,807
Was he on the show before?

2700
01:34:13,808 --> 01:34:15,108
(You've all seen him, haven't you?)

2701
01:34:15,308 --> 01:34:17,818
(Sixth Sense: City Tour 1)

2702
01:34:18,078 --> 01:34:19,517
(It feels like there isn't a kick...)

2703
01:34:19,518 --> 01:34:20,948
(for people to come all the way here.)

2704
01:34:21,318 --> 01:34:22,347
Right.

2705
01:34:22,348 --> 01:34:24,217
He was the one who put ice cream into tteokbokki.

2706
01:34:24,218 --> 01:34:25,287
The first episode?

2707
01:34:25,288 --> 01:34:26,757
- It's great to see you.
- Hello.

2708
01:34:26,758 --> 01:34:28,257
So he's a legend of Yongnidan Street.

2709
01:34:28,258 --> 01:34:29,327
If it's in Hapjeong,

2710
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:30,927
this is a place full of young Gen MZers.

2711
01:34:30,928 --> 01:34:31,928
Right.

2712
01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:35,297
There is a need for things that will entertain them.

2713
01:34:35,298 --> 01:34:37,737
In places like Hongdae or Seongsu,

2714
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:39,297
there are many gacha shops.

2715
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:41,637
- That was such a cool idea.
- As there are many dishes,

2716
01:34:41,638 --> 01:34:43,337
how would it be for these dishes...

2717
01:34:43,338 --> 01:34:45,938
to be drawn from the machine?

2718
01:34:46,278 --> 01:34:47,948
- The food is drawn?
- Right.

2719
01:34:48,148 --> 01:34:50,118
It was a great concept.

2720
01:34:52,218 --> 01:34:54,848
(There has been a boom for gacha machines.)

2721
01:34:55,548 --> 01:34:59,018
(Men and women of all ages have fallen for gacha machines.)

2722
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:01,327
(Gen MZers have fallen for gacha machines.)

2723
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:02,588
My goodness!

2724
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:05,397
Who would've ever expected this to be applied here?

2725
01:35:05,398 --> 01:35:06,558
(Drawing Bar concept to follow the Gen MZ trend)

2726
01:35:06,658 --> 01:35:09,468
Since that was really popular these days,

2727
01:35:10,368 --> 01:35:12,197
- I thought it was real.
- It sounded reasonable.

2728
01:35:12,198 --> 01:35:13,468
- Right.
- Seriously.

2729
01:35:13,838 --> 01:35:15,767
It fit perfectly with the concept.

2730
01:35:15,768 --> 01:35:17,278
Right.

2731
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:19,037
(The hidden menu...)

2732
01:35:19,038 --> 01:35:21,277
Sixth Sense is giving me goosebumps.

2733
01:35:21,278 --> 01:35:22,278
(of 7.14 percent of this Drawing Bar)

2734
01:35:22,908 --> 01:35:24,518
- Is this enough?
- Yes.

2735
01:35:24,818 --> 01:35:26,078
This is wasabi and potato.

2736
01:35:26,378 --> 01:35:27,848
This is just for entertainment purposes.

2737
01:35:28,248 --> 01:35:30,717
After spreading out the dough, add in 3g of wasabi.

2738
01:35:30,718 --> 01:35:31,917
(The splendor of 3g of wasabi for the draw)

2739
01:35:31,918 --> 01:35:34,387
The one with wasabi.

2740
01:35:34,388 --> 01:35:36,998
- The gacha ball.
- It felt too entertaining.

2741
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:39,027
(Gacha machines and a bar)

2742
01:35:39,028 --> 01:35:41,528
(A fantastic collaboration)

2743
01:35:41,598 --> 01:35:46,637
(Chef Kim Hoon's gacha ball fritter has been taught.)

2744
01:35:46,638 --> 01:35:47,837
I got it perfectly right.

2745
01:35:47,838 --> 01:35:50,437
I said this dish was newly made for the show.

2746
01:35:50,438 --> 01:35:51,737
Right. He guessed everything right...

2747
01:35:51,738 --> 01:35:53,748
when he made his deductions.

2748
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:55,307
(10 days before opening the fake bar)

2749
01:35:55,308 --> 01:35:58,718
I definitely remember seeing that bar.

2750
01:35:59,648 --> 01:36:01,888
(We're here to change up everything!)

2751
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:03,418
- I can't believe it.
- Gosh.

2752
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:06,758
(An inefficient space caught the eye of the production crew members.)

2753
01:36:07,188 --> 01:36:09,127
(Construction will begin right away!)

2754
01:36:09,128 --> 01:36:10,928
That was where the table was placed.

2755
01:36:11,258 --> 01:36:12,697
That place was redesigned.

2756
01:36:12,698 --> 01:36:13,698
(The most important gacha machines are placed.)

2757
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:16,698
(The balls are put in as well.)

2758
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:18,968
(Each detail is meticulously worked on!)

2759
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:20,567
(It's making a great transformation into a gacha machine place.)

2760
01:36:20,568 --> 01:36:21,938
So everything was changed.

2761
01:36:23,608 --> 01:36:27,608
(It managed to change into a perfect Drawing Bar.)

2762
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:29,607
There's a secret.

2763
01:36:29,608 --> 01:36:31,178
(There's a secret hidden in this place?)

2764
01:36:32,948 --> 01:36:34,417
There was that mascot.

2765
01:36:34,418 --> 01:36:35,447
(What about this mascot?)

2766
01:36:35,448 --> 01:36:36,548
What is that?

2767
01:36:37,318 --> 01:36:39,417
He said his older brother drew it for him.

2768
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:40,457
- Right.
- Right.

2769
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:41,887
Hello.

2770
01:36:41,888 --> 01:36:43,857
I created OMPANGi...

2771
01:36:43,858 --> 01:36:46,728
and I'm the emoticon creator, eaaaaso, Jeong Da Seul.

2772
01:36:49,298 --> 01:36:51,197
She's a famous emoticon creator!

2773
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:53,197
I love OMPANGi!

2774
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:54,538
OMPANGi is really famous!

2775
01:36:56,108 --> 01:36:57,278
No way.

2776
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,377
I didn't notice the creator of OMPANGi.

2777
01:36:59,378 --> 01:37:02,007
No wonder. It was the work of an expert.

2778
01:37:02,008 --> 01:37:03,648
(OMPANGi creator Jeong Da Seul and Sixth Sense: City Tour 2)

2779
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:07,148
(Telling her the details)

2780
01:37:07,348 --> 01:37:09,318
I think it'll be great fun.

2781
01:37:10,188 --> 01:37:12,387
- She resembles OMPANGi a bit.
- Right.

2782
01:37:12,388 --> 01:37:14,988
- She has a cute face.
- She's cute.

2783
01:37:15,728 --> 01:37:17,428
It was made really well.

2784
01:37:17,728 --> 01:37:21,098
The name of this goblin is Dongggaebi.

2785
01:37:21,128 --> 01:37:24,167
Its blue fur is its charming point.

2786
01:37:24,168 --> 01:37:27,967
It's a lively character that loves people.

2787
01:37:27,968 --> 01:37:29,338
It's cute.

2788
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,808
No one suspected that at all.

2789
01:37:32,378 --> 01:37:35,708
(All preparations are done!)

2790
01:37:35,948 --> 01:37:39,018
(D-Day of the Drawing Bar)

2791
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:41,418
Look at that.

2792
01:37:41,918 --> 01:37:43,587
- It's entertaining.
- This is giving me goosebumps.

2793
01:37:43,588 --> 01:37:44,658
It's great fun.

2794
01:37:45,288 --> 01:37:46,317
(The customers gave a great response to them.)

2795
01:37:46,318 --> 01:37:48,958
It would be great if it helps the owner with sales.

2796
01:37:49,158 --> 01:37:52,628
You should all gather at this place if you like drinking and seafood.

2797
01:37:52,828 --> 01:37:54,997
You can draw your own dishes from the gacha machine.

2798
01:37:54,998 --> 01:37:56,628
(It becomes a hot place on social media.)

2799
01:37:56,998 --> 01:37:58,067
(A new source of fun has been provided in Mapo-gu.)

2800
01:37:58,068 --> 01:37:59,898
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

2801
01:38:00,538 --> 01:38:01,707
(The Drawing Bar was a great success.)

2802
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:03,678
He used to get three tables, but it's completely packed.

2803
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:07,347
Sixth Sense, this place is fake.

2804
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:09,878
(Exciting Pub, fake)

2805
01:38:09,948 --> 01:38:13,747
- I'm speechless.
- I hope things go well for him.

2806
01:38:13,748 --> 01:38:15,447
(We hope things go well for the owner after this change.)

2807
01:38:15,448 --> 01:38:16,548
We hope your business will thrive.

2808
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:19,087
This doesn't make sense.

2809
01:38:19,088 --> 01:38:21,857
- I'm speechless.
- What do we do? Gosh.

2810
01:38:21,858 --> 01:38:24,557
- Well...
- The people watching this...

2811
01:38:24,558 --> 01:38:27,397
will think we're complete idiots.

2812
01:38:27,398 --> 01:38:28,398
(Subtitles omitted)

2813
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:30,468
Would it seem fake on TV?

2814
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:33,397
You kept saying it was too easy.

2815
01:38:33,398 --> 01:38:34,467
Right.

2816
01:38:34,468 --> 01:38:36,838
I would've been called a complete idiot by so many people.

2817
01:38:36,978 --> 01:38:38,177
What do I do, Jae Seok?

2818
01:38:38,178 --> 01:38:41,177
- She said it was too easy.
- It'll be hard to tell in person.

2819
01:38:41,178 --> 01:38:42,307
- Won Hun...
- Right.

2820
01:38:42,308 --> 01:38:44,018
It wasn't that hard, to be honest.

2821
01:38:44,848 --> 01:38:46,147
I'm still frustrated by this.

2822
01:38:46,148 --> 01:38:47,987
Why did everyone want to go for number one?

2823
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:49,917
I was forced against my opinion because of the majority vote.

2824
01:38:49,918 --> 01:38:51,957
If I were on this show alone,

2825
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:53,957
I would've definitely gone straight for number three.

2826
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:55,157
You should've spoken up like that much earlier.

2827
01:38:55,158 --> 01:38:56,158
Right.

2828
01:38:56,488 --> 01:38:58,528
I didn't want to win against my seniors.

2829
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:00,028
Is that so?

2830
01:39:01,398 --> 01:39:02,727
- Won Hun.
- I'll pick a name.

2831
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,038
This is...

2832
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:06,197
- for the penalty.
- The penalty.

2833
01:39:06,198 --> 01:39:08,668
A sentimental post.

2834
01:39:08,738 --> 01:39:10,477
A cringeworthy sentimental post has to be put up.

2835
01:39:10,478 --> 01:39:13,138
So the name of that person is written here like this?

2836
01:39:14,108 --> 01:39:15,148
Won Hun!

2837
01:39:15,748 --> 01:39:19,747
(So it's me who has to post it up.)

2838
01:39:19,748 --> 01:39:20,748
Gosh.

2839
01:39:20,749 --> 01:39:21,818
(That's awesome.)

2840
01:39:23,388 --> 01:39:24,657
(Won Hun gets chosen.)

2841
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:25,817
So I have to post it up?

2842
01:39:25,818 --> 01:39:27,187
- A post.
- Right.

2843
01:39:27,188 --> 01:39:28,928
It must've been the power of Seok Jin's gun.

2844
01:39:29,558 --> 01:39:30,998
Right.

2845
01:39:32,058 --> 01:39:33,997
- This is such a big shock.
- That's cool.

2846
01:39:33,998 --> 01:39:34,998
(Check Won Hun's social media page right now!)

2847
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:36,786
(Sixth City Tour)

2848
01:39:37,016 --> 01:39:39,386
(The center of Seoul filled with trendy stores)

2849
01:39:40,156 --> 01:39:41,925
(Yongsan)

2850
01:39:41,926 --> 01:39:44,266
(Davichi)

2851
01:39:44,766 --> 01:39:47,336
(The self-acclaimed Yongsan expert has arrived!)

2852
01:39:47,536 --> 01:39:49,435
(After a quick look,)

2853
01:39:49,436 --> 01:39:51,105
(I see some fake items.)

2854
01:39:51,106 --> 01:39:52,335
(That's real, Min Kyung.)

2855
01:39:52,336 --> 01:39:54,735
(A new blunt member has arrived.)

2856
01:39:54,736 --> 01:39:56,035
(Hae Ri is just focused on eating.)

2857
01:39:56,036 --> 01:39:57,805
(This is so good.)

2858
01:39:57,806 --> 01:39:59,845
(Hae Ri gets mad when the food is good.)

2859
01:39:59,846 --> 01:40:01,716
(It's good!)

2860
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,675
(I thought you were doing a skit.)

2861
01:40:03,676 --> 01:40:05,516
(Gosh, it's good.)

2862
01:40:05,586 --> 01:40:07,386
(Boing)

2863
01:40:07,816 --> 01:40:09,215
(Like a deduction duo)

2864
01:40:09,216 --> 01:40:10,255
(Shocked)

2865
01:40:10,256 --> 01:40:11,256
(Did you get it again?)

2866
01:40:11,486 --> 01:40:12,955
(Like a comedienne duo)

2867
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:15,356
(Along with the charming members of Davichi,)

2868
01:40:15,526 --> 01:40:17,926
(they head to find the owners of Yongsan with a double life.)

2869
01:40:18,196 --> 01:40:20,696
(There's Song Ga In here.)

2870
01:40:21,536 --> 01:40:23,065
(It's Director Bong Joon Ho?)

2871
01:40:23,066 --> 01:40:26,636
(Kyung Pyo knows the owner's double life?)

2872
01:40:26,766 --> 01:40:28,675
(Shocking figures keep appearing.)

2873
01:40:28,676 --> 01:40:30,106
(What is the surprising double life of the owner?)

2874
01:40:30,276 --> 01:40:32,146
I'm going to come here again.
