(Autumn when the foliage starts to turn vibrantly red)

00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:20,207
Gosh, this is nice. It's from the past.

3
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:21,547
Hello.

4
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:23,477
This is Yongsan,

5
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,087
- Dragon Mountain. - How was your Chuseok holidays?

6
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:27,187
Yes.

7
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:28,857
What's wrong with your hair?

8
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:30,687
I tried to style it.

9
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:32,586
- Just a little... - I got compliments from everyone...

10
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:34,626
- except you. - Your hair looks very strange.

11
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:35,696
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:37,156
- It's a trendy style. - You must be jealous of me.

13
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,466
- Seok Jin... - Isn't it trendy?

14
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,126
He's jealous, isn't he?

15
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:42,266
Recently, Seok Jin brought up...

16
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:43,696
- Young Sixty very often. - Yes.

17
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:46,237
Now, Young Forty became a meme.

18
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,377
Seok Jin was wrong about what it meant.

19
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:49,636
- Really? - Yes.

20
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:51,806
- And so... - I didn't know what the meme meant.

21
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:54,447
He just jumped on the bandwagon.

22
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:55,916
(Seok Jin jumped on the bandwagon just by seeing "forty.")

23
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,486
And I kept calling myself Young Fifty.

24
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,187
It's a type of mockery, isn't it?

25
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,356
Why do people mock me when I try to dress young?

26
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:02,457
- I mean... - You look great.

27
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:03,657
Thank you.

28
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,986
(Kyung Pyo's sweet comment makes his heart melt.)

29
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:08,096
Yongsan looks great.

30
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:09,956
This is Gyeongnidan Street.

31
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:11,326
- Is this Gyeongnidan Street? - I see.

32
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:12,427
Gyeongnidan Street.

45
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:41,427

46
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:44,967
(What is today's fake hidden in Yongsan?)

47
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:47,936
- I've only heard about it. - I didn't have a chance to come.

48
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,136
Me neither.

49
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:50,596
- Have you been here? - I come here often.

50
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:51,706
- Really? - Seriously?

51
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:53,706
I often come to this store next to us.

52
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,036
- Really? - Really?

53
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,276
- Is that so? - This is a popular place.

54
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,276
Is this Yongnidan Street? Mimi, you must know about it.

55
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,806
- Yes, but it's my first time here. - It's very popular here.

56
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,876
- Really? - I come to Yongsan often,

57
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,447
but it's my first time on Yongnidan Street.

58
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,146
Aren't there many restaurants here?

59
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,316
Yes, there are.

60
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:09,117
Instead of franchise restaurants,

61
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,556
there are many small, independent shops.

62
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:12,856
Unique shops and restaurants.

63
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,726
That's what people like.

00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,096
(that are unique.)

66
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,796
This is a pizza restaurant that I go often.

67
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:20,166
- Is the pizza good? - Is it a pizza restaurant?

68
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,197
This place?

69
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,636
(Kyung Pyo's favorite pizza restaurant is also here.)

70
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:24,937
You amaze me.

71
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:26,966
- You have to be diligent. - There's a reason why...

72
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,207
you have a hard time losing weight.

73
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,337
- It will become popular... - Hello.

74
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:30,706
- Hello. - Hello.

75
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:32,606
- So early in the morning... - What kind of place is this?

76
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:33,976
- It's a clothing company. - A clothing company?

77
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:35,846
- So that's why. - You look so stylish.

78
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,917
- You have a great sense of fashion. - That's why.

79
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,447
All of them are dressed well.

80
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,356
All of us are wearing matching outfits today.

81
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,626
- We're wearing... - Right.

82
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:46,756
- Mimi and I are... - Our outfits match perfectly.

83
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:47,856
Everything you're wearing matches.

84
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:48,926
- Yes, everything matches. - We're wearing black shoes.

85
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,556
Mimi, you dress very well.

86
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:51,666
- Thank you. - That's what I always think.

87
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,196
- Don't you choose your outfit? - Yes.

88
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,266
- She dresses so well. - Thank you.

89
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,767
- You're like her father-in-law. - Yes.

90
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,036
My daughter-in-law.

91
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:58,866
Do I look okay today, Father?

92
00:02:58,867 --> 00:02:59,906
Yes, you look good.

93
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:01,477
"Do I look okay today, Father?"

94
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:03,006
They're each other's in-law,

95
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,506
but the son who connects them ran away.

96
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:05,606
- The son ran away. - There's no son.

97
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:08,146
- He doesn't come home. - He's still in the US.

98
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,216
- Is he in the US? - Yes.

99
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:12,147
- I didn't even know that. - You didn't?

100
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:14,786
- Hello. - Hello.

101
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,286
- A good day, please. - Hello.

102
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,156
- It's already different. - "A good day, please?"

103
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,327
- Whom are you asking? - Whom are you asking?

104
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:23,027
He's talking without thinking.

105
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,267
- A good day, please. - He's not used to doing it.

106
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,067
- I'm clumsy. - So he's talking carelessly.

107
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,696
- It's hard to force myself. - He doesn't know what to say.

108
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:30,266
Whom are you asking for a good day?

109
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,937
(While they're laughing at his awkward greeting)

110
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:33,767
Let's look this way.

111
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,037
They might not recognize us from the back.

112
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,077
We're two girls. They'll probably recognize us.

113
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,017
Let's make an acrostic poem since we're bored.

114
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:42,677
"Six."

115
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:44,386
Be quiet.

116
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:47,047
(Be quiet)

117
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:48,317
That's good.

118
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,187
That's a good start. You have nice energy.

119
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,386
- This is how you do it. - Do I have to tense the fingers?

120
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,696
- Yes, the tension is necessary. - I see.

121
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,556
- Seok Jin, don't close that. - I shouldn't?

122
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:58,627
- There's something here. - Why would you close it?

123
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:00,296
I saw the door open.

124
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:01,596
- Seok Jin is... - I'm sorry.

125
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:03,066
- Ever since he asked... - I shouldn't have closed it.

126
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,466
For a good day, he has lost his mind.

127
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:06,937
I'm not completely awake yet.

128
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,407
By the way...

129
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:09,776
Is that your bed head?

130
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:11,676
Did you style your hair last night before going to bed?

131
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:12,707
No, I didn't.

132
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:13,976
- It looks suspicious. - This morning,

133
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,776
- it was done by a hairstylist. - Really?

134
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,486
- A hairstylist styled my hair. - Is that so?

135
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:20,086
Your hair is so puffy that it makes your face look long.

136
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,386
Yours is so flat.

137
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,387
By the way...

138
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,287
Your hair is not puffy enough.

139
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:26,426
Until a few minutes ago, you complimented...

140
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,996
- on each other's looks. - You said you liked her outfit.

141
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:31,097
- Your hair isn't puffy enough. - What's gotten into you?

142
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,596
- Gosh, my stomach hurts. - All of a sudden...

143
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:35,936
- Yours is the opposite of mine. - after a terrible greeting...

144
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,236
(They go inside before it gets too late.)

145
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:39,206
- My goodness. - They're looking at the wall.

146
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,037
I can tell by looking at them from the back.

147
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,676
(Today's guests with familiar backs)

148
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,907

149
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,717

155
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,626
Davichi is here with us.

156
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,767
Davichi.

157
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,866
They're Korea's comedy duo.

158
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:08,936
- Yes, a comedy duo. - Yes.

159
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:09,996
- A comedy duo? - A comedy duo.

160
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:11,167
- Hello. - My gosh.

161
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,436
I saw Min Kyung a few times,

162
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,206
but I've never seen you with your hair up.

163
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,207
- Yes. - That's right.

164
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,006
Since it's an outdoor shoot,

165
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,807
I didn't want my hair to get in the way.

166
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,976
- Your hair is completely up. - It's a trendy hairstyle.

167
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,686
- Really? - Yes, it's one of my favorite.

168
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:26,116
- We have similar... - They have similar hairstyles.

169
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,257
- You pressed your hair down. - Yes, I like it.

170
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:29,457
You have similar hairstyles.

171
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,056
Pressing it down is trendy. Don't puff up your hair.

172
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:32,657
But your hair is too flat.

173
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,157
It should be slightly puffy.

174
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:37,927
What do you think? It's been a long time.

175
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,166
- Do I look bad? - It looks a little too puffy.

176
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,266
Did you hear that?

177
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,996
(It looks a little too puffy.)

178
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:44,036
Wasn't I right?

179
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,836
- It's a little... - As expected, she knows.

180
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,336
- Right? - She's telling the truth.

181
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:48,576
- She hasn't seen me in a long time, - Hae Ri knows.

182
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:50,076
- so she must be telling the truth. - Just a little...

183
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:51,946
What did I tell you? It looks too puffy.

184
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,676
When it gets humid, it will come down.

185
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,447
- It's okay. I like it. - Your hair...

186
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:57,276
(Mimi is satisfied.)

187
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,817
Davichi, are you having another concert soon?

188
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:01,186
That's right.

189
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,356
(Davichi came with good news.)

190
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:04,956
Our concert will be on January 24 and 25.

191
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,886
It's coming up soon. Please invite us.

192
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,726
- Please come. - Please invite us.

193
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,596
- Last time, Jae Seok came... - I went to their concert.

194
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:12,996
- He came last year. - The concert hall was packed.

195
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,937
That must be why they hold a concert every year.

196
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:18,906
- It's hard to fill up the space. - It's hard.

197
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,906
- It was at a gymnastics arena. - Right.

198
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:21,936
- That's big. - It was packed with audience.

199
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:23,137
- Really? - Yes.

200
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:27,377
(Last January, Davichi's 17th solo concert)

201
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:30,477
(The first female duo to perform at a gymnastics arena)

202
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:34,017
(Sold out the moment the tickets went on sale)

203
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:36,287
- The two of them are also fun. - Right.

204
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,287
(Glancing)

205
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:39,987
- Have you seen them? - Please come.

206
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,297
Me?

207
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,926
- It's the perfect timing. - Thank you so much.

208
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,226
(Smiling big)

209
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,827
- It's the perfect timing. - Thank you so much.

210
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,997
It will be when Seok Jin turns 60.

211
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,466
- He won't go. - Hey.

212
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,466
He won't be able to deny that he's 60.

213
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,536
That's not true.

214
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,806
You've been delaying it enough.

215
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,746
Is there any discount on concerts?

216
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:58,906
- A discount on what? - A discount on concerts.

217
00:06:58,907 --> 00:06:59,976
You mean a discount for seniors?

218
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:02,017
- Yes. - Is there? I don't think so.

219
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:05,186
You can get a senior discount when you're over 65.

220
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,187
(Seok Jin assumes a senior discount from the age of 65.)

221
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:09,217
Thank you. Look at that.

222
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,627
- Are we having yogurt this morning? - Honey.

223
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,057
Is this your order?

224
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:18,667
(A healthy dessert that's fresh and sweet)

225
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,497
- Is that Kaymak? - Thank you.

226
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:22,736
- Thank you. - It must be Kaymak.

227
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:24,196
- Is this Kaymak? - It must be Kaymak.

228
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:25,867
When you dip some bread in Kaymak...

229
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,177
- It's Greek yogurt. - It's Greek yogurt.

230
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:30,207
It wasn't Kaymak.

231
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,806
Everyone heard about it from somewhere.

232
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:33,847
- But it looks like Kaymak. - Right.

233
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:35,716
- At the end, Seok Jin... - Why was my voice...

234
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,317
the loudest at the end?

235
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:40,017
(As long as it's not me)

236
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:42,086
(Everyone shares a bite of the dessert.)

237
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,586
- This looks amazing. - Try it.

238
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:44,727
Won't we go to the restroom after eating this?

239
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,826
(On one side, )

240
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:52,527
(the owner stands there naturally.)

241
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,297
(Absent-mindedly)

242
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:56,937
Sir, do we have to pay in advance?

243
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,436
- Pardon? - Do we have to pay in advance?

244
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,437
No.

245
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,676
(I'm sorry?)

246
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:04,847
- I wanted to explain. - Oh, I see.

247
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:06,206
- This... - Excuse me.

248
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,516
What was that about? The owner...

249
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:09,517
(Feeling embarrassed for Jae Seok)

250
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:11,547
- He was standing there. - He kept standing there.

251
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,287
I thought...

252
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:14,586
What was that about?

253
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,687
- Why are you embarrassing him? - I'm sorry.

254
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,256
- Are you making a mistake already? - He wanted to explain to us.

255
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:20,886
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

256
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,727
It reminded me of my past when I was in school.

257
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,296
- Thank you for coming. - Sure.

258
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,796
- It's strawberry Greek yogurt. - Greek yogurt.

259
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:30,266
- That's an acai bowl. - This is an acai bowl.

260
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,737
- It's yogurt called Real Honey. - It's very healthy.

261
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:35,906
I heard that you open early in the morning.

262
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:39,606
Yes, it's a bakery where we sell yogurt in the morning.

263
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:40,607
That's amazing.

264
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:42,977
(Adding to the appearance with colorful toppings)

265
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,987
(A popular place of healthy pleasure that's both tasty and healthy)

266
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,957
This place always wins first place in the food delivery application.

267
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,056
(Yongsan's hottest spot that Min Kyung also knows about)

268
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,386
Min Kyung knows about it.

269
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,457
(Shall I taste it?)

270
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:56,557
The acai bowl.

271
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:58,727
- Isn't it acai? - Is this...

272
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,897
- Acai berries? - Acai bowl.

273
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:03,766
- Are these red beans? - What's that?

274
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,037
- Acai. - Acai?

275
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:07,907
"Red beans?"
(Laughing)

276
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,107
What's so funny?

277
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,046
- He said... - He thought it was purple beans.

278
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,047
- What? - How could you call it red beans?

279
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:16,747
The owner just told us that it was an acai bowl.

280
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,847
(Father?)

281
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,916
- He doesn't listen to anything. - Gosh.

282
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,587
- That's refreshing. - He doesn't listen to others.

283
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,017
- Did he call it red beans? - He doesn't listen to others.

284
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:24,527
He only talks about himself.

285
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:25,957
They could be purple red beans.

286
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,757
It's been a while since Min Kyung responded so coolly like this.

287
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:29,996
When Seok Jin thought that it was red beans,

288
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,027
- she said, "Acai ball." - Acai.

289
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,626
(Cold)

290
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:33,827
Min Kyung, are you a thinker type in MBTI?

291
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:36,466
The acai bowl was mentioned about 20 times.

292
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,567
He called acai red beans.

293
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:40,766
Think of today as the winter solstice.

294
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,277
(Think of today as the winter solstice while eating.)

295
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,936
Enjoy it while imagining that it's red beans.

296
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,907
(Enjoying the acai bowl at the winter solstice)

297
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:47,846
- By the way, - They're talking in English.

298
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,216
- the acorn bread... - Their acorn bread is famous.

299
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:51,217
The acorn bread?

300
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:53,347
- Let's go see the acorn bread. - Okay.

301
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:55,486
- He doesn't ever get up. - You aren't going...

302
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,256
even though you're sitting at the end.

303
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:58,486
Mimi is the expert.

304
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:59,986
The bread...

305
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:02,597
- It's over here. It looks pretty. - Where's the tray?

306
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:05,567
This place looks like Studio Ghibli.

307
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,266
- Right? - Yes.

308
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,597
(A cute, cartoon-like atmosphere)

309
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:13,267
(Small and cute bread that matches the vibe perfectly)

310
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:17,977
(And their signature acorn-shaped madeleines)

311
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,146
- It looks so cute. - I know.

312
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,376
They must be cartoon characters.

313
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:22,946
- Matcha? Chocolate? - Sure.

314
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:24,446
When it comes to desserts,

315
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,486
you make great choices.

316
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:28,157
I just buy them all.

317
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,487
They're here.

318
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:32,986
This is the acorn bread.

319
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,626
- It's the acorn bread. - Acorn bread.

320
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,657
I'll eat the best one before Seok Jin starts.

321
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:40,167
But you can't eat it all.

322
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:41,797
Shall I cut it?

323
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,366
- Do you want it like this? - No.

324
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,466
- What's wrong? - No.

325
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,136
- Do you want me to do it? - Yes, do it for me.

326
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,177
Oh, my.

327
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,247
- She uses a knife... - "Do it for me."

328
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:53,446
She's cutting it so elegantly.

329
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:55,116
- Jae Seok cut it... - I mean, the angle.

330
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,277
Did I cut it poorly?

331
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,216
Did he cut it poorly?

332
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,846
No, but he cut it into small pieces.

333
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:01,117
- You're right. - Yes.

334
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:05,627
(Min Kyung cuts it again elegantly.)

335
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:08,256
(Taking a bite of the acorn bread gracefully)

336
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:09,257
- Is it good? - Right?

337
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:12,567
Tear it.

338
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,297
I'll tear it.

339
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:17,336
(Exclaiming)

340
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:18,836
The madeleine is tasty.

341
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:19,907
- It's good. - Right?

342
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:22,406
Okay.

343
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:23,707
We have places to go today.

344
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,506
Do you find them on the map?

345
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,106
- Yes. - That's so classic.

346
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:28,277
The cameramen...

347
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,546
(The classic staff)

348
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:31,547
(A classic map)

349
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:32,746
- What's wrong? - Are you mocking us?

350
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:33,747
- No. - She keeps...

351
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,156
- She keeps mocking us. - Min Kyung.

352
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:37,116
- I really didn't mock you. - You developed...

353
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:39,557
a lot of mockery technique since the last time.

354
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:42,156
- She mocks us so elegantly. - I agree.

355
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:43,997
- So it's hard to dispute. - I know.

356
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:47,297
(They calm down and take a look at the classic map.)

357
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:48,736
What's this?

358
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:51,037
"The Owner's Double Life in Yongsan?"

359
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,036
"Owner Who Does This Too."

360
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,676
"Owner with Lots of Jeju."

361
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,477
"Owner of Meat Restaurant with Lots of Smoke."

362
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:00,306
(This too?)

363
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,977
(That too?)

364
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:06,487
(Is the owner a pro at juggling multiple jobs?)

365
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:08,757
(Owner Who Does This Too)

366
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:12,886
(With dazzling hand skills...)

367
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,097
(Could it be juggling?)

368
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:17,497
(Owner with Lots of Jeju)

369
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:20,367
(Appearing from the smoke)

370
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:23,536
(Is the owner a genie?)

371
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,907
(Owner with Lots of Smoke)

372
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,676
(The owner's...)

373
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:31,276
(double life)

374
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,107
(Which is the one and only fake?)

375
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:37,146
I heard that Min Kyung knows a lot about Yongsan.

376
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,416
I live in this neighborhood.

377
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,586
- Seriously? - Really?

378
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,916
- Do you live here? - Yes, I live here.

379
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,256
I bet she has visited many places.

380
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,856
I honestly think that today will be very easy.

381
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:45,926
Is that so?

382
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:48,527
- I've been to everywhere. - I see.

383
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:50,696
- Then we can count on you. - I feel reassured.

384
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,226
- Seriously. - Today, you're done for.

385
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,366
You're done for. Brace yourselves.

386
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,866
We're sure to get it right today.

387
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,207
We have a huge advantage now.

388
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,936
Min Kyung is the type to visit all places...

389
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,307
that are trendy or new.

390
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,046
At a quick glance,

391
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,946
I see a few fake ones.

392
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,017
Which ones?

393
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:09,917
- Min Kyung, those are real. - Yes.

394
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,887
- All of these are real. - Min Kyung.

395
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,116
She just pointed...

396
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:17,157
at real places.

397
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:18,787
You fooled us.

398
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,727
Min Kyung, these are real.

399
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,997
She just pointed at real places.

400
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:25,796
(Her pointing of the finger stirs the public sentiment.)

401
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,266
Suddenly, I feel worried.

402
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,096
- You must have been startled. - I was.

403
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:32,637
In the list of real places, she said that she saw fake ones.

404
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:35,476
I will do my best.

405
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:37,537
- Shall we go outside? - Yes.

406
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:40,547
- The coffee was also delicious. - I love games.

407
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:42,646
Min Kyung, please do your best today.

408
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,147
Yes, I'll work hard.

409
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:46,117
Here we go.

410
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:50,216
I've been here for shoots,

411
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,786
- but I've never walked here. - Me neither.

412
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,656
- It's my first time walking here. - At night,

413
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:55,396
Yongnidan Street is extremely popular.

414
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:56,426
Yes, I heard that.

415
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,627
- At night? - Yes.

416
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,597
Many major corporate head offices are here.

417
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,166
There's also a big floating population.

418
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,397
(A commercial district shaped by major corporate offices)

419
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:07,267
(The streets of Yongsan at night are ideal for unwinding after work.)

420
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,707
(Yongnidan Street is full of new, hot places.)

421
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:12,376
- This place was on the map. - This bakery?

422
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:14,047
- This one? - Right, this place.

423
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,287
(One of the hip places on the map)

424
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,317
(A popular bakery in Yongsan that's packed even on rainy days)

425
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:25,357
(From croissants, its signature bread)

426
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:28,927
(A place that's popular for its various types of pastry)

427
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:32,327
(Extremely popular for its crunchy and moist texture)

428
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,527
- Yes, right here. - This place is amazing.

429
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:37,266
I bought a cake for you at this place...

430
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,667
- on your birthday. - Really?

431
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:40,407
(What?)

432
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:42,406
- I bought it on your birthday. - Okay.

433
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:44,407
(Laughing)

434
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:45,906
Shall we go to an accessory shop?

435
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,906
- It's pretty. - It looks cute.

436
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:49,417
It has so many pretty items.

437
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:51,216
It's adorable.

438
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:52,217
(A place that's full of small and cute items?)

439
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:56,557
(A small, charming accessory shop that faces the bakery)

440
00:14:57,787 --> 00:15:01,757
(A place full of handmade knitted items crafted by the owner)

441
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,057
Hello, ma'am.

442
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,027
Gosh, it's so cute.

443
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:10,036
(There's a knitting fever even among the idol singers, )

444
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,737
(including Sakura and SOYEON.)

445
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:15,076
(Knitting became a hobby for the MZers.)

446
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:16,376
("Reason Why MZer Grabs Knitting Instead of Smartphones")

447
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:17,677
("Knitting Is Popular Again, A Way To Reduce Stress")

448
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,006
She must make them by hand.

449
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,106
(Full of popular knitted items made by hand)

450
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,317
They're really handmade.

451
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:26,046
- There are so many pretty items. - It's so pretty.

452
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,816
- I know. - Do these sunflowers move...

453
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,157
when I clap?

454
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,387
- I guess not. - No.

455
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,326
They won't move no matter how many times you clap.

456
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:33,486
Keep clapping.

457
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,326
- Such a toy exists. Don't you know? - I think I've seen it.

458
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:36,656
- Right? - Doesn't it run on batteries?

459
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:37,657
Yes.

460
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:39,396
There are also Tom and Jerry.

461
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,596
These are so cute.

462
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:42,666
Tom and Jerry.

463
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,536
(Tom and Jerry capture Jae Seok's eyes.)

464
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:47,336
Seok Jin, why don't you get one of these with Jae Seok?

465
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,176
- Shall I? - Tom and Jerry.

466
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,736
- This looks good. - This is perfect.

467
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:52,977
- Other items are too cute. - It's cute.

468
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,577
- Let's call them Tom and Jeery. - "Jeery?"

469
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,177
"Jeery?"

470
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,186
You might wet your pants.

471
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,257
- How could you say that? - Wetting your pants is...

472
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:07,887
"Jeery?" It could make you wet your pants.

473
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,726
- "Tom and Jeery?" - It's pretty.

474
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,797
Isn't it cute?

475
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:13,196
To be honest, when I look at things like this,

476
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:15,066
I don't really want them.

477
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,936
Don't say that in front of the owner.

478
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:18,137
I'm sorry.

479
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,706
- I'm sorry. - He said it right in front of her.

480
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,206
"I don't like things like this."

481
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,006
(Embarrassed)

482
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,177
Like he was breathing.

483
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:26,307
Wait, what about this?

484
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:27,777
- Yes. - A hair tie.

485
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,717
A hair tie like this.

486
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:33,287
(There are knitted hairpins too.)

487
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,616
I can get something for Na Eun.

488
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:37,757
You should buy one for Na Eun. It's adorable.

489
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,286
She has her own taste.

490
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:41,556
- She doesn't like everything. - Really?

491
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:43,896
- In the past, she liked everything. - Does she refuse it?

492
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:45,566
- Kids these days have their taste. - Right?

493
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,826
- Having her own taste is cute too. - She has her taste.

494
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,337
I want to buy a calculator.

495
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:50,737
- Which one? - A calculator.

496
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,936
(A calculator out of the blue?)

497
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,236
- Why a calculator? - Don't you have it on your phone?

498
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:56,307
No.

499
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,076
Why would you buy a calculator, Mimi?

500
00:16:58,077 --> 00:16:59,976
- Tapping. - Why would you buy it?

501
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,577
I use it when I get my allowance.

502
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,417
When I win money while playing Go-Stop.

503
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:05,887
(That's cute.)

504
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,846
These are slippers and hairpins at the same time.

505
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,587
(These are slippers and hairpins at the same time.)

506
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,327
- The look on their faces... - They aren't interested.

507
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:16,796
They aren't interested.

508
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:17,927
- By the way... - They aren't interested.

509
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,626
The look in their eyes said,

510
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:20,927
"How could he pick something like that?"

511
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,567
- I didn't know how to react. - You two are...

512
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:24,437
You two are cold today.

513
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,636
I don't think Na Eun would wear these,

514
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:28,837
but I'll give them to her anyway.

515
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:31,276
- They're slipper hairpins. - They look cute.

516
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:32,607
(The dad ends up buying what he likes.)

517
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,146
I'll buy these.

518
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:35,876
- Gosh, that's a lot. - Why are you buying so much?

519
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:37,316
These are hairpins. Just in case...

520
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,187
- They're for Na Eun. - They're for Na Eun.

521
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,016
- You're a good dad. - Oh, my.

522
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,286
- I can feel love. - I'm so jealous.

523
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:43,656
- I wish I had a daughter too. - I know.

524
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:44,816
I'll pay for everything.

525
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:45,986
- Really? - Thank you.

526
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,757
Why are you paying for everyone?

527
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:50,127
Thank you.

528
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,066
- Thank you. - Thank you.

529
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:53,296
Goodbye.

530
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:54,596
- Your shop is lovely. - Thank you.

531
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:55,697
Have a good day.

532
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,107
Where are we going now?

533
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,966
Min Kyung, you must...

534
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,436
- look carefully from now on. - Okay.

535
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,736
Starting with the first place that we're going now,

536
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:05,376
we have to figure out if it's real or fake.

537
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,447
- Okay. - I see.

538
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,417
- I'm confident. - It should be here.

539
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,517
Here's the place.

540
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:12,246
Owner Who Does This Too.

541
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:14,047
- Owner Who Does This Too? - Yes.

542
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:15,756
Over here?

543
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:17,217
"T Pork Skirt?"

544
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:18,826
- It doesn't look fake. - Are we heading there?

545
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,587
"T Pork Skirt?" Is it here?

546
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,097
(Pork Skirt)

547
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,527
(The first popular place located on Yongnidan Street)

548
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:28,367
(It has a secretive vibe.)

549
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,536
- It looks amazing. - This place is fake.

550
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:33,107
- It looks amazing. - This place is fake..

551
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,366
- Is it fake? - Min Kyung says that...

552
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,506
- it's fake. - Seriously?

553
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:36,976
- How so? - You guys are in trouble today.

554
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:38,177
What should we do?

555
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:39,877
Why do you think it's fake?

556
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:41,816
(Is it a place that a Yongsan local knows?)

557
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,177
- This place is real. - I just gave it a try.

558
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:44,777
This place is real.

559
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:45,886
I gave it a try.

560
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,447
You don't seem very sharp.

561
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:49,916
This is very old.

562
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,086
How is this maintained...

563
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,186
- By the way, the door... - This is...

564
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,757
- And the smoke. - What?

565
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:54,996
This place is fake.

566
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:56,356
- It's real. - Does it look fake?

567
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,527
Is this real?

568
00:18:58,497 --> 00:18:59,627
This place...

569
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:04,167
(Pass through the long corridor at the entrance...)

570
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:07,167
(and open the door...)

571
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,977
(A big charcoal barbecue restaurant)

572
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,606
I feel like they decorated it...

573
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,347
to make it look old.

574
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,177
It seems excessively detailed.

575
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,886
"Owner Who Does This Too?"

576
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,317
What could this be?

577
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,917
This restaurant could be real...

578
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:26,156
while the owner...

579
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,386
Whether the owner is real or fake?

580
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:28,797
Or the owner's personality...

581
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:31,196
The pig skin sounds so delicious.

582
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,567
The smell.

583
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:33,627
It smells like they ran...

584
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,737
- the restaurant until yesterday. - I'm hungry.

585
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:41,037
(A real restaurant that was running until recently?)

586
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:43,237
- Owner Who Does This Too. - This Too?

587
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:44,436
Yogurt and raw fish?

588
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:45,877
(Yogurt and raw fish?)

589
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,517
It means that he does something.

590
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:51,177
Could it be that he has 2 or 3 different jobs?

591
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,346
Could the owner be someone famous?

592
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,916
- Right. - He might do several things.

593
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,257
He has 2 or 3 different jobs.

594
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:57,586
First of all, it's a real restaurant.

595
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,156
- Yes, it's real. - The restaurant looks real.

596
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,457
- There's a lot on the menu. - I know.

597
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:05,797
(Filled with a variety of dishes)

598
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,366
What catches the attention is...

599
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,967
the green onion pork skirt.

600
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,966
(Among them, the green onion pork skirt stands out.)

601
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,006
I agree.

602
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:13,706
Let's get green onion pork skirt.

603
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:14,736
That sounds amazing.

604
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:17,006
It's unbelievable. I didn't even think of it.

605
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,477
Hello, sir. What?

606
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:20,707
Hello, sir. What?

607
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:22,177
What?

608
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,147
- What? - Gosh, you startled me.

609
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:25,987
- What? - Gosh, you startled me.

610
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:28,387
- The acorn... - What?

611
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,917
(Who could the owner be?)

612
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,657
- What? - Gosh, you startled me.

613
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:35,897
- What? - Let me put this down first.

614
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:38,096
I mean...

615
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,626
Weren't you the owner at the cafe?

616
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:40,697
That's correct.

617
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,637
(The yogurt cafe owner, the meat restaurant owner)

618
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,637
- Remember what you said? - This has to be fake.

619
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,907
(What is going on?)

620
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,406
Thank you.

621
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,607
(The Sixth Sense members left the cafe a moment ago.)

622
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:55,417
(Getting off work)

623
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,347
(Moving)

624
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:00,647
(As soon as he gets off work at the cafe)

625
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,257
(Going to work)

626
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,657
Is that why you kept standing there?

627
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,227
- So that's why. - That's why.

628
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:11,026
- Do you also run this restaurant? - Yes.

629
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,967
I had been doing work related to baking.

630
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:17,167
Then I wanted to try something else in the restaurant business.

631
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,667
- And so... - Gosh.

632
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,767
But the direction is completely different.

633
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:22,777
It must be fake.

634
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:25,646
This and bakery...

635
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,276
- They're far from each other. - They have nothing in common.

636
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:28,446
After running a bakery,

637
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,217
- he could open a dessert place. - Right.

638
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,016
Most people stick to similar businesses,

639
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:34,187
but this is a totally different field.

640
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:36,617
While running a Greek yogurt cafe,

641
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,417
I had an idea...

642
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,327
of fermenting meat with yogurt.

643
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:42,296
(I see.)

644
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:45,027
- Fermentation with yogurt? - I see.

645
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:47,326
While running a bakery cafe,

646
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:50,537
I realized that yogurt could be used in many ways.

647
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,767
I was also interested in meat restaurants.

648
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:57,707
With advice from a probiotics specialist,

649
00:21:58,177 --> 00:22:01,846
I spent three months working on meat fermentation.

650
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,717
(He developed yogurt optimized for meat fermentation.)

651
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,816
People are surprised by the taste.

652
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,316
It's quite popular.

653
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,687
(Is this strange combination real?)

654
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,716
It doesn't sound natural.

655
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:11,956
- I know. - It doesn't seem natural.

656
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,186
- Fermentation sounds possible. - Right,

657
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:15,497
but something about yogurt...

658
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:17,656
- Remember the butter pork belly? - It seems...

659
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,767
It was created by a pastry chef.

660
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,637
- Once we taste it... - We'll know once we taste it.

661
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:24,597
Will it taste like yogurt?

662
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:25,866
I'll prepare your order.

663
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:26,967
- Okay. - Okay.

664
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,436
This place seems suspicious.

665
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:30,536
- It's like he memorized his lines. - It seems fake.

666
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:32,006
He looked way too nervous...

667
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,647
about forgetting what to say.

668
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:36,447
Also, the cost of yogurt is high.

669
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:39,846
Selling pork and pig skin for ten dollars won't cover it.

670
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:44,117
The vibe of this place and pork belly fermented with yogurt...

671
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,286
- They don't match each other. - I don't think so.

672
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:49,657
- This place is more like a pub. - Right.

673
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:53,297
(Yogurt fermentation at a pub like this?)

674
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:54,367
The food is here.

675
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:55,696
I'll go to the other side.

676
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:57,367
(They're here to set the table.)

677
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:58,836
(Looking around)

678
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,636
This is what's served at a typical meat restaurant.

679
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:03,276
Is that yogurt...

680
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:04,377
on the table?

681
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:05,946
It's yogurt.

682
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,646
- This is yogurt. - You're right.

683
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,276
That's why you brought us naan.

684
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:11,517
- He gave us naan. - To dip naan in it?

685
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:12,746
Wrap meat with naan...

686
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,116
- and dip it in yogurt? - No way.

687
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:15,717
- That sounds delicious. - That sounds good.

688
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:16,886
It's called prata.

689
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:18,286
- It sounds so good. - Like kebab.

690
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:20,627
- That's how you eat kebab. - Like kebab.

691
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,526
- I think it's fake. - Why?

692
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,027
Kebab seems so out of context.

693
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:26,567
Naan came out of the blue.

694
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:28,526
(He prepares charcoal for the grill.)

695
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:29,966
- It's hot. - Okay.

696
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,096
(Staring)

697
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,506
Are you the restaurant owner?

698
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:33,867
- Yes. - Do you run it together?

699
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:35,606
(Someone suspicious appeared suddenly.)

700
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:36,707
Am I wrong?

701
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,007
Who are you?

702
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:39,646
- What's the matter? - Are you a server?

703
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:40,747
Are you the restaurant owner?

704
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:42,247
Do you also run it?

705
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:43,446
Who are you?

706
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:45,017
He must be the real restaurant owner.

707
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:47,546
He isn't answering me. I asked who he was.

708
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:48,886
Maybe he's the real restaurant owner.

709
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,217
(What's going on here?)

710
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:54,187
- This is our sixth shoot. - Yes.

711
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:55,796
We only got 1 out of 5 right.

712
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:56,926
So we have to get it right today.

713
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:59,066
The production crew didn't expect us to be this bad.

714
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:00,266
(Exclaiming)

715
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:01,467
They didn't expect us to be this bad.

716
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:12,746
What is it?

717
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:14,106
Look at this.

718
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:16,116
This can't be true.

719
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:17,317
It looks like cake.

720
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,387
(Even a Yongsan local is shocked.)

721
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:23,517
(The look of yogurt pork skirt)

722
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,887
At our restaurant, pork skirt is...

723
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:29,757
served with whole green onions.

724
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:33,967
(Green onions and pork skirt came together.)

725
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:37,096
Pork skirt is a cut near the pig's heart.

726
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:41,137
To remove its strong smell, I found out yogurt fermentation method.

727
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:44,636
As probiotics help break down protein,

728
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:47,876
it helps tenderize the meat.

729
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,776
(It removes bad odor and tenderizes the meat.)

730
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:52,716
I ferment the meat in pure yogurt for one day.

731
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,917
That's what makes it special.

732
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:59,027
(It's ready to be served after fermentation for a day.)

733
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:01,957
(A unique combination of green onion pork skirt and yogurt)

734
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:03,256
(Yogurt pork skirt is really good.)

735
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,556
(Enthusiastic reviews on social media)

736
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:06,567
This month's sales will be about 100,000 dollars.

737
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,426
Sixth Sense members,

738
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:10,037
is this place real?

739
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,406
- It's like cake. - I'll put it in the middle.

740
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,637
- Sir, this is... - What?

741
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:18,906
Do you remove the yogurt before grilling?

742
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:21,507
- So this is green onion pork skirt. - Is this it?

743
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,176
- Green onion pork skirt. - Really?

744
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,347
Green onions are whole, right?

745
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,087
- Look at that. - Do you grill it like that?

746
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:32,186
Do you grill it even though it's covered with sauce?

747
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:33,756
Yes, grill it like this.

748
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:34,757
(Surprised)

749
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,996
When the color changes clearly,

750
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:38,456
- cut it with scissors. - Cut it?

751
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:40,526
Otherwise, the green onions might fall out.

752
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:41,566
(Quiet)

753
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,767
Enjoy your food.

754
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,736
I've never seen anything like it.

755
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:47,067
In my entire life...

756
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:49,336
I've lived the longest,

757
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:50,436
and I've never seen anything like it.

758
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:51,807
- You finally accept it. - Yes.

759
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:54,277
(Oh, I forgot.)

760
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:55,347
It happens a few times a day.

761
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:56,817
- You lived over half a century. - Yes.

762
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:58,616
This one...

763
00:25:58,617 --> 00:25:59,886
It's charcoal.

764
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:00,916
It's not very cooked.

765
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,356
- We have to keep flipping it. - Exactly.

766
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:05,556
Pork skirt is a cut...

767
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,226
that takes a long time to cook.

768
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:09,397
- You have to flip it often. - Right.

769
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:11,226
- You have to keep flipping it. - Right.

770
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:13,627
Despite that, the outside gets burnt fast.

771
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,196
Usually, this is partially grilled before serving.

772
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,566
It's served completely uncooked.

773
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,336
Pork skirt is usually partially grilled before.

774
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,207
By the way, why is everyone so angry?

775
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:23,876
- Right? - They're dying to get it right.

776
00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:25,976
You're angry even before tasting it.

777
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,246
When it comes to meat,

778
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:29,716
- Korean people are sensitive. - We are.

779
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:31,376
- By the way... - Pork skirt...

780
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:33,586
He usually grills it for his customers.

781
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:35,246
- Right? - With things like asparagus...

782
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:37,587
I don't think customers can grill it.

783
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,256
- I keep thinking that this is... - How will it taste?

784
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:41,826
Made by real chefs.

785
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:44,257
- Exactly. That's what I thought. - Me too.

786
00:26:44,557 --> 00:26:45,627
Right?

787
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:48,126
It looks like something that chefs would make.

788
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:50,396
In Season One, the butter pork belly was...

789
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:51,536
real.

790
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:52,737
(Butter pork belly was a real place on Season 1.)

791
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,567
By basing on that idea,

792
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:55,806
this time...

793
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:57,376
- Yogurt pork belly? - Yes.

794
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:58,377
To be honest,

795
00:26:58,378 --> 00:26:59,976
I find green onions strange.

796
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:00,977
(She agrees.)

797
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:02,546
- It's pretending to be hip. - Instead...

798
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:03,646
Right.

799
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,016
- What? - It's pretending to be hip.

800
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,846
There's a popular grilled green onion dish.

801
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,047
- Really? - Is it a Spanish dish?

802
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,856
Everyone sounds so angry.

803
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:11,356
We have to find which is fake.

804
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:13,186
We only got 1 out of 5 correct.

805
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:14,827
- So we're sensitive today. - We're sensitive.

806
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,826
It's because we've been terrible at guessing.

807
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:18,226
Please understand us.

808
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:19,767
Can you hand me the scissors?

809
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:21,267
Mister.

810
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,936
- Mister, give me the scissors. - Is your arm too short?

811
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,937
- Mister. - You just need to stretch it out.

812
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:30,136
- Goodness. - Kyung Pyo grilled it well.

813
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,836
- I agree. - It's exactly like galbi.

814
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:33,177
This is exactly like galbi.

815
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,277
Now that it's cooked, it looks very delicious.

816
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:40,617
(The yogurt coating kept the meat moist and juicy.)

817
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:43,687
(Cooked pork skirt with whole green onions)

818
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:47,287
(When it's cut nicely into a bite with scissors)

819
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:50,426
(Green onions inside the pork skirt)

820
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:52,926
- It looks similar to tripe. - Yes.

821
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:53,927
Right.

822
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:57,236
(How does the yogurt pork skirt taste?)

823
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:58,497
- This is... - I'll try it.

824
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,266
Try and see how it tastes.

825
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:01,467
- Is it cooked? - Let's see.

826
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,537
- How is it? - It comes out.

827
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:06,277
- How is it? Is it really good? - I bet it tastes good.

828
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:07,477
Is it good?

829
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:09,477
- It must be good. - I guess it's good.

830
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:11,847
Is it incredible? How is it?

831
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:13,216
It's really good.

832
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:14,346
- Really? - Is it good?

833
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,086
Everyone changes their opinion after tasting it.

834
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:17,417
- Did you try it with green onion? - Yes.

835
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:19,126
- It looks... - The owner...

836
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:20,757
nice enough to be on social media.

837
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:23,357
- Is it good, Seok Jin? - Yes.

838
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,696
(Surprised)

839
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:27,197
- Is it good? - Yes.

840
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,197
With the green onion flavor...

841
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:31,667
I don't know if it's the yogurt, but it's very tender.

842
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:33,507
Yes, it's so tender.

843
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,707
- This is my favorite texture. - Seriously.

844
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:38,676
It tastes like pork galbi instead of yogurt.

845
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,207
(It tastes like juicy pork galbi without the taste of yogurt.)

846
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,577
- This is really good. - It's not greasy.

847
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:44,347
What's with this meat?

848
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,687
- It's very tender. - How is this meat so good?

849
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:51,086
Nicely grilled pieces look good enough...

850
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,186
- The owner... - to be on social media.

851
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:53,926
- I agree. - The owner isn't sloppy.

852
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,026
This is...

853
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,627
(Both the taste and the look are excellent.)

854
00:28:57,897 --> 00:29:01,026
It'd be strange if it wasn't popular.

855
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:02,737
The meat tastes so good.

856
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,466
The meat tastes really good.

857
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,306
I totally agree with her.

858
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:10,907
- It tastes so good. - It really does.

859
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:12,106
- I'll cut it for you. - Please cut it.

860
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:13,747
Can you just cut the green onion? It's too big.

861
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:15,917
- No. Just cut it. - Okay.

862
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:18,176
- Cut it like this? - Cut it.

863
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:19,617
(Moving about)

864
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,417
Stay still...

865
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:23,257
- so that I can cut it. - Okay.

866
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:24,887
- Wait, I'll cut it for you. - Thank you.

867
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:29,396
(Enjoying a bite thanks to Min Kyung)

868
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:31,027
(Exclaiming)

869
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:33,026
- Is this our sixth episode? - Yes.

870
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,966
Among everything we've tasted, this is the best.

871
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,197
You should work more.

872
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:38,836
(We still have many places to go.)

873
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,236
- It's too early to tell. - It's too early.

874
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,007
- It's too early. - Right.

875
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:43,336
- It's early. - We still have four more episodes.

876
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:45,536
The meat tastes so light and delicious.

877
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,146
It's so good.

878
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:49,376
- It tastes like tripe. - Yes, it's excellent.

879
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:52,247
The production crew is looking at us like...

880
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,756
- What's wrong? - They must think that we're fools.

881
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:57,187
They really want some.

882
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:02,086
(Jealous)

883
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,127
- They must want some too. - I know.

884
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:06,197
- More food is coming. - Is there more?

885
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:07,567
This is doenjang stew rice.

886
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,396
- He's serving doenjang stew rice. - For the chilly weather,

887
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:10,467
- Thank you. - this is for you.

888
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,136
(A deep flavor from the seafood broth...)

889
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:13,837
(made with Manila clams, crabs, and shrimp)

890
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:18,307
(Finishing the perfect meal with doenjang stew rice)

891
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,676
- You can find this menu... - It's tasty.

892
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:22,846
- at a tasty restaurant. - The stew rice is always good.

893
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,877
Right?

894
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:26,617
- It's tasty. - You find it at a tasty restaurant.

895
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:28,517
- I've never had it before. - It's made with crabs.

896
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,187
How does it taste?

897
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:31,687
(What?)

898
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:32,986
- What's the matter? - It's good.

899
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:34,057
It's good?

900
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,727
(It's good.)

901
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:39,566
I thought that you were doing a skit.

902
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,567
(Flustered)

903
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:42,467
"It's good."

904
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:45,266
(A skit from back then)

905
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:46,867
(He loves it.)

906
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:48,737
- Gosh, a skit... - You can't hide your age.

907
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:49,976
The comedy duo.

908
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:51,036
- Hae Ri. - It wasn't a skit.

909
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,676
- It's not what you think. - Hae Ri, isn't that it?

910
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:53,746
- No. - The comedy duo.

911
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:55,446
- I think it is. - It's delicious.

912
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,047
They're a comedy duo indeed.

913
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:01,287
"It's good."

914
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:04,087
- "It's good." - It's delicious.

915
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:05,826
Anyway, this restaurant has...

916
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,056
- too many details. - I know.

917
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:09,226
It has many suspicious aspects.

918
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,227
- Right. - It has many.

919
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:13,127
Most importantly, I'm a social media addict,

920
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:14,666
and I've never seen this before.

921
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,166
When you look up tasty restaurants, they always come up.

922
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,536
They keep coming up.

923
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:18,866
When you look up tasty restaurants in Yongsan-gu,

924
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,637
- only those in Yongsan come up. - Right.

925
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:23,576
However, I've never seen this before.

926
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,706
I think that it's real.

927
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:27,277
I think the food happened to be good.

928
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,006
(Aren't I right?)

929
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:30,616
Delicious dishes...

930
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:32,617
- that couldn't become mainstream... - Right.

931
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:34,246
- Among those they created, - After creating them...

932
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,416
- this is the second dish. - You know why? The price...

933
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,687
Did someone punch you in the stomach?

934
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:41,357
(A hard blow in the abdomen)

935
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:43,097
Hae Ri.

936
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:45,626
- Your reaction is... - Did you get a punch in the belly?

937
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:47,226
Your reaction is incredible.

938
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:48,997
You can't resist the shift of generation.

939
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:50,836
- I knew it. - Old-school comedy.

940
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:52,396
Your sense of humor comes from the old generation.

941
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:54,167
(Her sense of humor is labeled old-school.)

942
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:56,107
(Gosh, my stomach hurts.)

943
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:58,237
- Anyway, let's go. - We've gotten fooled...

944
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,947
like this so many times.

945
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:01,206
One, two, three.

946
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,476
- The food was delicious. - If this place were real...

947
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:04,717
- It was amazing. - Hey.

948
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,947
- Let's take a photo. - All right.

949
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,416
- Where shall we take the photo? - Sir, where shall we take it?

950
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,487
- Sir. - I...

951
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:12,627
- In the front... - Can't we take it at the cafe?

952
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:14,126
We can only take it here.

953
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:15,656
He keeps wanting to take it at his cafe.

954
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:17,127
- He's an expert. - At the cafe?

955
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:19,766
- He seems disappointed. - The owners don't agree.

956
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:21,326
They care more about their own place.

957
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:22,536
Why does he want to take a photo...

958
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:23,666
- at the cafe instead? - The owners are different.

959
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,697
That's exactly what I mean.

960
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,067
This place must be fake.

961
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:29,877
There's someone else in the back. He's the real restaurant owner.

962
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,036
Which one is our next?

963
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:33,076
Next is Owner with Lots of Jeju.

964
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,606
(Shall we go and meet the second owner?)

965
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,016
I'm not very experienced,

966
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,777
but based on my experience, it's very confusing.

967
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:42,346
- We have to visit all of them. - Right.

968
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:43,987
- We can't tell after the first one. - We can't tell.

969
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:45,616
It's impossible to know.

970
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,657
(What kind of real or fake popular place awaits them?)

971
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:49,697
- Do you like old city centers? - Yes.

972
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:52,226
I don't like flashy places.

973
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:53,467
- You don't? - No.

974
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:57,296
(Low buildings)

975
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:59,566
I understand why Kyung Pyo likes old city centers.

976
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,606
- Isn't this the vibe? - I love it.

977
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,836
- It's really nice. - There's an open view.

978
00:33:03,837 --> 00:33:05,677
(Namyeong-dong)

979
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:07,707
Before that, we'll go to a cafe.

980
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:09,176
- Really? - Yes.

981
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:11,277
- Okay. - Okay.

982
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:13,217
- We're here. - It's not very far.

983
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:14,787
Goodness.

984
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:16,017
(The Sixth Sense members arrived somewhere in Namyeong-dong.)

985
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:17,817
Shall we go to the cafe?

986
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:19,527
She loves cafes.

987
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,257
- What's this? - We're going into an alley.

988
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:24,456
- Oh, my. - It looks very hip.

989
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:26,696
It used to be an arcade.

990
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:27,997
(An unusual entrance to an alley beneath an old signboard)

991
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,067
Is this a film set?

992
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,667
- It looks so beautiful. - It looks really nice.

993
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:36,077
Is this the beauty of a retro vibe?

994
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:39,476
It's pretty.

995
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:41,776
(The world of wood color starts.)

996
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:42,916
- It looks beautiful here too. - It's a daisy.

997
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,777
- It's so pretty. - It's nice.

998
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,146
This is unbelievable. The street is so beautiful.

999
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,317
(Inside the unique space of a different world)

1000
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:52,056
- What is this place? - It's really nice here.

1001
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:53,656
- It's very beautiful. - Hello, sir.

1002
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:54,926
- It's pretty. - Hello.

1003
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:56,627
- He looks cool. - Even the owner looks handsome.

1004
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:58,526
- Hello. - He looks hip.

1005
00:33:58,527 --> 00:33:59,927
(You can feel his hip aura right away.)

1006
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:01,596
Sir, how long have you been running this?

1007
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:03,496
It's been five years since it opened.

1008
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:04,497
- That's quite long. - It's been a while.

1009
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:05,796
- Five years? - This place wasn't...

1010
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:07,536
like this before, was it?

1011
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:10,006
It was a market that opened...

1012
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,406
during the Japanese occupation.

1013
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:13,106
After the Japanese military withdrew,

1014
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:15,546
Korean merchants started opening shops here.

1015
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:17,047
(A remnant of early modern architecture)

1016
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,116
It feels like we traveled back to the 50s.

1017
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:20,117
- You're right. - It looks amazing.

1018
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:21,416
I didn't know about that history.

1019
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:23,857
It was built during the Japanese colonial period.

1020
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:26,426
- These walls are genuine. - Yes, they were preserved.

1021
00:34:26,427 --> 00:34:27,527
These are genuine.

1022
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:31,157
(Inside where the appearance from the past was reinterpreted)

1023
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,027
- Like the walls used back then. - Exactly.

1024
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,396
When you take photos of this alley when it's deserted,

1025
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:37,696
- the photos come out well. - They would be beautiful.

1026
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:39,267
- They look amazing. - I imagine so.

1027
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:41,766
Sir, do you roast the coffee here?

1028
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,236
- Yes, I roast the coffee beans. - He has a roasting machine.

1029
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:44,277
You're right.

1030
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:46,906
Everyone, you can choose your coffee beans.

1031
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:48,476
- I'd like the nutty flavor. - Nutty?

1032
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,316
- Me too. - I prefer the nutty flavor.

1033
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:51,416
- Me too. - I'd also like it nutty.

1034
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:52,946
Everyone wants the nutty flavor, so can we get the MV blend?

1035
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,446
- That's right. - "MV blend."

1036
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:55,546
- You know a lot about coffee beans. - You know well.

1037
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:56,956
- It's written on here. - It's written.

1038
00:34:56,957 --> 00:34:58,317
(I see.)

1039
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:00,556
It's written.

1040
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,956
I'd like an espresso...

1041
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:03,427
- with the F blend. - Okay.

1042
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:05,156
I've never had an espresso before.

1043
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:06,297
Would you like an espresso?

1044
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,796
Sir, is an espresso...

1045
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,766
- served this much? - That's right.

1046
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,636
- You drink it fast? I'd like one. - As a shot?

1047
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:13,237
- I'll make you a good one. - Please.

1048
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,507
- That sounds good. - Goodness.

1049
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,707
Seok Jin, it could make your heart beat fast.

1050
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:20,046
- I'd like an espresso too. - Let's try it.

1051
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:21,406
- Espresso? - Let's try an espresso.

1052
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,416
Three espressos with the F blend, please.

1053
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,717
- Okay. - That sounds cool.

1054
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:26,216
- What's the F blend? - You do it very well.

1055
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:28,216
How you talk is very important.

1056
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:30,116
When Min Kyung says something, it sounds very sophisticated.

1057
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:31,287
Let me try it.

1058
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,657
Can I have a sweet one?

1059
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:35,656
- Okay. - "A sweet one."

1060
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:37,957
- Is that sophisticated to you? - Don't I sound sophisticated?

1061
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:40,296
Could you recommend me a sweet drink?

1062
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:41,297
(Mimi also makes her order elegantly.)

1063
00:35:41,298 --> 00:35:43,437
(Laughing)

1064
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,066
I will get them ready for you.

1065
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:46,206
- Thank you. - We look forward to it.

1066
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:47,266
Thank you.

1067
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,707
(While the beverages are made in a sophisticated way)

1068
00:35:49,777 --> 00:35:51,276
These days, this type...

1069
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:52,806
- of vibe is really... - Right.

1070
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:54,506
A place like this would look good in photos.

1071
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:56,147
It looks amazing in photos.

1072
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:58,217
Does anyone know how to take good photos?

1073
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,517
- I'm good at taking photos. - No, you aren't.

1074
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:01,816
- I'm good. - He's terrible.

1075
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:02,856
- When it comes to composition... - Really?

1076
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:05,357
Jae Seok finds taking photos bothersome.

1077
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,026
That's true. Do you want me to take a photo of you?

1078
00:36:07,027 --> 00:36:08,386
(Yes, it's annoying.)

1079
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:09,856
- Not really. - I can't trust him at all.

1080
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:10,896
You're bad at taking photos.

1081
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,456
- I'll take a photo right now. - I'm curious.

1082
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:14,796
- I bet he takes them carelessly. - Instead of taking it directly,

1083
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,536
could you take it when I'm turning around?

1084
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:17,997
(When you're turning around?)

1085
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:20,367
(I want to do it too.)

1086
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:21,766
- I'll take a photo right now. - Instead of taking it directly...

1087
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,036
(Seok Jin who's turning...)

1088
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:26,476
(and Jae Seok who's raising it)

1089
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,676
Jae Seok, that method is outdated.

1090
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:29,677
(Absorbed)

1091
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:32,346
(While they turn diligently in an old-fashioned way)

1092
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:36,287
- Are you taking a selfie? - Hey.

1093
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:37,956
I took a selfie. It's been a while.

1094
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:39,727
He's been taking a selfie.

1095
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,957
I took a selfie. It's been a while.

1096
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,497
- Min Kyung, could you take... - You look great right now.

1097
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:46,926
He really looks like someone from the Japanese colonial period.

1098
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:49,697
(He really looks like someone from the Japanese colonial period.)

1099
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:51,696
(Japanese colonial period)

1100
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:54,007
She mocks me so elegantly.

1101
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:55,966
Doesn't he look like someone from that time period?

1102
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:57,006
(Take a look.)

1103
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,306
He's posing like someone from that time.

1104
00:36:58,307 --> 00:37:00,076
- You're right. - He seems like a person...

1105
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:01,106
- of integrity. - You're right.

1106
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:02,346
Why do I look this good?

1107
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:03,476
Isn't it great? I'll take another one.

1108
00:37:03,477 --> 00:37:04,616
You look determined.

1109
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,346
Can you pose with a bit more feeling?

1110
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:08,947
- Got it. - You were too stiff.

1111
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:11,387
Try to look more arrogant.

1112
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:13,727
How about this?

1113
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,856
- This. - Okay, that's cute.

1114
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:17,596
Doesn't this look like an old album jacket?

1115
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:18,997
It's like a remake of his song, "I Know."

1116
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:20,267
You look cute.

1117
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,796
This is cute.

1118
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:23,366
We got a shot for your new album.

1119
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,497
Why are you also taking one?

1120
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,107
I have the shot.

1121
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:27,836
Wait, he looks great!

1122
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:28,937
He looks like a prankster.

1123
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:31,977
(Taking photo after photo)

1124
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:33,247
This is cute.

1125
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,947
What's with the burst mode?

1126
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:37,246
- Look how natural this is. - He looks so good!

1127
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:38,776
- That's a great one. - Doesn't this look natural?

1128
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,216
- Doesn't he look good? - He looks amazing.

1129
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,316
- Right? - It's like an album jacket.

1130
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:42,986
Look how natural he seems.

1131
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:45,187
- I look great in this. - See how natural this is.

1132
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:47,626
- Doesn't he look great? - You look amazing!

1133
00:37:47,627 --> 00:37:48,986
- That's nice. - He looks amazing in this.

1134
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:51,226
- Can you send me this? - Sure.

1135
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,426
I took too many.

1136
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,796
How do I choose out of all 100 photos?

1137
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,196
Wait, when was the last one I took?

1138
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:56,296
Send just the two from before.

1139
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,597
- You took 100 photos? - Hey, that's ours.

1140
00:37:58,637 --> 00:38:00,736
- Espresso! - There's our espresso.

1141
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,136
- The cups are so pretty. - The cups are beautiful.

1142
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:03,276
I haven't had an espresso before.

1143
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:04,377
(All eyes are on the cute cups.)

1144
00:38:04,507 --> 00:38:06,376
The cups look like they're from Portugal.

1145
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:07,477
You're right.

1146
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:08,806
The cups are so pretty.

1147
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:09,916
(Espresso is served in adorable cups.)

1148
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:12,617
- The cups are stunning! - I know. They're beautiful.

1149
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:14,016
Hey, that looks great. What's that?

1150
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:15,547
- Mimi, did you order that? - Who ordered that?

1151
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,456
- It was me. - What's that?

1152
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:18,557
I wanted something sweet.

1153
00:38:18,987 --> 00:38:20,986
(Making itself known among the small espresso cups)

1154
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:22,087
That looks delicious!

1155
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:25,697
(Tangy and sweet, berry granita)

1156
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,367
(Trying a bite before it melts!)

1157
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,166
Try it.

1158
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,637
- Is it coffee bingsu? - It's coffee bingsu.

1159
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:32,807
Is it a bingsu?

1160
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:34,406
(Under white cream)

1161
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:35,766
- This tastes like coffee ice slush. - Yes, that.

1162
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,177
There's ice slush in there.

1163
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:40,647
I'm going to think I'm in Italy.

1164
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,606
Hold on.

1165
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:45,017
He shook his head side to side without actually smelling it.

1166
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,516
- He was faking it. - Exactly.

1167
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:50,557
He moved his head without inhaling.

1168
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:53,087
What's the matter? What is it, Seok Jin?

1169
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:54,727
(Exclaiming)

1170
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,986
Isn't it super bitter?

1171
00:38:55,987 --> 00:38:57,626
Gosh, that's strong.

1172
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,996
(Oh, no...)

1173
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:00,297
- It's acidic, isn't it? - This is really good.

1174
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:01,997
It's like poison.

1175
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:04,596
So this is what an espresso is like. I quite like it.

1176
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:05,597
(Anyone can tell he hasn't had an espresso before.)

1177
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,166
Why aren't you drinking your coffee?

1178
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,167
(You said you liked it.)

1179
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:11,206
(Why do you think I'm not drinking it?)

1180
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:12,877
I'm going to take my time.

1181
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,006
You should have what I'm having.

1182
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,077
You're right.

1183
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:18,217
I bet that's way better.

1184
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:19,916
This is the one, right? This is up your alley.

1185
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,217
(Yes!)

1186
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:23,557
(Seok Sam's such a child.)

1187
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:25,586
I should've taken a photo of him drinking the espresso.

1188
00:39:25,587 --> 00:39:26,886
Yes, take one.

1189
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:28,386
Just pretend to drink it.

1190
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:30,627
Shake your head left to right like before.

1191
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:32,827
(This time, he points!)

1192
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,096
(Ambushed while watching)

1193
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:37,336
Who are you waving at?

1194
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:38,366
(Ending it by striking an 80s pose and looking into the distance)

1195
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,236
- Why did you raise your hand? - That was cute.

1196
00:39:40,237 --> 00:39:41,937
- We have the shot. - She's got it.

1197
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:43,976
Can you delete the ones where I'm smiling widely?

1198
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:45,737
Sure. Actually, I only took photos of your hand.

1199
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,246
(Chuckling)

1200
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:49,617
She only took photos of the cup.

1201
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:52,047
She's a menace.

1202
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:54,186
- A menace? - She's quite annoying.

1203
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:55,487
Gosh, Min Kyung.

1204
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,716
- She's been like that all day. - She puts you down elegantly.

1205
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:59,416
- Yes, elegantly. - Her teasing is graceful.

1206
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,726
- I wasn't putting him down. - She does that all day long.

1207
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,957
- The cup's cute, that's all. - Seriously?

1208
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:04,527
(What's that?)

1209
00:40:04,697 --> 00:40:05,726
(Only leaving behind the cup that was so cute in Min Kyung's eyes)

1210
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:06,927
- Shall we get going? - Sure.

1211
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,527
- Are we off to a restaurant? - Yes.

1212
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,497
We're off to see the Owner with Lots of Jeju.

1213
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:12,696
The Owner with Lots of Jeju?

1214
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:14,837
I wonder what we can expect from him.

1215
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,206
Why is it "Jeju" and not talent?

1216
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,107
The Owner with Lots of Jeju.

1217
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:19,676
That must be it.

1218
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,147
- Where? - Over there.

1219
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:22,707
Dongchimi?

1220
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,676
- Hey, it's Ddolraemi. - Ddolraemi?

1221
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:27,216
- Isn't that a Jeju dialect? - In Jeju, that means...

1222
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,217
Isn't "ddolraemi..."

1223
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,447
- from the Jeju dialect? - It is.

1224
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,586
You get charcoal barbecue here.

1225
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:32,616
(A Korean charcoal barbecue place named with a Jeju dialect word)

1226
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:33,986
(Charcoal-grilled galbi)

1227
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:35,487
(Salt-grilled meat)

1228
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:38,497
(Inside)

1229
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:40,366
This is a cute establishment.

1230
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:41,427
(A clean and cozy Korean barbecue place)

1231
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:45,437
(A Jeju dialect expression that shows where the owner is from)

1232
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:46,507
Everything's new.

1233
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:48,407
Everything's new. Check it out.

1234
00:40:49,207 --> 00:40:51,637
(The restaurant seems newly opened.)

1235
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:54,477
(Who's the Owner with Lots of Jeju?)

1236
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,577
He must be from Jeju.

1237
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:58,676
There's a photo of Song Ga In.

1238
00:40:58,677 --> 00:40:59,747
- What? - Where?

1239
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:02,017
(A real photo of Song Ga In)

1240
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:04,617
(The photo zone by the door)

1241
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:06,686
There's a myth that touching it brings wealth.

1242
00:41:06,687 --> 00:41:08,487
(Wall Street, New York)

1243
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:10,597
(Photos she took traveling the world)

1244
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:14,967
(The owner is a true extrovert.)

1245
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:18,897
- This must be the owner. - "Miss Trot?"

1246
00:41:18,997 --> 00:41:20,637
- Was she on "Miss Trot?" - Trot?

1247
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:23,107
(Photos from when she competed in the show)

1248
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:25,477
I think she's a trot singer.

1249
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:28,207
The owner is a singer.

1250
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:31,747
(Does this place really exist?)

1251
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:33,916
What does "ddolraemi" mean?

1252
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:35,516
- Ddolraemi. - Of course!

1253
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:36,787
I was born there.

1254
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:39,617
I was born there, but I didn't live there much.

1255
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:43,026
- Is it from the Jeju dialect? - Yes, it means "daughter."

1256
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,127
(Ddolraemi, a Jeju dialect word for daughter)

1257
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:45,856
How was this place described exactly?

1258
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:47,966
- The Owner with Lots of Jeju. - The Owner with Lots of Jeju?

1259
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,697
From what I can tell, she's a singer.

1260
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,166
- I get it! She's from Jeju... - She's from Jeju.

1261
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,007
And she can sing, which means she's multi-talented.

1262
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,376
A singer from Jeju.

1263
00:41:56,377 --> 00:41:57,476
- That's it. - A singer from Jeju.

1264
00:41:57,477 --> 00:41:58,677
(The secret is revealed thanks to Ms. Detective.)

1265
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,777
(Coming up)

1266
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:03,477
(Startled)

1267
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:04,947
Can she actually do that?

1268
00:42:05,117 --> 00:42:06,846
(Talented)

1269
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:09,116
(With many talents)

1270
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:10,486
(The owner from Jeju)

1271
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,956
(A talented soul from Jeju Island)

1272
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:13,357
(With lots of Jeju)

1273
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:15,387
(A dish you never expected)

1274
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:17,997
- This is amazing. - Right?

1275
00:42:18,857 --> 00:42:20,096
- Hello. - Hello.

1276
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,166
Hi.

1277
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,896
(The owner enters.)

1278
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:23,997
It was her in the photos.

1279
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:25,937
It's her.

1280
00:42:25,997 --> 00:42:27,767
I'm sorry, but aren't you a singer?

1281
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:29,166
I'm a singer,

1282
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,407
- and a restaurant owner. - Right?

1283
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,376
Hi, I'm Jung Ji Won, a trot singer...

1284
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:36,517
and the owner of the Korean barbecue place.

1285
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:39,546
Growing up with my grandmother,

1286
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:41,547
I used to sing a lot of trot songs.

1287
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:44,586
It naturally made me want to become a trot singer,

1288
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:48,026
and I applied for an audition after seeing one on TV.

1289
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:49,857
I made it to the top 100,

1290
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:51,796
but it was disappointing to get eliminated immediately.

1291
00:42:51,797 --> 00:42:52,797
(Unfortunately, she got cut in the 1st round.)

1292
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:55,296
Still, I didn't want to give up on that dream,

1293
00:42:55,297 --> 00:42:57,096
so while I was working at my dad's restaurant...

1294
00:42:57,097 --> 00:42:58,097
(She worked at her dad's Korean barbecue restaurant in Jeju.)

1295
00:42:58,098 --> 00:42:59,466
I saved up enough money.

1296
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:02,637
(She saved every bit she could to pursue her dream.)

1297
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:05,576
I thought working in Seoul...

1298
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:08,776
would make it easier for me to continue as a trot singer,

1299
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:09,946
so I moved here.

1300
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,116
(She left Jeju and opened...)

1301
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,247
(a Korean barbecue restaurant in Yongsan.)

1302
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:14,116
It opened on August 18.

1303
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:15,247
(It only opened 2 months ago.)

1304
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:18,087
(I see...)

1305
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:19,856
When did you start out as a singer?

1306
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:22,326
I started out as a singer in 2023.

1307
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:24,656
- It hasn't been that long. - Yes, it's only been two years.

1308
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:27,126
- You only just got started. - You took a photo with Song Ga In.

1309
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:28,127
(How do you know Song Ga In?)

1310
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:30,636
(The two seem close.)

1311
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:33,836
I once released a digital single album,

1312
00:43:33,837 --> 00:43:36,576
and that got me a chance to be on a TV show.

1313
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:38,577
That's when we took the photo.

1314
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:42,046
A digital single. So, you only released one song?

1315
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:43,976
Yes, just one. Can I sing it for you?

1316
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:45,017
Sure thing.

1317
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,547
- Will she sing it live? - Right here?

1318
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,247
(Excited)

1319
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:50,717
- Are you going to sing for us? - That's right.

1320
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:51,957
- Really? - Yes.

1321
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:55,226
- Please clap along. - Sure.

1322
00:43:55,227 --> 00:43:56,827
("Welcome")

1323
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:57,956
(Swinging)

1324
00:43:57,957 --> 00:43:58,957
(Swaying)

1325
00:43:58,958 --> 00:43:59,967
She's adorable.

1326
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:02,067
(This is so much fun.)

1327
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:04,496
Here we go.

1328
00:44:04,497 --> 00:44:05,766
("Welcome" by Jung Ji Won, An autobiographical song...)

1329
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,107
(about leaving Jeju for Seoul to chase big dreams)

1330
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:09,307
Three, four.

1331
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:12,576
(With the Jeju wind on my back)

1332
00:44:12,577 --> 00:44:15,677
(I made my way to Seoul)

1333
00:44:17,817 --> 00:44:19,277
(There you go!)

1334
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,317
- To "Welcome," say "Yes." - Got it.

1335
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:25,257
(Welcome)

1336
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:31,357
(Singing her heart out at a Korean barbecue place)

1337
00:44:31,827 --> 00:44:34,826
(Dance moves that line up with the lyrics)

1338
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:37,436
(Senior trot singer Yu San Seul is enjoying every second of it.)

1339
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:39,737
(Jihwaja!)

1340
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:43,037
(Singing without looking at the audience)

1341
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,176
- Ms. Jung. - Yes?

1342
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:47,047
The lyrics are bold,

1343
00:44:47,277 --> 00:44:49,676
- but you're being so shy. - With hands above your heads

1344
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:53,317
(Still, she ends it on a confident note.)

1345
00:44:53,517 --> 00:44:55,086
(Good job!)

1346
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:56,486
Of course she'd be nervous.

1347
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:58,016
- Ms. Jung. - I bet you were nervous.

1348
00:44:58,017 --> 00:44:59,657
I grew up watching "Infinite Challenge," you see.

1349
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:01,856
I wasn't this nervous during my audition,

1350
00:45:01,857 --> 00:45:02,886
- but... - Really?

1351
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:03,896
Jae Seok, I blame you.

1352
00:45:03,897 --> 00:45:05,626
I wouldn't have been as nervous if you were sitting here.

1353
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:07,027
- What? - What does that make me?

1354
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,496
It's your fault, Jae Seok.

1355
00:45:09,497 --> 00:45:11,097
(The issue was with the seating.)

1356
00:45:11,337 --> 00:45:12,867
(We're sorry.)

1357
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:14,407
Didn't you grow up watching "Running Man?"

1358
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:17,807
- Big Nose, I'm a huge fan. - It's all right.

1359
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:22,806
Anyway, the owner is in the entertainment industry.

1360
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:25,376
- That's right. - But just opening a restaurant...

1361
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:26,476
won't get her immediate attention.

1362
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:27,616
- Exactly. - The food must taste good.

1363
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:29,287
There must be a special dish.

1364
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:32,556
Why don't you go ahead and figure out what it is.

1365
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:33,727
- Really? - Is it a quiz?

1366
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,997
- This is it. The matcha. - Matcha galbitang.

1367
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:39,326
- Is this it? - Matcha.

1368
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:41,226
- Matcha's all the rage right now. - Matcha. Yes, of course.

1369
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:43,797
(Jeju matcha galbitang, 25 dollars)

1370
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,536
- Jeju matcha? - Matcha galbitang.

1371
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:46,837
(It makes sense since the owner's from Jeju.)

1372
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:49,137
(How far have you experimented with matcha?)

1373
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:51,907
(A worldwide craze for matcha)

1374
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:53,446
(Matcha cake)

1375
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:54,906
(Matcha tteokbokki)

1376
00:45:54,907 --> 00:45:56,477
(Matcha pasta)

1377
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:58,777
(Matcha fever is taking over everywhere.)

1378
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:02,546
Since this is a business district, I needed a lunch special.

1379
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:04,317
I thought about my options,

1380
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:06,626
and because matcha is all the rage...

1381
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:09,526
among young people, I came up with matcha galbitang.

1382
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,427
That's how I released matcha galbitang.

1383
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:15,826
Matcha is all the rage right now, but...

1384
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:17,997
But matcha in galbitang?

1385
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:21,436
- I think it'll be too sweet. - Actually, this makes sense.

1386
00:46:21,437 --> 00:46:22,706
- How so? - Think about...

1387
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:24,536
what we end our meals with at Japanese restaurants.

1388
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,036
Something fried is placed on rice. Right, an ochazuke.

1389
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:27,047
An ochazuke.

1390
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:28,776
Green tea is poured over rice.

1391
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:29,777
(Ochazuke, a dish of rice steeped in matcha tea)

1392
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,577
(Just like Korea's barley gulbi)

1393
00:46:32,747 --> 00:46:36,587
(Matcha tea is used in many dishes.)

1394
00:46:36,787 --> 00:46:38,686
This is like jumping on the bandwagon.

1395
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:41,286
But these days, unless you follow what's trending,

1396
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:43,286
you end up falling behind. So first...

1397
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:45,157
Are you just going to squash my opinion?

1398
00:46:45,557 --> 00:46:46,597
(He's only joking.)

1399
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:47,926
(Watching "Infinite Challenge" toughened her up.)

1400
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:49,566
I urge you to get on the bandwagon.

1401
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:50,567
(Edgy)

1402
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:53,766
- Yes, let's do it. - It might be fun.

1403
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,106
Got it.

1404
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:56,307
- I hear you, Ms. Jung. - Spoken like a zoomer.

1405
00:46:56,537 --> 00:46:58,637
- But... - Okay, then. Ms. Jung.

1406
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:00,676
It's supposed to be 28 dollars. Why are you charging 25 dollars?

1407
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,277
(What's the reason behind the 3-dollar discount?)

1408
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:05,246
It's an opening event.

1409
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:06,746
(Impressed)

1410
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:08,717
It's an opening event.

1411
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:11,817
- It's an opening event. - That's fun.

1412
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:14,427
(The boomer is flustered.)

1413
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,586
This and...

1414
00:47:15,587 --> 00:47:16,696
- She's relaxed. - this.

1415
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:18,697
(Full of Generation MZ-style reactions)

1416
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:21,267
- They point their hands upward. - They point upward.

1417
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:23,736
- You're right. - I told you.

1418
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:25,266
You kept making downward gestures.

1419
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,467
(His reaction droops downward.)

1420
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:28,667
(Like this.)

1421
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:30,406
(He can't hide...)

1422
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:31,837
(his old gestures.)

1423
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,507
(Physically low reactions)

1424
00:47:34,747 --> 00:47:35,776
All the way down.

1425
00:47:35,777 --> 00:47:36,976
(Mimicking Big Nose)

1426
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:38,816
(Feeling bitter)

1427
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:41,317
You should do it up here.

1428
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,346
For this restaurant,

1429
00:47:43,347 --> 00:47:45,317
we need to try the food and decide.

1430
00:47:45,357 --> 00:47:46,826
Honestly, it doesn't appeal to me.

1431
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:48,826
- Can I say it tastes bad if it is? - Sure. You know,

1432
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:51,296
customers around Seok Jin's age...

1433
00:47:51,297 --> 00:47:52,297
ask, "What's this?"

1434
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:54,127
How old do you think he is?

1435
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:57,237
(He suddenly asks her a question.)

1436
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,067
(Grinning)

1437
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:01,037
(Overbearing)

1438
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:02,937
(Making an eye contact)

1439
00:48:05,477 --> 00:48:07,076
In his 40s?

1440
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:08,247
You're right.

1441
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:11,417
(You're right.)

1442
00:48:11,877 --> 00:48:13,277
The food looks delicious.

1443
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:15,116
(She convinces him successfully.)

1444
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:17,186
- The owner is... - She's talented.

1445
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:18,286
- definitely talented. - She is.

1446
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:19,756
You're witty.

1447
00:48:19,757 --> 00:48:20,757
(The owner is the king of sales.)

1448
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:22,487
You'll get a lot of regular customers.

1449
00:48:22,657 --> 00:48:24,356
- I'll get it ready. - Let us try.

1450
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:25,957
This is a bit...

1451
00:48:26,227 --> 00:48:28,096
Even if someone else took me here,

1452
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:29,767
I wouldn't order it.

1453
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:32,337
As soon as she left...

1454
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:34,206
(He changes his attitude in 0.1 second.)

1455
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,337
You started talking immediately.

1456
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:37,376
You were clapping her hands.

1457
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:38,736
You high fived her.

1458
00:48:38,737 --> 00:48:41,606
For those that are fake,

1459
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:43,746
they make fake menus.

1460
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:45,417
(The staff adds fake menus to existing restaurants.)

1461
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:47,216
- It's perfect for that. - And matcha...

1462
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:48,646
- seems perfect for it. - It's perfect.

1463
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:49,786
It feels like a chef came up with it.

1464
00:48:49,787 --> 00:48:51,056
- It's here. - It's here.

1465
00:48:51,057 --> 00:48:53,116
The menu itself is something she could've come up with herself.

1466
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:54,756
At the early stage of her business,

1467
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:57,596
she could've developed it with passion.

1468
00:48:57,597 --> 00:48:59,697
- She could've since she's a zoomer. - Matcha is...

1469
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:00,926
From what I know,

1470
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,366
there's not enough matcha supply...

1471
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:03,397
- nowadays. - That's right.

1472
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:05,896
Because it's so popular globally.

1473
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:07,737
Globally, really. You're right.

1474
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:09,866
She said she used Osulloc matcha.

1475
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,407
(The owner uses matcha from a large company.)

1476
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:14,176
So I'm not sure how sustainable...

1477
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:15,446
it will be...

1478
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:17,046
to use it on food.

1479
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:18,276
That's an important point.

1480
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:19,476
- It's too highly in demand. - Yes.

1481
00:49:19,477 --> 00:49:21,016
Korean matcha became so popular too.

1482
00:49:21,017 --> 00:49:23,417
They add it to mayonnaise.

1483
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:26,078
(Eyes opening wide)

1484
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:27,956
(At that moment, )

1485
00:49:27,957 --> 00:49:30,027
(matcha galbitang arrives.)

1486
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:33,027
(Eyes opening wide)

1487
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:35,026
- Is it green? - It's not green.

1488
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:36,526
- It doesn't look green. - She could've added just a bit.

1489
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:38,197
- It's not green. - This...

1490
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:43,636
- She could've added just a bit. - This is 25 dollars?

1491
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:45,107
I don't think you added matcha, ma'am.

1492
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:48,406
It won't be fun if I served matcha galbitang as is.

1493
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:50,247
We have a performance ready.

1494
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:52,347
(A performance?)

1495
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:54,316
- You have it. - I have it.

1496
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,487
You can't survive without one.

1497
00:49:56,547 --> 00:49:59,117
There aren't too many ingredients.

1498
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:00,456
It's very simple.

1499
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:02,587
Potatoes and meat. That's all.

1500
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:05,896
Since our signature menu is ribs,

1501
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:07,126
we have not-so-pretty leftover parts...

1502
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:09,166
that are cut out from the big chunk.

1503
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,167
(Leftover parts which are a waste to throw away)

1504
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,036
I decided to add more back ribs to it...

1505
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:14,836
and make pork galbitang out of it.

1506
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:16,367
That's how I came up with the menu.

1507
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:18,707
(Pour water onto pork that was boiled once.)

1508
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,907
I add potatoes cut into big chunks.

1509
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,377
(Add whole garlic, ginger, and radish for the soup.)

1510
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:28,047
I stack up the back ribs high like a dome.

1511
00:50:28,217 --> 00:50:30,787
(Pour the broth made using back ribs.)

1512
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:34,827
(Clear galbitang is ready.)

1513
00:50:34,927 --> 00:50:36,427
It's very simple.

1514
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:38,226
- So it looks... - If it was...

1515
00:50:38,227 --> 00:50:39,326
made by a chef,

1516
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,396
- it would've been a lot flashier. - That's right.

1517
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:42,726
- She has a performance. - It would've been a lot flashier.

1518
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:44,967
- A performance? - Yes, a performance.

1519
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:46,467
We must check how it's done.

1520
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:49,267
Here she comes.

1521
00:50:50,577 --> 00:50:51,877
She's going to do that?

1522
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:53,507
What...

1523
00:50:54,277 --> 00:50:55,677
This is the performance.

1524
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:58,247
- She'll whisk it right here. - What...

1525
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:01,717
(Whisking: The act of making the foam to drink matcha)

1526
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:03,887
I pour hot water...

1527
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:06,356
onto Jeju matcha we use.

1528
00:51:06,357 --> 00:51:07,527
(Add hot water.)

1529
00:51:07,757 --> 00:51:09,827
I use the whisk to whisk it.

1530
00:51:10,257 --> 00:51:12,757
(Mixed finely)

1531
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:15,527
(Green Jeju matcha)

1532
00:51:16,227 --> 00:51:18,767
(Pour it on galbitang.)

1533
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:21,737
(It went viral on social media.)

1534
00:51:22,067 --> 00:51:24,577
(Matcha galbitang)

1535
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:26,876
After adding matcha galbitang to the menu,

1536
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:29,107
we're earning 1,000 dollars more each day.

1537
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:31,116
Sixth Sense members,

1538
00:51:31,117 --> 00:51:32,976
is this place real?

1539
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:34,247
(Sixth Sense members, is this place real?)

1540
00:51:34,347 --> 00:51:36,017
(Confused)

1541
00:51:36,347 --> 00:51:37,717
This looks way too fake.

1542
00:51:38,187 --> 00:51:39,486
- It... - Now it's...

1543
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,957
(The whisking performance looks suspicious.)

1544
00:51:42,257 --> 00:51:43,586
Won't it be bothersome?

1545
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:45,496
Exactly. To do this every time...

1546
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:46,956
If you don't do this much nowadays,

1547
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:48,297
you can't garner people's attention.

1548
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:49,766
- Is this for marketing purpose? - Yes. When I do this,

1549
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:51,766
the customers whip out their phones immediately.

1550
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:53,267
(The performance makes people want to film it.)

1551
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:56,667
(Matcha mixed finely from the whisking)

1552
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,206
I'll pour it.

1553
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:00,007
(It enters galbitang.)

1554
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:02,347
You pour it into the soup?

1555
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:05,047
(Falling onto the clear broth...)

1556
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:07,587
(and giving you a boost of green dopamine)

1557
00:52:07,717 --> 00:52:10,557
(The taste of Generation MZ, matcha galbitang)

1558
00:52:10,617 --> 00:52:12,756
It now looks like seaweed fulvescens soup.

1559
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:14,487
- You're right. The color. - The color.

1560
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:17,257
(It looks similar...)

1561
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:19,856
(to the green seaweed fulvescens soup.)

1562
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:21,827
It doesn't look too strange.

1563
00:52:22,027 --> 00:52:23,397
It smells amazing.

1564
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:25,096
I want to try the soup.

1565
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:26,167
(How does the soup taste?)

1566
00:52:26,637 --> 00:52:29,807
(He takes a sip of the soup first.)

1567
00:52:31,437 --> 00:52:32,976
(He takes another sip right after.)

1568
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:34,577
It's light and nice.

1569
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:35,706
It's tasty.

1570
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:38,647
(Seok Jin was hostile toward matcha.)

1571
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,417
It's delicious.

1572
00:52:40,987 --> 00:52:42,517
I think I'll come back for it.

1573
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:44,286
Really?

1574
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:45,717
(What's with him?)

1575
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:47,157
Because...

1576
00:52:47,857 --> 00:52:49,987
it's not too strong. I like how it's mild.

1577
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:52,027
I also like its light taste.

1578
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:55,067
It's mild, just how I like it.

1579
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:56,666
It isn't oily at all.

1580
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:57,897
(The mild taste of matcha and the light taste of galbitang)

1581
00:52:58,197 --> 00:52:59,566
Thank you.

1582
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,906
Try it. How is it?

1583
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,836
- Try it. - It smells like...

1584
00:53:02,837 --> 00:53:04,936
- ordinary Korean dish. - I want to add sujebi into it.

1585
00:53:04,937 --> 00:53:06,107
- Exactly. - Really?

1586
00:53:06,337 --> 00:53:07,677
I thought so too.

1587
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:11,117
(Drinking from the plate)

1588
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:13,617
How is it?

1589
00:53:14,547 --> 00:53:16,086
Why does it have a bitter aftertaste?

1590
00:53:16,087 --> 00:53:17,356
- Really? - It's fine for me.

1591
00:53:17,357 --> 00:53:18,716
I don't think she calculated...

1592
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,086
- the amount she needed to add. - She added too much, right?

1593
00:53:20,087 --> 00:53:22,157
I think she just played it by ear.

1594
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:24,326
(Just now)

1595
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:25,756
(When she added matcha, )

1596
00:53:25,757 --> 00:53:28,667
(Hae Ri observed carefully.)

1597
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,067
(Did the owner add the wrong amount?)

1598
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:32,466
It's not bad,

1599
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:34,567
but it doesn't taste amazing.

1600
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,167
Same here. I don't feel the urge to keep eating it.

1601
00:53:37,537 --> 00:53:40,107
(What about Mimi, the zoomer of Sixth Sense?)

1602
00:53:41,307 --> 00:53:43,147
- It's delicious. - It's not bad.

1603
00:53:43,347 --> 00:53:44,846
You're one of the zoomers that like it.

1604
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,147
- I think so. - It's nice.

1605
00:53:46,347 --> 00:53:47,446
I like clear soup...

1606
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:48,987
- over spicy soup. - Me too.

1607
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:51,316
Even for spicy fish stew, I sometimes prefer...

1608
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:52,816
- the mild version. - Yes.

1609
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:54,587
- That... - It's nice.

1610
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,356
You can't stop until you finish it.

1611
00:53:56,357 --> 00:53:58,357
(You keep craving it because it doesn't taste strong.)

1612
00:53:58,457 --> 00:54:00,827
- You either like it or dislike it. - That's right.

1613
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:02,126
Those who like this...

1614
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:03,496
will come back for it.

1615
00:54:03,497 --> 00:54:04,537
- It's a bit... - Yes.

1616
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:07,096
I guess you could compare it to Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1617
00:54:07,097 --> 00:54:08,166
(The black sheep of galbitang)

1618
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,866
Because it's matcha galbitang,

1619
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:11,036
I thought it'd cater...

1620
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:12,176
- to younger people's tastes. - No.

1621
00:54:12,177 --> 00:54:14,207
You and I like it.

1622
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:16,447
I like it. It's nice and warm.

1623
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:17,776
Let me try the meat, then.

1624
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:19,646
- I should try the meat. - Try the meat.

1625
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,116
- Try the meat. - Give her the one inside.

1626
00:54:21,117 --> 00:54:22,547
- The one inside. - Cut it using the scissors.

1627
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,686
(Soaked in matcha, )

1628
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:26,757
(so it's green outside.)

1629
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:29,657
Some of them are already separated from the bones.

1630
00:54:30,857 --> 00:54:32,957
(Eating the meat)

1631
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:35,997
(Humming)

1632
00:54:38,597 --> 00:54:40,837
(Taking a big bite)

1633
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,677
(Nodding)

1634
00:54:45,437 --> 00:54:49,677
(Kyung Pyo holds it in his hand and bites the meat off.)

1635
00:54:49,777 --> 00:54:52,277
The meat is so tender and nice.

1636
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,647
(Mild matcha galbitang, is it real?)

1637
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:58,587
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok can't stop eating.)

1638
00:54:58,757 --> 00:54:59,816
I like it.

1639
00:54:59,817 --> 00:55:01,887
- You're eating so well. - It's delicious.

1640
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:03,326
I really like it.

1641
00:55:03,327 --> 00:55:04,557
This is so good.

1642
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,356
Have some chives.

1643
00:55:06,357 --> 00:55:07,466
(Friendship blooms over matcha galbitang.)

1644
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:09,927
Did these two come here by themselves?

1645
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:12,697
Seok Jin, have some chives.

1646
00:55:13,497 --> 00:55:14,766
Doesn't it feel like...

1647
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,466
we were dragged here when we didn't want to?

1648
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:17,537
(It feels like they're forced to be here.)

1649
00:55:17,637 --> 00:55:18,706
We had to follow the directors.

1650
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:20,676
- They insisted on coming here. - This is...

1651
00:55:20,677 --> 00:55:23,107
The two superiors are driving you crazy.

1652
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,616
Do you now understand why I wanted to come here?

1653
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,786
- It's so delicious. - It's amazing.

1654
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:29,346
Senior Manager Kang, why won't you eat up?

1655
00:55:29,347 --> 00:55:30,516
Are you not hungry?

1656
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:32,486
- It's nice to see you eat well. - It's so good.

1657
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:34,326
- It's amazing. - I understand now.

1658
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:35,626
- I feel refreshed. - Why won't you eat?

1659
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,086
- Eat up. - I'm eating.

1660
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,897
(The younger staff members don't seem to like it.)

1661
00:55:39,097 --> 00:55:40,767
It's so nice.

1662
00:55:40,997 --> 00:55:42,566
Right?

1663
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:44,467
- Director Yu, you're... - Excuse me.

1664
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:47,066
(What's wrong, Director Yu?)

1665
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:49,206
Excuse me. I'm your superior at work.

1666
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,466
(I'm your superior at work!)

1667
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:51,736
I'm your superior at work.

1668
00:55:51,737 --> 00:55:53,207
(A plot twist)

1669
00:55:53,407 --> 00:55:54,677
I'm sorry.

1670
00:55:55,307 --> 00:55:56,406
Oh, dear.

1671
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:58,177
(Feeling the secondhand embarrassment)

1672
00:55:58,377 --> 00:55:59,716
I didn't know that.

1673
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:01,016
I just assumed since I'm older.

1674
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:02,086
- I'm sorry, Director. - Senior Manager Jee,

1675
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:03,146
you must be very drunk.

1676
00:56:03,147 --> 00:56:04,657
I'm a senior manager?

1677
00:56:04,857 --> 00:56:06,656
- My apologies. - Senior Manager Jee.

1678
00:56:06,657 --> 00:56:08,156
- Don't make such mistakes. - Sober up.

1679
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,726
I feel so suffocated in this atmosphere.

1680
00:56:10,727 --> 00:56:12,257
(Let's just not eat together.)

1681
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:14,597
- You guys eat really well. - But you know...

1682
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:16,197
I really like it.

1683
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:18,036
-This is real. - I really like it.

1684
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:19,397
(Director and Senior Manager are in love with matcha.)

1685
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,566
- I think it's fake. - Why?

1686
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,337
You say that after eating it so well?

1687
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:27,507
What if it's like ice cream tteokbokki?

1688
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:30,976
They placed ice cream on tteokbokki.

1689
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:32,017
Yes, they did.

1690
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:33,946
(It's fake here.)

1691
00:56:33,947 --> 00:56:37,457
(Could this be another fake combo that only looks real?)

1692
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:39,716
But doesn't yogurt pork skirt resemble...

1693
00:56:39,717 --> 00:56:41,886
ice cream tteokbokki more in that sense?

1694
00:56:41,887 --> 00:56:44,597
Can you remove this from your list? I really like it.

1695
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,526
Ice cream tteokbokki...

1696
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:48,567
Why are you forcing her to remove it?

1697
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:50,327
I was wondering what he was going to say.

1698
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:52,737
- This is real. - Ice cream...

1699
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:55,907
Aren't you making it too personal?

1700
00:56:56,407 --> 00:57:00,107
I'm not a big fan of matcha,

1701
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:01,876
so I was skeptical of it.

1702
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:05,076
But adding matcha in it lessens the greasy taste.

1703
00:57:05,077 --> 00:57:06,177
The aftertaste is clear.

1704
00:57:07,377 --> 00:57:09,886
I was looking forward to it before I ate it.

1705
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,356
I thought it made sense.

1706
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:13,716
But when I tried it, the taste was a bit iffy.

1707
00:57:13,717 --> 00:57:15,226
- Is this necessary? - Exactly. Is this necessary?

1708
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,756
- Why... Competitiveness... - It would've still tasted good...

1709
00:57:16,757 --> 00:57:17,796
without matcha.

1710
00:57:17,797 --> 00:57:19,657
If it's about competitiveness,

1711
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:22,967
she should've put up a fancier performance.

1712
00:57:23,297 --> 00:57:25,397
But it ended so fast.

1713
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,367
Will people react favorably to the uploaded video?

1714
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,107
I don't think so.

1715
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:32,077
You seem to be very angry.

1716
00:57:33,377 --> 00:57:35,277
- You are quite angry. - She might hear you.

1717
00:57:35,477 --> 00:57:37,446
(I'm sorry.)

1718
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:39,147
- She might hear you. - Yes.

1719
00:57:39,277 --> 00:57:40,316
"Will it?"

1720
00:57:40,317 --> 00:57:41,516
(A terrible reenactment)

1721
00:57:41,517 --> 00:57:42,517
"That's right."

1722
00:57:42,518 --> 00:57:44,517
(Embarrassed)

1723
00:57:45,557 --> 00:57:47,316
- You... - I was too into it.

1724
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,856
I really like your attitude.

1725
00:57:48,857 --> 00:57:50,256
That's how you reveal the truth.

1726
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:51,426
You look cool...

1727
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,596
- when you're focused on work. - I am.

1728
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:54,327
- I'm completely immersed in it. - You're immersed in it.

1729
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:55,966
Before we actually end up fighting,

1730
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,166
- let's stop talking. - The conversation isn't going well.

1731
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,266
We don't think alike on this one.

1732
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,566
We went along well before.

1733
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:01,637
(Owner with Lots of Jeju: A fake menu based on the trend?)

1734
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:04,276
We'll only be sure once we arrive at the last place.

1735
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:05,277
I agree.

1736
00:58:05,877 --> 00:58:08,777
Next is, "Owner of Meat Restaurant with Lots of Smoke."

1737
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:12,146
I think that's a wordplay too.

1738
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:13,416
- The owner might be an actor. - Exactly.

1739
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:15,087
- Acts as in acting. - An actor?

1740
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,117
- That could be it. - That might be the case.

1741
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,216
He's a stage actor.

1742
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:18,217
(That sounds plausible.)

1743
00:58:18,218 --> 00:58:19,387
Smoke as in stage smoke effect.

1744
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:21,026
For the second place, it had the drawing...

1745
00:58:21,027 --> 00:58:22,156
of Dolhareubang of Jeju Island, right?

1746
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:23,256
- Yes. - On the map.

1747
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:24,756
(The keywords are the key to finding the fake today.)

1748
00:58:24,757 --> 00:58:27,297
"Owner with Lots of Jeju" had Dolhareubang.

1749
00:58:27,727 --> 00:58:30,026
"Owner Who Does This Too" had another drawing.

1750
00:58:30,027 --> 00:58:31,336
- Right? - Is that so?

1751
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:32,367
"Is that so?"

1752
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:34,606
I don't actually speak like that, do I?

1753
00:58:34,607 --> 00:58:35,906
- You actually do. - You actually do.

1754
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:36,966
You speak like this.

1755
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:38,177
- Really? - Yes.

1756
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,176
- I love it. - I'm so stressed.

1757
00:58:40,177 --> 00:58:41,346
- It's stressful. - I'm stressed.

1758
00:58:41,347 --> 00:58:42,347
(Her clones are everywhere.)

1759
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:44,206
Look at how she put tape behind her ears.

1760
00:58:44,207 --> 00:58:45,846
- What? - Isn't it cute? Behind her ears.

1761
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:47,416
(Mimi used her ear tape today too.)

1762
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:48,986
Why did she paste it? Is it for motion sickness?

1763
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:50,816
No, to make her ears...

1764
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:52,317
- To lean them forward. - lean forward.

1765
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:55,356
It makes you look younger.

1766
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:56,756
There's a tape for this.

1767
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:57,897
- Making your ears lean forward. - I heard about it.

1768
00:58:58,027 --> 00:58:59,126
You should do it too.

1769
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:01,226
- I don't like stuff like that. - You should do it as Young Fifty.

1770
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:02,566
It feels too strange.

1771
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,196
- Shall I give you one? - No.

1772
00:59:04,197 --> 00:59:06,037
- I have a lot. - Doing this would feel strange.

1773
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,266
I heard there was a tape which makes your ears...

1774
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:11,037
- lean forward. - Yes.

1775
00:59:11,577 --> 00:59:13,176
That's what Mimi used.

1776
00:59:13,177 --> 00:59:14,976
- That's what we're talking about. - I'm using it now.

1777
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:16,907
- That's what we're talking about. - You're using it now?

1778
00:59:17,277 --> 00:59:19,017
(Seeing it for the first time)

1779
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,486
- You didn't know? - All this while.

1780
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:22,947
He doesn't pay attention to what others say.

1781
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:24,416
But this is too much.

1782
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,987
- They're like yours. - You know what?

1783
00:59:26,217 --> 00:59:28,726
His ears are stuck flat to his head.

1784
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:30,526
People with such ears don't listen to others.

1785
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:32,027
- Really? - They don't listen to others.

1786
00:59:32,457 --> 00:59:34,826
- He doesn't listen at all. - I tend not to listen to others.

1787
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:36,726
- If you speak like this... - You don't listen to others either.

1788
00:59:36,727 --> 00:59:37,997
(Suddenly getting angry)

1789
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:40,166
- My ears are wide open. - You still don't listen.

1790
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:41,366
- That's odd. - What's happening?

1791
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,337
- "That's odd." - You said you wouldn't get angry.

1792
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:44,776
I'm not angry.

1793
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:46,137
- You seem to be very angry. - I'm not.

1794
00:59:46,337 --> 00:59:47,707
It's a bit hot.

1795
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:49,476
It's true I don't listen to others.

1796
00:59:49,477 --> 00:59:50,707
I think so too.

1797
00:59:51,347 --> 00:59:54,016
Did you know we were a great fan of yours?

1798
00:59:54,017 --> 00:59:55,147
- Really? - Yes.

1799
00:59:55,447 --> 00:59:57,687
Jong Kook and Seok Jin...

1800
00:59:57,987 --> 01:00:00,356
- were in a cafe. - Yes.

1801
01:00:00,357 --> 01:00:03,027
We went to say hello.

1802
01:00:03,427 --> 01:00:05,426
You know this kind of action?

1803
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:07,056
He did that, and it looked so cool.

1804
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:08,767
- Really? - Yes, for real.

1805
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:10,067
Really?

1806
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:13,896
Did you discuss this with me?

1807
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:15,966
(The other Davichi member has no clue what she's saying.)

1808
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:17,166
Will you keep quiet?

1809
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:18,576
- Min Kyung. - Hae Ri.

1810
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:20,837
At moments like this, just don't say anything.

1811
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:22,646
Min Kyung didn't feel...

1812
01:00:22,647 --> 01:00:24,276
comfortable enough to say it was her story.

1813
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:25,647
- I think that's the case. - You...

1814
01:00:25,817 --> 01:00:28,186
But you were really fun and cool,

1815
01:00:28,187 --> 01:00:29,887
so we talked with you for quite long.

1816
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:32,357
I don't think it's a "we."

1817
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:34,957
- "Did you discuss this with me?" - She doesn't think so.

1818
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:37,087
We're here.

1819
01:00:37,657 --> 01:00:39,257
We must be going to Gyeongnidan Street.

1820
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:41,527
(You can see Mount Nam from here.)

1821
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:45,267
(A foreign vibe...)

1822
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,267
(and full of unique hot spots which are popular on social media)

1823
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:51,837
(The original hot spot, Gyeongnidan Street)

1824
01:00:52,207 --> 01:00:54,507
There are a lot of hip places...

1825
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:57,247
- in each and every alley. - That's right.

1826
01:00:57,877 --> 01:00:59,347
We're going to a back alley.

1827
01:01:00,317 --> 01:01:01,747
- Amazing. - Behind here is...

1828
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,856
I've never been to all the way back here.

1829
01:01:04,857 --> 01:01:06,387
(The last hot spot is in a back alley?)

1830
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:09,126
We come to this neighborhood very often.

1831
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:10,257
- Really? - Yes.

1832
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:13,126
- Have you been on this street? - Yes, I have.

1833
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,827
You know every place.

1834
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:16,227
But...

1835
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:19,597
There's a smoke meat place here?

1836
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:21,907
- It's acting. - An actor?

1837
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:23,307
- I think so. - An actor.

1838
01:01:24,437 --> 01:01:27,077
(Walk up the uphill street all the way.)

1839
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:30,047
It's this alley.

1840
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:35,047
(Unusual props welcome its guests.)

1841
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:38,987
(Who is the owner of this place?)

1842
01:01:39,357 --> 01:01:40,357
(Looking around)

1843
01:01:40,358 --> 01:01:41,387
- It's here. - This place...

1844
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:43,557
This is a meat restaurant?

1845
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:45,226
- Where's this place? - I don't know.

1846
01:01:45,227 --> 01:01:46,497
(The exterior doesn't look like a meat restaurant.)

1847
01:01:47,327 --> 01:01:48,667
What's this now?

1848
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:51,696
(They enter the shop dubiously.)

1849
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:52,797
What's this place?

1850
01:01:54,907 --> 01:01:57,367
(When you open the iron door, )

1851
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:02,047
(you come across a romantic and cozy space.)

1852
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:06,947
(The interior is decorated thoroughly and meticulously.)

1853
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:11,557
(What kind of place is this?)

1854
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:13,516
What's this place?

1855
01:02:13,517 --> 01:02:14,656
(When she's distracted by the romantic interior design)

1856
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:16,187
- It's really nice here. My gosh. - This is...

1857
01:02:17,257 --> 01:02:18,657
(She spots something.)

1858
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:20,197
The owner here is...

1859
01:02:21,097 --> 01:02:22,667
(A photo frame placed next to the entrance)

1860
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:24,366
- "Big Mouth?" - There's a drama...

1861
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:25,597
titled "Big Mouth."

1862
01:02:27,297 --> 01:02:28,606
- He's an actor. - What?

1863
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,737
- Is he? - Yes.

1864
01:02:30,237 --> 01:02:31,376
- He is. - I watched it too.

1865
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:33,107
Isn't that the drama starring Lee Jong Suk?

1866
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:35,606
Hold on. The owner...

1867
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:37,247
- He must be an actor. - This...

1868
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:40,046
Is that Director Bong Joon Ho?

1869
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,747
(Director Bong Joon Ho!)

1870
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,657
(He shocked the world with his movie "Parasite.")

1871
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:47,517
(The master of the generation, Director Bong Joon Ho)

1872
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:50,856
- It really is him. - It really is.

1873
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:52,626
(The owner is acquainted with Director Bong Joon Ho?)

1874
01:02:52,627 --> 01:02:53,926
- It's Director Bong Joon Ho. - It's him.

1875
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:55,796
- Does he know Director Bong? - Here.

1876
01:02:55,797 --> 01:02:56,927
(Shocked murmurs)

1877
01:02:57,167 --> 01:03:00,167
The owner really is an actor.

1878
01:03:00,837 --> 01:03:03,736
I think I worked with him too.

1879
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:05,537
- With this actor? - Yes.

1880
01:03:05,977 --> 01:03:07,576
Right, you would know, Kyung Pyo.

1881
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:08,676
- I... - Let's have a seat.

1882
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:09,677
- Look. - Yes.

1883
01:03:10,347 --> 01:03:11,977
- Hold on. - Have a look.

1884
01:03:12,477 --> 01:03:14,117
Did he say he owned a steakhouse?

1885
01:03:14,477 --> 01:03:16,417
He didn't say that.

1886
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,157
His fellow actors would come and...

1887
01:03:21,527 --> 01:03:23,057
(Peeking)

1888
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:27,627
- My gosh. - Hello.

1889
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,826
(The owner has appeared.)

1890
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:31,267
Hello, nice to meet you.

1891
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:34,267
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1892
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:36,507
Hello.

1893
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:39,407
I'm the owner of this shop and an actor,

1894
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:41,277
Hong Ju Hyung.

1895
01:03:42,147 --> 01:03:43,577
"Pump Up the Healthy Love,"

1896
01:03:43,877 --> 01:03:46,477
"Queen of Divorce," and "Big Mouth."

1897
01:03:47,317 --> 01:03:49,516
I do stage plays in Daehak-ro.

1898
01:03:49,517 --> 01:03:50,887
(He does stage plays too!)

1899
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:52,856
I met Director Bong Joon Ho...

1900
01:03:52,857 --> 01:03:55,057
at an after party of a film festival.

1901
01:03:55,857 --> 01:03:58,156
Sir, do you work both as an actor...

1902
01:03:58,157 --> 01:03:59,827
- and as the owner here? - Yes.

1903
01:04:00,297 --> 01:04:02,597
(That's impressive.)

1904
01:04:02,897 --> 01:04:05,196
(And...)

1905
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,467
(Thinking)

1906
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:09,837
- When did I meet him? - Which dramas were you on?

1907
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:13,337
(The owner looks very familiar.)

1908
01:04:13,677 --> 01:04:15,947
Have you worked with me before?

1909
01:04:16,177 --> 01:04:18,476
You look very familiar.

1910
01:04:18,477 --> 01:04:19,677
(Has he really worked with Kyung Pyo before?)

1911
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:21,986
I've worked with Kyung Pyo once.

1912
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,416
- Right? - Yes, back then.

1913
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:24,887
- It was some time ago. - Yes.

1914
01:04:25,457 --> 01:04:26,486
It was "Cross."

1915
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,757
Yes, that's right! I knew I worked with him.

1916
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:31,397
(He remembered!)

1917
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:32,856
("Cross" was a drama aired in 2018,)

1918
01:04:32,857 --> 01:04:33,926
(and Kyung Pyo was the protagonist.)

1919
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:35,966
(Door suddenly opening)

1920
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:39,667
(The owner enters.)

1921
01:04:40,097 --> 01:04:41,707
(Even after that, )

1922
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:44,637
(Kyung Pyo and the owner acted together in many scenes.)

1923
01:04:45,077 --> 01:04:46,976
(It's a rather painful memory for the owner.)

1924
01:04:46,977 --> 01:04:48,346
(Kyung Pyo and the owner)

1925
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:50,676
- You were in the ambulance... - That's right.

1926
01:04:50,677 --> 01:04:52,247
- wearing a suit. - Yes.

1927
01:04:52,647 --> 01:04:55,216
- Actor... My gosh. - So he really is an actor.

1928
01:04:55,217 --> 01:04:57,017
Then this place must be real.

1929
01:04:57,287 --> 01:05:00,287
But you don't know if he actually runs the restaurant.

1930
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:02,527
That's what I don't know. This is crazy.

1931
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:06,296
I think this place is real.

1932
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:07,657
(Is he the real owner? Or is he an actor cast for the role?)

1933
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,367
What do customers like to order in this restaurant?

1934
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:15,336
We have a signature menu.

1935
01:05:15,337 --> 01:05:17,976
- It's ghee butter steak. - Ghee butter steak!

1936
01:05:17,977 --> 01:05:20,307
(Ghee butter steak)

1937
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:22,677
(Ghee butter?)

1938
01:05:22,777 --> 01:05:26,077
We must be here because it's very popular.

1939
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:28,886
But ghee butter... Min Kyung knows right away.

1940
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:29,947
- Exactly. - This.

1941
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:32,216
(Do you still eat normal butter?)

1942
01:05:32,217 --> 01:05:34,786
(Ghee butter)

1943
01:05:34,787 --> 01:05:39,297
Ghee butter is 100 percent pure butter.

1944
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:44,696
You refine various energy sources like lactose and protein.

1945
01:05:44,697 --> 01:05:48,067
Only butter will remain, and that's called ghee butter.

1946
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,406
(It's already popular overseas for its various effects...)

1947
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:52,207
(like antioxidation and intestinal health!)

1948
01:05:52,307 --> 01:05:54,076
It's very healthy butter.

1949
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:55,576
- Yes, ghee butter. - Ghee butter.

1950
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,577
That...

1951
01:05:56,578 --> 01:06:01,047
(How did this restaurant become popular?)

1952
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:03,886
(It's more ordinary than I imagined.)

1953
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:06,687
The most unique aspect of this restaurant is...

1954
01:06:07,257 --> 01:06:09,957
that we don't use fire.

1955
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:11,397
- What? - What?

1956
01:06:11,457 --> 01:06:12,457
How?

1957
01:06:12,657 --> 01:06:13,726
Is that even possible?

1958
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:14,727
(How do you cook a steak without fire?)

1959
01:06:14,728 --> 01:06:17,966
Using only the heat of ghee,

1960
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:20,236
we cook meat.

1961
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:21,507
(They cook a steak using only the heat of ghee!)

1962
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:24,907
(Usually, a steak is cooked with fire.)

1963
01:06:25,337 --> 01:06:29,107
(Is it possible to cook meat with only ghee?)

1964
01:06:29,347 --> 01:06:30,676
It'll take all day long.

1965
01:06:30,677 --> 01:06:32,246
- No, it takes no time. - Does it take no time?

1966
01:06:32,247 --> 01:06:33,376
Does it get cooked in no time?

1967
01:06:33,377 --> 01:06:35,287
(Coming soon)

1968
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:38,716
(Their jaws drop.)

1969
01:06:38,717 --> 01:06:41,487
(Exclamations burst out.)

1970
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:45,857
(Cooking with ghee is the most fascinating.)

1971
01:06:46,097 --> 01:06:48,097
(The dish that charmed everyone, )

1972
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:52,167
(ghee butter steak is coming!)

1973
01:06:52,237 --> 01:06:54,466
- Sir, please prepare the dishes. - Okay.

1974
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:55,606
- Right away. - We're in your care.

1975
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:59,676
The spot with the light over there is called the steak zone.

1976
01:06:59,677 --> 01:07:02,376
When we're ready, you'll get a show.

1977
01:07:02,377 --> 01:07:03,846
- Okay. - Okay.

1978
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:06,016
- He's so relaxed. - Yes.

1979
01:07:06,017 --> 01:07:07,047
He's a real deal.

1980
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:10,687
Min Kyung and I noticed something while he was talking.

1981
01:07:10,787 --> 01:07:12,356
You know how chefs have burn marks from splattered oil.

1982
01:07:12,357 --> 01:07:13,956
He had them.

1983
01:07:13,957 --> 01:07:15,657
- He had so many on his right arm. - He had them.

1984
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:17,726
Look at his arm.

1985
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:19,197
He has burn marks from splattered oil.

1986
01:07:20,497 --> 01:07:21,726
You're right.

1987
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,827
(The owner's arm was full of burn marks.)

1988
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:25,566
You can't make those marks...

1989
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,267
- on purpose. - They weren't fake.

1990
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:29,407
I think this place is real.

1991
01:07:29,607 --> 01:07:32,507
- It has the vibe of a real place. - It's totally real.

1992
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,947
- Why do I feel like it's fake? - It's totally real.

1993
01:07:37,177 --> 01:07:38,416
- Do you think it's fake? - Am I the strange one here?

1994
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:40,016
- Do you think it's fake? - I think it's fake.

1995
01:07:40,017 --> 01:07:41,046
Why? What seems fake?

1996
01:07:41,047 --> 01:07:43,117
Ghee butter steak is a dish...

1997
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,157
that's in the realm of an expert.

1998
01:07:45,557 --> 01:07:47,016
Seok Jin, have you had ghee?

1999
01:07:47,017 --> 01:07:48,526
- Yes, I have. - Really?

2000
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:49,686
My family eats it at home.

2001
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:50,926
If it's in the realm of an expert...

2002
01:07:50,927 --> 01:07:53,326
- I mean... - That's different.

2003
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:55,196
- He eats ghee. - I eat ghee.

2004
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,867
- I see. Not ghee butter steak. - I don't cook a steak with it.

2005
01:07:58,597 --> 01:08:02,236
I've heard about it since it's known as the diet butter.

2006
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:03,936
I had no idea that it could be used like this.

2007
01:08:03,937 --> 01:08:04,937
I've never had it.

2008
01:08:05,077 --> 01:08:07,536
It's the realm of an expert I've never heard of.

2009
01:08:07,537 --> 01:08:09,007
(Seok Jin has never heard of ghee butter steak, so it's fake!)

2010
01:08:09,477 --> 01:08:12,417
(In that case, how do you make ghee?)

2011
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:15,917
We make ghee by boiling butter.

2012
01:08:16,487 --> 01:08:19,357
(Boil unsalted butter for 10 minutes.)

2013
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:23,656
When butter melts,

2014
01:08:23,657 --> 01:08:26,397
impurities rise to the surface in the form of bubbles.

2015
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:30,196
I scoop them out.

2016
01:08:30,197 --> 01:08:33,837
(Scoop out the impurities.)

2017
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:37,767
When you keep boiling it, the liquid becomes murky yellow.

2018
01:08:38,537 --> 01:08:41,676
Then more bubbles will rise to the surface.

2019
01:08:41,677 --> 01:08:44,647
(Scoop out the impurities for the 2nd time.)

2020
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:48,346
(You repeat the process.)

2021
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:50,547
During the boiling process, moisture evaporates...

2022
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:52,956
and only clear butter remains.

2023
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:53,987
(Clear butter shows itself.)

2024
01:08:54,157 --> 01:08:57,756
Then I sieve the liquid and extract ghee.

2025
01:08:57,757 --> 01:08:59,527
(Sieve the last remaining impurities.)

2026
01:08:59,797 --> 01:09:03,467
(Then the ghee extraction is over.)

2027
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:05,667
(Lastly, the liquid is cooled.)

2028
01:09:06,097 --> 01:09:09,807
(The 100 percent pure ghee is complete.)

2029
01:09:09,907 --> 01:09:12,877
During the clarifying process, I lose about 30 percent of butter.

2030
01:09:12,937 --> 01:09:15,277
(460g of butter yields 310g of ghee.)

2031
01:09:15,807 --> 01:09:19,547
(What kind of a steak can be made with this precious ghee?)

2032
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:23,287
(The owner prepares to cook in earnest.)

2033
01:09:23,487 --> 01:09:24,716
Is that ghee?

2034
01:09:24,717 --> 01:09:26,387
Yes, I'm boiling ghee.

2035
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:29,387
(What's this pot?)

2036
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:32,496
It's called a cezve. It's a pot where you make...

2037
01:09:32,497 --> 01:09:34,627
Turkish coffee.

2038
01:09:35,497 --> 01:09:40,767
(Ghee is boiled in a cezve with high heat conductivity.)

2039
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,907
- I can hear the boiling sound. - I know.

2040
01:09:44,307 --> 01:09:46,907
(The temperature rises fast and the smoke comes up.)

2041
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:48,906
This is the Meat Restaurant with Lots of Smoke.

2042
01:09:48,907 --> 01:09:50,177
(That's right.)

2043
01:09:50,877 --> 01:09:51,946
You're right.

2044
01:09:51,947 --> 01:09:55,246
- That must be the smoke. - That must be it.

2045
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,286
(Excited)

2046
01:09:56,287 --> 01:09:57,747
- Nice. - Oh, yes.

2047
01:09:58,517 --> 01:10:00,157
That explains the description about the smoke.

2048
01:10:01,157 --> 01:10:04,887
(When smoke comes up and ghee boils, )

2049
01:10:05,227 --> 01:10:07,157
(it's time to prepare the meat.)

2050
01:10:07,327 --> 01:10:10,067
It's a cut that brings out ghee.

2051
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:12,166
That's why I use the chuck flap tail.

2052
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,437
(He uses the chuck flap tail that has been aged for 3 days.)

2053
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:16,937
(What kind of a steak will ghee and chuck flap tail make?)

2054
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:19,907
The meat isn't cooked at all.

2055
01:10:20,777 --> 01:10:22,407
How fascinating. It's raw meat.

2056
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:24,246
I've never had it.

2057
01:10:24,247 --> 01:10:26,947
(Will meat really get cooked without fire?)

2058
01:10:27,277 --> 01:10:28,816
It's called ghee.

2059
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:31,886
Ghee is 100 percent pure butter.

2060
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:35,386
We bring up the temperature of ghee from 250°C...

2061
01:10:35,387 --> 01:10:38,156
to a bit over 300°C if it's momentary.

2062
01:10:38,157 --> 01:10:40,496
The temperature goes a bit over 300°C.

2063
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:41,497
(Startled)

2064
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:43,666
- It's 300°C. - Is it 300°C?

2065
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,967
(It's the most fascinating.)

2066
01:10:45,397 --> 01:10:47,867
(When ghee is boiled)

2067
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,037
Is that butter?

2068
01:10:54,007 --> 01:10:55,376
He pours the butter first.

2069
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:59,077
(Butter heats up the plate.)

2070
01:10:59,377 --> 01:11:00,846
(Smoke rises.)

2071
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,847
- There's so much smoke. - Does he pour the butter first?

2072
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:04,716
Sir, I'm excited.

2073
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:05,917
(He can't wait.)

2074
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:08,386
- It's actual smoke. - Now...

2075
01:11:08,387 --> 01:11:12,527
(The meat goes on the plate.)

2076
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:15,027
It's getting cooked.

2077
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,127
It's getting cooked.

2078
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:19,397
(On top of ghee that's as hot as lava, )

2079
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:21,937
(chuck flap tail gets laid down gently.)

2080
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:23,736
This is incredible.

2081
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:25,607
(It gets cooked as soon as it touches ghee.)

2082
01:11:25,677 --> 01:11:27,076
It's so fascinating.

2083
01:11:27,077 --> 01:11:28,276
It looks tasty.

2084
01:11:28,277 --> 01:11:30,377
- He doesn't do it haphazardly. - You're right.

2085
01:11:30,547 --> 01:11:31,547
(Impressed)

2086
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:32,647
He must've done this a lot.

2087
01:11:33,077 --> 01:11:34,576
This is incredible.

2088
01:11:34,577 --> 01:11:36,117
(This is how you cook meat without fire.)

2089
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:38,616
- This is insane. - Right?

2090
01:11:38,617 --> 01:11:40,057
It looks so tasty.

2091
01:11:40,857 --> 01:11:42,386
(When all the meat is on the plate)

2092
01:11:42,387 --> 01:11:43,787
- I think he'll pour it now. - Be careful.

2093
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:47,657
(A ghee shower)

2094
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:49,667
- Look at the smoke. - What a performance!

2095
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:51,397
- The smoke is insane. - This is incredible.

2096
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:55,407
(When you pour the remaining ghee, )

2097
01:11:57,507 --> 01:12:00,807
(meat gets cooked in 1 second like magic.)

2098
01:12:02,407 --> 01:12:04,406
Using only the high heat...

2099
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,076
the butter contains,

2100
01:12:06,077 --> 01:12:08,917
the steak gets cooked as if it was being deep-fried.

2101
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:10,946
- It's cooked. - Look at the meat.

2102
01:12:10,947 --> 01:12:12,287
This is incredible.

2103
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:15,387
It looks tasty. This is incredible.

2104
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:17,456
(The sight makes their mouths water.)

2105
01:12:17,457 --> 01:12:19,257
(Gulping)

2106
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:21,457
- I've never seen such a thing. - Me neither.

2107
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:25,036
(He sprinkles salt with the back of his hand!)

2108
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:26,667
- What's this? - I told you.

2109
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:34,137
(It's entertaining to watch.)

2110
01:12:34,537 --> 01:12:36,847
(There's always someone who copies it.)

2111
01:12:36,947 --> 01:12:38,776
- What a performance. - What a performance.

2112
01:12:38,777 --> 01:12:40,047
It bounded off of his hand.

2113
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:42,046
We should've seen that...

2114
01:12:42,047 --> 01:12:43,316
- with matcha. - That's right.

2115
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,917
- Then we would've been impressed. - Yes.

2116
01:12:46,957 --> 01:12:47,957
It's the real deal.

2117
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:49,357
- This... - It's the real deal.

2118
01:12:49,727 --> 01:12:54,427
(While meat gets salted and cooked in ghee, )

2119
01:12:54,757 --> 01:12:57,027
(the owner picks up baguette.)

2120
01:12:57,727 --> 01:12:59,397
- It's cooked. - He'll lay the bread.

2121
01:13:00,537 --> 01:13:05,507
(The next ingredient that'll get a hot taste of ghee)

2122
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:07,706
The plate must still be hot.

2123
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:08,906
(Tasty food next to tasty food)

2124
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:10,047
This is amazing.

2125
01:13:10,347 --> 01:13:12,377
There's one reason why I cook the ingredients like this.

2126
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:15,346
It prevents the flavor loss due to the heat loss.

2127
01:13:15,347 --> 01:13:18,286
On the ceramic plate that's heated up,

2128
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:20,956
I pour the heated ghee and cook the ingredients.

2129
01:13:20,957 --> 01:13:23,756
Then there's no flavor loss in the butter.

2130
01:13:23,757 --> 01:13:25,456
The baguette soaks up...

2131
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:27,357
the flavors of the butter.

2132
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:28,766
(Impressed)

2133
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:31,596
- What a description. - It sounds delicious.

2134
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:33,037
He didn't stutter once.

2135
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:34,896
Even the description was perfect.

2136
01:13:34,897 --> 01:13:36,167
(Even the description was perfect.)

2137
01:13:36,337 --> 01:13:39,307
This is... This is real. Totally.

2138
01:13:39,537 --> 01:13:40,776
Didn't you say it was fake earlier?

2139
01:13:40,777 --> 01:13:43,246
I said that earlier. But the way he tiled it,

2140
01:13:43,247 --> 01:13:45,046
- the ventilation system, - Exactly.

2141
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:47,017
And his comments changed my mind. If this is fake...

2142
01:13:47,617 --> 01:13:49,817
- It's not acting. - No.

2143
01:13:50,747 --> 01:13:52,486
It looks tasty.

2144
01:13:52,487 --> 01:13:53,817
(I don't care if it's real or fake. It looks tasty.)

2145
01:13:54,057 --> 01:13:56,026
I'll also serve pasta and fried rice.

2146
01:13:56,027 --> 01:13:57,127
(Impressed)

2147
01:13:57,887 --> 01:13:59,197
Will they be cooked on the plate?

2148
01:13:59,697 --> 01:14:02,726
The ghee is seasoned already.

2149
01:14:02,727 --> 01:14:05,467
(He adds pasta.)

2150
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:07,966
I add one egg yolk.

2151
01:14:07,967 --> 01:14:10,467
(One egg yolk and grana padano get added.)

2152
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:12,776
(Then the pasta is mixed well.)

2153
01:14:12,777 --> 01:14:15,906
Thick carbonara is ready.

2154
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:16,907
(Ghee butter carbonara with the flavors of butter and meat)
He added it right away.

2155
01:14:17,908 --> 01:14:19,276
(A round of applause)

2156
01:14:19,277 --> 01:14:20,317
He added it right away.

2157
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:23,247
- This is incredible. - Seriously.

2158
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:24,387
- This is incredible. - Bravo.

2159
01:14:24,517 --> 01:14:25,787
This is incredible.

2160
01:14:26,517 --> 01:14:28,487
(This is insane!)

2161
01:14:28,857 --> 01:14:30,826
Let's exclude this place and choose between numbers 1 and 2.

2162
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:32,657
Let's choose between numbers 1 and 2.

2163
01:14:33,397 --> 01:14:35,967
- You can't do this at a fake place. - You just can't.

2164
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:38,266
- Look at Min Kyung. - Oh, my.

2165
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:39,767
Their reaction is genuine.

2166
01:14:40,037 --> 01:14:42,036
I'll come back here.

2167
01:14:42,037 --> 01:14:43,207
This is incredible.

2168
01:14:44,037 --> 01:14:47,437
(He grates cheese that'll add the flavors.)

2169
01:14:47,837 --> 01:14:49,147
Cheese!

2170
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:51,247
I missed it! Please do it again.

2171
01:14:52,377 --> 01:14:54,117
I missed it! Please do it again.

2172
01:14:54,677 --> 01:14:55,847
I missed it.

2173
01:14:57,087 --> 01:14:58,187
I'll do it again.

2174
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:00,517
(Here comes the fan service.)

2175
01:15:00,817 --> 01:15:02,286
(She films it properly this time.)

2176
01:15:02,287 --> 01:15:03,487
What a delicate touch.

2177
01:15:03,687 --> 01:15:05,396
- Thank you. - This carbonara is a real deal.

2178
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:06,397
(Highly satisfied)

2179
01:15:06,398 --> 01:15:08,597
- Can we rent the whole restaurant? - Yes, you can.

2180
01:15:09,327 --> 01:15:11,096
(The last item is ghee and kimchi fried rice...)

2181
01:15:11,097 --> 01:15:12,897
(toasted in a waffle pan.)

2182
01:15:13,037 --> 01:15:14,936
- What's this? - Fried rice.

2183
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:15,966
(Exclaiming)

2184
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:17,637
- Waffle. - Fried rice waffle.

2185
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:20,307
(Full of the rich and buttery flavors)

2186
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:23,076
It looks delicious. There's everything I like.

2187
01:15:23,077 --> 01:15:24,677
(The ghee butter steak set is complete.)

2188
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:29,147
(It's the most popular restaurant on social media!)

2189
01:15:29,217 --> 01:15:33,257
My restaurant went viral through social media.

2190
01:15:34,157 --> 01:15:36,486
Through texts and calls,

2191
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:38,126
I got over 170 reservation requests.

2192
01:15:38,127 --> 01:15:41,357
The monthly sales is about 35,000 dollars.

2193
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:43,926
(The secret double life...)

2194
01:15:43,927 --> 01:15:47,297
(of the actor with 15 years of experience)

2195
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:50,837
Sixth Sense members,

2196
01:15:51,237 --> 01:15:53,337
is this place real?

2197
01:15:56,107 --> 01:15:57,746
- I'm so curious about the baguette. - I want that baguette.

2198
01:15:57,747 --> 01:15:58,777
Me too.

2199
01:15:59,147 --> 01:16:00,546
It's unbelievable.

2200
01:16:00,547 --> 01:16:02,816
It's bound to be tasty.

2201
01:16:02,817 --> 01:16:03,847
(It looks unbelievably good.)

2202
01:16:03,987 --> 01:16:04,987
(My goodness)

2203
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:06,787
The smell is no joke.

2204
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:09,256
I'll help you with plating.

2205
01:16:09,257 --> 01:16:10,486
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2206
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,227
He even helps with plating.

2207
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:15,426
Baguette goes to the bottom.

2208
01:16:15,427 --> 01:16:17,367
- So that's how you eat it. - I'll plate it like this.

2209
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:18,896
You'll cut it this way...

2210
01:16:18,897 --> 01:16:20,197
so that you can have the first bite with baguette...

2211
01:16:20,297 --> 01:16:22,006
and a bit of salt.

2212
01:16:22,007 --> 01:16:23,037
(He recommends that they dip it in salt.)

2213
01:16:23,907 --> 01:16:24,936
I can't wait.

2214
01:16:24,937 --> 01:16:27,777
(How does it taste?)

2215
01:16:28,277 --> 01:16:30,006
Let's dip it in salt.

2216
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:31,206
Jae Seok, it looks so tasty.

2217
01:16:31,207 --> 01:16:32,916
You sliced it so prettily.

2218
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:34,446
It looks tasty, Jae Seok.

2219
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:35,987
(Curious)

2220
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:38,487
(How does it taste?)

2221
01:16:40,087 --> 01:16:41,116
How does it taste?

2222
01:16:41,117 --> 01:16:42,486
(Impressed)

2223
01:16:42,487 --> 01:16:43,856
Oh, my!

2224
01:16:43,857 --> 01:16:46,297
(A feel-good bite)

2225
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:49,897
(Just how does it taste?)

2226
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,666
(Impressed nod)

2227
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:52,737
- He means it. - Is it insane?

2228
01:16:52,837 --> 01:16:53,867
- Is it that good? - Oh, my!

2229
01:16:54,467 --> 01:16:55,807
- Do you mean it? - He means it.

2230
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:57,966
- It's Jae Seok's honest reaction. - Oh, my.

2231
01:16:57,967 --> 01:16:59,106
Try it. I'm serious.

2232
01:16:59,107 --> 01:17:01,237
- What am I going to do? - I'm close to tears.

2233
01:17:01,507 --> 01:17:03,547
It's insanely rich.

2234
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:05,476
Oh, my.

2235
01:17:05,477 --> 01:17:07,446
- I'm so sad to see it go. - It's insanely rich.

2236
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:08,916
(Seok Jin takes a bite right away.)

2237
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:09,987
(Moaning)

2238
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:12,816
(What was that sound?)

2239
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:14,787
Is it that tasty?

2240
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:16,387
- Is it that good? - Really?

2241
01:17:16,787 --> 01:17:18,127
Oh, my. Hold on. I'm nervous.

2242
01:17:18,427 --> 01:17:19,826
I feel like...

2243
01:17:19,827 --> 01:17:21,926
- it's overly tasty. - Really?

2244
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:23,727
- I'm nervous. - What am I going to do?

2245
01:17:24,797 --> 01:17:26,537
Hurry up and try it.

2246
01:17:26,697 --> 01:17:27,937
(Eating)

2247
01:17:28,197 --> 01:17:29,606
Try them together. How is it?

2248
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:31,667
(Insanely tasty)

2249
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:33,807
Bravo!

2250
01:17:34,677 --> 01:17:36,047
It's so tasty.

2251
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:38,346
- The baguette is insane. - Try it, Min Kyung.

2252
01:17:38,347 --> 01:17:39,476
The baguette.

2253
01:17:39,477 --> 01:17:41,717
The meat is tasty as it is,

2254
01:17:42,147 --> 01:17:44,047
- but the baguette provides a kick. - Yes.

2255
01:17:44,087 --> 01:17:45,186
Seriously.

2256
01:17:45,187 --> 01:17:46,586
People will be curious about...

2257
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:48,686
why we're obsessing over the baguette.

2258
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:50,357
It's tastier than meat.

2259
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:52,457
It's crispy and soft.

2260
01:17:52,557 --> 01:17:54,756
The savoriness of the meat...

2261
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:56,426
and the crispiness and richness of the baguette...

2262
01:17:56,427 --> 01:17:57,997
are perfect together.

2263
01:17:58,367 --> 01:17:59,936
- It's crazy. - The baguette.

2264
01:17:59,937 --> 01:18:01,236
You need to eat it with the baguette. Hurry up.

2265
01:18:01,237 --> 01:18:02,267
(Min Kyung takes a bite.)

2266
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:05,477
Isn't it incredible?

2267
01:18:05,677 --> 01:18:07,437
(It's incredible!)

2268
01:18:08,237 --> 01:18:09,446
Isn't it insane?

2269
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:10,647
(Moved)

2270
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:13,277
- And there was a show. - That's right.

2271
01:18:13,347 --> 01:18:14,676
- We had a fun show before eating. - Yes,

2272
01:18:14,677 --> 01:18:15,916
- it was so much fun. - It's so tasty.

2273
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:16,987
(It's a treat to the eyes and mouth.)

2274
01:18:17,247 --> 01:18:19,717
(I can't believe I didn't know about the taste.)

2275
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:21,617
It's so tasty. It's insane.

2276
01:18:22,257 --> 01:18:25,427
- Let's eat it with radish kimchi. - Hurry up and try it.

2277
01:18:26,357 --> 01:18:29,426
(Hae Ri tries it first.)

2278
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:31,097
(Chewing)

2279
01:18:31,827 --> 01:18:34,067
(What's this?)

2280
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:36,737
(In ecstasy)

2281
01:18:38,107 --> 01:18:41,407
- The kimchi is insane. - Is the kimchi insane?

2282
01:18:41,677 --> 01:18:43,476
It cleanses the palate.

2283
01:18:43,477 --> 01:18:45,207
(The clean taste gets rid of the greasiness.)

2284
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:46,446
I'm seriously angry.

2285
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:47,716
It's so tasty.

2286
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:48,987
(It's so tasty!)

2287
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,787
- She's angry. - Why are you angry?

2288
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,046
- Isn't it tasty? - Pasta.

2289
01:18:52,047 --> 01:18:53,487
It's the taste I've never had.

2290
01:18:54,017 --> 01:18:55,217
It's so tasty.

2291
01:18:55,587 --> 01:18:57,526
- Shall we try pasta? - Pasta is insane.

2292
01:18:57,527 --> 01:18:58,587
- Seriously. - Pasta is insane.

2293
01:18:58,657 --> 01:19:01,096
(Jae Seok tries it first.)

2294
01:19:01,097 --> 01:19:03,327
(Impressed)

2295
01:19:04,727 --> 01:19:06,697
(This is the taste.)

2296
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:08,236
(Seok Jin slurps pasta as well.)

2297
01:19:08,237 --> 01:19:10,367
(Impressed)

2298
01:19:10,467 --> 01:19:12,007
Pasta is really tasty.

2299
01:19:12,977 --> 01:19:14,307
It's really savory.

2300
01:19:14,437 --> 01:19:15,977
It's totally creamy.

2301
01:19:16,807 --> 01:19:18,647
(Min Kyung tries the ghee butter pasta.)

2302
01:19:18,947 --> 01:19:20,717
(Her eyes go wide.)

2303
01:19:21,247 --> 01:19:23,417
I love dishes like this one.

2304
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:25,486
(What was that?)

2305
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:26,656
Isn't it the tastiest?

2306
01:19:26,657 --> 01:19:27,916
(She can't even describe the taste.)

2307
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,156
(This is incredible.)

2308
01:19:29,157 --> 01:19:30,656
- Look at her face. - Right?

2309
01:19:30,657 --> 01:19:31,686
Pasta takes first place.

2310
01:19:31,687 --> 01:19:32,857
- I agree. - Pasta takes first place.

2311
01:19:33,527 --> 01:19:36,297
So this is how you use ghee.

2312
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,837
I shouldn't have eaten it with food that tasted bad.

2313
01:19:39,037 --> 01:19:40,337
I thought "Ghee" meant...

2314
01:19:40,397 --> 01:19:42,736
that it was butter with special energy.

2315
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:45,737
(I thought that it was butter with special energy.)

2316
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:47,736
- Only the fried rice remains. - Do you want it?

2317
01:19:47,737 --> 01:19:49,207
- We should try it. - We should try it.

2318
01:19:49,407 --> 01:19:52,817
It's the taste of kimchi fried rice that was made with animal fat.

2319
01:19:53,547 --> 01:19:54,946
- This is... - It's so tasty.

2320
01:19:54,947 --> 01:19:57,447
- Right? - He should train other chefs.

2321
01:19:57,487 --> 01:19:58,957
Seriously.

2322
01:19:59,517 --> 01:20:01,917
The flavors play with my tongue.

2323
01:20:02,327 --> 01:20:03,656
I don't know I can say this,

2324
01:20:03,657 --> 01:20:05,656
but this is number one among all the places on the show.

2325
01:20:05,657 --> 01:20:06,726
- What? - Really?

2326
01:20:06,727 --> 01:20:08,657
This is number one among all the places on the show.

2327
01:20:08,727 --> 01:20:10,527
- Here comes ramyeon. - Thank you.

2328
01:20:11,027 --> 01:20:12,336
Beef hangover ramyeon.

2329
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:14,167
- Beef. - Beef hangover ramyeon.

2330
01:20:14,297 --> 01:20:16,007
It's bound to be tasty.

2331
01:20:17,337 --> 01:20:19,606
I boil the leftover meat from shaping the steak...

2332
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,237
in butter.

2333
01:20:22,207 --> 01:20:25,207
Then I add insanely spicy Vietnamese chili powder.

2334
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:28,776
It becomes a dish that resembles the Chinese beef noodle soup.

2335
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:29,917
(Ghee butter beef hangover ramyeon)

2336
01:20:29,987 --> 01:20:32,587
In case the food was too greasy,

2337
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:34,817
the soup will wash it down.

2338
01:20:35,017 --> 01:20:36,087
(My goodness)

2339
01:20:36,227 --> 01:20:38,457
I bet it's the taste I love the most.

2340
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:41,056
- Have you tried it? - Just now.

2341
01:20:41,057 --> 01:20:42,196
(Hae Ri takes a big mouthful.)

2342
01:20:42,197 --> 01:20:44,327
(Humming in approval)

2343
01:20:44,527 --> 01:20:45,636
It's so tasty.

2344
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:46,997
- It's so spicy. - How is the soup so rich?

2345
01:20:47,237 --> 01:20:49,307
(He blows on the noodles.)

2346
01:20:49,337 --> 01:20:51,407
- It's so tasty. - It's so tasty.

2347
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:52,776
- It's so spicy. - How is the soup so rich?

2348
01:20:52,777 --> 01:20:53,806
It's so tasty.

2349
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:54,837
(Nodding)

2350
01:20:55,437 --> 01:20:57,046
- Seriously... - The noodles...

2351
01:20:57,047 --> 01:20:58,877
(The taste makes him laugh.)

2352
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:00,817
Have you tried the soup?

2353
01:21:01,047 --> 01:21:02,847
- I want to copy the recipe. - I haven't tried the soup.

2354
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:04,216
This isn't ramyeon.

2355
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:05,447
- This is a proper dish. - This isn't ramyeon.

2356
01:21:05,517 --> 01:21:06,716
From the spiciness,

2357
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:08,016
consistency,

2358
01:21:08,017 --> 01:21:09,187
and noodles...

2359
01:21:09,227 --> 01:21:10,556
It's perfect.

2360
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:11,927
(It's perfect in every way.)

2361
01:21:12,327 --> 01:21:14,356
Try the soup. Jae Seok, try the soup.

2362
01:21:14,357 --> 01:21:15,457
Gosh, this dish...

2363
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:18,326
The taste goes beyond my imagination.

2364
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:19,436
(The taste settles the stomach.)

2365
01:21:19,437 --> 01:21:20,437
Look at the oil on the surface.

2366
01:21:20,438 --> 01:21:21,736
It's perfect.

2367
01:21:21,737 --> 01:21:22,866
(Savory ghee oil floats on the red soup.)

2368
01:21:22,867 --> 01:21:25,337
It's so tasty that I'm going crazy.

2369
01:21:25,437 --> 01:21:27,576
I have children, so I know that this ramyeon is...

2370
01:21:27,577 --> 01:21:29,046
- too spicy for them. - It's spicy indeed.

2371
01:21:29,047 --> 01:21:31,306
- But they'll love everything else. - They'll love everything else.

2372
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:33,776
But I can think of it this way. If I come here with children,

2373
01:21:33,777 --> 01:21:35,177
this ramyeon will be mine.

2374
01:21:35,347 --> 01:21:36,946
- Only you can eat it. - I see.

2375
01:21:36,947 --> 01:21:38,317
- Only you can eat it. - That's right.

2376
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:40,216
It makes you happy to have a dish to yourself.

2377
01:21:40,217 --> 01:21:41,657
- "You guys can't eat this." - He's the dad.

2378
01:21:41,917 --> 01:21:44,326
I see that even dads have such a thought.

2379
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:45,526
Of course, they do.

2380
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,727
Later on, you'll find yourself fighting over a piece of ham.

2381
01:21:47,997 --> 01:21:49,426
A piece of ham?

2382
01:21:49,427 --> 01:21:50,596
The last piece.

2383
01:21:50,597 --> 01:21:52,026
It was really tasty.

2384
01:21:52,027 --> 01:21:53,997
- I really enjoyed the food. - Sir.

2385
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:55,497
It was really tasty.

2386
01:21:56,107 --> 01:21:57,506
We've never done this before, right?

2387
01:21:57,507 --> 01:21:59,236
- We've never clapped before. - Even if it appears simple...

2388
01:21:59,237 --> 01:22:01,276
This is the first time. We've never been in agreement.

2389
01:22:01,277 --> 01:22:03,047
- We've never done this before. - I know.

2390
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:04,646
I've already excluded this place.

2391
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:06,217
- It isn't a candidate in my heart. - You're right.

2392
01:22:07,147 --> 01:22:09,887
- But we need to be suspicious. - We need to be suspicious.

2393
01:22:09,947 --> 01:22:12,187
If I must choose a point that feels fake,

2394
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:13,686
the overall setup...

2395
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:16,057
- is something a chef would do. - It seems like a chef's work.

2396
01:22:16,127 --> 01:22:17,527
It seems like a chef's work.

2397
01:22:18,187 --> 01:22:19,996
(The Sixth Sense members...)

2398
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:21,797
(have been fooled by the fake dishes...)

2399
01:22:22,027 --> 01:22:24,967
(that were created by the team of chefs!)

2400
01:22:25,097 --> 01:22:26,796
This is a course...

2401
01:22:26,797 --> 01:22:29,737
a chef might come up with.

2402
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:33,006
Here's what I think.

2403
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:35,336
Why did that chef share this recipe?

2404
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:36,547
They should've sold it themselves.

2405
01:22:36,807 --> 01:22:38,176
Perhaps they didn't know...

2406
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:39,276
that it'd be such a hit.

2407
01:22:39,277 --> 01:22:40,847
(Maybe they didn't know.)

2408
01:22:41,077 --> 01:22:42,617
I bet they were shocked.

2409
01:22:43,587 --> 01:22:45,517
Perhaps they developed a recipe...

2410
01:22:45,787 --> 01:22:47,816
the actor could recreate...

2411
01:22:47,817 --> 01:22:48,916
- without a lot of techniques. - Right.

2412
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:50,257
He just needed to boil ghee and pour it on the plate.

2413
01:22:50,557 --> 01:22:51,557
That might be the case.

2414
01:22:51,687 --> 01:22:53,657
(That's plausible.)

2415
01:22:53,957 --> 01:22:55,926
(When you think about it, )

2416
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:57,867
(the recipe didn't require a lot of techniques.)

2417
01:22:57,927 --> 01:23:01,566
Since the recipe didn't require a lot of techniques,

2418
01:23:01,567 --> 01:23:03,336
an actor could act and cook at the same time.

2419
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:04,607
- Right. - That might be it.

2420
01:23:04,637 --> 01:23:06,176
- Now that I'm seeing it... - That's right.

2421
01:23:06,177 --> 01:23:07,736
As a possibly fake place,

2422
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:10,407
the things that seemed perfect before...

2423
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:11,506
- They were too perfect. - They were too perfect.

2424
01:23:11,507 --> 01:23:12,576
There were a lot of them.

2425
01:23:12,577 --> 01:23:13,646
- Such things... - The owner's comments?

2426
01:23:13,647 --> 01:23:14,677
- They were too perfect. - The comments.

2427
01:23:14,777 --> 01:23:17,286
He showed that moment when he made comments while cooking...

2428
01:23:17,287 --> 01:23:18,647
without stuttering once.

2429
01:23:19,257 --> 01:23:20,516
An actor can do that.

2430
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:21,616
He can do that, right?

2431
01:23:21,617 --> 01:23:22,957
- You just need to memorize it. - He can treat it like a line.

2432
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:25,156
Things are becoming complicated again.

2433
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:26,326
(A real owner who's too perfect? A fake owner who has been hired?)

2434
01:23:26,327 --> 01:23:27,697
The taste and...

2435
01:23:28,597 --> 01:23:30,326
Once you become suspicious,

2436
01:23:30,327 --> 01:23:31,366
- there's no end. - There's no end, right?

2437
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:32,836
- There's no end. - Now, this place seems fake.

2438
01:23:32,837 --> 01:23:34,836
But just a moment ago, we were cheering.

2439
01:23:34,837 --> 01:23:35,906
"It's so tasty. Bravo."

2440
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,607
We didn't suspect it one bit.

2441
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:39,636
If this place is fake,

2442
01:23:39,637 --> 01:23:41,236
the owner should run this business.

2443
01:23:41,237 --> 01:23:43,007
- I agree. - I agree.

2444
01:23:44,447 --> 01:23:45,916
(Owner of Meat Restaurant with Lots of Smoke)

2445
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:47,346
(1. A performance that entertains the eyes and mouth)

2446
01:23:47,347 --> 01:23:48,817
(2. A fantastic taste everyone likes 3. Overly perfect explanation)

2447
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:50,187
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2448
01:23:50,987 --> 01:23:53,716
Your hands are covered in scars.

2449
01:23:53,717 --> 01:23:54,786
(Checking the scars)

2450
01:23:54,787 --> 01:23:56,456
- The owner... - I saw his hands just now.

2451
01:23:56,457 --> 01:23:57,727
They're covered in scars.

2452
01:23:58,157 --> 01:24:00,427
They're covered in scars from splattered oil.

2453
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:01,956
Even if you learn the recipe in a hurry,

2454
01:24:01,957 --> 01:24:04,226
- you can get red marks like those. - Right.

2455
01:24:04,227 --> 01:24:06,236
- If you practice for 2 months... - If he has done it for 2 months...

2456
01:24:06,237 --> 01:24:07,336
- Then you can get those marks. - Yes.

2457
01:24:07,337 --> 01:24:08,466
If you practice for two months...

2458
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:10,706
But you can't get those marks in two months.

2459
01:24:10,707 --> 01:24:13,006
For an actor, his body is his fortune.

2460
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:15,277
So he would've worn arm guards to prevent any injuries.

2461
01:24:15,437 --> 01:24:17,407
I've become confused toward the end.

2462
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:19,217
If it's fake,

2463
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:21,017
I'll open that restaurant.

2464
01:24:21,177 --> 01:24:22,177
Will you open that restaurant?

2465
01:24:22,178 --> 01:24:23,886
- You'll copy the recipe. - There you go again.

2466
01:24:23,887 --> 01:24:25,346
He wants to open a business.

2467
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:26,617
(He showed his desire to open a business.)

2468
01:24:28,957 --> 01:24:30,157
I'm certain...

2469
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:31,987
that number three isn't real.

2470
01:24:32,227 --> 01:24:33,656
- It can't be real. - Do you think it's fake?

2471
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:35,126
- I'm certain that it's fake. - Why?

2472
01:24:35,127 --> 01:24:36,497
It was too perfect.

2473
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:37,726
That came out of nowhere.

2474
01:24:37,727 --> 01:24:39,336
Can't you give that performance...

2475
01:24:39,337 --> 01:24:41,566
- if you practice for two months? - You can pull it off.

2476
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,637
- I bet you can do it. - You can pull it off.

2477
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:45,336
I don't think it's number three.

2478
01:24:45,337 --> 01:24:46,337
We need to be suspicious.

2479
01:24:46,338 --> 01:24:47,937
It's so hard.

2480
01:24:48,637 --> 01:24:50,006
To be honest, I don't know.

2481
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:51,077
(As always, choosing one won't be easy.)

2482
01:24:51,807 --> 01:24:54,017
Why don't we decide on a place that isn't fake?

2483
01:24:54,077 --> 01:24:55,516
- Number 3 isn't fake. - I'll exclude number 3.

2484
01:24:55,517 --> 01:24:56,846
- You don't think it's number 3. - Let's exclude number 3.

2485
01:24:56,847 --> 01:24:59,857
I want number three to be real. Seriously.

2486
01:25:00,117 --> 01:25:01,386
- Let's exclude number 3. - I think number 3 is real.

2487
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:02,926
- I want to think... - Number three is real.

2488
01:25:02,927 --> 01:25:04,227
- less. - I think it's real.

2489
01:25:04,427 --> 01:25:05,856
- I want number three to be real. - Yes.

2490
01:25:05,857 --> 01:25:07,326
- I want number three to be real. - It can't be fake.

2491
01:25:07,327 --> 01:25:08,556
Min Kyung doesn't agree.

2492
01:25:08,557 --> 01:25:10,766
- I think number three is fake. - You think it's fake.

2493
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:12,736
- Then are numbers 1 and 2 real? - Yes.

2494
01:25:12,737 --> 01:25:14,636
- Is number one real? - I think it's real.

2495
01:25:14,637 --> 01:25:15,637
Number two is real as well.

2496
01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:17,867
I think she's a young owner who isn't used to running a business.

2497
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:23,147
(Number 2, Owner with Lots of Jeju's matcha galbitang)

2498
01:25:23,377 --> 01:25:26,647
(Seok Jin was unsure about the use of matcha.)

2499
01:25:26,847 --> 01:25:28,347
(It's tasty.)

2500
01:25:28,677 --> 01:25:31,587
(It seemed to captivate both the old and new generations.)

2501
01:25:31,787 --> 01:25:34,716
(But the reviews on the taste were mixed.)

2502
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:37,457
(This place is fake because it has a strange dish.)

2503
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:40,427
(The owner who used to be a trot singer?)

2504
01:25:40,627 --> 01:25:44,467
(Did a former singer get hired to play a fake owner?)

2505
01:25:44,567 --> 01:25:46,497
That was the key point of number one.

2506
01:25:46,537 --> 01:25:49,307
Does the owner run a cafe and a meat place at the same time?

2507
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:53,007
(Everyone was shocked.)

2508
01:25:53,377 --> 01:25:58,406
(The owner who runs a yogurt cafe and meat restaurant?)

2509
01:25:58,407 --> 01:26:04,717
(Owner Who Does This Too's yogurt green onion pork skirt)

2510
01:26:06,817 --> 01:26:08,057
(This is it.)

2511
01:26:08,617 --> 01:26:10,987
(What does the meat taste so good?)

2512
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:14,796
(She gets angry when the food is good.)

2513
01:26:14,797 --> 01:26:16,127
(But I keep getting this thought.)

2514
01:26:16,227 --> 01:26:18,697
(It feels like this was made by chefs.)

2515
01:26:18,927 --> 01:26:22,807
(Is this a new menu developed by chefs?)

2516
01:26:22,907 --> 01:26:24,666
Can the unit cost be met with all that yogurt?

2517
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:25,736
Surely not.

2518
01:26:25,737 --> 01:26:28,076
- Whenever we thought about that... - Gosh!

2519
01:26:28,077 --> 01:26:29,206
(Gosh!)

2520
01:26:29,207 --> 01:26:30,207
- What is it? - Number one.

2521
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,307
- Did you get hit again? - Gosh!

2522
01:26:31,377 --> 01:26:33,116
(She has been getting a lot of stomach pain today.)

2523
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:35,047
(Gosh!)

2524
01:26:35,317 --> 01:26:37,717
- "Gosh, my stomach!" - "Gosh, my stomach!"

2525
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:40,886
Jae Seok! Menu-wise, I think it's number one.

2526
01:26:40,887 --> 01:26:43,587
And there was a man who couldn't answer us.

2527
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,257
- It felt off. - He avoided us.

2528
01:26:45,457 --> 01:26:46,757
- Like this. - Right.

2529
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:48,556
(Who are you?)

2530
01:26:48,557 --> 01:26:49,566
(Are you the owner?)

2531
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:52,097
(Keeping silent)

2532
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:53,566
Should we go for number one then?

2533
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:54,696
- Number 1. - I choose number 1.

2534
01:26:54,697 --> 01:26:56,567
- Do we only get 1 chance? - I'll choose number 1 as well.

2535
01:26:56,667 --> 01:26:57,667
- We only get one chance. - What about you, Min Kyung?
- Number 1. - Number 3?

2536
01:26:58,668 --> 01:27:00,477
- I think it's number 3. - No. It's number 1.

2537
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,477
I think it's number two.

2538
01:27:03,307 --> 01:27:04,746
- I choose number 1 as well. - Do you think it's number 2, Mimi?

2539
01:27:04,747 --> 01:27:05,847
I think it's number two.

2540
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:07,346
Let's have a show of hands. I will go for number one.

2541
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,516
- Number one. - Me too.

2542
01:27:08,517 --> 01:27:09,646
- Number one has the most votes. - Right.

2543
01:27:09,647 --> 01:27:11,347
- I have a good feeling about this. - After a few times...

2544
01:27:11,787 --> 01:27:12,916
- It's number 1. - Number 1?

2545
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:14,456
- Number one. - Hold on. Excuse me.

2546
01:27:14,457 --> 01:27:16,487
Listen to what I have to say.

2547
01:27:16,587 --> 01:27:18,526
- You're turning against the camera? - Oh, right.

2548
01:27:18,527 --> 01:27:20,397
This is what I think about number one.

2549
01:27:20,897 --> 01:27:22,696
It feels like a trick to seem like a fake place.

2550
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:23,697
It feels like a trick instead?

2551
01:27:23,698 --> 01:27:25,727
It feels like a trick to seem fake, Jae Seok.

2552
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:26,936
If that's the case,

2553
01:27:26,937 --> 01:27:28,336
- all places feel suspicious. - Right.

2554
01:27:28,337 --> 01:27:30,266
- Let's go with number 1. - Let's go with number 1.

2555
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:31,636
- The majority vote. - One, two, three.

2556
01:27:31,637 --> 01:27:32,677
- Number 1! - Number 1!

2557
01:27:32,937 --> 01:27:34,707
(She still is firm about her vote for number 3.)

2558
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:36,907
Gosh, I can't watch!

2559
01:27:37,277 --> 01:27:38,277
Gosh, I don't have a clue.

2560
01:27:38,278 --> 01:27:40,117
We can't get it wrong once again today!

2561
01:27:40,577 --> 01:27:42,277
I'm so curious! Please!

2562
01:27:42,647 --> 01:27:44,616
(Will number 1 be the right answer?)

2563
01:27:44,617 --> 01:27:47,387
- We're awful at this. - We have to get it right today.

2617
01:29:49,773 --> 01:29:52,233
I told you that it felt fake!

2618
01:29:52,373 --> 01:29:54,743
- I get this feeling at times. - Number two is fake?

2619
01:29:55,143 --> 01:29:56,513
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

2620
01:29:57,543 --> 01:29:58,613
(Groaning)

2621
01:29:59,543 --> 01:30:00,682
Gosh, we...

2622
01:30:00,683 --> 01:30:03,013
(A heartbreaking pain)

2623
01:30:03,483 --> 01:30:04,483
(Sighing)

2624
01:30:05,853 --> 01:30:08,352
(Current score: 1 win and 5 losses)

2625
01:30:08,353 --> 01:30:10,322
(D-65 before the Episode 6 shoot)

2626
01:30:10,323 --> 01:30:11,622
This was worked on two months before the shoot again?

2627
01:30:11,623 --> 01:30:14,592
(The production crew was looking for hot place ideas for Yongsan.)

2628
01:30:14,593 --> 01:30:16,393
(Yongsan hot place)

2629
01:30:17,193 --> 01:30:19,033
So this actually appeared.

2630
01:30:20,163 --> 01:30:21,363
What is that?

2631
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:24,432
(A banner with feet?)

2632
01:30:24,433 --> 01:30:26,102
(The daughter from Jeju who learned how to make galbi from her father)

2633
01:30:26,103 --> 01:30:27,942
So the restaurant was real.

2634
01:30:27,943 --> 01:30:29,543
(There are extraordinary messages on it as well!)

2635
01:30:30,513 --> 01:30:32,272
(How is there a human banner?)

2636
01:30:32,273 --> 01:30:33,983
Gosh, she went through so much.

2637
01:30:35,383 --> 01:30:36,412
That was great of her.

2638
01:30:36,413 --> 01:30:37,983
That was truly great of her. Gosh.

2639
01:30:38,783 --> 01:30:40,752
(Take coffee for free)

2640
01:30:40,753 --> 01:30:43,793
(Who are you?)

2641
01:30:45,423 --> 01:30:47,523
We watched a short video of you.

2642
01:30:47,723 --> 01:30:51,663
You were working hard to promote the place with a banner on you.

2643
01:30:52,603 --> 01:30:54,063
I did whatever I could.

2644
01:30:54,503 --> 01:30:56,632
There wasn't much I could do while the place was under construction.

2645
01:30:56,633 --> 01:30:58,103
That was why I decided to go out...

2646
01:30:58,433 --> 01:30:59,772
- and do anything... - That's amazing of her.

2647
01:30:59,773 --> 01:31:01,702
- on my own. - She seems to be very bright.

2648
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:03,243
She's an amazing person.

2649
01:31:03,613 --> 01:31:06,183
Hello. It has been one year since I have come from Jeju Island.

2650
01:31:06,613 --> 01:31:08,342
I have been a meat restaurant owner for a month now...

2651
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:09,713
and my name is Jung Ji Won.

2652
01:31:10,183 --> 01:31:12,623
My father runs a meat restaurant.

2653
01:31:13,423 --> 01:31:14,782
I worked at my father's restaurant...

2654
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:16,693
- for around 4 and a half years. - She saved 100,000 dollars?

2655
01:31:17,753 --> 01:31:19,122
While working at the meat restaurant,

2656
01:31:19,123 --> 01:31:20,522
- I saved 100,000 dollars... - She's amazing.

2657
01:31:20,523 --> 01:31:22,262
And I got a loan of around 50,000 dollars.

2658
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:24,292
So it cost me around 150,000 dollars for the restaurant.

2659
01:31:24,293 --> 01:31:25,533
(She opened a meat restaurant with 150,000 dollars.)

2660
01:31:26,003 --> 01:31:29,063
(She's a young owner that deserves praise.)

2661
01:31:29,203 --> 01:31:30,502
I got a loan,

2662
01:31:30,503 --> 01:31:31,972
and going out of business is the last thing I want to do.

2663
01:31:31,973 --> 01:31:33,943
That is why I'm giving it my all for this.

2664
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:36,042
(The human banner came to life...)

2665
01:31:36,043 --> 01:31:38,072
(out of the desperation of the rookie owner.)

2666
01:31:38,073 --> 01:31:39,113
She's amazing.

2667
01:31:40,013 --> 01:31:41,913
(She's a Gen MZ owner who reveals her own place of origin.)

2668
01:31:42,653 --> 01:31:43,852
(She uploaded her business story...)

2669
01:31:43,853 --> 01:31:44,912
That's amazing of her.

2670
01:31:44,913 --> 01:31:49,423
(and promotional short videos on social media.)

2671
01:31:50,053 --> 01:31:51,822
(The young owner who is working hard every day for her dream)

2672
01:31:51,823 --> 01:31:53,762
She went through so much.

2673
01:31:53,763 --> 01:31:55,222
(However!)

2674
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:56,363
What is it?

2675
01:31:56,863 --> 01:31:59,863
(When the production crew visited during lunch...)

2676
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:03,132
I'm not getting many customers during lunchtime.

2677
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:04,303
(The restaurant is empty during lunchtime.)

2678
01:32:04,633 --> 01:32:07,272
This area is full of office buildings.

2679
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:09,513
(The place in Namyeong Station is located by an office complex.)

2680
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:13,142
If there isn't a lunchtime menu,

2681
01:32:13,143 --> 01:32:14,843
I don't think many office workers will come.

2682
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:17,652
It would be hard to grill meat for lunch...

2683
01:32:17,653 --> 01:32:19,183
as it would make the clothes smell.

2684
01:32:19,853 --> 01:32:21,222
(There needs to be a solution for the young owner who is stuck!)

2685
01:32:21,223 --> 01:32:23,353
Gosh, it perfectly worked out.

2686
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:26,292
(A special helper for the rookie owner!)

2687
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:27,363
Who is it?

2688
01:32:28,123 --> 01:32:30,192
(Do you remember the AI omakase?)

2689
01:32:30,193 --> 01:32:31,493
AI omakase?

2690
01:32:31,793 --> 01:32:33,532
How will we ever get it right?

2691
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:36,072
It might end with us getting it right just once.

2692
01:32:36,073 --> 01:32:38,703
(The members were completely fooled.)

2693
01:32:39,403 --> 01:32:40,873
You guys are getting it wrong even on screen.

2694
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:42,173
(Shutting his eyes tight)

2695
01:32:42,273 --> 01:32:43,543
- We mostly got it wrong. - Hey!

2696
01:32:43,773 --> 01:32:45,243
We only got it right once.

2697
01:32:46,243 --> 01:32:48,583
(Michelin 1 Star for 4 consecutive years)

2698
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:50,153
It's him!

2699
01:32:50,783 --> 01:32:51,852
Chef Kim.

2700
01:32:51,853 --> 01:32:53,883
(Chef Kim Do Yun)

2701
01:32:54,153 --> 01:32:56,492
- She's from Jeju Island. - He was the one that helped?

2702
01:32:56,493 --> 01:32:58,723
- She runs a meat restaurant. - Surely she got help from him.

2703
01:32:59,393 --> 01:33:00,393
(If that's so...)

2704
01:33:00,394 --> 01:33:02,223
First of all, Jeju Island...

2705
01:33:02,663 --> 01:33:05,163
is known for its green tea.

2706
01:33:06,703 --> 01:33:08,703
Right. Jeju Island is known for its green tea.

2707
01:33:09,303 --> 01:33:11,733
It was a bit strange that Osulloc green tea was used.

2708
01:33:12,473 --> 01:33:13,702
- I'm really sorry, Mimi. - Osulloc...

2709
01:33:13,703 --> 01:33:15,302
- We missed all of what you said. - Right.

2710
01:33:15,303 --> 01:33:17,312
- No one listened to me. - Right.

2711
01:33:17,313 --> 01:33:18,572
- No one listened. - I'm sorry, Mimi.

2712
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:20,712
- You should've mentioned it. - I did!

2713
01:33:20,713 --> 01:33:22,343
- You should've mentioned Osulloc. - I did!

2714
01:33:23,183 --> 01:33:25,153
(And so, )

2715
01:33:25,713 --> 01:33:28,752
(we went to Jeju Island to develop the matcha galbitang!)

2716
01:33:28,753 --> 01:33:29,852
Gosh, that's just amazing.

2717
01:33:29,853 --> 01:33:32,223
(Will they be able to find the right tea for galbitang?)

2718
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,522
(They taste the matcha noodles...)

2719
01:33:34,523 --> 01:33:37,363
(for the development of the matcha broth.)

2720
01:33:38,393 --> 01:33:39,533
(Satisfied)

2721
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:42,063
- This one tastes clean, right? - Yes. It's delicious.

2722
01:33:42,633 --> 01:33:46,203
The matcha makes it feel like boiled pork.

2723
01:33:47,073 --> 01:33:50,313
(It's time to choose the right tea.)

2724
01:33:50,873 --> 01:33:52,643
(Starting from the green tea newly harvested this year, )

2725
01:33:53,243 --> 01:33:57,083
(they tried many different types.)

2726
01:33:57,313 --> 01:33:58,653
This will be perfect for soup dishes.

2727
01:34:00,453 --> 01:34:03,252
(The tea with a rich flavor and less bitterness was chosen.)

2728
01:34:03,253 --> 01:34:05,123
It will enhance the gamey smell when put in hot water.

2729
01:34:05,353 --> 01:34:07,193
Potatoes will be added to add a savory flavor.

2730
01:34:07,423 --> 01:34:09,263
Just match it to this level of concentration.

2731
01:34:09,763 --> 01:34:11,092
(She even learned how to whisk the matcha.)

2732
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:14,262
So after doing that, the tea was added to the dish.

2733
01:34:14,263 --> 01:34:16,062
(The matcha galbitang with a rich broth is ready!)

2734
01:34:16,063 --> 01:34:17,402
That was really good.

2735
01:34:17,403 --> 01:34:18,672
(However...)

2736
01:34:18,673 --> 01:34:19,703
What?

2737
01:34:20,643 --> 01:34:22,302
(The owner was called a trot singer.)

2738
01:34:22,303 --> 01:34:23,543
Gosh, what is all this?

2739
01:34:24,543 --> 01:34:26,743
(Is she really a trot singer?)

2740
01:34:27,113 --> 01:34:30,013
The theme of Episode Six is The Owner's Double Life.

2741
01:34:30,353 --> 01:34:32,753
What kind of double life would be right for her?

2742
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,882
She's always full of energy.

2743
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:37,723
She dreamed of becoming a celebrity.

2744
01:34:39,293 --> 01:34:41,492
- She was full of talent. - Right. A lot of talent.

2745
01:34:41,493 --> 01:34:42,663
She knew how to do many different things.

2746
01:34:42,793 --> 01:34:44,833
As she's full of energy,

2747
01:34:44,963 --> 01:34:46,503
how would it be if we make her into a trot singer?

2748
01:34:47,533 --> 01:34:49,602
- So she's not a trot singer? - She's not a trot singer.

2749
01:34:49,603 --> 01:34:50,632
No wonder her singing wasn't that...

2750
01:34:50,633 --> 01:34:51,872
- Her singing was... - Right?

2751
01:34:51,873 --> 01:34:52,873
I couldn't mention it as...

2752
01:34:52,874 --> 01:34:54,272
-I didn't want to hurt her feelings. -Right?

2753
01:34:54,273 --> 01:34:55,273
She looked so shy...

2754
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:56,772
when she was supposed to be a professional singer.

2755
01:34:56,773 --> 01:34:58,873
She even kept her eyes closed.

2758
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,853

01:35:11,393 --> 01:35:13,223
So it was made by AI.

No wonder. "Welcome..."

2767
01:35:20,303 --> 01:35:21,862
- sounded too corny. - Right.

2768
01:35:21,863 --> 01:35:23,033
That was such a corny title.

- My photo? - See? It wasn't taken with her.

2789
01:36:12,053 --> 01:36:13,222
That's fine.

2790
01:36:13,223 --> 01:36:14,722
That sounds like fun.

2791
01:36:14,723 --> 01:36:16,323
(She allowed her photo to be used.)

2792
01:36:16,723 --> 01:36:18,522
(Hello, Manager. May we use her photos taken with Kim So You?)

2793
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,262
(Yes. You may use them.)

2794
01:36:20,263 --> 01:36:22,863
(Both of them allowed their photos to be used.)

2795
01:36:23,693 --> 01:36:26,093
- So it was Photoshopped? - It was edited?

2796
01:36:27,203 --> 01:36:28,362
But... Gosh!

2797
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:29,602
(The owner's face was edited in.)

2798
01:36:29,603 --> 01:36:31,833
(The original photo that looked like this...)

2799
01:36:32,673 --> 01:36:34,642
- That's just... - Gosh!

2800
01:36:34,643 --> 01:36:36,372
That was done so well.

2801
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:38,113
(Photo editing is easy, isn't it?)

2802
01:36:38,413 --> 01:36:40,913
- It did feel quite awkward. - Right.

2803
01:36:41,313 --> 01:36:43,382
(Another helper was met in person.)

2804
01:36:43,383 --> 01:36:44,413
Yes?

2805
01:36:46,453 --> 01:36:47,752
- Hello. - Hello.

2806
01:36:47,753 --> 01:36:48,822
It's Hong Ja.

2807
01:36:48,823 --> 01:36:50,423
(Trot singer, Hong Ja)

2808
01:36:50,493 --> 01:36:52,053
It's so hard to predict.

2809
01:36:52,753 --> 01:36:54,362
Gosh, how are we supposed to figure that out?

2810
01:36:54,363 --> 01:36:55,692
This was done so meticulously.

2811
01:36:55,693 --> 01:36:57,462
(From a regular meat restaurant owner, )

2812
01:36:57,463 --> 01:37:00,132
(she made a great transformation into a trot singer.)

2813
01:37:00,133 --> 01:37:04,032
Yongsan has many famous meat restaurants.

2814
01:37:04,033 --> 01:37:06,742
While I was torn about what to do...

2815
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:08,172
to survive in this red ocean,

2816
01:37:08,173 --> 01:37:10,442
I felt really grateful to get this opportunity.

2817
01:37:10,443 --> 01:37:12,372
I will do my best...

2818
01:37:12,373 --> 01:37:15,442
to make this place a top meat restaurant in Yongsan.

2819
01:37:15,443 --> 01:37:16,853
Sixth Sense,

2820
01:37:17,253 --> 01:37:19,922
I am not a trot singer...

2821
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:21,823
and this dish is fake.

2822
01:37:23,253 --> 01:37:24,352
(Matcha galbitang)

2823
01:37:24,353 --> 01:37:28,222
(Fake)

2824
01:37:28,223 --> 01:37:30,563
- We really wish you the best. - Right.

2825
01:37:30,963 --> 01:37:32,563
- Make it big! - You deserve it.

2826
01:37:33,863 --> 01:37:34,962
- In the future... - During the next shoot,

2827
01:37:34,963 --> 01:37:36,402
I should definitely follow Mimi's opinion.

2828
01:37:36,403 --> 01:37:37,472
I'm sorry, Mimi.

2829
01:37:37,473 --> 01:37:40,343
- I'm quite good at this. - Well...

2830
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:43,443
Can you cut out the part of me saying it's number three on my own?

2831
01:37:44,273 --> 01:37:45,443
I feel so stupid.

2832
01:37:46,073 --> 01:37:47,912
You never mentioned number two a single time.

2833
01:37:47,913 --> 01:37:49,512
She kept saying it was number three.

2834
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:51,553
- Right. - You're totally off.

2835
01:37:52,883 --> 01:37:54,752
Gosh, what do we do?

2836
01:37:54,753 --> 01:37:55,882
We got it wrong again.

2837
01:37:55,883 --> 01:37:58,322
Gosh. We got it right once out of six attempts.

2838
01:37:58,323 --> 01:37:59,323
Last week...

2839
01:37:59,863 --> 01:38:01,022
It's time to decide on who will serve the penalty.

2840
01:38:01,023 --> 01:38:02,363
Do you know what our penalty is?

2841
01:38:02,523 --> 01:38:04,993
(The penalty is to upload a cringeworthy post for 24 hours.)

2842
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:07,032
(Hae Ri sticks in her hand naturally.)

2843
01:38:07,033 --> 01:38:08,762
- Just pick one? - Yes.

2844
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:10,472
- Oh, no! - That just drives me crazy.

2845
01:38:10,473 --> 01:38:12,002
Hold on! Why did she get to pick?

2846
01:38:12,003 --> 01:38:13,972
- I don't know. - I thought everyone picked one.

2847
01:38:13,973 --> 01:38:14,973
It's over once one name is picked.

2848
01:38:15,443 --> 01:38:16,542
- That's not it. - It's over once one name is picked.

2849
01:38:16,543 --> 01:38:18,342
- You thought everyone went. - Do I just open it now?

2850
01:38:18,343 --> 01:38:19,343
- Yes. - Please don't be me.

2851
01:38:19,413 --> 01:38:21,012
- It must be. - I don't think it's me.

2852
01:38:21,013 --> 01:38:22,242
- No way! - It's not me.

2853
01:38:22,243 --> 01:38:23,313
- Who is it? - It's me, isn't it?

2854
01:38:23,853 --> 01:38:24,952
It's you!

2855
01:38:24,953 --> 01:38:28,182
(It's you, Kang Min Kyung.)

2856
01:38:28,183 --> 01:38:29,483
- Gosh! - Nice one.

2857
01:38:29,953 --> 01:38:31,492
There you go.

2858
01:38:31,493 --> 01:38:32,892
- Nice one. - That was great.

2859
01:38:32,893 --> 01:38:33,893
Nice one, Min Kyung.

2860
01:38:33,894 --> 01:38:35,823
(The penalty post can be found on her social media page now!)

2861
01:38:35,972 --> 01:38:37,701
(Seventh City Tour)

2862
01:38:37,702 --> 01:38:38,741
(A tourist city...)

2863
01:38:38,742 --> 01:38:40,242
(with culture and art)

2864
01:38:41,072 --> 01:38:42,572
(Paju)

2865
01:38:42,972 --> 01:38:45,242
(Today's strange theme, Drama City Paju?)

2866
01:38:46,882 --> 01:38:49,211
(Shocking...)

2867
01:38:49,212 --> 01:38:51,621
(and even more shocking)

2868
01:38:51,622 --> 01:38:53,751
(A fake place with a dramatic twist is coming.)

2869
01:38:53,752 --> 01:38:56,391
(For the Paju Tour with the most stunning sights, )

2870
01:38:56,392 --> 01:38:59,222
(which special guest will join them?)

2871
01:38:59,322 --> 01:39:02,232
(Wonpil and Young K of DAY6)

2872
01:39:02,792 --> 01:39:05,102
(Has a rising star of deduction appeared?)

2873
01:39:05,462 --> 01:39:07,472
(He points things out with a smile.)

2874
01:39:07,702 --> 01:39:10,542
(Each item is looked at sharply.)

2875
01:39:10,672 --> 01:39:11,871
(Thinking)

2876
01:39:11,872 --> 01:39:12,971
(I can't stand being curious!)

2877
01:39:12,972 --> 01:39:14,442
(Rising star of deduction, Wonpil)

2878
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:16,042
(Hold on.)

2879
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:17,482
(Eyes opening wide)

2880
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:19,042
(Right!)

2881
01:39:19,043 --> 01:39:20,652
(The members get surprised by Wonpil's hunch.)

2882
01:39:21,152 --> 01:39:23,682
(While everyone is making their deductions seriously...)

2883
01:39:23,982 --> 01:39:25,351
(Have you tried the risotto?)

2884
01:39:25,352 --> 01:39:26,592
(No.)

2885
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:28,321
(It's really good.)

2886
01:39:28,322 --> 01:39:30,621
(You aren't interested in finding the fake place.)

2887
01:39:30,622 --> 01:39:31,821
(Eating)

2888
01:39:31,822 --> 01:39:32,922
(Eating some more)

2889
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:35,691
(Eating again)

2890
01:39:35,692 --> 01:39:39,031
(Foodie K lets Wonpil make the deductions.)

2891
01:39:39,032 --> 01:39:41,572
(A page of the City Tour written with the DAY6 members)

2892
01:39:42,272 --> 01:39:43,272
(I want to see it.)

2893
01:39:43,273 --> 01:39:44,401
(I'm curious.)

2894
01:39:44,402 --> 01:39:45,842
(Why don't you come and check it out next week?)
