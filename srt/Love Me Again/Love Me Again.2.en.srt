1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,040
To night.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,400
Please, stay with me.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,359
What do you think your talent is?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,120
Perseverance.

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,920
Can perseverance be a talent?

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,079
I like this one.

7
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,560
Hey!

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,439
Welcome to AGA1N.

9
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,879
I’m Plaifah.

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,200
Don’t frighten her!

11
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,920
She looks so scared.

12
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,000
I’m Bee.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
Nice to meet everyone.

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
Hi, I’m Mimi.

15
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,759
I’m Nadear.

16
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,960
No need to pull faces, ok?

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,360
Don’t take her seriously, Bee.

18
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,319
Nadear is always like this.

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,120
By the way.

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,879
I’m Kumpuy.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,479
the sexiest one.

22
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,280
Nice to meet you.

23
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,240
Nice to meet you too.

24
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,879
Alright, that enough.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,120
Can you girls not make it any harder for her?

26
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,599
Thank you.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
This is Cherrie.

28
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,560
The team captain.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,960
Nice to meet you, Cherrie.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
Don’t be a handicap for our team, got it?

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,759
Don’t take her personally.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,280
Let’s go and nail this.

33
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,960
Should we start?

34
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,479
Can we go over the routine here?

35
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,039
Give me some energy peeps!

36
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
Kumpuy, music please.

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
Can we take a little break?

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
I need to catch a breath.

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,759
Bee,

40
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,879
we’ve gone over this for hours.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,879
Why haven’t you got it yet.

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
I’m really sorry.

43
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,959
Can we go over this one more time?

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,439
I’ll try harder.

45
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,120
How many times have I heard this from you.

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,719
20 Times, I'm counting it.

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Plaifah.

48
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,479
Is it time for a joke?

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Enough.

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,079
Please.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,680
Bee,

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,800
let me be straight with you here.

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
I don't get it.

54
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,480
You’re the worst of all people at audition.

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,639
I don’t understand why Pop let you through.

56
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,439
Do you want to disappoint him?

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,919
If I can’t master this by end of this week,

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
I’ll go.

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,279
Would that make everyone happy now?

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,680
We hope you...

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,680
keep your word.

62
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,639
On point!

63
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Ouch!!

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,040
What happened?

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,920
Are you hurt?

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Are you ok?

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,600
Take a break, shall we?

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
Bee, are you ok?

69
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,120
Can you get up?

70
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,560
Take it easy.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,000
Owww!

72
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,040
After all, who caused this mess?

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
It’s my fault.

74
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
I’m sorry.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,879
Let’s just carry on.

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,920
I think we should take a break.

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,120
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

78
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,160
Yeah. You should take a break...

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,480
so we can just go ahead.

80
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,439
If everyone is still able to practice.

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,879
So carry on.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,800
Bee will need to take a break.

83
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,279
Let me help you.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
No no. I’m doing just fine.

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,279
It’s ok.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
Take it easy.

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
Thank you.

88
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,199
You will need a few days.

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,439
So attractive.

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,560
How’s it been today?

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,959
How’s the practice.

92
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,560
Bee.

93
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Bee.

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
How’s the practice?

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,240
Ah.

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,920
Well,

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,680
just as you know.

98
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,160
Sorry for disappointing you.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,240
Totally fine.

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't forget that.

101
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,680
It’s only your first day here.

102
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,360
And you have plenty of time to adjust.

103
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,360
Don’t worry about it.

104
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
But I’ve told Cherrie.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
if I still can’t make it this week...

106
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
I’ll leave.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Listen to me now.

108
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,438
Becoming an idol has a lot with being a good team member.

109
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,240
Very talented person or less talented person.

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
Doesn't as important as teamwork.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,920
So,

112
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,360
if you can’t fit in,

113
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,920
or you’re not accepted by the rest of them.

114
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
There’s nothing I can do about it.

115
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,240
No matter how much I like you.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,480
I mean...

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,920
no matter how much I like

118
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,680
your enthusiasm.

119
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,879
You know what I mean, right?

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,160
Yes, I got it.

121
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,240
And one more thing.

122
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920
Plaifah will be your buddy.

123
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
You both will share a room together.

124
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,480
Plaifah?

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,480
Yes.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,920
Or you prefer...

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,720
Cherrie instead?

128
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,040
No, it’s ok.

129
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
I’ll have Plaifah.

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,239
But you should get along well with Cherrie too.

131
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,600
Would you like to be with Cherrie?

132
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
Plaifah will do.

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
I think it's ok.

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,120
I think so too.

135
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,480
Much better with Plaifah.

136
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,960
Hi.

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Shit!

138
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,759
Hi,

139
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
what would you like today?

140
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,320
Umm...

141
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,639
I’ll have...

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Thai tea double cocoa lava.

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
Coming up.

144
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,639
A moment please.

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,399
Yes.

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,320
So,

147
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
about Pueng.

148
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
Are you not gonna tell me?

149
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,600
I can’t.

150
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,000
You can't?

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
If you can't.

152
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
Does anyone else know where she is?

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
I don’t think so bro.

154
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,639
She’s gone…for good.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,360
You should...

156
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,840
just concentrate on your band and make it happen.

157
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,720
I’m sorry?

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,879
Well...

159
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
Well...

160
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,720
Well, Pueng knows you love your job very much.

161
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,519
If you succeed,

162
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
this would make her really really happy.

163
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,720
Here’s your drink.

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,639
Thank you.

165
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,240
Slide.

166
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,600
It's has to slide.

167
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,000
Mimi.

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,759
Hmm?

169
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,879
Can you help Bee out here?

170
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,000
See?

171
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
She looks terrible.

172
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,480
Here.

173
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,000
This thing massages and cleans with foam at the same time.

174
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,600
2 in 1!!

175
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,480
Do you have Anything for...

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
Body works?

177
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,960
Body works?

178
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,960
Then,

179
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
Here is it.

180
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,000
Soap with Sakura rice beads.

181
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Your skin will be so soft and smooth.

182
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
But...

183
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
What is it?

184
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,759
Why does it sound so familiar.

185
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
Like an ad.

186
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,240
I think so too.

187
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,480
Bee, Kumpuy.

188
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,320
Look at Mimi here.

189
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,360
Do you see it?

190
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,360
Haven’t you heard.

191
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,360
That a woman’s greatest asset is her beauty.

192
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,000
That’s why I take such good care of myself.

193
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
And have you heard a thing called Botox?

194
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,600
One shot and that’s it!

195
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,080
You look great, Mimi.

196
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
Thanks.

197
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,600
Pop is so kind to Bee, don’t you think?

198
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,360
A lot!

199
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,759
Like a lot.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,120
You and Pop.

201
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,480
Did you two know each other?

202
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,080
No way!

203
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,480
I only just got to know him.

204
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,240
So,

205
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,600
How do I use this, Mimi?

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
This one?

207
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
This is called cleansing oil & foam.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,600
Massage it in to remove makeup

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,120
then it turns into light foam.

210
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,519
It’s 2 in 1.

211
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Why is your face so white?

212
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,879
Wait wait, sorry.

213
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,360
Oh I’ve got this thing on.

214
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,240
It is so so white!

215
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Well,

216
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,878
Mimi gave this to me. I think it’s some kind of a mask.

217
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,080
Maybe I’m not used to it.

218
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,519
Haven’t shared a room with anyone before.

219
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,000
I’m not a ghost.

220
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,479
Relax...

221
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,399
just go to bed.

222
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,519
You scared the shit out of me!

223
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,519
Alright then.

224
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,240
You want me to stay up with you?

225
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,399
Ok.

226
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,000
As if dancing is not tiring enough.

227
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,200
Pop wants us to have 6-pack.

228
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,200
Why would we need a 6-pack for?

229
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,120
You guys go ahead.

230
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,480
Ow!!

231
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,320
Bee, are you ok?

232
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,000
It’s my ankle again.

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,200
Which ankle?

234
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,639
The same spot.

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,759
This is so off!

236
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
Hey Plaifah,

237
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,000
you slept with her...

238
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,759
you notice anything strange about Bee?

239
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,600
Strange?

240
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
Yeah.

241
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,120
I guess she does a lot of toss and turn when she sleeps.

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,039
Not that!

243
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,720
You’ve just recovered.

244
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,240
But you've come to race with me.

245
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,600
Give me one more week.

246
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,240
And I can definitely catch up with you.

247
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,840
You think so, huh?

248
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,879
But it’s good too see

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
that you’re not giving up.

250
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,840
Do you jog like this everyday?

251
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,480
How can I ask you all to do it...

252
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,960
if I don’t set an example, right?

253
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
From now on,

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
keep your eyes on her.

255
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,480
And report back to me.

256
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
I want no scandals in our group.

257
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,120
Do you have something...

258
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
on your mind lately?

259
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
I think,

260
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,960
I'm not good enough just yet.

261
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,600
No one’s ever made it overnight.

262
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,360
So,

263
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,120
why don’t you use your strengths to shine?

264
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,000
Do I have any?

265
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,840
For this one I think.

266
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,879
Bee.

267
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
That’s for you to find out.

268
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,600
Alright, everyone go to your mark.

269
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,360
Nadear, music!

270
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,120
Move closer.

271
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,360
One.

272
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,120
Two.

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,360
Three.

274
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,440
Bee, are you hurt?

275
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,160
All over! Haven’t been exercising that much.

276
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,319
Girls!

277
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,279
How are your followers looking?

278
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,359
I just hit 5K.

279
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,160
Should have asked us first.

280
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,119
When would she realize that.

281
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
Brilliant, Mimi!

282
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,559
That’s great!

283
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Thanks.

284
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,519
Mine’s almost at 2K.

285
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,440
That’s not bad.

286
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,839
Anyone else?

287
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,839
Nothing to worry.

288
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,359
Actually, what I wanted to say this weekend.

289
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,400
We...

290
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,440
will...

291
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,680
take a break.

292
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,119
No practice, You can all go home and rest.

293
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,920
Yeah!

294
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,119
Bee.

295
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,680
You can get a ride home with me if that’s ok?

296
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,640
I’ll meet you outside.

297
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,119
OK.

298
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,279
OMG.

299
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,200
Are you guys…

300
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,920
No.

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,680
There’s nothing going on.

302
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,759
Are you sure?

303
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,839
Let me tell you this.

304
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,519
Cherrie is keeping her eyes on you.

305
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,318
Pop has quite a reputation

306
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,599
so we all need to be very careful about this.

307
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,799
What reputation?

308
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,359
He...

309
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,119
used to have a thing with Cathy SMA7H and they got caught!

310
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,359
I’m off now.

311
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,839
Thanks for dropping me off.

312
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Wait!

313
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,839
Sorry about that.

314
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,599
Uh.

315
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
A moment ago.

316
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,799
Are you ok?

317
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,159
You’ve been very quiet on our way back.

318
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,440
And you didn’t say much.

319
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,920
Aren’t you afraid...

320
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,200
they will gossip about us?

321
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,200
So this’s what’s on your mind?

322
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,759
Look.

323
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,559
I know

324
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,319
what I’m doing,

325
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,119
and I think

326
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,759
you know it too.

327
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,358
You must have...

328
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,680
heard the rumors.

329
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,400
But they’re just rumors.

330
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,039
The truth is...

331
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,119
Nothing bad happened.

332
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,440
And if you feel...

333
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,799
uncomfortable about it,

334
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,118
I can leave some space between us.

335
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,279
You don’t need to do that.

336
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,880
I didn’t mean to seem uncomfortable.

337
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,279
I’m totally fine.

338
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:33,880
OK.

339
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,359
Thanks again for the ride.

340
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,599
OK.

341
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,119
Bee,

342
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,759
Bee, wait!

343
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,559
Oh God!

344
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,079
What now!?

345
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,519
Where are you off to, uncle?

346
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,640
Uncle?

347
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,039
Yes. You. Uncle!

348
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,838
I saw that!

349
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,079
You were holding her hands.

350
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,519
Bullshit!

351
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,599
wait, wait, wait.

352
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,759
You’re trying to go after her, aren’t you?

353
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,039
Going after her?

354
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,518
Drink your milk and go to bed,

355
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,799
kiddo!

356
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,799
Wait!

357
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,359
How you do know I...

358
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,359
drink milk before bed.

359
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,319
No one knows about this.

360
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,519
Are you done?

361
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,400
Listen to me.

362
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,400
Bee...

363
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,599
is Pueng’s niece.

364
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,079
She’s just staying here for a while.

365
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,680
Who the hell...

366
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,920
are you?

367
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,519
Me?

368
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,359
Yeah.

369
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,960
I am her manager.

370
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,599
Oh...

371
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,599
Alright.

372
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,039
My name is Meng.

373
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,960
I’m her boyfriend.

374
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,559
Huh?

375
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,200
I’m..her..boyfriend.

376
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,118
Stop right there.

377
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:23,960
Where do you think you’re going?

378
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,920
I’m here to see Bee.

379
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,039
You can’t.

380
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,880
Why not? I’m her boyfriend.

381
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,118
What boyfriend? Which Meng?

382
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,598
Get out of my way! I’m going to see her.

383
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,880
No way. You’re not even a customer here.

384
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,400
Keep fighting!

385
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,599
Pueng,

386
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,880
Pueng! Pueng,

387
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,160
Pueng,

388
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,440
Auntie Pueng!

389
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,119
Turn it down a bit, would you?

390
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,200
YOU turn it down….with men I mean.

391
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,599
What men?

392
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,680
Meng was here to see this Bee.

393
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,839
Which Meng?

394
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,159
Maew’s son.

395
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,400
Across the street.

396
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,279
The one with the bike.

397
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,599
I think.

398
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,640
You could have a man at the age of your son!

399
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,200
Shut the F up...

400
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,200
or I’ll cut your pay!

401
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,599
Don’t tell me...

402
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,960
you’re here because you’re fired.

403
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,119
Damn you!

404
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,960
Of course not!

405
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,359
They let me take a break this weekend.

406
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,400
So,

407
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,160
Does Pop know?

408
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,039
Know about what?

409
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,599
Don’t you tell anyone.

410
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,960
OK OK I’ll won’t tell.

411
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,839
Why are you still here. Back to work!

412
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,680
Fine!

413
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,880
Back to work. Now!

414
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,079
Muay,

415
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,119
get to work!

416
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,200
Good morning.

417
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,519
What would you like?

418
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,880
Milk tea. Not too sweet.

419
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,879
Not sweet yet.

420
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,799
Because,

421
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,680
I’m already sweet enough.

422
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,359
Just a sec.

423
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,359
Ok.

424
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,119
You're so good.

425
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,599
You make the tea just like how Pueng used to.

426
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,599
Too bad she’s gone for good.

427
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,519
I’m still here, you moron.

428
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,599
Taste as good as the one making it.

429
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,680
Thank you. Would that be all?

430
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,279
Yes, thank you.

431
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,599
How is it?

432
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:15,920
Very nice. Not too sweet like I ordered.

433
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,359
Drink it up.

434
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,359
Why don’t you take it home with you.

435
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:24,880
Oh! I forgot.

436
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,759
This is so good. You’re good!

437
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,559
And this…is their signature routine.

438
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,799
Look at Kathy!

439
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
She gets so high up.

440
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,839
The rest is also catching up.

441
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,559
Let's continue.

442
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,119
This is a summation of stats.

443
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,278
Look at the score! everyone scored 600.

444
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,758
Kathy’s also at 600.

445
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,599
How’s the plan?

446
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,200
Good…

447
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,119
Bloody hell,

448
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,359
there’s nothing ‘good’ about this.

449
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,839
And what’s with these bloody giraffes and flowers and trees.

450
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,799
I know we’re the best,

451
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,880
but don’t you think we’re underestimating Pop here?

452
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
Such a waste.

453
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,519
What did you just say?

454
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,359
It would be such a waste of time to even think about them.

455
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,359
I’ve sent in my Natasha.

456
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,359
Natasha?

457
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,119
Yep.

458
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,119
Who?

459
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,920
Duh. Natasha Romanoff, Natasha the spy.

460
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,880
A spy huh?

461
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,039
Since when?

462
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,119
Since the very beginning.

463
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,079
I’ve been aware of their moves all along.

464
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,839
Wow.

465
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,119
You’re so good

466
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,680
at being bad.

467
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,119
You are such a classic and absolute asshole.

468
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,200
Come in.

469
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,359
Why don’t you tell Satta.

470
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,920
What’s on your mind.

471
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,440
Well, I think our performance has dropped a lot.

472
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,599
Not as intense as it used to be.

473
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,880
We have no advance briefing of our opponent

474
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,119
with less time for practice prep.

475
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,160
You should be thankful we’re great enough to have survived.

476
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,119
Satta.

477
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,119
Stop minding other people’s business

478
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,079
and focus on what’s in front of you, Satta.

479
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,839
If we lose,

480
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,319
you’re the one to take responsibility.

481
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,799
Noted.

482
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,200
Were you serious about firing me?

483
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,359
Have I ever joked?

484
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,599
How can I survive without a job?

485
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,880
I have a lot of burdens.

486
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:23,279
Haven’t you heard ‘A loser loses everything’.

487
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,160
Who would be taking care of your if I’m not around.

488
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,440
I'm just joking with you.

489
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,519
I just...

490
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
I was just pressuring them,

491
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,319
But you…

492
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,960
you should be firm with them too

493
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,640
or else you won’t have them under control.

494
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,440
I know.

495
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,359
You know Pop well, don’t you?

496
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,200
Don’t you worry.

497
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:04,119
I’ll crush him with my own hands.

498
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
Pretty please.

499
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,199
Nadear,

500
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,440
Turn that off!

501
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,680
5 minutes break.

502
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,599
I’ll be back.

503
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,599
Bee is not contributing to our team at all.

504
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,679
I mean she can sing.

505
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,599
But her dance is getting nowhere.

506
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,680
Do you think so?

507
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,359
I think she can do better.

508
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,359
But you know.

509
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:53,599
She cannot even compare to other finalists.

510
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,880
Let me ask you something.

511
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,160
Did you pick her because of personal interests?

512
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,119
I think...

513
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,359
there’s some kind of misunderstanding here.

514
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,599
But that doesn’t make her any better.

515
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,599
About Bee.

516
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Has she ever brought any trouble?

517
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,440
No.

518
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:24,119
Does she make other girls perform better?

519
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:25,839
I guess.

520
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,599
Well, that’s her strength.

521
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,359
Can’t you see?

522
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,559
She’s trying her best to catch up with everyone else.

523
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,960
She encourages everyone...

524
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,400
...for perform better because there’s a newcomer.

525
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,440
Though she’s not good enough.

526
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,160
But she’s trying.

527
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,920
And she’s definitely catching up with everyone.

528
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,440
Especially....

529
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,359
you.

530
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,400
Right?

531
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,680
Everyone.

532
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,359
I’ve talked to Pop.

533
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,880
Bee,

534
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,119
congratulations. You get to go on with us.

535
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:17,559
Congratulations! You made it.

536
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,119
Let’s get dinner together.

537
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,960
But...

538
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,200
you’ll need to continue to work as hard,

539
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,599
got it Bee?

540
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,359
Sure, captain!

541
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,839
Welcome to AGA1N.

542
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,319
You’ve done a great job!

543
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,200
Congrats!!!

544
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,880
Pop.

545
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,640
How can I help you?

546
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,440
I have something I need to talk to you about.

547
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,799
Take seat first, please.

548
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,119
OK.

549
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,920
Meng!

550
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
Meng.

551
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,359
Would you please help me clear that table?

552
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,680
Sure!

553
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,640
What a mess.

554
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,440
What a jerk.

555
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:48,880
It's a phone.

556
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,559
Hi mom.

557
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,599
Yes mon.

558
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,759
Fish sauce, sugar.

559
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,599
Yes mom.

560
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
Yes.

561
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Don’t cross the line, uncle.

562
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,239
I warn you. Don’t cross the line.

563
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,239
I need to go now.

564
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,079
See you soon.

565
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:25,880
Here you go.

566
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,079
Thank you.

567
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,440
So…what do you wanted to say?

568
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,800
I’m just wondering.

569
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,320
if you know what your strengths are now.

570
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,360
Me?

571
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,519
Well, each and everyone in the team

572
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,760
has their own strengths.

573
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,159
And they happen to be almost identical

574
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,239
to SMA7H.

575
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
The only difference

576
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
is you.

577
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,920
Well,

578
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,079
it's me.

579
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,880
I’m the weakest link.

580
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
This is where you’re wrong.

581
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,360
You have something that no one else has.

582
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
You have the perfect memory.

583
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,960
Seriously?

584
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,159
How do you know?

585
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,880
I’ve gone over the clips.

586
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,000
I notice that

587
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,559
every time you do something wrong,

588
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,360
you would try to memorize from others

589
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,000
and keep practicing until it’s flawless.

590
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,920
And then.

591
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,679
Then you stopped making the same mistake

592
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,880
because you’ve got them all in your head. Am I right?

593
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,079
How did you realize that?

594
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,159
To be honest.

595
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,360
You’re that missing piece of the team.

596
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,880
You’re making us all

597
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,880
a better person.

598
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,360
Thank you so much for telling me this.

599
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,079
Yep.

600
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,320
So,

601
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,280
I’ll keep it up.

602
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,400
Keep fighting.

603
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,639
Thank you.

604
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,079
This is so good.

605
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,000
Thanks.

606
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,960
Any more desserts?

607
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,159
Desserts?

608
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,880
Sounds great!

609
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,880
Here it is

610
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,199
our launch plan. It’s 80% done.

611
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,360
I think we’ll make the timeline.

612
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,480
I’m not worried about that all.

613
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,360
What I’m concerned about...

614
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,639
is our rating.

615
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,760
Hear me out.

616
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,960
Why don’t we have one of the team

617
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,239
featured in Jimmy’s music video.

618
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,360
So AGA1N will become mass.

619
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,239
Do you agree?

620
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:29,679
Well,

621
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,239
sounds like a good idea.

622
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,920
But I know that

623
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,639
right now

624
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,559
you’re all tied up with preparation.

625
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,840
So,

626
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Why don’t I help you pick one the girls?

627
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,519
Is that ok with you?

628
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,880
Sure.

629
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,800
I have to excuse myself now.

630
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,400
We’re good?

631
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes, we’re good.

632
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:52,880
I have to go now.

633
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,039
Purim,

634
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,920
I’ve made my decision.

635
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,360
Who I would choose.

636
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,360
Hi.

637
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,519
What’s up.

638
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,280
If it’s not urgent I’ll have everyone carry on.

639
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,159
take it easy.

640
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,320
I hope it is.

641
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,480
We need a break.

642
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,880
OK. I’ll make it urgent.

643
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,800
There’s something I need to say to everyone.

644
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,840
Whoa whoa whoa.

645
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,558
Our sponsor, Mr. Korn,

646
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,880
wants Bee.

647
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,840
To be in his son’s music video, Jimmy.

648
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,440
Is about to release his new single.

649
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,840
Me?

650
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,320
Yep.

651
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,880
I agree with him actually.

652
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,800
We’ll get to promote our band at the same time.

653
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,800
That’s all.

654
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,360
Keep practice.

655
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:27,519
Hey.

656
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,800
Who’s Jimmy?

657
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,360
Google it.

658
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,280
I kinda like you. And would you like me too?

659
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,719
He’s hot!

660
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
He’s so hot.

661
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,360
We get along well. Well to the end.

662
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,000
I kinda like you.

663
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,479
It’s always been you.

664
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,039
I love you smile.

665
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,559
It’s your time, Bee.

666
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,440
I like you and that’s all done.

667
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,000
He's so..

668
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,480
so cute!

669
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,719
Yes?

670
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,840
Pop.

671
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,880
I’m just wondering…why me?

672
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,079
About this?

673
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,320
I’m not exactly sure.

674
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,320
Mr. Korn brought up your name himself.

675
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,000
Cherrie would be a better fit.

676
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,920
Bee,

677
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,679
Are you concerned?

678
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,880
I don’t want anyone to feel bad about me.

679
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,760
They don’t feel that way,

680
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,920
I’m sure.

681
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,840
I’m still concerned.

682
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,440
So,

683
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,519
Why don’t you look at it as an opportunity?

684
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,719
An opportunity for the team.

685
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,519
An opportunity for you

686
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,360
to prove that you can do it.

687
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,880
OK.

688
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,719
You’ll be great.

689
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,800
Well, thank you.

690
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,719
I should go now.

691
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,039
OK.

692
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,000
What do we do now?

693
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,000
Why did she get this job?

694
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
That's right.

695
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,920
Cherrie should get the job.

696
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,519
This is such an overstep.

697
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,159
Cherrie should say something.

698
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,360
Sure.

699
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,199
I won’t take it anymore.

700
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,199
Why are we talking in the dark?

701
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,800
My eyes.

702
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,760
Then we should talk to Pop.

703
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,039
He should switch from Bee to Cherrie.

704
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:04,320
No.

705
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,000
We won’t do anything about it.

706
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,920
We’ll only have to give Bee a heavier training.

707
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's heavy too.

708
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
But how?

709
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,199
If she goes out there and doesn’t perform.

710
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,880
That will reflect back on us.

711
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,079
I won’t let that happen.

712
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,880
Why is it so hard to provoke you.

713
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,000
But...

714
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,879
what’s the MV?

715
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,320
How should we go about it?

716
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,519
Do you know?

717
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,360
Free meal?

718
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,400
Bee,

719
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,280
this is really important for us all.

720
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,639
Because you..

721
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,759
you’ll be the representative of our team.

722
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,480
Being in this MV is a big deal.

723
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:00,639
Acting will need to be perfect.

724
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,320
And that’s why

725
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,920
to day.

726
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,159
You

727
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,079
gonna having an acting class today.

728
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Got it?

729
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,159
Got it.

730
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,239
Understood?

731
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,039
Understood!

732
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,400
Do you all understand?

733
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:19,199
Understood!

734
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:35,639
There might be a crying part.

735
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,679
a sad character.

736
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,519
Now let’s image

737
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,839
a sad incent in your life

738
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,639
it could help.

739
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,360
Can you do it?

740
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,559
No, I can’t.

741
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,199
I can't imagine it.

742
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:56,960
Can I just use an eyedrop?

743
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,079
Would you like some coffee?

744
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,639
Would you like some coff…

745
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,199
I’ve got some moustache in my mouth!

746
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,639
Why do I have to go in disguise?

747
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,000
Just in case you get to play a half kid.

748
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,440
You will need English as well.

749
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,079
Repeat after me.

750
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,519
I’m also just a girl,

751
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,159
who standing in front of a boy,

752
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,840
asking him to love her.

753
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,879
I am a girl

754
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,079
standee…

755
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,280
can you say it again?

756
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,679
Jimmy,

757
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
Here your actress.

758
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,719
Angel.

759
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,479
Stand still!

760
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,679
Seeing fans waiting for us like this.

761
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,639
It's encourage me and my tireness are completely gone.

762
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,159
Is that how Idol feel?

763
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,360
You got it right.
