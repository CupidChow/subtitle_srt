1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,159
Pueng,

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,999
What would you do if you were…

3
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,038
If I were you?

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,799
Hmm (mumbling)

5
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,079
I...

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,119
would prove myself to be better than them, I guess.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,479
Prove?

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,759
What else is there to prove? Huh?

9
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,799
You need to take it slow, Pop.

10
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,479
This world is so unfair!

11
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,519
This could be a test, you know?

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,719
Can you...

13
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:54,959
stay over tonight?

14
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,839
Hello.

15
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:37,839
Where are you!

16
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,959
On my way.

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,678
If you’re so messed up

18
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,759
then you can just email to quit.

19
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,719
No hard feelings.

20
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,639
Yeah whatever.

21
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,598
OK so now that we’re all here,

22
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,279
let’s start the meeting.

23
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,718
First agenda on the list is

24
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,479
about changing the band manager.

25
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,119
I’m sorry,

26
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,039
what did you just say?

27
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,479
Changing the band manager!

28
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,559
Why have I not heard of this before?

29
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,279
What do you mean?

30
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,719
No one has given me a notice on this!

31
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
You should have known.

32
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,719
You should have known!

33
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,879
About what?

34
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,678
We all agree that

35
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:29,039
you should be looking after the 2nd season instead.

36
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,199
They need you.

37
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,479
Me?

38
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,798
I kind of agree with Satta.

39
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:40,079
Who else can be it be.

40
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,479
Do you realize

41
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:45,199
their rating is shockingly low right now.

42
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,199
Can you really just abandon them?

43
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,759
Only you can help them out, Purim.

44
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,799
I’m not a babysitter here.

45
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,238
Purim.

46
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:16,079
As long as you’re still working for the company,

47
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,959
please respect our decision.

48
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,319
We feel as difficult as you are right now.

49
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,358
Difficult?

50
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,279
Yes.

51
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,438
Though you’ve been wanting to kick me out for so long now?

52
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:29,879
Huh?

53
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,399
I believe our decision is a final verdict.

54
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:41,239
Bunlai has made it very clear.

55
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,999
You should take it seriously too, Purim.

56
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,279
Purim!

57
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,318
I’m only giving you an advance notice here.

58
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,518
You will start your new role this coming week.

59
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,918
Does any of you have anything else to say?

60
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,319
Any problem?

61
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,759
huh?

62
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,599
No more question.

63
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:13,279
Good!

64
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,518
Let’s move on to the next agenda then.

65
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,999
It’s Bangkok Music Festival.

66
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:29,719
Sure. I’ll sort this out for you.

67
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,799
What the F….

68
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,039
Wipe your mouth?

69
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,199
What? Something on my face?

70
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,079
Your mouth.

71
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,639
Your mouth.

72
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,678
You.

73
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,879
Lick ass much?

74
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,359
At least I got rid of you.

75
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,559
Don’t be so sure.

76
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
What would a trash like you know.

77
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,079
They all agree with me.

78
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,119
I think...

79
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,159
I know them better.

80
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,679
I know what they would think.

81
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,199
Why don’t you ask them yourself?

82
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,439
Are you defying me?

83
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,718
No, I’m not.

84
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,878
Why don’t you ask them yourself?

85
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,678
They’re right by the fish tank

86
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,999
having a live session.

87
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,199
Hi, I’m Kathy.

88
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,879
Hi, I’m Tangkwa.

89
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,479
Hi, I’m Angle.

90
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,959
Hi, I’m Praeploy.

91
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,479
Hi, I’m Vasa.

92
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,559
Hi, I’m Punch.

93
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,518
Thank you everyone.

94
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,838
Thank you so much.

I love you guys.

See you soon.

104
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,759
Hey,

105
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,879
why did you barge in like that?

106
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,319
But…

107
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,159
If you ever did that again,

108
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:39,879
I’ll have my fans crash you down.

109
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,799
But I don’t have that many followers…yet.

110
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,199
You were such a brat.

111
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,519
What’s your problem? Everyone does it.

112
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,479
B R A T.

113
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,799
and it’s pronounced ‘brat’.

114
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,959
Next time you go on a front row.

115
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,039
Yes.

116
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,719
What did I do wrong?

117
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,999
Shut up!

118
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,959
Stay quiet

119
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,359
or else I’ll tell Satta.

120
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,199
I need to talk to you.

121
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,119
Me?

122
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:55,879
Hmm.

123
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:58,679
But I don’t.

124
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,039
You know about this.

125
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,119
Don’t you?

126
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,519
About what?

127
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,319
About me being taken off the group?

128
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,839
Satta...

129
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,039
And that bloody Satta is taking over.

130
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,798
Oh.

131
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,399
Of course I did.

132
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:25,639
Because...

133
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,599
it was my idea.

134
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,119
Is there a problem?

135
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,559
Look around you.

136
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,839
No one’s listening to you anymore.

137
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,639
You know?

138
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,639
You're...

139
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,198
acting more and more like a nagging uncle by the day.

140
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,399
You’re fussy, you’re boring.

141
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,879
It’s driving me nuts,

142
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:01,839
don’t you realize?

143
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,398
I’m not being fussy, Kathy.

144
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,518
It’s called discipline.

145
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,438
And if you keep being the way you are,

146
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:07,598
one day

147
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,759
other bands

148
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,559
will become far more better than you.

149
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:12,839
Really?

150
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,999
Does it look like I give a shit?

151
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,239
But I do!

152
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,439
We’ve been on this journey together for a long time.

153
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,599
You were a nobody, Kathy.

154
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,679
You were nothing.

155
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,079
No one even recognized you.

156
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,399
So.

157
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,199
Uncle,

158
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:31,839
oh!

159
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,119
I mean bro

160
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:33,959
are you saying

161
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,958
I am who I am today...

162
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,838
because of you?

163
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,799
Is that what you’re saying?

164
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,239
So...

165
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,399
Then why don’t we try NOT having you?

166
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,519
We will prove that we can still make it

167
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,799
without you.

168
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,439
Hey guys.

169
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,519
Come over here.

170
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,479
Take a listen this joke.

171
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:05,318
This old nagging uncle is saying

172
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:08,759
we’ll be nothing without him.

173
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,479
Nothing without him?

174
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:31,158
Oops. Someone slept in?

175
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,959
Whoa what’s good news?

176
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,039
Sold some gold?

177
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,639
Nope.

178
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:39,439
Won lotto?

179
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,439
No!

180
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,358
Oh oh

181
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,719
I know.

182
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,239
Smile like this.

183
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,799
Fresh like this.

184
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,439
Must be a kiss.

185
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,279
No.

186
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,599
More.

187
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,599
With who?

188
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,319
Uncle Nim?

189
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,319
Nooo.

190
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,079
Who else can it be.

191
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,998
Oh well. Don’t wanna know any more.

192
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,119
Walk away and you won’t get paid.

193
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,279
Who was it?

194
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,679
Just tell me.

195
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,479
Pop.

196
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,559
Who?

197
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,799
Pop.

198
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,879
I couldn’t hear you.

199
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,199
It’s Pop.

200
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,399
You’re kidding me!

201
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,959
Wait.

202
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,718
Where are you…?

203
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,999
Bunlai is not…

204
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,639
Where is he?

205
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,039
He’s in the restroom.

206
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,119
Would you like to…

207
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:56,358
You did the right thing.

208
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,798
You think?

209
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,278
Definitely.

210
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,238
Pop is so outdated.

211
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,558
Acting so serious with lots of rules

212
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,318
is not gonna be able to pull it off with the kids.

213
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,119
Do you think you’ll be able to handle?

214
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,439
Sure, I can!

215
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,679
Harder. Make it harder.

216
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,759
Does it feel good?

217
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,199
I’m here to quit!

218
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,119
Hey!

219
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,598
Can’t you see I’m in the middle of something!

220
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,079
You two

221
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,959
really think you can handle the band, huh?

222
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,479
I don’t see how I can’t.

223
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,719
I’m an investor here.

224
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,958
And when I team up with those girls,

225
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,678
you are just one big loser.

226
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,558
A loser huh?

227
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,039
Let me tell you what.

228
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,639
Satta is a real loser.

229
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:52,759
Hey!

230
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,278
Do whatever you want. If you want to quit and prove

231
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,798
whatever shit you think you’re doing then that’s fine.

232
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,159
But please,

233
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,839
please make sure to do it in writing.

234
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,278
We have rules here.

235
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,559
What the f…. what? What do you want?

236
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,279
What?

237
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,479
What?

238
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,879
Bunlai.

239
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,599
What?

240
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,839
You’re hurting my legs…

241
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,199
And my hands too.

242
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,918
Hi. This is Pop – from SMA7H.

243
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,159
I’m calling in regards to your investment…

244
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,999
Did Bunlai send you to talk to me?

245
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,079
Hello,

246
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,678
The deal we’ve talked about.

247
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,478
I would like to ask for an investment

248
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,879
at half the cost of SMA7H.

249
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:18,719
Well… I don’t know.

250
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,878
We feel kinda uncomfortable without Bunlai on board.

251
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,199
Let’s just say…

252
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,478
Can I ask for your faith?

253
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,479
I don’t think so.

254
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,999
I have a project I’d like to propose for your investment.

255
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,319
Bunlai sent me.

256
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,478
Auntie,

257
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,119
You should just give up.

258
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,719
Muay!

259
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,319
I mean it!

260
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,558
Maybe that night was a mistake.

261
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,559
Maybe he’s too ashamed to come see you again.

262
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,999
You!!

263
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,718
You can leave now.

264
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,359
I’ll take care of the rest.

265
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,279
Sure?

266
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,919
Sure.

267
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,759
Hi.

268
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:36,639
This is Pop, Purim from SMA7H.

269
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,999
I am asking

270
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,239
if anyone is interested in investing

271
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,159
with me.

272
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,839
Everyone!

273
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,798
If you have faith in me,

274
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,998
I ask you to...

275
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,639
step out with me!!

276
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,199
I am aware

277
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,599
you’ve been so sick and tired working here

278
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,879
because it’s getting you nowhere.

279
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,438
You have to suck up to this bullshit boss to survive.

280
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:28,319
I mean how can you put up with this shit?

281
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,559
How can you put up with this fucking office?

282
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:34,078
I encourage those of you to step out with me.

283
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,799
Pop Purim,

284
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,599
the only one that believes in you all.

285
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,079
I understand

286
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:08,959
the amount of pressure you’re under

287
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,439
I know you’re worried and threatened.

288
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,999
So whenever you come to terms with it,

289
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,399
feel free to call me.

290
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:17,919
Any time at all...

291
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,079
tomorrow,

292
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,359
the day after,

293
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:24,159
or even next week.

294
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,959
And...

295
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,079
guys...

296
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:34,079
I’m sure you all know where to find my number.

297
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,799
But if you don’t, let me leave a note for you here.

298
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,759
Here!

299
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,039
I will put this here.

300
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,479
I'm...

301
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,199
Pop, Purim.

302
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,039
Those of you who believe in me,

303
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,679
please give me a call.

304
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,359
Resignation forms

305
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,959
are on my desk,

306
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,279
feel free to pick up a copy.

307
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,479
Anyone wants to quit with him?

308
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:37,839
Mr.Korn,

309
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,359
Mr. Purim is here.

310
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,959
Mr. Purim.

311
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,799
Hello Mr. Korn,

312
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,999
I’m Purim.

313
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,479
Thank you so much for your time.

314
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,199
Hi Mr. Purim.

315
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:08,479
Hi.

316
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,119
Please.

317
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,359
I’ll start then.

318
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,599
Hello everyone.

319
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,478
I’m Pop Purim.

320
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,919
You can find my presentation in the folder I’ve given out.

321
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,558
As some of you may know,

322
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,118
during the past 5 years,

323
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,239
girl group market

324
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,079
has been growing tremendously.

325
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:30,118
In 2018,

326
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,559
SMA7H owned majority of market share at 70%.

327
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,878
But then in 2022,

328
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:41,039
SMA7H market share declined

329
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:44,999
from scandals of certain band members.

330
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,959
Another problem has a lot to do with discipline.

331
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,679
which is extremely critical for girl groups these days,

332
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,118
But...

333
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,119
I already have a solution to this.

334
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,799
Thank you so much.

335
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,399
Terrific presentation!

336
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,759
I can’t wait to see your band.

337
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,039
Yes.

338
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,319
Can you make it happen in 6 months?

339
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,239
Six months?

340
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:13,919
Yes.

341
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,318
In the next 6 months

342
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,438
there’ll be the Idol Battle event.

343
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:21,798
I want your new band to perform on stage,

344
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,839
if you can make it.

345
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:23,999
Sure can.

346
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:26,439
But...

347
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,639
there’s once tiny hiccup about the venue.

348
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,959
Don't worry.

349
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,639
I’ve sorted this out for you.

350
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,519
Jutamas will work with you on details.

351
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,359
Mr. Purim.

352
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,479
Goodbye.

353
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,559
Are you sure you’re going ahead with this, Mr. Korn?

354
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,278
6 months lead time isn’t easy.

355
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,159
How will you be able to set up a band

356
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,478
with cutting edge like S’more.

357
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,199
Hey!

358
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:04,879
S-Much.

359
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:05,719
Smash. It’s Smash.

360
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,998
I believe we’re in good hands with Mr. Pop on board.

361
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:14,719
I think...

362
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,959
Not only the potential of sending our artists abroad

363
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,599
but we can turn them to actresses

364
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,159
brand ambassadors even.

365
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,079
I agree.

366
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:38,958
With my son joining the band,

367
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,399
it would help bring so much spotlight in already.

368
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,799
Wow.

369
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,879
I can use this space for free, for real?

370
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,998
I’ve bought it for quite a few years

371
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,919
now and still don’t know what to do with it.

372
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,119
Are you sure?

373
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,399
I’m positive.

374
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,038
You can turn it into a debut camp.

375
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,919
No worries ok?

376
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,319
Ok. Thanks very much.

377
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:28,199
Thank you.

378
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,359
Hi, my name is Plaifah.

379
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,078
Pop,

380
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,719
Did you know you can actually get older from doing that?

381
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,319
Don’t tell me you believe in that kind of myth.

382
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,118
Let me ask you something...

383
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,079
If you could turn back time,

384
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,599
what’s one thing that you’d like to do the most?

385
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,519
Maybe...

386
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,359
Find true love.

387
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,119
Leaving already?

388
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,719
Where’s Pueng?

389
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,479
Well, we’ve been closed for some time now.

390
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:38,519
What? Why?

391
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,399
Well,

392
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,479
Pop...

393
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,399
Peung is…

394
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,479
She is…

395
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,759
What’s wrong with her?

396
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,199
She’s…ummm…

397
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,399
Tell me. What’s wrong with Pueng?

398
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,599
What the hell!

399
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,959
1 month later.

400
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,319
Mr. Bun.

401
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,198
What are you doing sleeping in office hours.

402
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,359
I’ve got something to show you. Look at this.

403
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,679
On my right here is a face you should all be familiar with.

404
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:33,038
He has been in the business for a long long time

405
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,798
and now it’s my pleasure to announce that,

406
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,118
Mr.Pop Purim is working with us.

407
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,479
Hello.

408
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:46,598
And on my left here is our latest kid on the block.

409
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,638
Let me introduce you to Cherrie.

410
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,238
captain of AGA1N.

411
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,919
Hello.

412
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:58,759
Join us again at the Idol Battle at the end of the year.

413
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,838
But you only have 6 months to go.

414
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,879
Would that be enough time?

415
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,439
Time is never a problem for us.

416
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,479
AGA1N is always ready.

417
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,839
Appears like they want a war against us Mr. Bun!!

418
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,399
They’re just bluffing.

419
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,118
But Mr. Korn is his investor.

420
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,439
I don’t think he’ll let it go easily.

421
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,678
Why would someone like Mr. Korn want an idol band?

422
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,199
It doesn’t make sense.

423
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,318
I have no idea either.

424
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,239
Let me tell you something.

425
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,799
Korn had zero artist before except for his stupid son.

426
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,558
Can’t you see

427
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,158
they only launch teen idol band

428
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,639
just to gain temporary rating.

429
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,919
Pop will never survive…

430
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,478
even for another 6 months,

431
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,798
6 years, 6 lives.

432
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,879
They will never be able to win us over!!

433
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:11,639
Hey guys!

434
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:13,679
I’ve got great news for you all!!

435
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,158
But...

436
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:17,719
we have bad ones.

437
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,079
What is it?

438
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,039
I’ve quitted. I’m sorry.

439
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:37,199
Prae quitted?

440
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,758
Since when?

441
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,478
Lunchtime.

442
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,718
She came to say goodbye and left.

443
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,519
Too ashamed to face you.

444
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,879
Prae's been crying for a few days now.

445
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,679
I would have talked to her if I knew.

446
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,599
Cherrie.

447
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,599
Cherrie, Jutatip Seangwan.

448
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,319
Nadear.

449
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,519
Nadear, Ramavadee Chokmanusorn.

450
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,959
Mimi.

451
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,759
Mimi, Rinrada Teekatapong.

452
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:30,879
Plaifah.

453
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,959
Plaifah, Penpat Kairapee.

454
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:37,719
Kumpuy.

455
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,159
Kumpuy, Surirat Dasri.

456
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,759
you all have to help me out here.

457
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,319
We will open another round of audition

458
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,519
to find the 6th member.

459
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,159
Are you with me?

460
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,279
Yes!!

461
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,439
Yes!! Let’s do it!

462
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,839
Hi. Introduce yourself, please.

463
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,359
Soulxia.

464
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,079
Why do you want to be in AGA1N?

465
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,758
I just love singing…and dancing.

466
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,399
She’s a bit rude.

467
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,998
I don’t like her.

468
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,319
Should we cut her off?

469
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,159
Well…

470
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,439
thank you.

471
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,559
Gosh. Cross her off.

472
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,039
Hello, my name is Meeyok.

473
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,959
Why do you want to be in our band?

474
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:56,919
Well, being an idol...

475
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:58,999
would give me...

476
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,079
I believe we should let you go.

477
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,679
What’s wrong with her?

478
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,879
She’s drowsing.

479
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,359
Film,

480
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,039
Film!

481
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,519
Film!

482
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,919
Not waking up.

483
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,359
Mew Suppasit is here!!!

484
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,759
What?

485
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,038
Wow.

486
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,118
That was great, First.

487
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,919
Why else do you want to join AGA1N?

488
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:43,558
I’ve been following your work since SMA7H.

489
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,439
I want to be like Kathy.

490
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,279
Can you turn me into Kathy, Mr. Purim?

491
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,238
But you sing so well…

492
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,239
No.

493
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,958
I’m gonna be like Kathy!

494
00:33:56,959 --> 00:34:00,959
I want to be like Kathy!

495
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,879
I’m gonna be Kathy! I’m gonna be Kathy!

496
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:19,799
I’m gonna be Kathy! I’m gonna be Kathy!

497
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,879
How many more do we have?

498
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:28,759
Only one last girl.

499
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,959
Let me know when you’re done.

500
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:55,919
Hi Mr. Korn.

501
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,638
How was your audition? Mr. Purim.

502
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,998
Everything’s looking great.

503
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:04,799
But I cannot decide yet.

504
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,799
I know we don’t have that much time left.

505
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,039
I trust you, Mr. Purim.

506
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,079
Thanks Mr. Korn.

507
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,758
Why...

508
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,959
do you want to be in AGA1N?

509
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,359
I like it.

510
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,559
Like? What do you mean by ‘like’?

511
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:08,799
Oh!

512
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,478
I mean

513
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:11,399
I like

514
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,318
like dancing.

515
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,758
I like acting. Something like that.

516
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:16,839
I see.

517
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,399
But you don’t appear too fond

518
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,159
of acting, singing, or dancing.

519
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,558
I’m still trying!

520
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,198
And I’m not giving up.

521
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,318
And if you give me a chance,

522
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:33,519
I’ll do my best.

523
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,719
And...

524
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:42,839
Have you auditioned anywhere else before?

525
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:43,999
Never.

526
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,038
Don’t you want to try the water?

527
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,119
No.

528
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:48,919
But...

529
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,799
They might accept you right away.

530
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,678
If I don’t make it here this time.

531
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,758
I would think of it as…

532
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,598
Maybe I’ve not put enough effort into it.

533
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,598
And I’ll ask for another chance to go back,

534
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,558
practice, prepare myself,

535
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,279
and come back.

536
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,439
Don’t do that.

537
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,039
They say it makes you grow old faster.

538
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:23,959
Well,

539
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:28,319
What do you think your gift is?

540
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:29,958
Perseverance.

541
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,239
Can perseverance be a gift?

542
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,319
Yes!

543
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,119
Think about it.

544
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,679
If we give up easily

545
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:41,238
no matter how many great opportunities come in,

546
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,078
they will mean nothing.

547
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,318
Nothing! But if we keep persevering,

548
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:46,839
even if we have zero chance.

549
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,999
It will be come ours one day.

550
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,639
I truly believe that way.

551
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,039
Ok.

552
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,879
We’re done.

553
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:03,999
That’s it?

554
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:05,999
Well,

555
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,439
Will I get to see you again?

556
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,718
Oh don’t worry.

557
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,839
If you pass our audition,

558
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,038
we will see each other again.

559
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,039
I’ll be taking care of AGA1N personally.

560
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:21,039
Ok.

561
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,719
Thank you.

562
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,239
Thank you.

563
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:38,119
You're the last for today.

564
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,479
Hope I get to see you...

565
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,559
again.

566
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,559
Cherrie, what do you think?

567
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,358
She’s not bad at singing.

568
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,399
But the dancing it’s a little awkward.

569
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,319
Plaifah.

570
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:07,919
You think you can train this one?

571
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,039
No no no way.

572
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,839
Let’s pick someone else now.

573
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,199
Bro, wait!

574
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,599
Wait. Let her sing.

575
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,439
She’s...

576
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,079
not bad actually.

577
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,198
Maybe she just needs some time.

578
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,319
Need to fix the tone a little though.

579
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,718
She could be like me. I take a while to warm up.

580
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,479
You’re way slower than her.

581
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:54,159
Let’s see how she dance.

582
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,519
Maybe she can dance even better than Nadear.

583
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,799
If this was true.

584
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:12,439
I like her.

585
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,958
What?

586
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:18,599
You guys don’t think so?

587
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:19,999
She?

588
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:20,679
Yeah.

589
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,878
She doesn’t have that shine.

590
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,559
Yeah.

591
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,359
Just average.

592
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,199
I agree.

593
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:27,359
True that.

594
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,999
But she doesn’t seem very talkative.

595
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,319
Because she’s not like you.

596
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,638
So...

597
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,599
If not her,

598
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,199
then who would you girls pick?

599
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,399
No more choice?

600
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,319
None.

601
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,399
So,

602
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,559
Why don’t we have another round of audition?

603
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,199
We don’t have time for it.

604
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,398
Think about it.

605
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,599
Each of you five

606
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,519
is unique in your own way already.

607
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,399
If we add another ordinary one in,

608
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,679
it shouldn’t be a problem right?

609
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:14,959
Right?

610
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,599
Ahh.

611
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,679
So...

612
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:22,919
Up to you then.

613
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,959
That’s a wrap then.

614
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,079
She’s in!

615
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,478
Repeat after me.

616
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:35,439
Up

617
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,079
and down.

618
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:38,438
Up

619
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:39,079
and down.

620
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,919
Shit,

621
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:45,639
Shit,

622
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,959
this hurts!

623
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,679
It feels so stiff!

624
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,118
Yeah!

625
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,879
Done!

626
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,199
Let’s take a break.

627
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:43,679
Where’s the new girl, bro?

628
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,719
I’ve not seen her too.

629
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,759
Ditching on the first day. That’s not good.

630
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,039
Come on girls.

631
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,118
Let’s go over the hook again.

632
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,039
Come on.

633
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:58,719
Stand on your mark.

634
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,278
Mimi and Nadear,

635
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:06,159
can you swap your positions?

636
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,438
And...

637
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:14,918
Kumpuy,

638
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,838
you take Plaifah’s position.

639
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:18,519
Plaifah, you come up right in the front here.

640
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,519
Don’t steal the spotlight.

641
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,318
Shhhh. You were prying on every before.

642
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,399
Now you can see everything from the back.

643
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,079
Pop,

644
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,319
Should we call someone else in?

645
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,158
But...

646
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,679
we still have time though.

647
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,119
I don’t think...

648
00:43:38,279 --> 00:43:41,039
we should just wait around for just one person.

649
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:43,559
Yeah. We’re not gonna get anywhere.

650
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:44,839
So,

651
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,638
Let me see what I can do.

652
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,399
You girls carry on first.

653
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:58,599
Can you turn the music back on, Plaifah?

654
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:14,398
Hi, this is Pop Purim.

655
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:15,769
Is this Kate’s number?

656
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,798
You came in for an audition the other day?

657
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:19,799
I’m sorry.

658
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,039
I'm sorry.

659
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,199
Have we already started?

660
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:07,599
One practice down.

661
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:10,479
I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry.

662
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,279
Were you running?

663
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:15,599
Yes, I was running from across the street.

664
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:20,279
Traffic’s so bad, I was afraid I was gonna be late.

665
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,679
Would you like to sit and rest first?

666
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:29,879
No need.

667
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,999
I’m ready.

668
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:32,518
I’m ready to meet everyone.

669
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,079
They asked...

670
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:36,359
why I chose you.

671
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:37,839
And...

672
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,119
what was your answer?

673
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:41,719
I didn’t.

674
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,439
But it’s you

675
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,519
who has to prove to everyone yourself.

676
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:49,719
Are you ready?

677
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,199
Definitely!

678
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,079
If you can’t fit in,

679
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:00,918
or you’re not accepted by the rest of them,

680
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:02,319
there’s nothing I can do about it.

681
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:05,079
No matter how much I like you.

682
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,959
He’s hot!

683
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:18,319
He’s so hot.
